[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:34.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.440 --> 00:43.120]  ladies and gentlemen here we are another Monday the 17th day already of March 2014
[00:43.120 --> 00:47.240]  and here's what I'm gonna do today we don't have any guest I have cleared the
[00:47.240 --> 00:51.600]  slate of guests because I want to take your phone calls I want to cover the
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.600]  news there is a transference to private corporate Davos type interest of the
[00:58.600 --> 01:02.720]  internet we're going to be looking at that today and tying it into the
[01:02.720 --> 01:08.920]  technocracy that these scallywags run and operate and are building in to the
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.000]  technological system we're gonna look at the huge developments obviously in
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.240]  Europe and the Ukraine and what that means to the Russian US and the rest of
[01:17.240 --> 01:22.160]  the world economy and we're going to get into a plethora of news that's
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.400]  that's breaking and then I haven't gotten to yet I literally have one of the
[01:26.400 --> 01:34.200]  largest arrays of stacks of news I think I've ever had in all of it is
[01:34.200 --> 01:39.600]  incredibly important so what I'm going to do best I can is come back in the
[01:39.600 --> 01:42.800]  next segment and just read some headlines out to give you an idea of
[01:42.800 --> 01:46.320]  what's coming up and then I'm gonna open the phones up we took military calls
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.680]  active duty and retired yesterday on Ukraine it was so informative people
[01:52.680 --> 01:55.920]  that had been over there in there in the Cold War folks that live in Ukraine
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.880]  for a decade people who work there one guy called in it was retired out of a
[02:00.880 --> 02:05.040]  naval intelligence recently just incredibly informative I'm sure a lot
[02:05.040 --> 02:08.440]  of you heard that phone call we should probably give YouTube videos like that
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.560]  names like you know naval intelligence insider speaks out on Ukraine or it was
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.120]  just it's just incredibly informative because I study this stuff in depth you
[02:18.120 --> 02:20.280]  can tell when somebody knows what they're talking about and then takes it to
[02:20.280 --> 02:24.520]  a whole other level of how this is all a war game to put pressure on Russia so
[02:24.520 --> 02:29.320]  they can take Syria and that's exactly what it is and then of course move on to
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.360]  Iran it's not that I'm some fan of Syria or Iran it's just that the globalists
[02:34.360 --> 02:40.640]  are running America and Europe and it is just a bad situation any way you slice
[02:40.640 --> 02:45.720]  it and you know the numbers I've got are there 200,000 trips on the Russian
[02:45.720 --> 02:52.480]  border with Crimea 60,000 are already in there and you've got one of the largest
[02:52.480 --> 02:55.720]  standing armies though it's primitive but they have armored vehicles tanks and
[02:55.720 --> 03:01.960]  artillery close to a million people in the Ukrainian military but really only a
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.080]  few hundred thousand they can muster up but they are massing those near the
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.720]  Crimea we heard all these threats last week I think the big story is that people
[03:11.720 --> 03:19.000]  like John Kerry and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dempsey had all
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.920]  sorts of rhetoric about how there might even be military action and you've got
[03:24.920 --> 03:29.440]  McCain running around calling for military action and and and military
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.240]  aid if the Russians didn't pull out a Crimea well Crimea just voted 90 plus
[03:34.240 --> 03:39.920]  percent 95 plus percent actually last number I saw with the votes it was 97
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.400]  percent I found that hard to believe but but I mean they had Western exit
[03:43.400 --> 03:49.320]  pollers picking that up I mean that is a massive number 75% ethnic Russian but
[03:49.320 --> 03:53.640]  still I guess the Ukrainians do in that area do not want to go those that aren't
[03:53.640 --> 03:58.560]  even Russian with the EU and and look Ukraine's got a lot of serious beefs
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.680]  with Russia and I'm not painting Russia as angels here as Ron Paul has said it's
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.040]  just the West started this over through the government and it's trying to start
[04:07.040 --> 04:11.800]  a new Cold War together with a national sovereignty they're gonna use the crisis
[04:11.800 --> 04:19.400]  of a new Cold War with Russia as a police state excuse to militarize the EU
[04:19.400 --> 04:23.240]  via Germany at its heart that's why Russia is criticizing Germany right now
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.520]  the Russians are not stupid they know who's running in quarterbacking this and
[04:27.520 --> 04:33.160]  it's Deutschland Uber Alice at the heart of Europe with the same financial
[04:33.160 --> 04:36.840]  interest pulling the strings here in the United States in England and Israel
[04:36.840 --> 04:41.640]  wants it as well because they want to be able to take out Iran's allies so it's
[04:41.640 --> 04:48.240]  the stars aligning for war economic war bare minimum cold war and hot war is on
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.760]  the horizon and could approach any time we're gonna come back break down a
[04:53.760 --> 04:57.200]  spectrum of news and then give out the phone number to take your phone call

[08:48.400 --> 08:58.760]  pull the trigger shoot the thrill play to kill too many women and too many pills
[08:58.760 --> 09:05.760]  folks the problem that we have is not old-fashioned type trouble but just
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.200]  corrupt boss hogs running around now we have globalists that want world
[09:10.200 --> 09:18.280]  domination we've got their fingers on the nuclear launch triggers and they
[09:18.280 --> 09:26.120]  want to pull the trigger and that's the big issue here ladies and gentlemen
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.640]  they've now had the big state-run TV darling of Vladimir Pootie Poot as
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.680]  George W. Bush would call him so I'm on state-run television says Russia could
[09:35.680 --> 09:45.160]  turn us into radioactive ash by the way I've been invited on that show and on
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.160]  other shows on Russian state-run television I'm not bragging I'm just
[09:48.160 --> 09:52.120]  giving you an interesting factoid here because I'm against war with Russia and
[09:52.120 --> 09:55.880]  you know against turning the Ukraine over to the EU and against towards
[09:55.880 --> 09:59.640]  sorrows starting with the State Department McCain five billion dollars
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.600]  of funding to overthrow the elected government but I will not go on state-run
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.960]  Russian television at the same time I will not cross the line because Russia
[10:10.960 --> 10:15.000]  is going to end up getting involved in its own rhetoric and its own escalation
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.160]  that are going to end up being bad for this country you see I look for at
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.680]  American interest in my individual interest in my children's interest and
[10:23.680 --> 10:32.760]  I've described this over and over again on a scale of one to ten zero being a
[10:32.760 --> 10:36.720]  country not being bad for US interest which means the interests of the
[10:36.720 --> 10:40.680]  American people and due process and private property and family and the
[10:40.680 --> 10:45.840]  right to self-defense and having a good truly sustainable future so I look at a
[10:45.840 --> 10:54.480]  country as being say neutral at zero and being hell-bent to destroy us at 10
[10:55.280 --> 11:01.160]  Russia's about a one despite all the things the globalists have done to Russia
[11:01.160 --> 11:08.880]  in our name with our money in our military in the last 20 years since 1991
[11:08.880 --> 11:12.760]  all the West has done is try to destabilize and bring Russia down and
[11:12.760 --> 11:19.920]  loot it with outside banks the entire time and our government in 1917 at the
[11:19.920 --> 11:25.880]  end of World War one on record funded a hundred thousand New Yorkers mainly
[11:25.880 --> 11:29.840]  East Coasters mainly New Yorkers who were Russian immigrants in the last two
[11:29.840 --> 11:38.800]  generations to go back to Russia with 25 million in gold delivered by Stalin to
[11:38.800 --> 11:45.520]  the island this is all mainline history books by the way so we owe the Russians
[11:45.520 --> 11:48.880]  along with the British you let British intelligence be involved they were
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.160]  hanchoing the whole deal with US money the US and British citizens owe the
[11:54.160 --> 12:02.960]  Russians a gigantic apology for dumping the island and Joseph Stalin to lead an
[12:02.960 --> 12:10.200]  army of a hundred thousand Americans Russian Americans to do that to them
[12:10.200 --> 12:19.280]  people don't know all this stuff we literally took down Russia and kick
[12:19.280 --> 12:25.920]  those ours out and put the Bolsheviks in boys and girls the Bolsheviks must say
[12:25.920 --> 12:35.200]  that again the Bolsheviks the most nasty filthy scum you could imagine and then
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.800]  when Stalin finally decades later kicked the Trotskyites out do you know
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.680]  where they came back to New York City and then they got kicked out of New York
[12:47.680 --> 12:54.360]  City so they went down to Mexico City and then they creep back in the 60s and
[12:54.360 --> 13:01.040]  took over the Republican Party via national review and now run the
[13:01.040 --> 13:06.360]  Republican Party actual Trotskyite Bolsheviks uh-huh that's a if you're a
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.480]  new list or you're going man that that sounds crazy that is 100% mainline fact
[13:11.480 --> 13:17.160]  in the New York Times the Washington Post even admits it you understand that
[13:17.160 --> 13:22.120]  you understand the geopolitics here we're dealing with a global crime syndicate
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.080]  that will use al-Qaeda to take down Syria that we use mother brotherhood and
[13:26.080 --> 13:32.280]  al-Qaeda destabilize Egypt that we use al-Qaeda to take down Libya and
[13:32.280 --> 13:36.400]  destabilize all of Africa they admit it's a total hellhole now many times
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.720]  worse than it was under Qaddafi Qaddafi was actually out of arrogance or whatever
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.520]  you want to say building up all of Africa with tens of billions of dollars of
[13:45.520 --> 13:51.320]  oil money a year no strings attached literally the only person building up
[13:51.320 --> 13:58.480]  Africa and I'm not romanticizing muh market off it but compared to the al-Qaeda
[13:58.480 --> 14:05.320]  people he is a little angel and that's what we're getting down to here I mean
[14:05.320 --> 14:08.360]  that's how serious all of this is and when you look at the whole history of it
[14:08.360 --> 14:17.720]  the globalist British intelligence would use a bunch of Russian immigrants to go
[14:17.720 --> 14:24.200]  into Tsarist Russia and take it down and kill 30 something million people over
[14:24.200 --> 14:31.160]  the next four decades that's in Russia 30 million 10 million in Ukraine
[14:31.160 --> 14:37.600]  millions in Poland hundreds of thousands in the Czech areas other areas they took
[14:37.600 --> 14:42.760]  over I mean the numbers are just staggering and the globalist would like
[14:42.760 --> 14:48.320]  to do that here as Larry Grathwald who died last year former Green Beret
[14:48.320 --> 14:53.000]  Vietnam infiltrated the weather underground sent him to prison they were
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.240]  in the meetings it all came out in court and was confirmed how they were going to
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.600]  have a Bolshevik takeover here and how they were going to put 50 million
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.040]  Americans in death camps and kill at least 25 million of us
[15:07.040 --> 15:13.520]  well I'm gonna explain something to you okay the goal of Obama and all of his
[15:13.520 --> 15:19.120]  Zars if they could have everything they wanted would be to put 50 million people
[15:19.120 --> 15:26.840]  in torture camps okay this isn't rhetoric this is what they'd like to do and
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.040]  if they can get a war going with Russia a regional war a conventional war a
[15:31.040 --> 15:34.800]  proxy war and then they'll start this new thing up that there's spies or
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.280]  stayed some terror attacks and say Russia did it they're gonna come out and
[15:38.280 --> 15:44.600]  try to bring in martial law they're not gonna call it that and they want a war
[15:44.600 --> 15:48.440]  just like Hitler started war so he could take over domestically governments do
[15:48.440 --> 15:51.880]  the same thing over and over again Julius Caesar would start outside wars so
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.240]  he could seize power in Rome the same story folks it's like third-world
[15:56.240 --> 15:59.720]  dictators I'll claim there's some threat you know Bolivia will turn and there's a
[15:59.720 --> 16:02.720]  threat from their neighbor and then declare martial law or civil emergency
[16:02.720 --> 16:09.200]  and take over or Honduras will do it or Nicaragua or El Salvador or the list
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.720]  goes on or they have martial law basically in Nigeria now because of a
[16:12.720 --> 16:17.760]  Muslim threat in the north it's Cobras killed more people every year the
[16:17.760 --> 16:22.320]  numbers I've seen in Nigeria than then Muslims do and I'm not saying there isn't
[16:22.320 --> 16:27.760]  a Muslim extremist issue there just it's total hype and and war is the health
[16:27.760 --> 16:32.480]  of the state and the state's a giant cancer going out of control and I just
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.880]  know the history of Russia I know what's going on there I know what's
[16:35.880 --> 16:41.240]  happening there they're reforming a nationalist Neo czar confederation that
[16:41.240 --> 16:47.400]  scares the the you know what's out of the George Soros types who want to run the
[16:47.400 --> 16:54.440]  world and by the way put something in Russia that looks like Neo Bolshevism
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.080]  with a bunch of foreign banks administering it sucking the country
[16:58.080 --> 17:03.240]  dry having everybody line up to get their government ration to get their
[17:03.240 --> 17:07.800]  government welfare check then the economy collapses and you know you get a
[17:07.800 --> 17:11.560]  pittance from what you got before but that's the plan that's flowered in
[17:11.560 --> 17:21.200]  heaven look it up this is what they're doing and here's the problem
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.000]  historically people will be faced by an evil and they just can't believe it's
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.440]  happening to them again and so they get run over by it well I'm a history buff
[17:29.440 --> 17:35.920]  and I know who runs the country it's a bunch of super rich ultra elites who
[17:35.920 --> 17:41.960]  want a form of socialism slash communism at the grassroots with a fascism
[17:41.960 --> 17:45.120]  sitting above it that administers it that's above the law tax example
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.760]  diplomatic immunity a UN Davos carbon tax world government it's all being
[17:50.760 --> 17:54.120]  announced by the way the internet's being handed over to the UN it's all
[17:54.120 --> 17:58.880]  happening right now all the stops are being pulled out right now again I do
[17:58.880 --> 18:04.680]  not romanticize Vladimir Putin I mean you talk about creepy folks I'd go to

[25:32.880 --> 25:49.880]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central we're here blasting out worldwide
[25:49.880 --> 26:03.760]  let me get serious here folks I never finished my analogies I rarely do the
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.200]  point I was getting at this key here is let's say zero is a country's neutral
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.000]  with us like Switzerland and being neutral actually means very positive
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.360]  then it's just free will back and forth free association you get so much wealth
[26:15.360 --> 26:19.320]  you know can you handle it like the Swiss no most people can't they create a
[26:19.320 --> 26:22.000]  corrupt system everybody ends up robbing each other and everything
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.760]  collapses and you become Venezuela or you become America with a gang that
[26:26.760 --> 26:29.640]  follows a leader and then get free handouts but soon there's no handouts
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.560]  anymore soon there's only uniforms and guns and trudgins soon the language
[26:35.560 --> 26:42.080]  falls apart soon all the chivalry is gone and the elegant weapons for a more
[26:42.080 --> 26:49.520]  civilized time are replaced with the brute black helicopters checkpoints but
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.360]  here's the analogy it's more than analogy it I mean it's really just a
[26:53.360 --> 27:00.560]  just a fact it's more than just a way to gauge it let's say Switzerland's a zero
[27:00.560 --> 27:08.400]  and 10 is total oppression our total enemy Russia is about a one and now
[27:08.400 --> 27:14.560]  because it's doing counter sanctions maybe a two to US interest the globalist
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.520]  to Russia are a 10 trying to bring down Russia offensively all over their
[27:19.520 --> 27:23.240]  borders funding Muslim extremists to attack them trying to bomb the Olympics
[27:23.240 --> 27:28.160]  openly threatening them starting wars in Georgia starting wars overthrows and
[27:28.160 --> 27:34.040]  Crimea using public ignorance about the facts to go over democracy nonviolent
[27:34.040 --> 27:37.920]  protesters shooting police with John McCain the guy that six months ago was
[27:37.920 --> 27:44.200]  you know leading al-Qaeda literally in Syria trying to take over blowing up all
[27:44.200 --> 27:51.280]  the churches this guy is the enemy not Russia is my point so Switzerland's
[27:51.280 --> 27:58.160]  about a zero Russia's about a two against US interest real independent
[27:58.160 --> 28:04.320]  interest of the American people China's a six or a seven as I said last night
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.800]  influencing our media buying our debt to control us backing up the bankers to
[28:08.800 --> 28:12.840]  keep that scam going in turn for our jobs and industry buying up all the
[28:12.840 --> 28:16.680]  rare earth minerals getting all the deep water ports infiltrating with spies and
[28:16.680 --> 28:20.640]  over 10,000 known front companies operating and then engaging in money
[28:20.640 --> 28:24.680]  laundering operations if you stabilize the economy long term I mean it is a
[28:24.680 --> 28:27.960]  total takeover by the Chinese they're about a seven against us they're a real
[28:27.960 --> 28:35.040]  threat blue water Navy giant arms build up Russia is just trying to survive and
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.520]  then you've got China's about a seven and then who's a 10 well I'm gonna tell
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.720]  you you're saying the new orders of 10 no they're not they're an 11 they're
[28:42.720 --> 28:49.480]  going a hundred and 10% out so hardcore against this country against our
[28:49.480 --> 28:53.120]  physical well-being with fluoride in the water the GMO and then they write
[28:53.120 --> 28:57.000]  textbooks eco science right there on my desk the White House science are about
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.520]  putting poison in the water to make you more passive and reduce your fertility
[29:00.520 --> 29:04.400]  it's all very funny to them and they're right books about it doesn't matter
[29:04.400 --> 29:07.440]  Harvard comes out and it's lowering IQ and kids doesn't matter they admit
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.120]  seven-fold increase in bone cancer pancreatic cancer go and go read the
[29:12.120 --> 29:18.240]  literally thousands of studies of the and it's all hands down no and so we're
[29:18.240 --> 29:21.080]  run by the eugenicists they're playing all the countries off against each other
[29:21.080 --> 29:27.400]  and they are an 11 so that's why I'm against this war that's why Ron Paul's
[29:27.400 --> 29:32.720]  against it because he's smart he's informed and he knows that Russia had a
[29:32.720 --> 29:38.480]  very measured response only taking Crimea NATO and the EU just took 90% of
[29:38.480 --> 29:43.600]  the country they just took it over through proxies and now George Soros is
[29:43.600 --> 29:51.160]  going to suck it dry like a giant vampire that he is stay with us we're on the March

[33:58.960 --> 34:04.920]  human resources to be called and controlled officially the family courts
[34:04.920 --> 34:10.280]  all of it are an expression of eugenics law the new system of government
[34:10.280 --> 34:18.280]  adopted officially by the 1860s by the Britannic Empire and now the standard

[35:56.840 --> 36:07.160]  life and that's their words we are under just total assault and and the only way
[36:07.160 --> 36:14.320]  to get around this is admitting it you can't just play patty cake with this
[36:14.960 --> 36:21.040]  we're not going to sit here with half measures and get out of this I want to
[36:21.040 --> 36:36.480]  explain this again Russia has been supine in the last 20 years since 1991 so how
[36:36.480 --> 36:42.440]  many years is that 20 plus I guess under Common Core could be a hundred years
[36:42.440 --> 36:47.840]  cuz two plus two could equal anything I know it's 23 but you know the point is
[36:47.840 --> 36:51.140]  it could be anything they say like randomly I could just randomly dial
[36:51.140 --> 36:55.560]  numbers on a phone and I will just it should work I mean Obama said so these
[36:55.560 --> 36:59.240]  are the age of total mental illness and total fraud with a public that's been
[36:59.240 --> 37:02.880]  brought up in front of television sets and so people don't understand that the
[37:02.880 --> 37:05.680]  website was not meant to work so they could make it about the broken website
[37:05.680 --> 37:08.720]  people understand the scams I do I know what they're gonna do before they do it
[37:08.720 --> 37:16.720]  it's very nightmarish by the way it's nightmarish to not be arrogant and to be
[37:16.720 --> 37:21.960]  able to sit down with major CEOs of major companies who get a lot of it and
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.640]  say you'll never stop it you might as well just join with it or to talk to
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.160]  major you know people that are very successful and billionaires and people
[37:30.160 --> 37:33.960]  and they don't even understand it all they know their business and that's it
[37:33.960 --> 37:41.400]  I mean it's very lonely sitting here watching it all in white papers and all
[37:41.400 --> 37:46.360]  public taking place in front of me and people have lived their lives in it so
[37:46.360 --> 37:51.160]  they're comfortable with it and they've adapted to it in a bad way and that was
[37:51.160 --> 37:55.920]  the great epiphany I was given by the head of a major US bank off record on
[37:55.920 --> 38:02.760]  that first-class American Airlines flight to be on the view he was on the
[38:02.760 --> 38:08.040]  plane in his perfect suit unwrinkled and when he got up from it and put on his
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.040]  overcoat he looked like something out of a out of a you know Nordstrom's
[38:12.040 --> 38:18.200]  catalog and he looked at me and he laughed at me and he said well they will
[38:18.200 --> 38:25.840]  adapt to whatever we do don't you understand not all adaptation is good
[38:25.840 --> 38:31.600]  and he laughed at me and said we win you lose
[38:31.600 --> 38:41.960]  and at that point with the demonic power he had he had twice the male bigger
[38:41.960 --> 38:48.960]  that I had in his focused evil you could tell the guy didn't use drugs didn't
[38:48.960 --> 38:55.280]  drink didn't eat fattening food nothing he just looked at me after three hours
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.200]  talking on the plane and he finally quit the nice guy act and says we're getting
[39:00.200 --> 39:04.920]  up he goes you really want to know they're all gonna adapt to what we do
[39:04.920 --> 39:11.240]  they'll muddle through everything and there's no way out of it got up put his
[39:11.240 --> 39:20.200]  coat on like a Darth Vader stormtrooper and marched off that plane and I look
[39:20.200 --> 39:25.240]  at the public who are like mindless children who have no idea what they're
[39:25.240 --> 39:32.800]  facing these people put poison in your water and laugh at you they put poison
[39:32.800 --> 39:37.160]  in my water and I don't do enough to filter the water I bathe in even though
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.680]  I give people the advice to do it here the filter breaks I turn it off never
[39:41.680 --> 39:45.960]  get the people to come replace it and I've been six months without a filter I
[39:45.960 --> 39:56.920]  mean I am pathetic ladies and gentlemen I have adapted to bathing and poison I
[39:56.920 --> 40:00.600]  have adapted to using a smartphone even though it radiates me and tracks
[40:00.600 --> 40:06.360]  everything I do I have adapted to not getting enough sleep and not taking
[40:06.360 --> 40:13.520]  care of myself I have adapted the world goes on and we're gonna adapt to half
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.680]  the public dying of cancer by 2025 and major government numbers pull it up
[40:17.680 --> 40:23.440]  half the public's going to have or be dying of cancer by 2025 in the West you
[40:23.440 --> 40:28.440]  go to the third world middle of nowhere nobody's dying of cancer and I'm not
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.040]  trying to get negative here folks it's already going on you might as well know
[40:33.040 --> 40:41.560]  what's happening you might as well be aware of what's happening the level of
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.800]  mind control the Stockholm syndrome of loving your abuser is so great 95% of
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.400]  black people in this country vote for the Democratic Party whose sworn goal
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.760]  under Margaret Sanger and the great society is to exterminate every one of
[40:55.760 --> 41:00.360]  you off the face of the earth and then to give you the hip-hop gangster culture
[41:00.360 --> 41:06.280]  on record in the 90s to weaponize you to act like gangsters so the police can be
[41:06.280 --> 41:09.840]  trained see you wear your gangster tough guy uniform the police are then
[41:09.840 --> 41:13.320]  trained you're a thug and are trained to put you in jail and you literally go out
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.960]  and wear the uniform of a prisoner with your pants hanging down over your butt
[41:17.960 --> 41:22.520]  and everything else and Hollywood says it's cool so everyone gets behind it to
[41:22.520 --> 41:27.840]  convert the culture to that and the police like attack dogs like a foxhound
[41:27.840 --> 41:33.600]  is trained to kill foxes the police are trained to go after gangbangers and then
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.600]  you go dressed like a gangbanger and try to act hard I don't care what color you
[41:37.600 --> 41:41.640]  are but it started with the black folks and then they put you in a prison where
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.080]  you go to jail for petty reasons when you're in juvenile and then the gangs
[41:45.080 --> 41:51.240]  induct you if you're lucky they don't binge over and give you HIV and then
[41:51.240 --> 41:55.520]  when you get out of juvie well now you've gone to school to be a prisoner to
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.240]  be institutionalized and now you're put out on the street and they choose a few
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.880]  dozen of you out of tens of millions of of wannabe gangsters and they let you
[42:03.880 --> 42:07.800]  sit there rapping with a big fat belly hanging out and throw some women up
[42:07.800 --> 42:10.640]  there with you and then the kids think that's how they get ahead when really
[42:10.640 --> 42:15.040]  you're being inducted directly into the prisons on record where they get state
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.000]  laws passed all over the country where they got to have 90% occupancy in the
[42:19.000 --> 42:27.040]  Wacken Hut and you know type industrial prisons you can walk over and talk to one
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.520]  of these kids one of these white black it doesn't matter who's into that whole
[42:30.520 --> 42:35.120]  gangster culture they don't know what planet there are I was in a gas station
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.520]  the other day and they had one of those coffee machines where you put the coffee
[42:38.520 --> 42:41.400]  in and pick the one you want at the button there was a group of these
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.720]  trendy's hip-hop people in there and they didn't know how to use it folks you
[42:45.720 --> 42:49.360]  could tell they grew up in their diapers getting their diapers changed every two
[42:49.360 --> 42:54.360]  days you know my mom goes out with these loaves and fishes and she does mills on
[42:54.360 --> 42:57.400]  wheels to and she says I need to go with her I haven't gone since I was a
[42:57.400 --> 43:02.400]  teenager and she goes into East Austin and these kids see him and run up and
[43:02.400 --> 43:04.680]  they'll have like a sandwich and some chips or whatever they give them and the
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.080]  kids sit there and just beg them and thank them and gobble it up and haven't
[43:08.080 --> 43:11.640]  you know since I've seen their parents in days no CPS is coming to take those
[43:11.640 --> 43:16.840]  kids the CPS is only coming if you've got a healthy child they can adopt out
[43:16.840 --> 43:21.920]  or maybe they take a fancy to want to bend them over and rape them so that's
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.080]  how this country really works I mean let's let's stop being naive about all
[43:26.080 --> 43:29.400]  this let's stop being fools
[43:32.600 --> 43:39.520]  I literally watch the thug culture of everyone trying to walk around acting
[43:39.520 --> 43:46.680]  tough it's a fake alpha male act and the women are so lost the women are so
[43:46.680 --> 43:52.800]  desperately destroyed that because MTV said so they actually believe they're
[43:52.800 --> 43:59.120]  going to be successful attaching themselves to some 20 year old 10 year
[43:59.120 --> 44:06.440]  old who literally thinks acting like I want to be gangster is tough that's
[44:06.440 --> 44:09.680]  weaponized culture just like they had the feminist they couldn't get half the
[44:09.680 --> 44:13.840]  population to smoke women wouldn't smoke seen as a lady likes so they had
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.440]  feminists go around smoke cigarettes and say show your man in the newspapers show
[44:18.440 --> 44:26.120]  him your independent smoked cigarettes of course now women lead the United
[44:26.120 --> 44:33.200]  States in lung cancer it's sexy to get your lungs chopped out you didn't you
[44:33.200 --> 44:41.120]  didn't know that sure killed my grandmother she's a lot tougher than a
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.320]  man the women are tougher than men they chopped her lung out first a bunch of
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.960]  the stuff she took him 10 years to kill her my grandfather while he died along
[44:51.960 --> 45:01.760]  cancer in just a few months Jerry Jones wasn't as tough as Patty Jones and then
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.280]  there's all my family this died of age and orange just all the loving gifts of
[45:06.280 --> 45:11.520]  the New World Order I'm very thankful for all of them aren't you you know who I'm
[45:11.520 --> 45:16.640]  worried about those Russians those bad Russians we you're not patriotic if you
[45:16.640 --> 45:24.120]  don't get behind George Soros the Nazi collaborator and I mean he fought the
[45:24.120 --> 45:28.520]  Russians in World War two I mean of course he fights him now he's a patriot
[45:28.520 --> 45:32.880]  he gets 80 yellow wards just like Schwarzenegger your dad's in the SS you're
[45:32.880 --> 45:36.640]  a product of an SS marriage you dress up in Hitler outfits until Rolling Stone you
[45:36.640 --> 45:42.160]  love Hitler you get an ADL award you fight Nazism you get attacked by the
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.800]  ADL I was downtown yesterday doing some business and walked out of a restaurant

[45:52.120 --> 45:56.480]  KKK and I already knew about the petition it was a band-free speech in Texas

[46:23.400 --> 46:28.240]  that you know he must not be too big of a fan if he hadn't done his research and
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.520]  gone and found out that was all true

[47:17.240 --> 47:21.960]  get attention last Friday with his show or the dwindling audience here is the
[47:21.960 --> 47:26.880]  clip where he said he likes to promote death so there's less people so he has
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.320]  more because he's a eugenicist Mill Maher knows what team he's for he is a
[47:31.320 --> 47:39.240]  anti-human ultra fascist hit larry it people go with these Jewish how can he
[47:39.240 --> 47:44.840]  be hit larry it doesn't matter I mean you you could have Hitler like ideas and
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.960]  be because because you want to kill people there's too many people and you
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.080]  want more for you and you decide everybody's subhuman kill more people
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.880]  but don't kill me I'm Bill Maher who has writers that make me Sean Whitty who
[47:55.880 --> 47:59.360]  can't even sell out thousand person arenas when he travels I mean I could
[47:59.360 --> 48:04.280]  sell out thousand person arenas endlessly Bill Maher's a nobody but a punk a
[48:04.280 --> 48:12.480]  coward an anti-gun sniveling rat bastard that's not fair to bastards a lot of
[48:12.480 --> 48:15.720]  great men that didn't have a daddy at home I apologized all the bastards out
[48:15.720 --> 48:22.000]  there I mean it here's Bill Maher talking about how we need to kill more
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.400]  people but then when he wants to ban your guns or wants to talk about God
[48:26.400 --> 48:30.120]  being a murderer no no people like you have death in their heart people like
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.960]  you like to see death people like you like to exercise raw power you've said

[48:39.680 --> 48:44.720]  maggot let's go to the eugenicist Bill Maher the Pope is consistently pro-life
[48:44.720 --> 48:51.400]  I'm consistently pro-death I'm death penalty although I do believe in more
[48:51.400 --> 48:57.920]  DNA testing I build my motto is let's kill the right people I'm pro-choice I'm
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.360]  for assisted suicide I'm for regular zoys I'm for whatever gets the freeway

[49:06.440 --> 49:10.640]  crowded and we need to promote death when I look at the Venn diagram of people
[49:10.640 --> 49:18.480]  who are pro-death penalty and choice let's stop right there oh yeah they're
[49:18.480 --> 49:21.720]  inconsistent those are pro-death penalty on average or anti-abortion that's
[49:21.720 --> 49:27.720]  because it's an innocent baby these people act like they're intellectuals
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.800]  they are literally stupid but they know how to cling to the dark side cling to
[49:32.800 --> 49:38.960]  the evil and get off on the power trip so so he loves death and then he says
[49:38.960 --> 49:44.920]  God is a psychotic mass murderer who drowns babies and basically wants to kill
[49:44.920 --> 49:53.040]  people so you're God Bill Maher because that sounds like you that sounds a lot

[58:49.600 --> 58:55.080]  In the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[58:55.080 --> 59:00.320]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[59:00.320 --> 59:04.360]  the world guess what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and
[59:04.360 --> 59:09.000]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.440]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[59:14.440 --> 59:20.120]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[59:20.120 --> 59:24.400]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.560]  alex jones
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:39.880]  all right folks we are now into our number two and I have been basically
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.200]  gibbering about what I'm thinking about because all the other stuff is just
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.600]  window-dressing all the other articles all the other factoids I mean you see
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:55.440]  the stuff going on around you it's all just little particles in the sandstorm
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.880]  that is the disintegration of humanity by design and again I want to explain this
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.800]  like a sandblaster the globalists don't even have to create the sandstorm itself
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:12.000]  that engine's already driving they just direct it wherever they want and kind of
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  ride the wave they surf the crises they they they feed off all the different
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.360]  sides all the different angles and that itself is a natural symbiotic thing to
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.880]  do except that they're actually foaming the crises I mean obviously you take
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.280]  whatever crisis there is you try to do as best you can you know to survive it
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.720]  but you don't accentuate it and try to not let people know what's going on so
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.640]  they fall down so you can then feed on them and that's really what this
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.560]  predatory system comes down to where the public is like Helen Keller and that's
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.120]  what gives me faith Helen Keller of course you guys print me the Helen
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.520]  Keller biography thank you because I don't want to butcher it but I'll come
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.160]  back and then maybe read from that but the point is you know she was as they
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:15.800]  called the time deaf dumb and blind she couldn't see couldn't hear but was
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.520]  trained to be able to end up to be able to write be able to talk build a base
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:29.280]  to do everything and that's a testament to the human spirit versus people that
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:37.000]  have eyes to see and ears to hear but cannot see to quote the Bible is it
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.880]  subconsciously like Job chapter 3 that it's so horrible people choose to deny
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:57.640]  it because deep down they know the true horror I think that's part of it maybe I
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:05.160]  am the bad man maybe it's bad to not want to brain damage babies and give them
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.160]  75% high fructose corn syrup in the average formula that will totally brain
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.840]  damage them on record maybe it's wrong to not want to give small children shot
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.120]  some vaccines with cancer viruses in them that'll implant themselves in the
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.160]  DNA with the RNA to kill them a decade 15 years later after the doctors chop the
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.760]  cat cancers out of them for 10 years of excruciating pain or five years whatever
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.320]  it is maybe it's wrong to know they're giving people viral type 1 diabetes with
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:41.520]  a virus that attacks the pancreas viral pancreatitis no one will tell the people
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:54.800]  why it's happening why it's unfolding maybe I am the bad one maybe it's good
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.760]  to give the troops DU that's a death sentence when they use it kidney failure
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.680]  because it precipitates out in the kidneys maybe it's wrong to not want to
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:10.400]  put fluoride in the water and watch IQs drop and see people die of cancer let's
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  play devil's advocate maybe maybe for the next two hours I'll play devil's
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.360]  advocate today you like Bill Maher I have the moral high ground because I hate
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.560]  people want to kill everybody and want death everywhere I want abortion I'm so
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:28.760]  trendy I'm so loving so good because I'm arrogant and put on a confidence act
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:36.360]  and everyone worships me I just go through life totally empty hating
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:43.760]  everyone maybe that's fulfillment is it nobler to suffer the slings and arrow
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.920]  of outrageous fortune to be or not to be to be conscious and loving and good or
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.600]  to be a vampire scumbag that is the question
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.040]  we'll be right back

[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.680]  you know while everybody is obsessing over this missing Malaysian flight that
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.760]  has been a hijacking from from the beginning that's what I said and that's
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.760]  what I still believe it is that's what everything points at right now while
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.440]  we're all busy obsessing over that there's major wars over the planetary
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.480]  currency there's troops massing on both sides and around Ukraine and Crimea
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:53.760]  Crimea just voted 90 plus percent to join Russia you've got Obama announcing
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.600]  new sanctions I saw him this morning just happened to be in a restaurant and
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.000]  catch a part of the press conference and he was sitting there saying you know
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.720]  you just can't go around into countries and invade places and there's going to
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:13.360]  be consequences for your actions and then this is a guy funding al-Qaeda to
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.640]  attack Syria to attack all these other countries and then Russia played the
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.880]  part of the good guys fighting against al-Qaeda our own military said no so now
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.720]  they've moved to a proxy war right up against Russia Crimea has been part of
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.960]  Russia for hundreds of years but this is escalating very very quickly and now
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.320]  the Russians are announcing a whole bunch of new sanctions they're going to
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.280]  pull against the United States which is only going to hurt the average American
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.440]  is going to hurt people in the euro like they've got articles out today in
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.080]  mainstream news saying how bad this will hurt the average European especially it
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.640]  will hurt the Russian people too but it'll sure help the globalists they
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:57.400]  always get to you know come in when countries go bankrupt and take over it
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.480]  was ninety six point seven seven percent I kept saying ninety plus percent
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.040]  ninety six point seven seven percent voted to join with Russia and of course
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.920]  oh this is outrageous the globalist just over through the country and their
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.640]  elected government three weeks ago and called it a democracy uprising and I'm
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.200]  sure they have some real beefs and there's different factions they're not all
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.880]  Nazis but the main government is Nazis that's those shake up at the end of
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.840]  World War two was Ukraine was one of the Nazis the Russians kicked them out
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:33.680]  purged them and now they're getting revenge and I'm not saying the Russians
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.720]  haven't done horrible things in the past you know it's it's it's kind of like
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.920]  stuff the US has done to Mexico okay well Mexico's really bad too and does
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.000]  horrible things you know just because the US has been bad to Mexico doesn't mean
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.440]  Mexico hasn't mass murdered over the years hundreds of thousands of
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.840]  Guatemalans in wars with them Guatemala used to be part of Mexico the point is
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.200]  these countries all act the same ladies and gentlemen they do the same thing
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.520]  over and over again and what do you think the Malaysian flight is diverting
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.480]  from folks because the way they're covering it I mean they've had other
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.200]  planes that go missing in the Mediterranean big passenger liners in
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.680]  this other places and you know French airlines that have been missing for
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:24.280]  weeks they can't find this is just an absolute diversion like the Zimmerman
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.600]  thing was a diversion from all the stuff that was going on I mean this is
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.080]  definitely a diversion now I'm gonna open the phones up long-time callers
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.560]  first-time callers you agree disagree I want to hear from folks you know what
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.480]  I'm gonna do this first then I'll have open phones for everybody I want to
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.640]  attempt to get calls from Russia maybe we should open up our international
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.080]  lines for folks with a dollar country code you can call in dust I can go to
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:54.800]  them quickly can we turn on our international lines John Harmon and

[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.280]  in Ukraine how about this too if you disagree with me on Ukraine and you
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.920]  think it's great what happened all I want to say is if we had so-called
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.120]  protesters out shooting police and the cops start shooting people for no
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.640]  reason I think the public should defend themselves 1776 you shoot us take our
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.840]  guns so the war's gonna start but you don't go out and just start shooting the
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.640]  police and then our media calls them freedom fighters oh look the freedom
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.320]  fighters the riot police weren't doing anything and they threw them all off
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.320]  cocktails at them and killed a bunch of them oh they threw them all off cocktails
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.440]  at a police vehicle and burned them up oh they're wonderful people John McCain
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.560]  said six months ago was Al-Qaeda's wonderful it just doesn't hold water

[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.040]  invasion of non-transportation related events yeah first it was the buses and
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:05.680]  the trains and now it is the highways the schools the prompts John Harman you
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.800]  know you remember 12 years ago then when I saw the TSA being formed on c-span I
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.320]  said they're gonna be on the highways they're gonna be at checkpoints they're
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.040]  gonna be everywhere as a national police force because I saw them say that and
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.640]  of course now John Harman is it happening absolutely I mean it's it's
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.880]  one of those things that it wasn't something that you predicted and you
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.760]  looked into your crystal ball you could see it happening that's just the way the
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:36.120]  future is going with all the technology and everything checkpoints on when you
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.840]  go to the mall you're gonna be at search everywhere Alex is absolutely right
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.680]  that's the way things are heading well they said they were gonna do that and
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.600]  here it is it's happening it's getting rolled out slowly it's it's the whole
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.320]  they they if they just announced it hey folks we're gonna start doing this now
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.640]  people of course would go up in arms and say absolutely not this is ridiculous
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.760]  it's the you know slowly turning up the pressure cooker and eventually people
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.920]  just accept it it's just another thing it's it's boiling the the frog in the
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.920]  hot water analogy why are you being registered right now you know because
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:17.240]  I'm I am white and I am sorry I love Obama I apologize that's better I mean
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.560]  if you have it listen if you have an opinion on the flavor of ice cream you
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.280]  want it's racist if you don't like your guns and your racist you don't pay for
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.560]  the Obamacare rip off your racist you do what you're told and nobody's gonna
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.080]  call you racist don't give up don't give up on me I am learning yeah I mean you
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.720]  used to that people governments had to smack you around to make you do what
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.120]  they said now they just threaten you with not being trendy that yep that's the
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:45.200]  way things are going they politically can assassinate your characters so that
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.600]  when you have an opinion people could say oh it's that guy saying that and well
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.000]  exactly but I mean more than that it is even more of a hoax because the system
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.160]  has almost no power and is discredited and so many people hate the system that
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.200]  for them to attack you you actually become popular oh they know that and
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:07.080]  it didn't desperate exactly but the trendy still think that if the system's
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.800]  attacking you it means you're discredited that's because they're on the
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.280]  winning team they're you know if if even though they're they're going down they
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.920]  look bad they have to keep rooting for that winning team because it their whole
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.760]  life is being they bought into this whole their whole life is about being in
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:25.040]  the facade it's just like what does Stefan Maldew was saying the other day
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.000]  people that live on the surface it's all about that whole thing I mean we all you
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.760]  know those those yuppies that you talk about they're all living on the surface
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.800]  they're not living in the barbarian beauty area exactly they're not really
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.760]  living it's all about their BMW and their bank account they have to protect
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.800]  that Sean they're not seething with the animating contest of liberty their minds
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.120]  are not on fire absolutely they just don't have that right mindset something
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.280]  eventually will come along and kind of you know a cop pulling them over and you
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.320]  know kind of abusing their rights something like that well I told everybody
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.720]  cuz Toyota said it like 15 years ago and they announced it they're gonna have
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.880]  cameras and all the cars that watch you to make sure you're not upset that then
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:07.160]  live time back to the police see you know if they said they're secretly watching
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:12.440]  you everyone would get upset but now it's not secretly watching you it's oh in
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.440]  case there's road rage in it and in the article I'm gonna get to later it shows
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.640]  the face of the guy with road rage and all he's doing is kind of frowning I
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.640]  frown when I'm having my most delicious moments listening to music or thinking

[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.560]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take

[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:24.800]  I've got so much news and I am not a lazy creature it's more of torture some
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.400]  days most days I want to cover news some days I get in here and look at it all
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.640]  and it's just like this is all this is off the charts but I've got to get to the
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:38.080]  UN news I've got to get to just all this other incredible news but right now
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.880]  let's go to the hubo am I pronouncing that right and then we're gonna go to
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:51.560]  Robert God and country Alyssa and Bob and we've got some folks that disagrees
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.680]  let's go to let's go to the hubo first because he disagrees from Wisconsin
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.640]  okay you're first up what do you disagree with me about with the Ukraine
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:04.800]  situation sir I dare not disagree with you although it's a minor point let me
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.880]  just say you've been spot on in your analysis and you've said it in such a
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:18.040]  stentorian way I respect you I disagree with the notion that this may well
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:24.480]  that you know thermo nuclear war is well while it is possible I don't think the
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.920]  West will will will go that way of course unless it's forced into it and of
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:35.440]  course Russia has been very measured and and sober about this I'll tell you why
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.760]  the West won't do it because it has got too much to lose it's got this rigged
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:46.120]  game and they don't want to lose it I mean just think of Axon and all these
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.480]  big companies they won't be able to do business so they've got just too much to
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.240]  lose to go that direction let me just tell you what I think this whole thing
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:00.640]  is about this thing is to cut off to to create the scenario to cut off gas coming
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.040]  into Europe as somebody said yesterday they would blow up a pipeline and you
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.840]  know it is to make Americans think oh we're in another cold war again let's
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.320]  give into fracking you know so then we don't need we don't need the gas here we
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.280]  have enough gas but it's to then send it down to Europe and so to make people
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:25.280]  agree to give up their rights on fracking well I think that is the energy
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.680]  fits into it and then getting Europe off of Russian gas that is actually part of
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.200]  it and I think different forms of newer forms of exploration for natural
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.120]  resources is in that equation that you're absolutely right that's why they
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.680]  want a new proxy war with Russia is because it lines up with so many
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.280]  interests the EU wants to control Germany wants control the British always
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.120]  want to bring down Russia the Israelis want to go after Iran they got to get
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.200]  rid of Syria Russia's protecting Syria but again Israel loses the moral high
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.960]  ground supporting along with our government Al Qaeda forces blowing up
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.600]  all the churches and stuff I mean you don't get rid of Assad and put Al Qaeda
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.920]  in who's literally I keep saying ten times worse they got to be a hundred
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.560]  times worse get some of the oldest Jewish and Christian communities in the
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.960]  world in Syria they live in total peace and are now being blown up they blew
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:24.720]  up something like 200 churches in the month of December last year you know
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:32.160]  Alex not not that I'm an apologist for Russia but I believe that Russia is the
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.920]  repository of Christianity and it's the all-right but it is the repository of
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.640]  Christianity more so than any way in the world it is the ancient Orthodox
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.520]  Christianity and it is true that it is taking over Russia right now they're
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.400]  having a revival over there and the establishment does not like it you know
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.960]  what you're talking about Habib it's so good to inform college I guess money
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:59.080]  else thank you so much sir Robert in Illinois you're on the air thanks for
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:06.040]  holding go ahead yes Alex thank you very much I just like to point out that if
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:12.080]  if we are being eavesdropped on via our cell phones audio and video who's is
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:16.320]  saying that the NSA doesn't already know or or knows what's going on and that
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.320]  missing plane if other phones are still active maybe they've already painted a
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.520]  picture of what's going on and then governments are involved and they can't
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.120]  let the rat know that it's being chased back to it's then so that's why there's
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.200]  no new updates and they won't say no on the you know they could know who really
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.720]  got it and it's behind the scenes diplomatic stuff with the North Koreans
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:42.640]  the Chinese or it could have been an NSA CIA style deal where in operation
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.720]  Northwoods they said they would land the plane and claim it crashed or claim it
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:52.480]  disappeared and then have the people on board be government folks or corporate
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.480]  you know sheep dipped covert deep cover operatives who then all stage their
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.280]  death and then get new names which is a routine operation I mean I know people
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.440]  and have had I'm just gonna leave it at that the let's just say this a lot of
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.720]  people going to the military and then they stage their death and then they
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.040]  get a new identity so that type of stuff does go on I mean my shelf I'm Bill
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:18.920]  Hicks I mean I I'm not joking folks it's sarcastic joke on the internet but not
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:25.960]  funny the family I apologize but getting serious any other points you dropped
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:31.200]  on it we're gonna come right back no but seriously there is a program a large
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:39.040]  program called sheep dipping and that's how they create secret armies I mean
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.040]  brigade level of basically ghost soldiers that don't even exist on paper
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.360]  and the Russians are big into that too and our country is just full of Russian
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:55.680]  operatives we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.680]  supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.920]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:19.320]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.920]  Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan

[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:19.400]  Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:25.160]  encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:30.240]  table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ

[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:08.200]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:15.960]  the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude. People
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:23.200]  can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:45.000]  ought not to intrude. Too many kids are what's making planet worse. A lot of
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.920]  these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have stable parents making good
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:55.720]  decisions. Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.680]  new studies in the journal pediatric. These new studies suggest that the
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.080]  opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.480]  behavior and mental performance. Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:13.240]  but could it also cause cancer. The government had the right under US law to
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:17.360]  conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition. I have
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:22.520]  to work the dark side of it. I'll spend time in the shadows. Any attempt to achieve
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.520]  world order must be the work of the devil. Well join me and I'm glad to sit
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:34.280]  here at the right hand to say there's a need for a new world order. Someday in the
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:40.880]  next few years a solution will emerge.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:46.200]  Nuclear war.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:35:04.120]  You're listening to Info Wars Worldwide. I am your host Alex Jones and we're here.

[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:32.240]  I listen to that frown but it's a frown of enjoyment. The new Toyota face scanner
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.120]  will call the police or slow my car down even though I wasn't speeding because
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:49.680]  it's a sign of a road rage. Yeah! I'm awake. I'm not a slave. I see the globalist.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:57.200]  I know what they're doing and I don't like it. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.760]  Okay let me do this. I'm gonna take about ten phone calls and then I will get
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.880]  into the news. I will get into this just so much. I've got to do it. But the
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:10.320]  callers are the news. They bring up so much important stuff. We got a caller
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.600]  God and Country from UK lived in Russia on topic. Wants to give us their take on
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.360]  what's happening over in Russia. Then Alyssa wants to talk about trendies.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.560]  Says that she disagrees and then Bob in Wisconsin on the topic of Russia we're
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:30.520]  gonna get to you. God and Country you're on the air. Hello Mr. Jones can you hear
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:36.200]  me? I can go ahead. Alright first of all God bless and God bless our country. I'm
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.600]  really happy to talk to you. I wanted to say quickly. There's a lot to cover but
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.080]  I'll try to be as quick as possible. First of all from all of us and from the
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.600]  whole world and military. You're the biggest here in the world. You're a
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.160]  brother in arms and a modern age prophet sounding the horn for those that will
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:57.120]  listen. I just want to start that. Don't build me up like that. So what's
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.720]  your nationality? You're saying our country. My country's humanity but I'm
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:05.600]  an American. But I mean you're in the UK or are you Russian? You're Ukrainian? What
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.920]  are you? A bunch of things. First of all I was born in the United States. I'm from
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:17.100]  San Francisco, California but my parents are Russian and they ran away from you
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:23.000]  could say they ran away from the communist 70-year communist
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.320]  stakeholder. The communist disease that our government literally defecated on to
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.880]  you? Mm-hmm. Oh yeah which is now pushing it on the United States and trying
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:38.040]  to make it a world policy now. But so I had the opportunity to
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:44.040]  understand from my father and my mother how bad things were and I
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.560]  understood that that was a big experiment. It was actually a big huge
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.600]  experiment on the Russian people. I believe it was about 100 million Russians
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:57.880]  that died. The official numbers are 66 million. We're not talking about World
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.620]  War II deaths. World War II deaths which was another manipulated war. Yeah they've
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.840]  actually brought the Russian population down. They brought in eugenics. They
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:08.880]  broke up the families. They put people in the big dormitories. Everything we're
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.360]  going to go through. The globalists have visited upon Russia. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.240]  had abortions. Everything before any other country had it. They were
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.280]  experimenting with that a long time. They were actually the eugenics, sacred
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.760]  testing, breaking down the family, every nastiness. Yes.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.800]  Pure hell on earth. And the countries, because I lived there for about three
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.120]  years. Now it's going to be four. I'm in the UK just visiting my grandparents. I'm
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.080]  trying to help them which is actually it's another terrible tyranny. The UK is
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:43.240]  unbelievable. I mean they give you hell just trying to get in. I mean they are
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:47.760]  in America. They give you hell but every other foreigner, someone else they just
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.960]  you know please come on right in. You know ruin the country further but that's
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:56.200]  another story. And you know I don't want to go too far into this but even the
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.240]  UK government took the pensions of my grandparents and we're here trying to
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.560]  try to fight it. Pull it back. I mean it took about a couple hundred thousand
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.160]  pounds from my grandparents. That's what they do. So very kleptocratic. They're
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.080]  saying they're going to take UKIP's children. The mayor of London openly said
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.040]  if you're a nationalist, basically like Ron Paul, you're mentally ill. We're
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.960]  going to take your kids and they're trying to start that here. I mean these
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.240]  people literally are setting up reeducation camps but they do it like
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.600]  it's no big deal. Like we're going to come take your kids. It's loving and it's
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.480]  sick. So what's your point on Russia and the situation right now with Ukraine?
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:41.440]  Yeah I'll get to Russia. Okay first of all I'm there for three years and what
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:47.120]  we've seen is that first of all Putin is 100% in WIO. Just get that out of the
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  way. You know Putin is 100% with the New World Order and maybe
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:55.960]  the thing is he has to play the role because the majority of the
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.200]  population still are good people. They're down to earth. You know there's
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.920]  an expression, a Russian soul. The UK, the New
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  World Order has really tried to destroy the Russian people, the Russian nation
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.920]  because they're really the outside threat, the unseen, the
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.400]  joker in the deck. They don't know because these people have
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.600]  survived for thousands of years and they never were really completely under
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.280]  control. And communism really gave a terrible hit to the country. I mean you
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.320]  have run down buildings all over the country still even though it's one of
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.960]  the richest countries in the world now. Which is one of the reasons why I
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.760]  will, my family was actually forced to leave the United States because
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.080]  we're trying to run a business, trying to do some business. We actually had to
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.280]  go to Russia to just basically survive just economically. Besides from all the
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.600]  terrible tyranny back at home you know especially California. It's pretty insane
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.440]  there. I still have my sister and mother there. I'm going to try to get them out
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.920]  of there because... What's your bottom line on Ukraine? Very interesting.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:06.280]  Bottom line in Ukraine, I mean it's a huge conspiracy. What I want to
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:14.600]  about Ukraine, the Ukraine they wanted to join NATO number one but
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.720]  they can't let Ukraine join NATO with a Russian base attached to it. It's
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.520]  politically unfeasible. That's right, that's all public. And see this is all
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.840]  public and the average American is against the war in Poles but still the
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.120]  minority, 20% that are for it. They can't even find it on a map. I just go yeah
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:37.760]  Russians kill them. I mean it's just the most mindlessness. Go ahead. Yes and so
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.640]  in the Crimea, we used to belong to Russia for
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.480]  ages for hundreds of years and they basically use that as a
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.120]  sideshow while they're taking over the Ukrainian government. I mean do you
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.880]  remember Mr. Jones when the Polish plane with the entire Polish
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:02.880]  government got wiped out over Russian territory? Yes. That's exactly the same
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.000]  thing that's happening in the Ukraine now. That's exactly the same. They replace
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.320]  the government with a new world order government. They're going to join
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.960]  at least the NATO. They might not join the EU just yet but they're
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.920]  going to join the NATO. Do you think NATO blew up the Polish president? I don't
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.440]  know about NATO. It doesn't matter who did it, does it? It's the new order that
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:27.640]  blew them up because they weren't going to join the EU. That's right, it's above
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:31.600]  every country. That's right. Yeah, so they just wiped out the
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.160]  Russian government is with them. I mean ever since communism fell,
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.760]  it's an actual CIA, it was a CIA plan. Sure, what you're saying is actually
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.320]  very sophisticated and just like Stalin, Hitler divided Poland before they
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.800]  turned on each other, before Hitler turned on him. You're saying that this is a
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:53.560]  backroom deal to divide up Ukraine amongst themselves. Let Putin secure his
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:59.360]  foothold with the illusion of outside pressure while the euro can secure its
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:04.160]  foothold in a new Cold War. That's a very sophisticated view and that's the
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.960]  eye from the globalist but they know it's fluid and it's going to change. But
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:13.040]  you've obviously lived in Russia. From my studying, the globalists do not
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.000]  completely control Russia. Obviously Putin's got his billions in offshore
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.800]  bank accounts. They've been bought off to a certain extent but he did kick out a
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.800]  bunch of oligarchs and arrest a bunch of Rothschild fronts. That all came out in
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:29.000]  the news and in court trials. I mean, how do you reckon for that? Yeah, that's
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.200]  what actually confuses even me sometimes, even us sometimes because
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:39.000]  sometimes he pushes buttons that make it really look like he's
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.400]  anti-New World Order. But the direction the country is going, I mean, the
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:48.560]  education system, the society, the cultural collapse, the music industry,
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.040]  they're pushing homosexuality purposefully on the children. The Olympics
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.080]  was just a huge show just to pressure with the rainbow flags all over the
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:04.320]  place. The entire St. Petersburg had rainbow flags all over it. The purple, the
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.760]  Putin dressed up and supposedly Putin is anti-gay, right? Supposedly. But then
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:14.680]  he goes on to a Russian TV show, puts on a purple shirt, talks to Elton John,
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:18.880]  while the society locally is very against it. I don't get all this
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:22.720]  code stuff. I had someone one time wearing purple in here and she's a
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:29.680]  lesbian and she said, you know, oh, you know, I wore purple today because I'm
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.760]  just like, what does that mean? I mean, I wear purple shirts sometimes and so I
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.160]  just want to mean I'm wearing a blue shirt right now. That doesn't mean I'm who's
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.720]  got a blue flag Russian or something. But I hear it's all very interesting. Look,
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:46.120]  they just use this whole stuff as a football issue back and forth and it's
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.760]  the same thing. Even if Putin isn't completely in bed with the New World
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:53.320]  Order, there are special interests that overlap. That's undoubted. That's just
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:45:01.440]  how it works. And Putin represents a lot of the old line groups that didn't want
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.560]  to just have a bunch of oligarchs running on everything. They want to be their
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.280]  own Russian oligarchs, not offshore oligarchs. So obviously there's systemic
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.520]  corruption in Russia. That's one of the problems. You know, they have a smart
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.840]  population. They can't ever, you know, totally get themselves together and they
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.280]  can build spaceships and fighter aircraft and come up with mathematical
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:26.200]  equations and, you know, like nobody else. But then they can't get over the
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.200]  corruption. And most countries can. I'm not picking on the Russians and look at
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.560]  the rest of the world. They're smart people in Latin America. They're not
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.040]  stupid. They just cannot get over their corruption. They're smart people in
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.760]  Africa, folks, but they just can't get over the corruption. Smart people all
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:50.680]  over Asia. Most of Asia is hyper-corrupt. And Japan's run by the mafia, basically,
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.440]  but they keep it so controlled that it doesn't go systemic. I need to stop
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.360]  talking and go to calls. Alicia in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. You
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.280]  disagree about something. Please tell me what it is. It's not so much of a
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:09.040]  disagreement, but as far as the people we mock, the people we try to wake up,
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:13.400]  whether people aren't awake or not. I kind of want to start this little rant
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:18.240]  off with a personal story. Everything that they've been doing to us with the
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.120]  fluoride, with the toxins, with the chemtrails, with whatever you want to call
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.760]  it, we have all suffered so much because of that. And I think whether we're
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.720]  trendy, whether we're a Democrat completely brainwashed, whether we're
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:37.000]  sheeple, everyone is going to wake up soon. I'm 28. I've had four years of my
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.360]  life just completely taken away from me. Cancer at 24, completely related to
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.840]  all that crap that I was brought up drinking, eating, whatever. Went through
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.320]  their chemotherapy, their radiation and everything, only to discover thyroid
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.520]  cancer right in the middle of my radiation treatment. Thyroid removed. So now
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:03.120]  I'm on the fake centroid replacement for that. And that was really my wake-up
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.920]  call to everything. And that's when I opened my eyes to a lot more. And we
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:14.520]  have all in America watched uncles, grandparents, even parents, whoever die
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.520]  of cancer, die of these horrible things that shouldn't be happening. I have a
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:24.120]  mother to this day that cries and blames herself for a daughter that can't have
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:29.440]  kids and for a daughter who had to go through all that. And whether it's cancer,
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.400]  whether it's... I haven't been able to find a job in four months. I was laid off
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:40.400]  after Obamacare. Oh, you might not want to say that. Yeah, if you don't thank them
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:45.520]  for giving you cancer and the vaccines on record and the cancers are up 10,000
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:50.760]  percent in children on average, that's racist. If you, I mean, you need to let
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:55.800]  them kill you or you're racist. But I mean, to not be sarcastic, we
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.360]  lead the world in cancer. They are killing us on purpose and it's on record. The
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:05.840]  glyphosates, all of it, are meant to grow cancers in women. And it's
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:10.080]  abominable. It's happening. It's the real deal. And I agree. People have been
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:15.320]  mind-controlled from birth and we shouldn't make fun of them. I do it
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:20.240]  because just, you know, at a certain human level, it becomes ridiculous. And I
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.880]  kind of get the same sustain for the public the elite has and that's wrong
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.080]  and that's evil. And thank you for correcting me. You're right. We shouldn't
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.120]  get so mad at the public. We shouldn't get mad when they laugh at us. We
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:32.600]  shouldn't get mad at how stupid they are. We should realize they're victims and
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:40.480]  I mean, cancer in women is off the charts. I know tons of young women that have
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:44.600]  had cancer and now they overdiagnose it. They find the antibodies for cancer,
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.240]  which everybody's got in them constantly, and then claim, oh, it's
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.320]  inconclusive. We need to cut this out of you. It's also an overdiagnosis industry.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:54.080]  And the chemo therapy, obviously, is going to give you a whole bunch of other
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:59.960]  cancers on the road. I'm sure you know all this, but it's a serious situation.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:05.160]  And I think what you've said is very poignant. I'm sorry that you can't have
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:09.960]  children and I'm sorry that, I mean, the Gardasil shot does, and in the trials,
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:15.200]  does destroy the ovaries. And it's now confirmed. It's a soft kill
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:18.600]  sterilant. It will not sterilize everybody. It will cause major
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:24.640]  reproductive tract problems and autoimmune disorders and all sorts of problems.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:30.160]  And those are all epidemic. And, you know, I know parents whose kids die at the
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.480]  doctor's office when they take the shot. They don't just have convulsions in the
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.920]  car home. They die. And then we sit here, instead of the Nazis lining folks up and
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:44.040]  shooting them, they just soft kill where it's like a lottery and, oh, Junior's got
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.880]  cancer. Oh, your kid can't talk. Oh, neighbor's got cancer. Oh, our kids got
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.800]  cancer. Oh, everybody's got allergies now. Oh, everybody's got bowel disorders. Oh,
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.120]  everybody's got neurological disorders. Oh, everybody's got skin disorders. Oh,
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.840]  everybody's got, everybody's got mental disorders. Oh, what's going on there?
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:05.160]  We're being murdered by a giant secret biological, chemical, radiological
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.600]  weapons program that is only barely beneath the surface. A lot of it's
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.000]  submerged in public. Closing comments, ma'am. My main point, I think everything
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.920]  that they've done to us is going to backfire. My personal experiences, Alex,
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:25.400]  they have, I can't thank them, but they have turned me into steel. And I read a
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.920]  quote somewhere that stuck with me ever since I was sick. There's nothing more
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.840]  powerful than the human soul on fire. And we all have a breaking point, whether
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:38.200]  we're awake or not. And they're on the cusp of doing that to us. I agree with you.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.280]  I agree. I could feel your power. I could feel the fire of liberty burning in you.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.320]  And where there is the spirit of the Lord, there is liberty. Anything else? We will
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:53.120]  fight. Absolutely. Just give them hell. Expose them. Get in their face. Warn
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.720]  others. Free the zombies. We can do it together. Life will defeat death with
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:05.680]  Christ's aid. My name is Jessica Arman. I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:09.280]  mother of three. Our drinking, watering food are filled with fluoride and other
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.400]  contaminants that harm our teeth and gums. To protect my family, I created My

[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.960]  The facts are in. The studies are legion. Sodium fluoride and other toxic
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:08.760]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:13.600]  ability of the American people. So why are the social engineers adding it to the
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:17.680]  water? Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:21.800]  technocracy is feeding on. We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.920]  water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies. I am extremely
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:30.640]  excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLine fluoride shield formulation

[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:43.560]  whole host of toxic substances. Let's take a stand against the globalist by
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:47.800]  blocking their poisons with fluoride shield. I use fluoride shield every day.

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:36.840]  time and life for this, but then it all fell apart. Beautiful song, poetry. You guys

[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.840]  trans specific partnership we're gonna give you the rest of the story Paul
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.120]  Harvey would say good day so that's coming up talking about glyphosates I
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:14.280]  try to sell things here that I personally buy that I personally use that I
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:22.120]  personally believe in because I don't want any anything I do to come back on
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:27.120]  me and it's not even magical thinking I don't like doing things bad to other
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.240]  people I like inviting friends over and cooking them the most delicious meal
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:35.520]  possible just because I enjoy hospitality and see people have a good
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:40.480]  time I love taking my friends out shooting I love having you know some of
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:46.680]  my buddies and telling jokes I know you're like that too but the globalist
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:50.040]  aren't folks they would rather cheat somebody or screw somebody over my point
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.960]  is we only sell products that I believe are really awesome and I say I believe
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.480]  even when you're trying to get the very best products and trying to be perfect
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.800]  job you know nothing's absolutely perfect but whether it's the info works
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.200]  life supplements of supermail vitality that we're gonna get some more of it in
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.880]  a couple weeks it is back order right now it did sell out but if you get your
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.440]  order and you'll you'll get it first they say the trucks will leave sometime
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:21.240]  this week the truck so the point is that that's an informers live.com that
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:24.760]  supports the broadcast supermail vitality survival shield nice and
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:29.160]  iodine and we have a new product but we only have a limited amount of these it's
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:33.640]  called silver bullet we've got the write-up on it but it is the strongest
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:40.280]  colloidal silver that we could find anywhere it is the strongest colloidal
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:47.200]  silver that we could find anywhere and we've got all the specs of info wars
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.480]  life comm it's called silver bullet I can't believe nobody else had a
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.200]  loyal silver called silver bullet I mean that is a no-brainer but it's there
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.520]  unfortunately it's really hard to get colloidal silver and we got a very limited
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:05.280]  supply this is not hype at $19 this double strength that's beyond double
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:10.720]  strength will sell out you get as low as $15 a bottle it will sell out in a
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:14.720]  matter of days because we didn't get very much that's really the problem with
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:19.720]  selling high quality products is the supply chain is that I mean we can put
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:23.800]  crud out all day long we're very neurotic about only putting out the best
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.720]  quality so we have a very limited supply of this it is the silver bullet info
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:35.640]  wars life's fourth product we have fourth supplement survival shield fluoride
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:40.240]  shield supermail vitality and now silver bullet and I guess info wars life also
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.000]  puts the coffee out but that's not really a supplement that's just organic
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.880]  coffee and so I haven't plugged in two hours I'm plugging here midair refueling
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.440]  this is how we find our operation bringing you stuff that I use that I

[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:05.480]  effect that's not why we sell it it's it's about general male vitality and
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:12.000]  blocking estrogen mimicers with me I take half a dose because I have had
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:20.080]  problems with anger my entire life obviously and it just does not I'm the

[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.840]  they're called a conspiracy from a Vietnam veteran that I met out in both
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:02.480]  Colorado was kind of trampling around the United States they had a hippie
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:06.600]  pop house and the man to this guy and we bought a library during the day and

[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:36.920]  governor of New Mexico former governor yeah Gary Allen can you believe his son
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.760]  runs Politico and serves the New World Order and makes fun of us when we cover
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.720]  Bilderberg and his father literally wrote a book that predicted the future and has
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.920]  and may may actually save us because it woke up so many people 10 million
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:56.880]  copies in print I mean can you believe can you imagine your son betraying you
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:02.520]  like that I just I just that was Gary Allen's dead but I just couldn't
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:06.240]  imagine being a great journalist like Gary Allen and writing that book that he
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:10.400]  put out at cost so 10 million copies got out we sell it by the way today and back
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:17.280]  in print written in what 1972 71 or 72 yeah matter of fact I got you to the
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.520]  newspaper they got it got from the fours it's unbelievable it's unbelievable I
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.520]  mean I don't want to digress but can you imagine if you were such a patriot and
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:31.800]  your son but like literally joined the emperor imagine if you were Darth Vader's
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:35.040]  father and that's what it's basically like go ahead sorry no I couldn't imagine
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.600]  that because I have three boys and they're in their adult age now 11
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:44.320]  married 39 years and they're in their 30s and and you know I gave them the
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.240]  information that I got out of that book and what's funny about it is that you
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:51.800]  know I was warned everybody for years and being ridiculed and laughed at and
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:57.760]  and when 9-11 happened it got by me and you know my oldest boy was telling me
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:02.960]  look that it was an inside job this was probably around 2006 you tell me that
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.880]  look at that it was an inside job here's the proof blah blah blah and I said you
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:11.560]  know but these this government got some messed up people in it but it ain't that
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:15.760]  bad and they turned me on there a couple more books in my so old son did any
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:22.520]  turn me on to you and I said oh my god it's all happened just like my worst
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:29.800]  fears and I appreciate what you're doing because for years I knew what you know
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:34.400]  and I didn't do nothing about it well brother you did you had three great
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.760]  sons that educated them and then you got busy with life and then they
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:41.360]  came back and woke you back up again that's how it works and in Gary Allen's
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.640]  book like a sleeper cell is out there with all these people I mean listen I
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:51.000]  grew up with John Berger's coming over when I was like one two three years old
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.240]  there was a John Berger live next door that would keep me when my mom with the
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:02.000]  grocery store and stuff Bobby Vaughn he's dead now and he'd crank up you know
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  rock and roll music and you know we sit there and he was he was a funny guy I
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.640]  remember when I was a kid and playing with me but but the whole point was is
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:13.280]  that he but he was just constantly talking at night drinking beer at my
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:16.960]  parents house he's over there every night you know the neighbor with his
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.520]  girlfriend just constantly about the new world order new world order new world
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.840]  order banks gonna take over blah blah blah and I just sat there listening to
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:29.560]  that like a sleeper cell later than I read the book because I heard so I'm
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:32.800]  handing out the books talking to my dad everything because my dad was already
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:36.200]  awake but that's how it works brother you never got to your point about the
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.280]  missing plane what's going on Bob well I get things hijacked you know there's
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:44.440]  only one power on this planet that's got the ability and the capability in an
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:49.440]  urban New York Datsunian here against the steel plane with 240 souls on it you
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:53.600]  know what it is I don't think I have to come around and tell you that it's the
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.400]  United States government that don't get playing and what they got up their sleeves
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:02.760]  I have no idea I hear you probably knows my friends Alex Jones here to tell you

[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:13.320]  in the northern hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.480]  accidents radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply there's
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:22.120]  only two ways to avoid this move south of the equator or properly protect your

[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:16.360]  calls Chris Robert Laura Tom Travis and others that are patiently holding and I
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:20.360]  love an article like this because it really just illustrates everything I'm
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:26.840]  talking about and we're gonna be the rest of the story on it what's in this
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.800]  article is not just the news that the internet's being handed over to someone
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:37.080]  they say they don't know who it's that you could write an article like this
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:43.000]  where the Washington Post says we don't know who's getting control of the
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.120]  internet that's like saying we're gonna have World War three that's gonna have
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:53.200]  it in 10 minutes but we don't know who we're having it with we're gonna have a
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:57.560]  Super Bowl tomorrow but we don't know who the Super Bowl players are you know
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.600]  we don't know who the teams are I don't know if it's the Washington Post writer
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:08.720]  Craig Tim Berg is this stupid or whether they think you're that stupid
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.760]  actually I know he's not stupid they don't want to tell you that's how
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:19.920]  stupid they think you are it's on record that under international treaties in the
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:24.840]  last 20 years they've already signed over most the internet that's why hidden
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:29.040]  in the headline is the answer oh this is not my opinion I mean I'm gonna go over
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:34.520]  some evidence of this in a moment they know full well it's the UN getting
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:39.720]  control and by UN the private interest that sit on those boards and it's the UN
[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:43.640]  that wants his Ben sopa style legislation the sense of free speech so
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:49.880]  don't forget that that's why Congress is getting behind shining over the
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:55.520]  internet that DARPA created that Americans paid for the core technology
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:59.920]  by the way will you guys queue up the John D Rockefeller we'd be better
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:06.440]  without the internet cuz cuz cuz he's the guy involved in all this thank you
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:13.920]  US to relinquish remaining control over the internet that's the headline US
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:21.400]  officials announced plans Friday to relinquish federal government control
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.920]  over the administration of the internet a move that pleased international
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:31.360]  critics but alarm some business leaders and others who rely on smooth
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:36.840]  functioning of the web that's code for we don't want an internet neutrality we
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:41.360]  don't want to be under EU law-sensoring free speech we don't want to be under
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.840]  internet tax and by the way that's what's in there and and that's what's
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.280]  actually in other news publications mainline news that's what Google is
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.040]  saying I'm not normally saying Google's good guys but if they've
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:55.720]  understand their interest is threatened even though they're a large part of the
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.360]  new order system this is being transferred basically to the EU that runs
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:05.320]  the UN now we're gonna get to Senator Rockefeller here in a moment but listen
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:09.920]  to this pressure to let go the final vestiges see it's already been done of
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:14.360]  US authority over the system of web addresses and domain names that organized
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:18.680]  the internet has been building for more than a decade and was supercharged by
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:24.480]  the backlash last year to revelations about national security agency
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.560]  surveillance see how all the other government to do it all the big
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:31.160]  corporations do it it's all about how America's doing it we've got to turn the
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:38.480]  web over to the UN they'll fix it see how they do this because it's globalist
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:43.200]  above America playing us off against others the change within the long-running
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:46.280]  contract between the Commerce Department the internet corporation for sign
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:51.680]  names and numbers I can a California based non-profit group that contract is
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.640]  set to expire next year but could be extended if the transition plan is not
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.040]  complete now I've been covering this for 15 years really since I learned a
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.920]  little bit more about it the UN is constantly saying they want to remove
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:11.320]  most people's domains and tax the other domains and in free speech and you can
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:15.840]  look that up to tell me just type in UN wants to tax domains or UN wants to take
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:23.480]  domains and that's why they've got all the names biz and gov and org and they're
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.520]  gonna come in and say you can't do this on that you can't do that I mean it's
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.160]  all happening it's all being announced now let's continue in a statement
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.000]  Senate Commerce Chairman John D Rockefeller called the move consistent
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.200]  with other efforts the US and other allies are making remote free and open
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:43.320]  internet and to preserve and advance the current multi stakeholder model of
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:49.280]  global internet governance you're that global internet governance and by the
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:55.280]  way there's a big club to quote George Carlin and you ain't in it because the
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:00.000]  world's owners want you dumb that's why education will ever get better it'll get
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.200]  worse because it's designed to dumb you down because the country's owners once
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:11.720]  you stupid thank you George Carlin rest in peace not a love and truth or so
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.880]  there you go ladies and gentlemen now now now he says this is gonna protect the
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.160]  freedom of internet he's been promoting stuff that within freedom of the web as
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:25.880]  we know it syspa sopa the UN treaties let's let's play that clip just so I'm
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:30.320]  not just claiming he said we'd be better off without internet here it is President
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.920]  Obama's director of national intelligence Admiral Blair who I greatly respect have
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:43.520]  labeled cyber security perpetrated through the internet as the number one
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:51.560]  national hazard of attack on the homeland in West Virginia and on in West
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:58.000]  Virginia on attacks so I mean it really it really almost makes you ask the
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.360]  question would it have been better if we never invented the internet and had to
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  use paper and pencil or whatever and that's a stupid thing to say but it's
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:13.520]  it has genuine consequence are getting on the internet that these acts okay so
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:18.680]  there you go all these acts are so bad let us run everything turns out most of
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:22.920]  the time it's the globalist doing it all so that's what's going on now now
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:25.680]  listen here's the key part of the article sees why I don't cover articles a
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:33.640]  lot I got 300 on my desk this is one to decipher this crud now let's go to the
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.040]  next one but former House Speaker Newt Gennrich I cannot believe I'm agreeing
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:43.000]  with Newt Gennrich Republican Georgia tweeted what is the global internet
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.200]  community that Obama wants to turn the internet over to the risk of foreign
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.320]  dictatorships defining the internet this risk foreign dictatorships fine
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:56.480]  internet well no nudie it's not that we're gonna have you know Zimbabwe or
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:00.760]  whatever voting on the thing it's the private stakeholders that already under
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:04.720]  the treaties will control it to the World Trade Organization and others and
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:12.080]  fast-track that's the issue here and we know because it got leaked by hackers
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:16.520]  and they confirmed it's real only one of the 30 pieces dealing with the
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:21.720]  Trans-Pacific Partnership we know what's in it and it makes CISPA and SOPA look
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:26.200]  tame it's a pay-for-play internet with about 3,000 big sites and universities
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:29.200]  and government and corporations and then you've got to have a subdomain with
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.720]  them and then they just phased out the old internet it's like it's like turning
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.760]  a road into a toll road and then not letting you have access to it and here
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:42.360]  it is out of the new American by Joe Wolverton excellent article SOPA dead
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.880]  in Congress alive in Trans-Pacific Partnership and this thing they call
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.960]  it Trans-Pacific it's for the whole world folks it comes in with the
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:55.640]  governance over the internet and that's just one piece of 30 parts that I wish
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.920]  the hackers would release the whole thing but see Google has access to this
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:02.800]  and we know they're probably the hackers there's some fights of the new
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.800]  World Order and some people that don't want this to go through right now they
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:12.840]  want the web to be free a little bit longer while they dominate it and so
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:18.840]  they they want it known what's going on so it can be shot down so it's the
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:21.960]  separation of powers is one of the main things that's still keeping us afloat
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:28.120]  now now I mentioned some of this earlier but this ties into it ex-bush
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:31.640]  administration official internet giveaway weakened cybersecurity opens
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:37.680]  door to web tax well yeah I mean the web tax is being proposed across the board
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:42.800]  by the UN that's getting it and again the UN's the name on the door it's these
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.960]  private boards just like Codex Alimentarius is a bunch of big pharma
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:52.360]  people shutting down vitamins and minerals and nutrients worldwide the US is
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.680]  one of the few countries they haven't restricted it here's another one just
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:01.440]  showing where we're going Google wants email scanning information block
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.640]  Bloomberg don't want you knowing they're spying on everything you write see
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.480]  they all do it here's one the future of brain implants how soon can we expect to
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:12.800]  see brain implants for perfect memory enhanced vision hyper normal focused or
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:17.800]  an expert golf swing see they're rolling out brain chips like it's going to be so
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:24.080]  cool only the coolest people get them there'd be unintended consequences and
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:30.040]  problems if I'm a level it excuse me I had afforded slip benevolent loving
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:35.320]  angel was running it but this angel's not very loving that runs this well I
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:41.440]  sure you and here's the next article see they're just rolling out everywhere I
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:44.880]  should tell you the plan was for DARP it up have everybody with a brain chip by
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:50.200]  2025 that's official DARPA policy the classified in 1991 reclassified soon
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:54.560]  after I'm a coupe I think they're gonna put brain chips in you but they're

[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:16.920]  halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.240]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add

[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:18.640]  news and then more phone calls but I want to tie it into the story I was just
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:23.840]  covering later cars could soon monitor our emotions device reads facial
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:27.640]  expressions to prevent road rage where the computer sits there bossing you
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:31.920]  around and is tied back to the police department and that's out of the Daily
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:37.400]  Mail RT you name it and again Toyota about 15 years ago had a whole online
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:42.520]  symposium where they said they were gonna do this and then they're gonna show
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:46.760]  that little robot cars are safer so you're not gonna be able to drive or if
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:51.320]  you have a special high score and pay more insurance then you can drive you'll
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:54.680]  get in your car and it'll just shuttle you around I mean this is just the end
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:57.920]  of humans being able to do anything and I go back to different Chinese
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:02.120]  dynasties I forget which one it started in I think like 3,000 years ago there's
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:06.960]  been Chinese dynasties for 6,000 years but around the middle period I know from
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:10.640]  memory forget the name of the dynasty the point is I'm obsessing on name of that
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:14.640]  dynasty they said you've got to be in the Forbidden City you've got to stay
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.320]  behind walls no one can look at you you're God it's the fashion and then
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:24.080]  we've got to bind your feet so that you can't walk you're so royal we have to
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.600]  feed you we have to bathe you we have to wipe your hind end like to the queen of
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:33.760]  England groom of the stool we have to have a valet that dresses you and pretty
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:37.680]  soon the men and the women of the royalty could hardly walk basically and
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:43.200]  they could never live they were prisoners and that's all that's happening
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:48.760]  we're seen as a ugly human resource that isn't needed and so they want to reduce
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:53.080]  our population now their own record about that I mean everybody knows that
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:55.920]  and they've taught the average person to hate themselves and hate their fellow
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:59.040]  humans and go yeah there are too many people we on let's let's euthanize
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:03.800]  folks but but not you but we've got to give up all our rights so that you know
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:08.520]  the terrorists don't kill bad Americans a year or whatever it is I mean that's
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:12.240]  scary you know because we yeah we got to have morals and we got to have the
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:18.080]  morals of letting women kill their babies that's an important moral
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:28.320]  you understand I know you understand it's just that it's this total
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:32.760]  anti-human system that they teach people to love and I said I go to your
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:38.440]  call let's go to the next segment this is a short segment and look it's not like
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:43.920]  I'm even smart that this stuff is out in the open just like they're like yeah
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:48.720]  they're giving troops brain chips now that are depressed it's really open
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:55.120]  why magazine hey they got a vaccine they give the troops after six seven eight
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:27:01.440]  tours or they're not upset anymore it's real good shot real easy of course they
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.120]  don't tell you a virus goes in each part of your brain and you'll never have
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:09.680]  those high emotions would listen to music or when your first born's born or
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.400]  you know when you win that business a deal or kiss that girl at the door when
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:21.320]  you say bye to her at night we're gonna take away your bad emotions those are
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.120]  all in the very same area the brain is the good emotions that's why the best
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:34.480]  things in my life now I see were the worst things leg surgeries and car wrecks
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:41.560]  and fights and times I was scared and down but came through it that made me
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:50.320]  who I am they don't want you to experience any of that the animating
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:55.600]  contest of life and again I'll use the analogy of space travel if I was gonna
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:58.960]  go on a Mars mission my heart would disintegrate my bones would turn to
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:02.920]  rubber by the time I got there I'd be an invalid even if I tried to work out
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:08.760]  six seven eight hours a day unless they build a satirical force system like 2001
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:13.800]  space Odyssey to create some some basic G's when the crew gets there it'll take
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:20.160]  a months to get to where they can pick up a 20 pound box basically and that's
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:24.000]  what the globalists have done to us they have put us in an artificial soft
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.120]  poisonous system to get us ease back into their control so they can create the
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.560]  control grid wipe us out and we won't get upset while we're being killed we're
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:39.600]  already been killed we're already dead most people are walking dead they're
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.400]  not conscious they're not awake they're not living they're just machines that
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:49.960]  watch television try that cool they're not really conscious because if you were
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:55.840]  conscious you wouldn't want to act cool you'd want to act honorable you'd want
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:59.320]  to find other honorable people to commune with you'd want to find other
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:05.600]  people to share art and love and passion with and to not be betrayed and to not be
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.120]  forsaken and to be loved so there'd be people there to honor you when you're
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:14.560]  putting the ground like your ancestors and that even though they don't know
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:18.120]  your name a thousand years from now they will look back at what you did and
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:22.280]  we'll have a feeling of honor for you and we'll want to be honorable into the
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:30.560]  future with whatever unimaginably splendid missions our species is involved

[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:08.240]  about Matt Red Hawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:12.240]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:15.720]  the direction this country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:20.040]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:24.360]  patriots was born by Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted

[02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:30.560]  don't try to leave my friends that's what the governor of New York says
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:39.200]  that we should give up all of our freedoms and accept abortions and
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:47.000]  accept turning our guns in or leave the state how about you leave the state
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:51.920]  that's treading on you ladies and gentlemen I don't want to be treaded
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:56.960]  upon I don't want to be food for somebody that claims they have this
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:34:04.720]  authority and just dominates everyone by the way there's a big
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:11.960]  controversy around the nation as police start wearing ultralight cameras and I
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:16.360]  don't have any problem with that if we're gonna be able to film them in
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:20.320]  public which federal courts just ruled and state courts and this rule the last
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:24.240]  week two different courts strange two rulings one in Maryland I think one was
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:30.160]  in Illinois that the police can no longer arrest you for filming them in
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:38.440]  public well by the same token then you can't stop them filming you and my
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:43.960]  issue is that that'll make them behave better I'm not against cameras out in
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:49.680]  public if we have them as well what I don't like is in privacy them spying on
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:54.680]  our phones our Twitter our Facebook our emails reading everything tracking us
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:35:00.960]  and then using that data to corner financial markets that's the essence of
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:06.720]  illegal spying wiretapping anyone could ever go out in the public's square and
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:11.200]  see what people are doing see what they're saying and in my experience the
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:15.920]  system does not like cameras pointed back at them
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:21.320]  now I don't like the fact that there is a total control grid of license plate
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.760]  readers and that there are cameras up at every street corner tracking where you
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:30.320]  go because there's no probable cause and you're being tracked as if you're a
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:36.640]  criminal that is wrong the total control grid under common law and common sense is
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:42.320]  designed to abuse people and tax people's mobility which is an ancient
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:47.920]  form of oppression so you I want to be clear they're conflating it that oh my
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:56.300]  gosh the police are wearing cameras well I've got a camera too so you've got
[02:35:56.300 --> 02:36:01.120]  yours and I've got mine and I didn't see any problems with the Austin police when
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:04.480]  we went down for the open carry March to carry and accrued to the great job
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:10.600]  Wednesday and Saturday those videos are up on that for worse.com and the
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:13.400]  Austin police we talked to were like we're pro second amendment right keep
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:16.360]  their arms you have a right to March open March and we also support straight
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:24.200]  preachers in the first amendment and people online are like wow man that cop
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:28.560]  talk to you was nice yeah that's how they're supposed to act and that's how
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:31.560]  I'd want to be if I was a cop or anybody else I want to treat people like I want
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:38.040]  to be treated you know we all go overboard the police get emotional
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:41.280]  sometimes as well and you know I was up in Dallas and the police were being
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:44.080]  pretty nice the fellow reserve and they sent this cheerleader style woman over
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.240]  to tell me I couldn't be out there demonstrating and I started screaming at
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.560]  her so they sent the riot police but by the time they got there we'd left an
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:56.240]  hour later really was screaming those cops but you know what I don't apologize
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:00.960]  for it because I was real nice till this woman shows up and says you don't
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.600]  have free speech in Dallas so we have an ordinance lady your ordinance is toilet
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:13.320]  paper just like some ordinance against wiretapping in in in in Maryland some
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:17.240]  state law saying video and cops in public's wiretapping no it's not and
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:22.720]  you know it's not and you know my political speech is protected when I'm
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:30.760]  on a sidewalk not blocking the road bullhorning the Federal Reserve so see I
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:34.400]  say I shouldn't have blown up at it like that but I starts making me mad that is
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:39.200]  treading on me if we all don't get so upset folks we've gotten the position we
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:46.400]  are because we lay down like a doormat a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:51.840]  and I physically get upset by people wanting to dominate me because I'm
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:56.640]  free folks Americans were always some of the freest people compared to other
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:02.680]  nations because Americans would rather kill than be a slave Americans would
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:07.720]  rather kill I'm gonna say that again then let somebody like them I mean people
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:11.600]  were very polite in in the old American culture not just the south that's where
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:17.640]  it got outlawed by the 1870s what do you think that is in the old westerns where
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:20.480]  we're two guys and I'm gonna go to I'm gonna go to Chris I'm gonna get to you
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.160]  Chris I'm gonna play special report and get to you what do you think that is in
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:27.320]  the old westerns where it shows the come on sheriff that you're so tough let's go
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:34.400]  outside and then they draw and shoot each other that's really what went on but
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:37.640]  it didn't happen very often like Hollywood says because people were real
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:43.280]  polite because it didn't matter who somebody was if you cheated them in
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:54.680]  business if you beat somebody's daughter up or raped her you're dead and it
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:57.920]  wasn't they finally done the histories and I'm back on all the letters and
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.160]  stuff I like my great great great grandpas and people and then reading the
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:04.200]  letters and the stuff is just there's just like safety deposit boxes full of
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:07.920]  it it sounds better than any Western stuff that was going on the stuff was
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:12.280]  having like you know had four wives you know the three would die and you have a
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:18.040]  four to have like 30 something children and like you know somebody cheated them
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:22.080]  so they went over and pistol wept them to death and then they had a trial and you
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:26.160]  know little Jerry found not guilty and you know just like just all sorts of
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:29.920]  just and then this guy did this and that guy did that and just like I mean my
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:32.960]  ancestors just I mean you know we're really nice to give the shop their back
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.360]  but if you mess with them they would kill you just instantly I mean or you're
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:43.160]  gonna do well somebody's gonna die I look at what a wimp I am compared to those
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:47.280]  people and it wasn't they were looking for trouble they were the nicest sweetest
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.640]  upright people man but they were gonna live they were gonna have kids and they
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.760]  were gonna plow and they were gonna build and they were gonna they were gonna
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:01.520]  get strong or they were gonna die trying anybody got in their way anybody
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:09.280]  tried to keep them down they were gonna kill you and if you walked into a place
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.320]  and said somebody's wife was a whore you're gonna go outside and you were
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:21.880]  gonna have a duel because if you talk the talk you got to walk the walk
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.240]  government doesn't have to do that today all this scum doesn't have to do that
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:34.840]  today you cheat somebody today most time you don't get in trouble for it but let
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:39.000]  me tell you how you get in trouble no one will do business with you I love
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.920]  people that have cheated me over the years or done stuff and then years later
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:46.280]  they go did you blackball me or something nobody will give me a job and I go no
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:50.040]  no one has to blackball someone that goes around cheating people no one has to
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:53.880]  blackball someone that goes around lying about people people see that type of
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:59.920]  stuff and they don't want to associate with you and then people see folks that
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:06.840]  don't kiss and tell about things that are going on good things people that
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:10.680]  don't cheat people that don't steal people that want to be honorable that's
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:15.920]  the real society and let me tell you that society is still what's making the
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:18.800]  West run and operate even though there's a corrupt society above it and
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:25.200]  below it and it's that society that's got this country still operating and
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.400]  still running and the professionals out there in every walk of life that are
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:32.840]  honorable because their daddy was honorable and because their mama was
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:37.000]  honorable and they wouldn't think about doing something bad or cheating to
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.280]  somebody or hurting somebody because it feels bad to them but also because the
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:47.000]  what would their grandma think even though she's dead now the establishment
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.480]  boys they call that a goody-two-shoes square they call that an idiot they call
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:57.160]  that a fool I call that civilization and that doesn't mean everybody's perfect
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:00.480]  doesn't mean you don't get mad and do things that are wrong every one of us
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:07.280]  has got our own sins our own problems but what God judges is the heart and that's
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:11.960]  why they say before you go into battle better get your heart right with God
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:20.120]  better get lined up with God and when you get lined up with God believe me you
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:27.440]  feel it you feel eternity you feel love you feel strength you feel honor but you
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.640]  also feel very ashamed that's why people calling and tell me how great I am no
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:41.000]  I'm not I I can feel the presence of God I feel ashamed at how bad I am even
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.200]  though people wouldn't look at the stuff I do you're pretty good guy man we
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:51.760]  mean doesn't matter I'm still wicked as the day is long I'm a wicked how do you
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.520]  think I know how the new order operates I've got that area my brain too we all
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.920]  do but see my good side is so much bigger than my dark side my evil side
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:10.160]  that's how I'm able to continue on just like you're able to continue on fight
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:14.280]  the good fight now speaking of mind control with the face scanners going in
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:19.440]  car manufacturers are always looking for ways to make driving safer oh like
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.520]  proximity to other vehicle systems that will tax you by the mile and now live
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:29.000]  cameras of the police and in the future dashboard of motion detectors could
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.040]  search for signs of irritation a bid to identify the first signs of road rage a
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:37.680]  prototype of the device is able to rear drivers facial expressions using tiny
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:43.560]  embedded camera and they're coming out with it and oh you're gonna get an
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:47.360]  insurance discount if you get it speaking of mind control here in we're
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:54.560]  gonna go to Chris in Carolina Robert is Robert in Ukraine oh he's in
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:58.720]  California Laura Tom and Travis and I'm gonna go to you I've been bad little
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:04.840]  hog ish with my babbling I need my inane in amongst the inane babbling they
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:10.360]  could make out two words hobbit and shire it's kind of like my show but in
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:15.960]  amongst the inane babblings there is some information there let's go ahead and
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:19.360]  go to this report by David Knight on mind control here it is used to be that
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.160]  your privacy was invaded by people breaking into your home listening to
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:27.920]  your phone calls opening your mail but technology has made it far easier for
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.840]  criminals and governments to invade your privacy as a matter of fact you could
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:37.480]  argue that metadata is far more dangerous than just listening to people's
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:41.680]  phone calls or opening their emails info wars has been warning you about this
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:46.000]  for a long time here's just one article from four years ago where we told you
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.320]  about Google's cozy relationship with the CIA joining with them in an internet
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:55.000]  monitoring project that would scour Twitter accounts blogs and websites and
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.520]  be used to quote predict the future Google's venture capital firm and the
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:06.040]  CIA's in cutel invested $10 million into a company called recorded future using
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:10.520]  metadata Google and the government can predict not only societal trends but
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:15.200]  individual action knowing better than you do where you will likely be at a
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:20.480]  certain time that's being done with metadata not with your phone calls or
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:24.600]  your email but now the surveillance state gets far more intrusive and sinister
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:28.520]  not content to invade your home your mail your computer the government has
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:34.040]  been working for decades on ways to invade your mind monitoring your thoughts
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:39.800]  controlling your actions even implanting or changing your memories and info wars
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:42.960]  has been pointing this out for a long time as well look at this article from
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:49.240]  11 years ago now if you Google it you'll easily find over 349,000 results in less
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:53.200]  than half a second and the government and its media have gone from ridiculing
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  reports of their mind control research calling you a conspiracy theorist if you
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:02.120]  report it to taking credit for it even putting a humanitarian spin on their
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:07.480]  demonic creation the mainstream media is positively giddy about the prospects of
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:12.960]  mind control and memory manipulation how will the IT revolution help change our
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.440]  minds and prove our lives are we gonna cure diseases like Alzheimer's move
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.520]  objects just by looking at them DARPA wants you to see the purpose of their
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:27.960]  research as producing a medical device for Alzheimer's or PTSD DARPA also wants
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:31.800]  you to see their militarized robots as something that will save your life in
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:35.240]  an actual disaster they want you to believe that building a robot that can
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:41.080]  run faster than a human is to save you not to hunt you down of course DARPA's
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:45.120]  evil inventions could be used for benevolent purposes but benevolent
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:49.840]  medical devices are not DARPA's mission their mission statement says that it's
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:55.960]  to overcome multifaceted threats to wield cyber as a military capability to
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:00.120]  open new operational regimes with advanced platforms and weapons and to
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:05.720]  build a strong foundation for tomorrow's military DARPA weaponizes technology
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:08.840]  they're not looking for a cure for Alzheimer's they're not even looking for
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:14.400]  a cure for PTSD they're looking for a way to weaponize mind control keep that
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:19.000]  in mind when you hear this we can actually connect the mind to a computer
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.680]  now and actually begin to quote read thoughts you can type you can issue
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:29.440]  commands and we can even photograph what you're thinking about meaning that in
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:33.080]  principle we can photograph a dream homeland securities mission isn't
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:37.440]  benevolent medical devices either as info wars reported three years ago
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:41.000]  homeland security is part of their so-called anti-terrorism mission
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.640]  developed a memory transfer system at the University of Southern California the
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:48.400]  Pentagon and homeland security pretending that their mind control programs
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:52.200]  are benevolent medical devices it's just like the thought police and the
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:57.280]  interrogators from the novel 1984 calling themselves the ministry of love
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:03.640]  homeland has a familiar ring to it and a familiar purpose who knows maybe we'll
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:08.480]  upload a vacation you never had or maybe they'll use you as a false-fly
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:15.640]  terrorist kaku even reference total recall tell us your fantasy we'll give
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:24.400]  you the memory we want to be the crime fighter or world-class athlete our secret
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:31.320]  just happy trails man what happens if our criminal justice system comes up
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:35.680]  against the fact that memories eyewitness accounts cannot be trusted
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:39.280]  anymore finally kaku talked about another aspect of brain control besides
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:44.040]  selectively removing memories or implanting new fictional memories and
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:47.920]  for wars has been covering for a long time the dream of Ray Kurzweil now
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:52.200]  director of engineering at Google and of others that they will transfer their
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:55.520]  consciousness into machines that they will merge with machines and what they
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:01.160]  call the singularity so professor are we going to be able to live forever
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:05.640]  store memories well president Barack Obama and the European Union are gonna
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:11.000]  dump a billion dollars that's billion with a B not an M to the brain project
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.920]  so that we're gonna create basically a disc with all your neural patterns maybe
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:18.640]  your memories and thoughts and desires on it the short-term goal is to cure
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.600]  mental illness one of the great scourges of the human race but long term if you
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:29.280]  die in some sense your genome and your connect home will live on forever the
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.840]  real singularity is the merging of global corporations with global
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:37.360]  government in order to enslave you you've already seen a huge upswing in
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:40.880]  prosperity because of the it revolution that's kind of things that you're
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:45.440]  talking about though sound like they could expand our economy improve our
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:49.800]  lives they see you as lab rats they will offer you some temporary beneficial
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:54.740]  benefits in order to get you to accept their brain and memory technology but
[02:49:54.740 --> 02:50:01.080]  it will be the instruments of your enslavement excellent report by David

[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:19.120]  but please understand that this could all be neutral and then we could decide
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.760]  whether we wanted to change ourselves give up our humanity and become
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:28.960]  something different they are not making it voluntary they intend to make it
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:34.320]  mandatory and are facing an end right now just like the illegal spying just
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.640]  like the forced medication with the fluoride in the water they think it's
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:44.720]  funny and they will end up being destroyed in it as well the funny thing
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:47.720]  about some of the top eugenicists in this country if you go back to the 1920s
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:52.120]  and 30s is most of them ended up being an insane asylums and ended up being
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:58.440]  mentally ill or committing suicide I'm not saying all those psychologists and
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:03.200]  people were eugenicists Sigmund Freud said that a fear of weapons shows a
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:09.760]  gross immaturity and childishness give me the exact quote Sigmund Freud on fear
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:14.360]  of weapons type that in guys I want to give the exact quote because I saw that
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:18.880]  years ago and then I was doing research last night late last night and came back
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:23.960]  across it on an official psychology site with a bunch of other quotes but
[02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:28.600]  that's true I mean it shows if you have a fear of like a butcher knife or somebody
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:32.240]  pulls out a bush and you're cutting carrots or something or a fear of a gun
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:36.360]  or whatever it really does show a childishness all we're finding that

[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:34.000]  the air thanks for holding yes sir I was wanting to go at the angle of you know
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:43.160]  your movie in game yes sir okay you have said many times that the globalist the
[02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:50.720]  two main issues are China and Russia all right what if they're occupying China
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:57.240]  what if they're starting this war with Russia the nukes are missing all right you
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:53:03.400]  got the commanders and everything else within the military being purged all at
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:07.600]  the same time they're rolling out all of the stuff like you were saying they've
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:13.960]  also killed the bankers and they have also disappeared a bunch of tech guys
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:19.160]  who have created a lot of this technology you tell me what you think this war is
[02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:24.920]  about well again you said it the globalists are above the countries not
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:28.520]  totally controlling them but playing them off against each other while they
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:33.680]  transfer the governmental authority to unelected private corporate boards and
[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:36.280]  then once that's in place Katie bar the door we've already seen what they've
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:40.920]  done in terrible countries so it's just a the conflict they'll make trillions off
[02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:46.160]  of and you know Putin won't mind it because he'll get to become stronger and
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:50.600]  become a hero because he's challenging the West that's why we keep having war
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:54.680]  and keep having death and keep having our real progress destroyed because
[02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:59.840]  governments do the same tricks over and over again because they work
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:09.920]  you have these Russian sleeper people okay then you have NATO who Obama has
[02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:16.480]  given our military to all right they're saying NATO strikes which is would
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:25.960]  basically be us okay I mean it's all right what exactly are you getting at
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:33.360]  I think this is more or less yeah it's a money-making thing like you were saying
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:37.960]  you crane has more than just make money the global's have unlimited money they
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:44.120]  do it to transfer wealth and destroy it out of the economy Russia and the
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:48.600]  Ukraine are some of the stronger countries but if you can break them down
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:52.920]  then what do you have no that's it bankrupt them no I totally agree I
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:56.200]  appreciate your call that that's what's going on have an arms race within the
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:00.280]  brakes them just like they have with the Soviet Union except now America's
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:04.360]  totally run by globalists so it's not America doing this to Russia it is
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:08.960]  literally the same people that are ruining our lives doing and so the
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:12.080]  American people and the Russian people are in the same boat is what I keep
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:16.800]  trying to get at Robert in California go ahead you're on the air
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:22.520]  obviously from California California I don't know if I used to see the
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:25.760]  information of the producer for a TV show called hardcop if you remember that
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:31.880]  one yes anyway the biggest thing that you've done some simple words was
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:35.760]  basically your Pierce Morgan thing I'm going to now get the next stage for the
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:39.680]  next level of your show to progress on to TV we could probably get you on
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.320]  satellite on direct TV you can use the same advertisers so you'd be worldwide
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:47.720]  with your broadcast through satellite the information I'm giving you right now is
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:51.440]  world breaking right now they're going to test the UN's going to test out the
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:55.480]  cyber teams to shut down the internet once I tell you this information and
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:59.360]  where to locate the information on the internet it reveals exactly covert
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:04.040]  operation in order to you sign up special operators from the White House
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:10.520]  Pentagon MCIA that you're saying to take away people's guns number one people
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:14.120]  who have access it's like finding the diamond in a rough on the sand there's
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.040]  diamonds out there in the sand but you gotta know where to look as intelligence
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:21.800]  I actually I retired I left hard copy as one of the producers for the show and
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:26.000]  now I'm a licensed private investigator yeah I've been on I've been on hard copy
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.800]  about ten times that was interesting show so didn't build rallies be on that
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:36.240]  but listen bottom line what's the information okay the information is
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:40.400]  basically it's hitting on YouTube if you go to YouTube and you have to take
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:43.680]  screenshots because it will be removed by the White House you go to YouTube you
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:48.600]  type in crisis actress Minuto's there's a lady who works for the government who
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:53.720]  is the witness from every single scene the Boston bombing she's a witness there
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:58.440]  Sandy Hook she's a witness there and four other scenarios everything you've
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:03.800]  seen is a movie maybe was filmed and then released as a real fact oh I know
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:07.880]  they got caught creating fake ATF raids of gun owners that said oh it was just a
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:11.560]  drill I mean look they are doing a lot of fake stuff but they also do real stuff
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:14.840]  and they mix it in with real people they're bombing and killing so that's
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:18.840]  that's important to add I believe from my investigation they hybridize the
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:24.520]  killings big man again they don't want to kill people it's that it's easier to
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:28.600]  not kill as many people to manage it but I've seen all the crisis actor stuff
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:34.960]  what's it called again and you go to crisis actor busted on YouTube and you
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:39.120]  see all the government agents and what's really bad is Obama's crying for
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:43.560]  something he knows is faked and scripted is made to be filmed no Obama wouldn't
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:49.160]  fake cry I mean you didn't build your business I appreciate your call I mean
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:53.200]  he said don't listen to people that said tyranny's always around the corner but
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:59.200]  that's not true it's already eating you you're inside tyranny's belly well again
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:03.240]  I don't know how much of that crisis actor stuff is real how much of it isn't
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:08.240]  but they clearly in some of these videos it staged blue screens all of it
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:16.280]  disappearing noses and people acting really bad actors all those folks that
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:19.640]  that you know went to all the acting classes have never got a job anywhere
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:23.640]  because the markets not big enough they finally got a job working for FEMA and
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:26.960]  actually have real crisis actor groups they go around they've got all these
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:31.040]  housewives and people that wanted to be movie stars now they all run around and
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:34.680]  go to the government bombings and stuff and all a little secret agent badges and
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:37.680]  stuff of course the government's gonna kill all you ladies later you know that
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:42.200]  right all the actors men and women you name it wouldn't want to be part of any
[02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:48.160]  of that let's do some overdrive to talk to Laura Tom and Travis Rinker come back

[02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:04.640]  planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it
[02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:10.080]  all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition

[03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:27.760]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones all right let's go Laura in
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:35.640]  Montana Laura you're on the air go ahead hi Alex thanks for having me first
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:40.760]  time I've called my husband is an engineer with ExxonMobil who is also a
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:46.440]  member of the 8911 group and I was a Bay Area as an account executive for
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:50.120]  Pacific Bell when the politicians started getting heavily involved in
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:55.280]  telecommunications and trying to learn what our capabilities were that's just a
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:00.680]  little bit of my background but I just wanted to caution you or your listeners
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:05.400]  not to just always immediately believe someone who calls into the show just
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:10.560]  because they say they come from Russia on the power you had on earlier could have
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:17.720]  been a neo-nazi-Ukrainian who wants to run Putin down I wanted to say that you
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:22.280]  had also said I mean obviously everybody knows that everybody that calls in can
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:25.080]  be making stuff up people have to gauge the validity of what they're saying for
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:29.240]  themselves yes I mean go ahead he made the allegation that Putin was a
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:33.960]  supporter of the new arm border and a supporter even of homosexuality to some
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:41.080]  extent but Putin supported the anti-homosexual propaganda law and aside
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:45.320]  from that I did want to say his approval rating as you had mentioned a
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:52.360]  couple days ago with an 85% but it's not quite true that it's because directly
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:57.480]  of the Crimean situation I read a book called the Russian populace that was
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:02:02.280]  recommended off the Lou Rockwell website written by Matthew Johnson I highly
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:07.640]  recommend it anyway I learned a lot about it and Putin's approval rating
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:12.760]  has been 80 to 85% for the past four years and one of the reasons it's so
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:19.680]  high is because Russia's economic growth rate has been increasing at 8% per year
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:26.560]  for the last four years so I think that's the correlation but and it's true
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:30.200]  the Russians are not as wealthy as Americans but their Latin life has
[03:02:30.200 --> 03:02:37.760]  improved apparently and it's still better than the Ukrainians but he also
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:42.520]  that the US and the ruling class elites that you always talk about the TFR
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:47.760]  owners hate Putin as we talked about before for several reasons his stance
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:52.560]  against him invading Syria and Iran he was against that and his
[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:59.240]  influence that he's had with Yanukovych over staying out of the EU but he also
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:05.640]  has received interest to Russia of the NGOs and we know what they do they try
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:10.320]  to destroy the unity within a country and then as you mentioned before put up
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:16.800]  their puppet oligarchs into power if they can get away with it right now we
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:22.120]  have an independent Russia task force in the CFR and that was listed all the
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:29.000]  members are listed in this book which I'd like to send to you a copy because I
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:33.160]  know you're a voracious reader it's in my call if somebody could take I'm not as
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:36.560]  voracious as I used to be I mean listen to books on tape but but yeah just send
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:40.080]  me the name of it or send me the passages photocopy them thank you so much
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:45.800]  very interesting Laura I know that guy could be a fake caller I don't think he
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:49.560]  was a fake caller I mean I think he really meant what he was saying but but I
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:53.560]  hear what you're saying let's talk to Tom in New York I don't get to Travis I'm
[03:03:53.560 --> 03:04:00.360]  sorry but go ahead Tom you're on the air yeah I've been hearing a lot of stuff
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:08.800]  about the legality of this Crimea referendum and I personally witnessed
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:14.400]  at least two similar referendums just north and Quebec some years back I
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:18.640]  can't really see any difference between the you know that's right it's been part
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:26.240]  of Russia previously and they voted 96 plus percent so I mean the fact that the
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:29.760]  euro is promoting referendums everywhere else but then saying this one's
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:35.680]  illegal it's it's it's it's pretty amazing right yeah I mean nobody made
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:40.560]  mention of the Quebec referendums in any way being illegal but it would have
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:45.000]  given those just a prevention provincial wide referendum which would have
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:48.960]  given them the right to succeed from Canada you know you set up their own
[03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:53.120]  republic or you know some other situation that fell though the globals
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:55.880]  were behind that I'm out of time brother thank you so much back tonight
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:05:15.840]  seven o'clock God bless you all you
