[00:40.120 --> 00:41.560]  I'm Robert Friedman.
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.960]  An Iranian religious leader says people protesting the outcome of the recent presidential election
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.600]  should be executed.
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.480]  Ayatollah Ahmed Katami said anyone who engaged in what he called destructive acts should
[00:54.480 --> 00:58.280]  be considered at war with God and therefore put to death.
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.920]  President Obama has condemned the crackdown against protesters as outrageous.
[01:02.920 --> 01:08.320]  North Korea is threatening to shoot down Japanese planes that intrude on North Korean airspace.
[01:08.320 --> 01:13.520]  The Pyongyang government claimed Japanese spy planes recently breached the communist
[01:13.520 --> 01:15.520]  nation's airspace.
[01:15.520 --> 01:20.840]  In time, a French news agency says North Korea may be preparing to fire more missiles.
[01:20.840 --> 01:25.800]  The U.S. has said it's prepared for the possibility that North Korea might fire a long-range missile
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.080]  toward Hawaii, possibly on the 4th of July.
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.360]  This is IRN USA Radio News.

[02:34.200 --> 02:38.680]  An interagency team is being assembled by the White House to coordinate efforts with
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.240]  other countries to sanction North Korea for a recent nuclear test.
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.360]  The Washington Post reports former Ambassador to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, will head the
[02:48.360 --> 02:49.360]  team.
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.040]  An official says the consensus is that a focused effort is needed to see that sanctions are
[02:54.040 --> 02:57.080]  implemented and the information is being shared.
[02:57.080 --> 03:01.000]  The group will include representatives from the State Department, the White House, the
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.680]  National Security Agency, and the Treasury Department.
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.080]  The Brazilian military has called off the somber search for bodies of the people on
[03:09.080 --> 03:14.040]  board an Air France jumbo jet that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month.
[03:14.040 --> 03:20.600]  All 228 people on board died when the Airbus A330 apparently broke apart in mid-air and
[03:20.600 --> 03:22.280]  plunged into the ocean.
[03:22.280 --> 03:26.520]  Only 51 of the victims have been found, and the flight data recorders have yet to be
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.520]  recovered.
[03:27.520 --> 03:56.920]  For the latest news and analysis, log on to IRNUSANews.com.
[03:57.520 --> 04:09.280]  9 people are dead after a multi-car crash involving a semi on the Will Rogers Churnpike
[04:09.280 --> 04:11.240]  near Miami, Oklahoma.
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.520]  According to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, traffic was stopped because of an earlier
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.560]  accident when the semi slammed into at least three cars.
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.000]  That caused a chain reaction that involved seven vehicles, with the semi ending up on
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.760]  top of three of the cars.
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.160]  Michael Jackson's doctor has been questioned by Los Angeles police for a second time.
[04:31.160 --> 04:36.520]  Accompanied by his lawyer, Texas cardiologist Dr. Conrad Murray was questioned by detectives
[04:36.520 --> 04:38.880]  for several hours Saturday.
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.320]  The attorney, identified as Matt Alford by TMZ.com, issued a statement through his law
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.240]  firm that said, Dr. Murray is considered to be a witness to the events surrounding Michael
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.840]  Jackson's death, and he is not a suspect.
[04:52.840 --> 04:57.560]  Police are thought to be investigating reports that Murray injected Jackson with the potent
[04:57.560 --> 05:02.280]  painkiller demoral before he collapsed and died Thursday.
[05:02.280 --> 05:08.080]  Third-seeded American Venus Williams and top-seeded Dinara Safina were the round three winners
[05:08.080 --> 05:10.160]  on day six at Wimbledon.
[05:10.160 --> 05:15.160]  Williams cruised past Spaniard Carlos Suarez Navarro, while Safina ousted unseeded Kristen
[05:15.160 --> 05:16.240]  Flipkins.
[05:16.240 --> 05:20.400]  On the men's side, two-time runner-up Andy Roddick posted a third straight, four-set
[05:20.400 --> 05:24.760]  victory as he reached the fourth round at Wimbledon's for a fifth time.
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.240]  Former champion Layton Hewitt also booked a spot in the round of 16.
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.960]  This is IRN-USA Radio News.
[05:33.960 --> 05:39.160]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight
[05:39.160 --> 05:40.280]  into our bodies.
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.280]  Take a deep breath.
[05:41.280 --> 05:47.240]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.560]  entering your lungs?
[05:48.560 --> 05:50.080]  Have a glass of water.
[05:50.080 --> 05:54.880]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other
[05:54.880 --> 05:55.880]  chemicals?
[05:55.880 --> 05:56.880]  Of course you can't.
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.640]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not
[06:00.640 --> 06:01.920]  take away from it.

[07:06.920 --> 07:09.920]  Here's Alex Jones.
[07:19.920 --> 07:25.920]  Welcome, welcome my friends and thank you so much for joining us on this live,
[07:25.920 --> 07:31.920]  June 28, 2009 Sunday edition.
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.920]  Of course I have the syndicated transmission Monday through Friday.
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.920]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave, satellite,
[07:40.920 --> 07:45.920]  number one radio show on the internet, according to Shotcast, Flycast, and many other gauges.
[07:45.920 --> 07:51.920]  And of course also Sammelcast reared on XM Radio.
[07:51.920 --> 07:56.920]  And here we are on the abbreviated Sunday transmission 4-6pm.
[07:56.920 --> 07:59.920]  Each and every Sunday come rain or shine, I am here.
[07:59.920 --> 08:03.920]  Talk about rain or shine in my car as a thermometer on the dash,
[08:03.920 --> 08:08.920]  I guess from the windshield, said it was 115 driving over here.
[08:08.920 --> 08:12.920]  Now remember that that's obviously driving on the highway
[08:12.920 --> 08:16.920]  and it's much hotter with the heat coming off the asphalt and the concrete.
[08:16.920 --> 08:19.920]  What they were saying was like 105 the other day here in Austin.
[08:19.920 --> 08:21.920]  It's only 102.
[08:21.920 --> 08:23.920]  It's always been nice though in these particular studios.
[08:23.920 --> 08:27.920]  These are nice studios, but the AC is always freeze up when it gets over 100.
[08:27.920 --> 08:32.920]  So everybody's basically got their shirts off here at the MS offices that we're syndicating out of
[08:32.920 --> 08:35.920]  in the studios of News Radio 590K, LBJ.
[08:35.920 --> 08:39.920]  I mean, Jerron Nighard literally earlier has his shirt up.
[08:39.920 --> 08:42.920]  He's standing over by the fan.
[08:42.920 --> 08:45.920]  It's the opposite of a turtle sunning itself out on a log.
[08:45.920 --> 08:47.920]  He's like trying to cool off with the fan.
[08:47.920 --> 08:51.920]  He has his shirt literally hanging it over the fan, hanging over the board
[08:51.920 --> 08:54.920]  because they have those old fashioned tube boards and all these computers
[08:54.920 --> 08:57.920]  and heat just rising off of them.
[08:57.920 --> 08:59.920]  You can almost fry eggs on them.
[08:59.920 --> 09:03.920]  Right now I've got sweat just pouring down my sides of my shirt.
[09:03.920 --> 09:07.920]  I look like I'm a Russian bus driver or something in Moscow in the middle of summer.
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.920]  But you know why I say that?
[09:10.920 --> 09:13.920]  Because still in Eastern Europe and places in Western Europe,
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.920]  a lot of them don't have AC because it hardly ever gets hot there.
[09:15.920 --> 09:18.920]  But when it does get hot, look out everybody.
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.920]  Well, like up in Chicago, every time it gets this hot in Chicago or Milwaukee,
[09:22.920 --> 09:24.920]  you hear about dozens of deaths a week.
[09:24.920 --> 09:26.920]  They're up there dying right now.
[09:26.920 --> 09:30.920]  I made a mistake of going for a jog at noon today.
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.920]  By the time I woke up and hung out with the kids and did some business,
[09:35.920 --> 09:38.920]  I looked up and I said, I got to do my daily run.
[09:38.920 --> 09:40.920]  I got to go work tonight.
[09:40.920 --> 09:42.920]  Even after the show, so I'm going to have time to jog.
[09:42.920 --> 09:43.920]  I better go do it right now.
[09:43.920 --> 09:45.920]  Big mistake.
[09:45.920 --> 09:48.920]  I got about a mile on this stuff and let me tell you,
[09:48.920 --> 09:52.920]  a little bit of a sun kissed as they say.
[09:52.920 --> 09:54.920]  So look out today.
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.920]  But I am dispensing with the pleasantries, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:59.920 --> 10:05.920]  to get into the very serious grave news and information we're going to be covering
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.920]  throughout the next well now hour and 52 minutes today.
[10:08.920 --> 10:10.920]  First off, take a lot of calls.
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.920]  The toll free number is 877-590-5525.
[10:14.920 --> 10:17.920]  877-590-5525.
[10:17.920 --> 10:20.920]  Or locally in Central Texas.
[10:20.920 --> 10:23.920]  If you're listening to us in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[10:23.920 --> 10:25.920]  Okay.
[10:25.920 --> 10:29.920]  Here's what's happening.
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.920]  Foreign offshore corporations that are bigger than most governments independently,
[10:35.920 --> 10:39.920]  but together they're bigger than any one government combined,
[10:39.920 --> 10:41.920]  of the 100 biggest economies.
[10:41.920 --> 10:45.920]  50 plus are now corporations, not governments.
[10:45.920 --> 10:49.920]  They have teamed up, lobbied governments worldwide to create international law
[10:49.920 --> 10:53.920]  that gives them unlimited power and the people absolutely know rights.
[10:53.920 --> 10:56.920]  And they're in the final phase right now of bankrupting the planet
[10:56.920 --> 10:59.920]  according to their own IMF World Bank documents by design
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.920]  so that everyone will be bankrupt and owe their allegiance to the new bank of the world
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.920]  whose fiat currency and credit is protected and backed up
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.920]  by the US military, British military, European military NATO.
[11:14.920 --> 11:17.920]  And that's it. Very, very simple.
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.920]  They are now making their move, completely breaking the back of the US Republic.
[11:22.920 --> 11:26.920]  The fall of the Republic is now happening.
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.920]  The death of the Republic, Republic's end, Republic's fall,
[11:30.920 --> 11:33.920]  the gallows for the United States is here.
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.920]  In fact, I can officially say that if they pass all the bills they've got introduced
[11:38.920 --> 11:41.920]  and then are able to implement them,
[11:41.920 --> 11:46.920]  officially the Republic will be 100% dead
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.920]  and we will be an official dictatorship of the bureaucracy
[11:51.920 --> 11:54.920]  and then the private corporations that own and control it.
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.920]  There is a total and complete carbon credit, carbon tax takeover happening.
[11:59.920 --> 12:01.920]  We'll break that down coming up.
[12:01.920 --> 12:05.920]  There is a complete absolute banking dictatorship over it all,
[12:05.920 --> 12:08.920]  openly being announced about to be passed in Congress.
[12:08.920 --> 12:12.920]  There is a complete total takeover of every square inch of the United States.
[12:12.920 --> 12:14.920]  Same laws have already been passed from the rest of the world
[12:14.920 --> 12:16.920]  because the bankers run everything,
[12:16.920 --> 12:19.920]  where all land is owned by the federal government
[12:19.920 --> 12:23.920]  and thus given to private offshore corporate interest for collateral on the debt.
[12:23.920 --> 12:27.920]  Any below ground water, all land has below ground.
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.920]  Feds can take your land, come on it without warrants, tax you, fine you, fee you.
[12:31.920 --> 12:36.920]  They've stolen most people's ranches and farms outside Austin in the mid-90s under SOS
[12:36.920 --> 12:39.920]  and then they give it to themselves and it's a crime syndicate.
[12:39.920 --> 12:43.920]  It's this on a national setting.
[12:43.920 --> 12:47.920]  So water takeover is happening right now with the Clean Water Restoration Act.
[12:47.920 --> 12:50.920]  Openly mainstream news is announcing just absolute total federalism
[12:50.920 --> 12:54.920]  every square inch everywhere, just hellish.
[12:54.920 --> 12:57.920]  Police state takeover is happening with expanded Patriot acts,
[12:57.920 --> 13:00.920]  body scanners at all the airports, scanning your neck and body,
[13:00.920 --> 13:04.920]  TSA checkpoints popping up at train stations, bus stations, highways,
[13:04.920 --> 13:07.920]  total control, warrantless wiretapping everywhere,
[13:07.920 --> 13:10.920]  openly federalizing all the state police, mainstream news,
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.920]  gun grabbing, more than 15 bills introduced to completely ban all guns.
[13:14.920 --> 13:17.920]  It allows the Attorney General to ban all guns at will.
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.920]  It's just dictatorial power.
[13:19.920 --> 13:22.920]  That's what all these bills do, the water bill, the banking bill, the carbon bill.
[13:22.920 --> 13:26.920]  It just says, our bureaucracies can do whatever they want, blank check.
[13:26.920 --> 13:30.920]  See, they've decided to just violate the whole Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[13:30.920 --> 13:33.920]  You put up with warrantless wiretapping and so now you put up a torture.
[13:33.920 --> 13:35.920]  That was the trial balloon.
[13:35.920 --> 13:38.920]  And so they said, look, these idiots will buy the thing we do.
[13:38.920 --> 13:41.920]  We can torture kids in front of their parents and they say it's good.
[13:41.920 --> 13:42.920]  They like Jack Bauer.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.920]  And they said, all right, drop the hammer on them.
[13:44.920 --> 13:45.920]  Take everything they got.
[13:45.920 --> 13:46.920]  Blow the country out.
[13:46.920 --> 13:49.920]  And they said, Zeke Heil and launch the operation.
[13:49.920 --> 13:55.920]  You're getting conquered militarily and economically in a blitzkrieg of destruction right now.
[13:55.920 --> 13:59.920]  The next three months is the most important phase in this country's entire history
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.920]  since independence was won 233 years ago.
[14:03.920 --> 14:05.920]  So the gun grab takeover is happening now.
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.920]  The total complete open border takeover is happening right now.
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.920]  Complete absolute total amnesty has been introduced.
[14:15.920 --> 14:21.920]  The healthcare total complete takeover with the government can have eugenics to control everything you do.
[14:21.920 --> 14:23.920]  All the treatment you get.
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.920]  Dashell wrote in his book and the bills say they're going to ration care.
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.920]  They said the British model where you wait 18 months for a brain tumor to be removed.
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.920]  And it's a fatal in almost every case.
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.920]  I've got Tony Blair on video in the House of Commons saying yes.
[14:36.920 --> 14:38.920]  No brain tumor surgery for you.
[14:38.920 --> 14:41.920]  So total state control.
[14:41.920 --> 14:44.920]  We're going to break down the complete takeover.
[14:44.920 --> 14:45.920]  This is your heads up.
[14:45.920 --> 14:48.920]  This is the alarm being given.
[14:48.920 --> 14:53.920]  This is raising the alarm that we are being completely taken over.
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.920]  And as you know people kept saying Alex they're not going to pass the global warming takeover bill.
[14:58.920 --> 15:00.920]  They're not going to pass the carbon tax.
[15:00.920 --> 15:04.920]  I had idiots when I made in game two and a half years ago.
[15:04.920 --> 15:07.920]  E-mailing me and calling me and saying there's no plan for carbon tax.
[15:07.920 --> 15:10.920]  Is there a carbon tax now after you saw it pass?
[15:10.920 --> 15:13.920]  You people need to stop living in denial.
[15:13.920 --> 15:22.920]  You know I was watching this morning a little bit of downfall which is from the diary of Hitler's secretary.
[15:22.920 --> 15:27.920]  Very accurate film. It's in German.
[15:27.920 --> 15:35.920]  And the denial in his bunker even as the Russians were 200 yards away pounding it with giant artillery.
[15:35.920 --> 15:42.920]  Eva Braun his wife was stumbling around saying that they were going to defeat the Russians in the U.S.
[15:42.920 --> 15:45.920]  That's what the American people are like.
[15:45.920 --> 15:48.920]  You won't admit you're losing everything.
[15:48.920 --> 15:49.920]  You won't admit you're being raped.
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.920]  You won't get angry because you don't believe in yourselves.
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.920]  Well, you better believe in yourselves because we're under assault and we don't deserve to be slaves.
[15:56.920 --> 15:57.920]  We're not Hitler.
[15:57.920 --> 16:02.920]  But it's the same kind of moronic denial or it's not your place to stand up.
[16:02.920 --> 16:05.920]  It's not your place to speak out.
[16:05.920 --> 16:08.920]  Yes, it is your place to speak out and you better.
[16:08.920 --> 16:11.920]  And listen, if you want to hear about Michael Jackson, the scumbag.
[16:11.920 --> 16:14.920]  I'll talk about him briefly when we get back and then I'm done talking about it.
[16:14.920 --> 16:24.920]  The only reason I'm going to talk about that freak, that ne'er-do-well drug addict is because it's an example of modern mind control.
[16:24.920 --> 16:27.920]  And I'll tell you what I think of Michael Jackson when we get back and then I'll get into real news.
[16:27.920 --> 16:29.920]  Not the distraction. Stay with us.
[16:32.920 --> 16:38.920]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill if you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form?
[16:38.920 --> 16:40.920]  That's exactly what you're doing.
[16:40.920 --> 16:49.920]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman. According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[16:49.920 --> 16:57.920]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.

[17:39.920 --> 17:45.920]  We're surrounded by gestures, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[17:45.920 --> 17:51.920]  Fuzzy air, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[17:51.920 --> 17:55.920]  The stimulus package is working. A bailout is coming your way.
[17:55.920 --> 18:01.920]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[18:01.920 --> 18:07.920]  Pardon me? Back to the real world. We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[18:07.920 --> 18:12.920]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you. No one else is coming to the rescue.

[18:32.920 --> 18:39.920]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.920]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[18:43.920 --> 18:50.920]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[18:50.920 --> 18:55.920]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer. Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods,

[19:05.920 --> 19:11.920]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.

[19:32.920 --> 19:41.920]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776. However, few know the importance of September 17th, 1787.
[19:41.920 --> 19:47.920]  The day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders. Unfortunately, over 200 years later,
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.920]  this sacred document is under attack, along with our beloved Republic.
[19:51.920 --> 19:55.920]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners,
[19:55.920 --> 19:58.920]  which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.
[19:58.920 --> 20:06.920]  Today, we have the Constitution Pride Flag to show our support for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Freedom, Liberty,
[20:06.920 --> 20:14.920]  and Justice for We the People of the United States. Now available at www.1787flags.com,

[20:20.920 --> 20:27.920]  www.1787flags.com, the official website of the Constitution Pride Flag.
[20:27.920 --> 20:37.920]  That's www.1787flags.com.
[20:58.920 --> 21:02.920]  Goin' down!
[21:15.920 --> 21:17.920]  Party time!
[21:17.920 --> 21:28.920]  Shootin' up those opiates!
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.920]  That's enough for Mr. Jackson.
[21:31.920 --> 21:36.920]  Look, I don't usually talk about celebrity deaths. I'm real sad, Ferris Fawcett died. I liked her.
[21:36.920 --> 21:40.920]  I liked Ed McMahon, classy guy.
[21:40.920 --> 21:43.920]  Bob Chetman was telling me off very how he knew Ed McMahon. That was a pretty interesting story.
[21:43.920 --> 21:50.920]  But the point is, I'm not going to spend any more time on this than need be.
[21:50.920 --> 21:57.920]  I'm going to move into the serious issues in just a moment, but this is the same Michael Jackson everybody's defending
[21:57.920 --> 22:03.920]  and they have him on the cover of every newspaper and magazine saying the king of rock and roll, the king of pop.
[22:03.920 --> 22:09.920]  Oh, we love you and people crying and candlelight vigils. This is disgusting.
[22:09.920 --> 22:15.920]  This is a freak who would hang babies off of buildings threatening to basically drop them.
[22:15.920 --> 22:24.920]  This is a guy that had a Neverland ranch to lure kids and then had high security motion sensors and locks on his bedroom door
[22:24.920 --> 22:31.920]  and who would give the children the Jesus of juice. All those recordings of him getting them all drunk and making them pass out.
[22:31.920 --> 22:38.920]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, he may have been able to pay off people $10 million here, $5 million there to shut up,
[22:38.920 --> 22:47.920]  but I am tired of Michael Jackson assaulting my psyche and having to look at the bat creature, the vampire on television.
[22:47.920 --> 22:51.920]  I am sick of it.
[22:51.920 --> 22:59.920]  And I'm even more sick of a bunch of emails I got people angry at me that I was talking about how the guy was a piece of garbage
[22:59.920 --> 23:03.920]  and how I don't want to hear about him.
[23:03.920 --> 23:09.920]  What is wrong with you people? Do you forget how disgraced this freakazoid is?
[23:09.920 --> 23:12.920]  And now they're comparing him to Elvis?
[23:12.920 --> 23:16.920]  No comparison, though both of them did die after taking injections.
[23:16.920 --> 23:22.920]  He was taking a synthetic form of opium, of morphine,
[23:22.920 --> 23:26.920]  and now they're saying newspapers are reporting a bunch of other drugs in his system.
[23:26.920 --> 23:32.920]  I mean, obviously, you could look at the guy so stoned out of his mind most of the time he had to be in a wheelchair.
[23:32.920 --> 23:34.920]  I mean, just a complete zombie.
[23:34.920 --> 23:39.920]  And look, I actually at a certain level feel sorry for Michael Jackson
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.920]  because you'd see photos of him with his nose kind of flapping in the wind, literally.
[23:44.920 --> 23:53.920]  And having to have like little stints on it just to hold it on because he didn't like his natural good looks.
[23:53.920 --> 23:56.920]  He didn't like his black skin.
[23:56.920 --> 24:03.920]  He didn't like who he was so he took all these skin bleachers and all these surgeries.
[24:03.920 --> 24:08.920]  And it's what our culture is sick with is Madison Avenue makes you feel inadequate
[24:08.920 --> 24:16.920]  so they can sell you all their products, sell you their political ideologies, sell you their ideas.
[24:16.920 --> 24:21.920]  And so Michael Jackson is another example of what fame and fortune does to most people.
[24:21.920 --> 24:30.920]  When you're buying in to bling and money just for the sake of it.
[24:30.920 --> 24:38.920]  I know a lot of high powered Hollywood people and they are happy and empowered and well centered
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.920]  and hate fame and don't like the money and just use their money and fortune and fame to be left alone.
[24:44.920 --> 24:51.920]  They talk about those in Hollywood that do like the fame and fortune and how they are always destroyed.
[24:51.920 --> 24:53.920]  It is not fun.
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.920]  So women out there that think your butt's too big, your waist is too big,
[24:57.920 --> 25:01.920]  stop feeling inadequate, stop listening to the establishment.
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.920]  Make you feel inadequate so you don't respect yourself so you'll be an insecure person
[25:05.920 --> 25:11.920]  that can be manipulated by the media and the culture, a culture of death by design to make you weak.
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.920]  Public policy to break down the family, break down society.
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.920]  Nine times out of ten in surveys to deal with women they say, why do you leave your husband or why do you start fights with him?
[25:20.920 --> 25:26.920]  Oh, because I think I'm ugly and he doesn't empower me and I'm bored and my life isn't good and I'm a princess.
[25:26.920 --> 25:28.920]  You're not supposed to be a princess.
[25:28.920 --> 25:32.920]  You're supposed to live on this planet and help other people and build something
[25:32.920 --> 25:39.920]  and leave it a better planet when you die than when you first got here.
[25:39.920 --> 25:41.920]  Same thing for men.
[25:41.920 --> 25:47.920]  Men think their whole life's supposed to be about partying and enjoyment and lots of sex and lots of women and no responsibility.
[25:47.920 --> 25:50.920]  And we wonder why everything's falling apart.
[25:50.920 --> 25:52.920]  This planet's been a hard planet to live on.
[25:52.920 --> 25:59.920]  Our ancestors had to fight with every ounce of energy they had just to survive and then to build civilizations.
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.920]  And as soon as they built the civilization and our numbers grew, then we had to fight with each other
[26:04.920 --> 26:07.920]  for different powerful groups always trying to enslave us.
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.920]  And now in the modern day we've been convinced by Madison Avenue and the mainstream media
[26:12.920 --> 26:19.920]  and the map makers of the mind, the political controllers, the engineers of society and our psyches
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.920]  that, oh, don't be involved, don't have responsibilities, be a big kid for your whole life.
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.920]  Don't be involved, let the establishment, let the experts run things.
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.920]  Just accept the way the world's set up around you like it's a rat maze.
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.920]  Don't ever try to change the world around you.
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.920]  Don't ever try to leave your mark in any way. Just regurgitate and conform into these little boxes
[26:38.920 --> 26:42.920]  and then be scared to death to ever get out of that little comfort zone bubble.
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.920]  Don't ever talk about politics or don't ever say anything that might be strange to your neighbor
[26:47.920 --> 26:51.920]  and, oh my God, if your neighbor's a little strange and never talk to them.
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.920]  So we're all isolated watching the glowing television sets at night.
[26:55.920 --> 27:01.920]  You go to a restaurant and there's TVs everywhere and your wife, your children, you, all you stop talking,
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.920]  all you do is watch the TVs or play on your iPhones.
[27:04.920 --> 27:12.920]  We're losing our humanity being sucked in to these media devices that are pre-programmed
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.920]  by the establishment with their images and their messages to distort what true human development
[27:18.920 --> 27:21.920]  and society is supposed to be all about.
[27:21.920 --> 27:25.920]  People say, well, you're on the media, you're on the internet, you make films, you're on the radio.
[27:25.920 --> 27:32.920]  Absolutely. And I make those films and I explain that this is kind of a culture jamming
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.920]  or that I'm going in there trying to warn people and wake them up using the establishment's own medium.
[27:38.920 --> 27:42.920]  And I will go further that all the major studies that we've sourced and cited here
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.920]  show that reading actually increases your IQ and your critical thinking.
[27:47.920 --> 27:49.920]  And so does listening to radio. And why is that?
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.920]  Because with reading, your brain has to interpret the symbols and then reconstruct them in your mind
[27:55.920 --> 27:59.920]  and create a three-dimensional hologram to image.
[27:59.920 --> 28:01.920]  If I say yellow bicycle, you see yellow bicycle.
[28:01.920 --> 28:04.920]  If I say Marilyn Monroe, you see Marilyn Monroe.
[28:04.920 --> 28:09.920]  If I say Gulfstream jet, your brain has to then analyze for a few seconds and pull up a Gulfstream jet.
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.920]  If I say NFL, then you have to conjure up NFL.
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.920]  If I say Roger Stalbach, you've got to conjure up Roger Stalbach.
[28:19.920 --> 28:23.920]  But if you're watching TV, it's all done for you.
[28:23.920 --> 28:26.920]  So with reading and radio, you have to develop it.
[28:26.920 --> 28:28.920]  All the studies, Google it.
[28:28.920 --> 28:30.920]  Studies show radio and reading increase IQ.
[28:30.920 --> 28:36.920]  And you will see the government universities own studies and they know that.
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.920]  That's all people that read books and magazines and even newspapers make more money.
[28:41.920 --> 28:44.920]  They have higher IQs. They're more fulfilled. They're more happy.
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.920]  They're radio. Talk radio listeners.
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.920]  They're not perfect, but statistically they have higher IQs, higher education.
[28:53.920 --> 28:55.920]  They're more fulfilled.
[28:55.920 --> 28:58.920]  You see, we're always here fighting with the mainstream media,
[28:58.920 --> 29:00.920]  which has all its lies and disinformation in it.
[29:00.920 --> 29:03.920]  And talk radio and prints got in it too.
[29:03.920 --> 29:06.920]  But think about how most of the public doesn't even read the newspaper.
[29:06.920 --> 29:08.920]  They don't even watch the news.
[29:08.920 --> 29:12.920]  If they do, it's for five minutes when somebody like Michael Jackson dies.
[29:12.920 --> 29:15.920]  It's a diversion. It's a distraction.
[29:15.920 --> 29:19.920]  Don't let that guy enter into your psyche as an archetype and take over your mind.
[29:19.920 --> 29:24.920]  Push that boy who had a poor, pathetic life out of your mind
[29:24.920 --> 29:29.920]  and move on to real issues like total tyranny coming down on you and your family.
[29:29.920 --> 29:31.920]  Break your mental chains.
[29:31.920 --> 29:33.920]  We'll be right back with key analysis and math.
[29:33.920 --> 29:36.920]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals
[29:36.920 --> 29:38.920]  necessary to maintain good health,
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.920]  with so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy
[29:42.920 --> 29:44.920]  can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[29:44.920 --> 29:45.920]  The answer is simple.

[30:35.920 --> 30:38.920]  no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value
[30:38.920 --> 30:41.920]  of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[30:51.920 --> 30:54.920]  is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.

[31:32.920 --> 31:35.920]  You worry, if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[31:35.920 --> 31:38.920]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[31:38.920 --> 31:41.920]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants,
[31:41.920 --> 31:43.920]  remember, there's a learning curve.
[31:43.920 --> 31:45.920]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[31:45.920 --> 31:49.920]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[31:49.920 --> 31:51.920]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[31:51.920 --> 31:54.920]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[31:54.920 --> 31:57.920]  DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[31:57.920 --> 32:02.920]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[32:02.920 --> 32:06.920]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[32:06.920 --> 32:09.920]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar
[32:09.920 --> 32:12.920]  to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[32:12.920 --> 32:14.920]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[32:14.920 --> 32:16.920]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[32:16.920 --> 32:21.920]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[32:21.920 --> 32:24.920]  Start now. Knowledge is power.
[32:24.920 --> 32:53.920]  Better take action. I think a storm's coming.
[33:24.920 --> 33:33.920]  866-598-7396-866-598-7396.
[33:33.920 --> 33:39.920]  The GCN Radio Network, providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[33:39.920 --> 33:43.920]  GCN Great Talk Radio starts here.
[33:43.920 --> 33:56.920]  OK, so I want to apologize to all the listeners.
[33:56.920 --> 34:04.920]  I'm not going to talk about somebody so drugged out of their mind they couldn't walk most of the time.
[34:04.920 --> 34:12.920]  Who had all sorts of people's kids in a bed with him giving them wine.
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.920]  I'm sorry, I'm not going to talk about how great he is or how good a dancer he is or how sad it is that he's dead.
[34:18.920 --> 34:22.920]  Because the mainstream media wants to cram this down our throats.
[34:22.920 --> 34:25.920]  That circus for four hours is the press conference built up.
[34:25.920 --> 34:31.920]  And helicopters picking him up like he was Jesus rising back into heaven.
[34:31.920 --> 34:35.920]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[34:35.920 --> 34:41.920]  And I am just tired of being assaulted and assailed with images of Michael Jackson.
[34:41.920 --> 34:43.920]  I can't stand Michael Jackson.
[34:43.920 --> 34:48.920]  I remember when he was really big in the early 1980s when I was like 8, 9, 10 years old.
[34:48.920 --> 34:50.920]  I'm 35 now.
[34:50.920 --> 34:54.920]  And the neighborhood kids were running around dressed like Michael Jackson with glitter gloves on.
[34:54.920 --> 34:58.920]  And I wasn't some little kid who was hip or cool or into the cool clothes.
[34:58.920 --> 35:00.920]  I just was cool.
[35:00.920 --> 35:02.920]  And I was like, that guy is a twit.
[35:02.920 --> 35:04.920]  That guy is embarrassing.
[35:04.920 --> 35:07.920]  Your sequined glove looks stupid.
[35:07.920 --> 35:09.920]  I've never liked Michael Jackson.
[35:09.920 --> 35:11.920]  I see these full grown women at office parties.
[35:11.920 --> 35:13.920]  My parents would take me to and I was like 10.
[35:13.920 --> 35:15.920]  No, don't you just love Michael Jackson?
[35:15.920 --> 35:17.920]  And I'd go, no, and they'd get all angry.
[35:17.920 --> 35:19.920]  I mean, what is it with you freaks?
[35:19.920 --> 35:22.920]  Some kind of weirdo Michael Jackson cult?
[35:22.920 --> 35:23.920]  I don't like your cult.
[35:23.920 --> 35:27.920]  And I don't like seeing Bat Boy on the news every day.
[35:27.920 --> 35:30.920]  All right, that's it.
[35:30.920 --> 35:32.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the issue.
[35:32.920 --> 35:35.920]  The country is going to hell in a handbasket.
[35:35.920 --> 35:37.920]  I've done these sources on air.
[35:37.920 --> 35:40.920]  Google it, real inflation over 20%.
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.920]  The different brokerage firms and banks that gauge it,
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.920]  they've got it at 20.4, 20.8, 20.9.
[35:47.920 --> 35:48.920]  In fact, Google that.
[35:48.920 --> 35:50.920]  I don't want to give them an actual headline.
[35:50.920 --> 35:51.920]  I forgot to bring it.
[35:51.920 --> 35:53.920]  Just Google for everybody and print it for me during the break
[35:53.920 --> 35:55.920]  and I'll cover it next segment just because people can see.
[35:55.920 --> 35:56.920]  I don't just throw this out.
[35:56.920 --> 35:58.920]  Real inflation above 20%.
[35:58.920 --> 36:00.920]  That'll give you hundreds of headlines,
[36:00.920 --> 36:03.920]  but just print me two big mainstream headlines on that for them.
[36:03.920 --> 36:05.920]  I'll give that to them later.
[36:05.920 --> 36:08.920]  So the issue here is you got the cooked government
[36:08.920 --> 36:11.920]  with the cooked numbers telling you that it's 10%.
[36:11.920 --> 36:13.920]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's over 20,
[36:13.920 --> 36:16.920]  and every top economist I have on,
[36:16.920 --> 36:19.920]  former head of the Treasury Department,
[36:19.920 --> 36:21.920]  head of policy, former Wall Street Journal editor,
[36:21.920 --> 36:23.920]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[36:23.920 --> 36:26.920]  and all these other people, Joseph Stickles,
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.920]  Nobel Prize winner, Chief Economist, World Bank,
[36:28.920 --> 36:30.920]  they all say the same thing.
[36:30.920 --> 36:32.920]  It's at least 20%,
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.920]  and they're talking about 30% in another year.
[36:35.920 --> 36:42.920]  They're talking about 25% by early 2010.
[36:42.920 --> 36:43.920]  Can't believe I just said that.
[36:43.920 --> 36:48.920]  I can't believe 2009 is already halfway over.
[36:48.920 --> 36:53.920]  The point here is this economy is in free fall.
[36:53.920 --> 36:55.920]  The federal government is openly abolishing
[36:55.920 --> 36:57.920]  the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution
[36:57.920 --> 37:01.920]  in front of everybody's eyes.
[37:01.920 --> 37:03.920]  The left that was so upset about Bush
[37:03.920 --> 37:05.920]  and warrantless secret detention
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.920]  and warrantless wiretapping and lying about WMDs and wars,
[37:09.920 --> 37:12.920]  and everything else he was doing in the Patriot Act,
[37:12.920 --> 37:15.920]  suddenly love it when Obama's doing it.
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.920]  And after I take some calls, I'm going to go over
[37:19.920 --> 37:24.920]  the real news, the crisis, the takeover.
[37:24.920 --> 37:25.920]  This is it.
[37:25.920 --> 37:27.920]  Total complete blanket amnesty.
[37:27.920 --> 37:29.920]  Total complete carbon taxes passed.
[37:29.920 --> 37:32.920]  Now they're going to try to pass total amnesty.
[37:32.920 --> 37:36.920]  The healthcare takeover.
[37:36.920 --> 37:38.920]  The gun grab takeover.
[37:38.920 --> 37:40.920]  The police state takeover.
[37:40.920 --> 37:42.920]  The takeover of the entire United States.
[37:42.920 --> 37:44.920]  Every square inch of land being federalized
[37:44.920 --> 37:47.920]  under this Clean Water Restoration Act.
[37:47.920 --> 37:48.920]  I'm not kidding.
[37:48.920 --> 37:49.920]  I'm not exaggerating.
[37:49.920 --> 37:51.920]  Last week we had the local news people in here
[37:51.920 --> 37:53.920]  reporting on it, and the state officials
[37:53.920 --> 37:56.920]  are running around saying it's a total federal takeover.
[37:56.920 --> 37:59.920]  Read the bill.
[37:59.920 --> 38:01.920]  You know, we told you this whole global warming hype
[38:01.920 --> 38:03.920]  was about attacks, and they said, no, it's not.
[38:03.920 --> 38:05.920]  No, it's not, and then wouldn't let anybody
[38:05.920 --> 38:08.920]  read the bill until 30 minutes before
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.920]  when the minority leader, Bonner, demanded to see the bill,
[38:13.920 --> 38:16.920]  and then he did an illegal filibuster,
[38:16.920 --> 38:19.920]  because in the house only leaders can do a filibuster,
[38:19.920 --> 38:21.920]  and Waxman tried to say it was unauthorized,
[38:21.920 --> 38:23.920]  and they said, no, actually it is authorized,
[38:23.920 --> 38:25.920]  so it's not illegal, but they implied it was.
[38:25.920 --> 38:28.920]  The Senate, anybody can filibuster,
[38:28.920 --> 38:31.920]  and God knows we need one, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:31.920 --> 38:33.920]  And then he starts reading through the bill.
[38:33.920 --> 38:35.920]  It was worse than even we thought.
[38:35.920 --> 38:37.920]  Now I've had a chance to look at it.
[38:37.920 --> 38:39.920]  All 1,300 pages.
[38:39.920 --> 38:41.920]  It was over 1,500, and they pulled some out,
[38:41.920 --> 38:44.920]  added some in.
[38:44.920 --> 38:45.920]  That's right.
[38:45.920 --> 38:47.920]  The Congress wasn't allowed to read it
[38:47.920 --> 38:49.920]  until 30 minutes before, and then one copy,
[38:49.920 --> 38:52.920]  because the minority leader demanded it,
[38:52.920 --> 38:53.920]  was given to him.
[38:53.920 --> 38:55.920]  He's handed it on the floor, and he goes, okay,
[38:55.920 --> 38:57.920]  and they go, you have two minutes, and he goes,
[38:57.920 --> 38:58.920]  no, I've got to read this.
[38:58.920 --> 39:00.920]  We've got the video, the whole hour,
[39:00.920 --> 39:03.920]  where he filibustered, on infowars.com.
[39:03.920 --> 39:06.920]  Go watch it, where he's reading the stinking thing.
[39:06.920 --> 39:08.920]  I should just air that here today,
[39:08.920 --> 39:11.920]  so Americans can hear him reading from it.
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.920]  Home inspectors, everything selectively enforced.
[39:15.920 --> 39:17.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is so off the charts.
[39:17.920 --> 39:21.920]  They're saying 25 to 2,800 more per person in the country.
[39:21.920 --> 39:23.920]  That's way more than that, because it allows these
[39:23.920 --> 39:26.920]  unelected boards to do whatever they want,
[39:26.920 --> 39:29.920]  including taxing human respiration.
[39:29.920 --> 39:31.920]  Did you know you put off 2.5 pounds on average
[39:31.920 --> 39:34.920]  of carbon dioxide a day?
[39:34.920 --> 39:35.920]  It's what plants breathe.
[39:35.920 --> 39:36.920]  It's the life cycle.
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.920]  They're taxing the life cycle.
[39:38.920 --> 39:42.920]  It is the sickest, most diabolical tax ever thought of.
[39:42.920 --> 39:44.920]  So I'm going to go over the entire takeover next hour.
[39:44.920 --> 39:45.920]  In detail.
[39:45.920 --> 39:47.920]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[39:47.920 --> 39:51.920]  Barbara, in Alabama, you're on the air.
[39:51.920 --> 39:52.920]  Hello?
[39:52.920 --> 39:53.920]  Yes, go ahead.
[39:53.920 --> 39:56.920]  Okay, well, this is Scott in Washington State.
[39:56.920 --> 39:57.920]  Okay, well, they got me the phone lines wrong,
[39:57.920 --> 39:58.920]  but just go ahead, Scott.
[39:58.920 --> 39:59.920]  Okay, yeah.
[39:59.920 --> 40:01.920]  Yeah, I wanted to share with you a little bit
[40:01.920 --> 40:04.920]  of my experience when I tried to call those numbers
[40:04.920 --> 40:09.920]  that you guys gave out, telling them to say no
[40:09.920 --> 40:12.920]  on that 2454.
[40:12.920 --> 40:13.920]  Yeah, for those that don't know,
[40:13.920 --> 40:15.920]  and then they changed the bill number again last minute,
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.920]  that was the total complete, gigantic,
[40:19.920 --> 40:23.920]  thousand plus page secret bill that no one could read
[40:23.920 --> 40:25.920]  until 30 minutes before and one copy was given
[40:25.920 --> 40:27.920]  to the opposition.
[40:27.920 --> 40:31.920]  And it is, it is, it is worse than we even said.
[40:31.920 --> 40:33.920]  Total dictatorship.
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.920]  The Soviet Union wasn't this harsh over everything we do.
[40:37.920 --> 40:39.920]  And yes, tell folks what happened.
[40:39.920 --> 40:40.920]  I've been getting calls.
[40:40.920 --> 40:43.920]  Most people got laughed at when they called the Congress,
[40:43.920 --> 40:44.920]  but go ahead.
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.920]  Well, first of all, I called the switchboard in Washington
[40:48.920 --> 40:51.920]  and it asked you for your area code to type in,
[40:51.920 --> 40:52.920]  you know, who you're representative.
[40:52.920 --> 40:55.920]  I knew what it was, but I typed it in anyway.
[40:55.920 --> 40:57.920]  You should be able to talk to whoever you want, by the way,
[40:57.920 --> 40:59.920]  but now they're trying to shut people off, yeah.
[40:59.920 --> 41:02.920]  Yeah, and then it, and then it patches you through to a number.
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.920]  And then I got this, well, the number that you just called
[41:04.920 --> 41:05.920]  has been disconnected.
[41:05.920 --> 41:08.920]  So it gave me, well, it didn't route me back,
[41:08.920 --> 41:11.920]  but it gave me my local number to the local office.
[41:11.920 --> 41:12.920]  Yeah, let me be clear.
[41:12.920 --> 41:16.920]  Exactly. What they do now is they just constantly,
[41:16.920 --> 41:18.920]  because a number would be working for five minutes
[41:18.920 --> 41:19.920]  and it wouldn't be.
[41:19.920 --> 41:21.920]  They admit they have hundreds of numbers
[41:21.920 --> 41:23.920]  and they just keep flipping them back and forth.
[41:23.920 --> 41:25.920]  But I've talked to people I know who called
[41:25.920 --> 41:27.920]  who just got laughed at and hung up on.
[41:27.920 --> 41:28.920]  Go ahead.
[41:28.920 --> 41:30.920]  So anyway, so then I called the local number
[41:30.920 --> 41:33.920]  and I got ahold of one of the staffers or anyway.
[41:33.920 --> 41:35.920]  First, the guy tries to tell me,
[41:35.920 --> 41:37.920]  because I told him about the, you know,
[41:37.920 --> 41:39.920]  the hundreds of pages that were flipped in
[41:39.920 --> 41:42.920]  and the fact that it was not made available to the public.
[41:42.920 --> 41:44.920]  Well, first the guy tries to tell me, you know,
[41:44.920 --> 41:46.920]  that those reports were over-exaggerated.
[41:46.920 --> 41:47.920]  Now, stop. That's what I was about to say.
[41:47.920 --> 41:48.920]  They always lie.
[41:48.920 --> 41:51.920]  In fact, I'm surprised he just didn't say that wasn't true.
[41:51.920 --> 41:54.920]  It doesn't matter if they have the Speaker of the House
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.920]  on the podium saying,
[41:56.920 --> 41:59.920]  we're not going to give it to you.
[41:59.920 --> 42:00.920]  Yeah.
[42:00.920 --> 42:02.920]  They are lying degenerate scum.
[42:02.920 --> 42:03.920]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[42:03.920 --> 42:06.920]  And then he, well, he tried to tell me it was only 300 pages.
[42:06.920 --> 42:09.920]  Well, he was off by about a thousand pages at least.
[42:09.920 --> 42:12.920]  It's only 300 and we only slipped in 300.
[42:12.920 --> 42:13.920]  Nobody can read it.
[42:13.920 --> 42:15.920]  And I'm surprised they didn't laugh at you
[42:15.920 --> 42:17.920]  and say, sir, there's no Congress.
[42:17.920 --> 42:18.920]  You're mentally ill.
[42:18.920 --> 42:20.920]  And then he tried to tell me,
[42:20.920 --> 42:22.920]  well, they had been debating on it for weeks.
[42:22.920 --> 42:25.920]  And I told him, I said, well, according to the sources I got,
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.920]  that's not what I heard.
[42:26.920 --> 42:29.920]  And how come it hasn't been made available to the public
[42:29.920 --> 42:31.920]  if this is such a wonderful bill,
[42:31.920 --> 42:34.920]  which it wasn't my main objective.
[42:34.920 --> 42:36.920]  Well, what did he say? More lies?
[42:36.920 --> 42:37.920]  Like that.
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.920]  Well, no, he said, well, you know, I'll take that a note, you know,
[42:40.920 --> 42:42.920]  and give me your name and, you know,
[42:42.920 --> 42:45.920]  and represent out some kind of a letter or something to that.
[42:45.920 --> 42:48.920]  But, you know, I told him, I said, well, my big problem with this
[42:48.920 --> 42:50.920]  is that this is such a wonderful bill,
[42:50.920 --> 42:52.920]  then how come there's been no discussion on it?
[42:52.920 --> 42:53.920]  Yeah.
[42:53.920 --> 42:55.920]  You know, another one of Obama's lies
[42:55.920 --> 42:57.920]  that open transparency in government.
[42:57.920 --> 42:58.920]  Well, look at what Bush did.
[42:58.920 --> 43:01.920]  Look at how Bush rushed the Patriot Act through
[43:01.920 --> 43:04.920]  while the Capitol was under anthrax attack
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.920]  to where nobody could even read it.
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.920]  All these really bad bills are passed
[43:10.920 --> 43:12.920]  when they don't let people read the bill.
[43:12.920 --> 43:14.920]  So how did the conversation end quickly?
[43:14.920 --> 43:17.920]  Well, basically that what I just said,
[43:17.920 --> 43:19.920]  that he said that, you know, they take my name and number
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.920]  and that, you know, he was going to,
[43:21.920 --> 43:24.920]  the congressman was going to send out some kind of a...
[43:24.920 --> 43:26.920]  Yeah, so basically he pushed you off.
[43:26.920 --> 43:28.920]  Look, the Congress is criminal.
[43:28.920 --> 43:29.920]  They know they're criminal.
[43:29.920 --> 43:31.920]  We'll break it down when we get back.
[43:31.920 --> 44:00.920]  We'll all stay with it.

[47:31.920 --> 47:36.920]  Are you tired of searching for Great Talk Radio?
[47:36.920 --> 47:38.920]  Search no more.
[47:38.920 --> 47:42.920]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[47:42.920 --> 48:00.920]  It's very, very simple throughout history.
[48:00.920 --> 48:04.920]  You can count the free countries, the free republics, nations where the people had even bare bones rights
[48:04.920 --> 48:08.920]  to private property and liberty on one hand.
[48:08.920 --> 48:16.920]  There have been thousands of corrupt empires and nations and thuggish lords and kings
[48:16.920 --> 48:19.920]  and corrupt systems that have come and gone.
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.920]  And the minute you let government get too big and start violating any part of the
[48:24.920 --> 48:26.920]  Bill of Rights and Constitution, it's over.
[48:26.920 --> 48:27.920]  You're in tyranny.
[48:27.920 --> 48:31.920]  And they're going right down the list on record getting rid of the entire Bill of Rights,
[48:31.920 --> 48:33.920]  the entire Constitution.
[48:33.920 --> 48:36.920]  And the public doesn't know their Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.920]  They sure know all about Michael Jackson and his nose.
[48:40.920 --> 48:44.920]  They know all about Michael Jackson and his boots and little medals he liked to wear
[48:44.920 --> 48:51.920]  and the ferris wheel color at Neverland Ranch and all about Jesus juice.
[48:51.920 --> 48:52.920]  I'm sorry, folks.
[48:52.920 --> 48:54.920]  That's sick.
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.920]  And that's why we're slaves.
[48:58.920 --> 49:01.920]  We are a decadent, bloated, dumbed-down nation.
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.920]  And now we're going to get butchered like a fat hog.
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.920]  But there are tens of millions of good, wholesome people in this nation.
[49:08.920 --> 49:10.920]  And we're fighting to save the republic.
[49:10.920 --> 49:12.920]  And some of you call yourselves liberals.
[49:12.920 --> 49:13.920]  Some of you call yourselves conservatives.
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.920]  You better get rid of those terms and get back to liberty versus tyranny.
[49:17.920 --> 49:21.920]  And you better do it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:21.920 --> 49:24.920]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to break down the complete and total takeover
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.920]  that is taking place and unfolding and how we can fight back against it.
[49:30.920 --> 49:33.920]  But there is no doubt now they are making their complete move.
[49:33.920 --> 49:36.920]  This is going to be a hot revolution by the elites against the people.
[49:36.920 --> 49:40.920]  And I want to let you know what the moves are, what will happen if they win,
[49:40.920 --> 49:46.920]  and what will happen if we win in ways to defeat them.
[49:46.920 --> 49:50.920]  So let's go ahead and go to Barbara in Alabama.
[49:50.920 --> 49:53.920]  Sorry, I hit the wrong button earlier, not the guy's fault, my fault.
[49:53.920 --> 49:56.920]  Barbara in Alabama, you are on the air now.
[49:56.920 --> 49:57.920]  Hi, Alex.
[49:57.920 --> 49:58.920]  Hi.
[49:58.920 --> 50:03.920]  First, I do want to tell you we did call down there.
[50:03.920 --> 50:06.920]  We didn't get much done, get through to anybody.
[50:06.920 --> 50:11.920]  But I've got something here that I wanted to tell you about.
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.920]  I have a small business where we have a call center.
[50:17.920 --> 50:23.920]  And Friday, I received an email from a client at states beginning today.
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.920]  Your home business may be receiving calls from employees in North America
[50:28.920 --> 50:33.920]  as part of the employee H1N1 flu hotline.
[50:33.920 --> 50:38.920]  Employees will be calling to confirm whether or not their office is open for work.
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.920]  If they have additional questions, blah, blah, blah, to review.
[50:42.920 --> 50:44.920]  Here's your script.
[50:44.920 --> 50:52.920]  And predominantly, we will be getting calls from New York, Atlanta, and Chicago.
[50:52.920 --> 50:53.920]  Yep.
[50:53.920 --> 50:56.920]  And I don't know if this is anything important.
[50:56.920 --> 50:57.920]  No, it is.
[50:57.920 --> 50:58.920]  I wanted to call you.
[50:58.920 --> 50:59.920]  It is.
[50:59.920 --> 51:00.920]  And I was going to get to this next hour.
[51:00.920 --> 51:03.920]  I'll cover it in a moment.
[51:03.920 --> 51:06.920]  But first, tell folks, so you were unable to get a hold of one of the little
[51:06.920 --> 51:12.920]  snot-nosed legislative aides up there on the hill while they completely butchered
[51:12.920 --> 51:14.920]  the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[51:14.920 --> 51:18.920]  And our form of government will cease to be if the Senate passes this.
[51:18.920 --> 51:20.920]  Yes.
[51:20.920 --> 51:23.920]  And first, we got a couple of numbers.
[51:23.920 --> 51:28.920]  That was the number, you know, the numbers disconnected or this is a number is out of order.
[51:28.920 --> 51:33.920]  We've basically, we never really got through to anyone.
[51:33.920 --> 51:38.920]  I mean, I mean, we got transferred a couple of times.
[51:38.920 --> 51:40.920]  We tell people what we want.
[51:40.920 --> 51:41.920]  Yeah, let me tell you what you do.
[51:41.920 --> 51:43.920]  And we're going to post this.
[51:43.920 --> 51:45.920]  You got to call their local office.
[51:45.920 --> 51:49.920]  That's the one you got to hammer up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[51:49.920 --> 51:56.920]  I posted Friday a list of their local numbers and so call your local congressman.
[51:56.920 --> 52:02.920]  But the main, and I appreciate your call, the main people to call are the eight Republicans that voted for it.
[52:02.920 --> 52:09.920]  We have a list of them upon infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now because they have a motion to reconsider.
[52:09.920 --> 52:13.920]  There is three days we have a defector clock up there on the site.
[52:13.920 --> 52:16.920]  Let me just go to it.
[52:16.920 --> 52:23.920]  Oh, the passcode just launched on this useless computer up here that relaunch every five minutes when you try to go to them up on infowars.com.
[52:23.920 --> 52:30.920]  I have a clock counting down for the motion to reconsider where those individuals have five days.
[52:30.920 --> 52:37.920]  And again, that runs out in three days to go back into the house of representatives and reconsider their vote.
[52:37.920 --> 52:42.920]  So those eight Republicans and those are the eight that helped it pass do that.
[52:42.920 --> 52:54.920]  We can't have seven because if seven, if we have seven that do it, then the vice president will be able to tie break and the motion will still carry.
[52:54.920 --> 52:58.920]  Because people are saying, well, they're going to try to beat the bill on the Senate.
[52:58.920 --> 53:03.920]  The criminals in the Senate, and by the way, it's criminal that they wouldn't let the American people read that bill.
[53:03.920 --> 53:07.920]  It's criminal that they added hundreds and hundreds of pages last minute.
[53:07.920 --> 53:12.920]  And when you read what's in it, it's even more criminal. And again, that's coming up next hour.
[53:12.920 --> 53:23.920]  Let me scroll down here into this story.
[53:23.920 --> 53:27.920]  I know my dad's calling me right now while I'm on air. I forgot to turn my phone off.
[53:27.920 --> 53:31.920]  It's a complete circus up here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:31.920 --> 53:38.920]  Here it is. Cap and trade traders can change vote by July 2nd is the headline.
[53:38.920 --> 53:45.920]  And we have a countdown clock three days, seven hours, six minutes, 48 seconds to beat that.
[53:45.920 --> 53:48.920]  And all their phone numbers and details are right there.
[53:48.920 --> 53:50.920]  And you can also call Democrats that voted for it.
[53:50.920 --> 53:57.920]  They are Mary Bono Mack, Republican, California, Mike Castle, Delaware, Republican.
[53:57.920 --> 54:07.920]  Mark Steven Erk, Republican, Illinois, Leonard Lance, Republican, New Jersey, Frank Lowe,
[54:07.920 --> 54:14.920]  Bonondo, Republican, New Jersey, John McHugh, Republican, New York, Dave Reich, Erk, Republican,
[54:14.920 --> 54:18.920]  Washington state, Chris Smith, Republican, New Jersey.
[54:18.920 --> 54:24.920]  We have the motion to reconsider House rules up there and we have links to it again up on infowars.com.
[54:24.920 --> 54:29.920]  And I was going to get into that next hour, but I'll just cover it now.
[54:29.920 --> 54:41.920]  Now on the subject of the flu, if you go back two and a half months ago and all that started,
[54:41.920 --> 54:45.920]  I went on air day one and I said, we've received secret documents from the state of Texas,
[54:45.920 --> 54:49.920]  from federal meetings that had the names of the doctors and the names of the feds.
[54:49.920 --> 54:51.920]  And we posted it on infowars.com.
[54:51.920 --> 54:55.920]  And the documents said they're telling the public we're at level four.
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.920]  We're already really at level five and within 90 hours we're going to level six.
[55:00.920 --> 55:04.920]  But the public won't be told this for a while.
[55:04.920 --> 55:05.920]  You've ever.
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.920]  And this is to get the whole emergency response ready for basically a federal takeover.
[55:09.920 --> 55:11.920]  And they put it in a good light.
[55:11.920 --> 55:15.920]  And I posted it and everybody laughed at me and said, what, what in real?
[55:15.920 --> 55:19.920]  And as usual, just like the MyAC report and the DHS report and the clergy response team reports
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.920]  and the hundreds of other big stories we broke and aren't real till it's all over mainstream news.
[55:24.920 --> 55:25.920]  And then what?
[55:25.920 --> 55:28.920]  Two weeks ago they came on and said, yeah, we've really been at level six for a while
[55:28.920 --> 55:37.920]  and we're enacting level six level, which means they can quarantine under that protocol forced inoculations.
[55:37.920 --> 55:41.920]  And I read to people Friday again, the executive order.
[55:41.920 --> 55:46.920]  You can just Google forced inoculation quarantine executive order and it'll pull up.
[55:46.920 --> 55:49.920]  It's 13,600 and something.
[55:49.920 --> 55:52.920]  But the point is CBS News.
[55:52.920 --> 56:01.920]  Oh, did you guys print me those other articles about the inflation really above 20%?
[56:01.920 --> 56:02.920]  Yeah.
[56:02.920 --> 56:07.920]  And then while you're at it, print me a CBS because I know people won't do this.
[56:07.920 --> 56:08.920]  So I'm just going to print it.
[56:08.920 --> 56:09.920]  I'm not going to source something.
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.920]  And then I actually gave it Friday on air with the source, but I'm not even now going to say it without giving the sources.
[56:13.920 --> 56:16.920]  People are in denial. We got to break through their brainwashing.
[56:16.920 --> 56:18.920]  Exact headline.
[56:18.920 --> 56:27.920]  I'll just search it under flu quarantine executive order in the CBS article as the quarantine enforced inoculation.
[56:27.920 --> 56:31.920]  And you've seen them on Fox and CNN going, yeah, for your safety.
[56:31.920 --> 56:39.920]  And the big Canadian newspapers are saying in the European papers, yeah, we're getting billions of doses ready worldwide to forcibly inject you.
[56:39.920 --> 56:48.920]  And then we played a state official in Arkansas, a tape of him on the news saying, yeah, yeah, we're going to forcibly inject you.
[56:48.920 --> 56:54.920]  Now, people are saying, wait a minute, this thing's only killed maybe 20-something people worldwide.
[56:54.920 --> 56:59.920]  But US News and World Report had the headline Friday, so did USA Today.
[56:59.920 --> 57:01.920]  A million Americans have the swine flu.
[57:01.920 --> 57:02.920]  It's the end.
[57:02.920 --> 57:05.920]  That means you've contracted the virus.
[57:05.920 --> 57:07.920]  There's thousands of flu viruses floating around.
[57:07.920 --> 57:09.920]  Most of them don't even make you sick.
[57:09.920 --> 57:12.920]  But see, this thing is engineered.
[57:12.920 --> 57:14.920]  And I don't just say that.
[57:14.920 --> 57:22.920]  All these top scientists in the Canada, the US, Europe have come out and said it's clearly an engineered virus out of a laboratory.
[57:22.920 --> 57:24.920]  We told you that day one.
[57:24.920 --> 57:26.920]  Months later, they admit it.
[57:26.920 --> 57:35.920]  And then Baxter Pharmaceutical, the same people that got caught mixing live, deadly weaponized bird flu with vaccines in Europe,
[57:35.920 --> 57:39.920]  are the ones getting the contracts for the vaccine.
[57:39.920 --> 57:41.920]  Something's going on here.
[57:41.920 --> 57:42.920]  So yes, it's not real.
[57:42.920 --> 57:43.920]  It's not a real threat.
[57:43.920 --> 57:46.920]  But do they know it's going to mutate into something?
[57:46.920 --> 57:49.920]  They normally mutate into something innocuous.
[57:49.920 --> 57:53.920]  But they're saying it's going to mutate into something bad.
[57:53.920 --> 57:55.920]  I just answered my own question.
[57:55.920 --> 58:04.920]  Are they going to, during the financial collapse, during the martial law takeover, during a financial martial law takeover in the fall, which everything is pointing towards now?
[58:04.920 --> 58:10.920]  Are they going to, just like in Mexico, say stand down, stand down.
[58:10.920 --> 58:11.920]  It's for the flu.
[58:11.920 --> 58:13.920]  Fribs are on the streets for the flu.
[58:13.920 --> 58:15.920]  So the feds can grandstand as saviors.
[58:15.920 --> 58:21.920]  We're going to break it all down after the news in the next hour and go over the complete tyranny that's unfolding.

[58:59.920 --> 59:02.920]  Having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[59:02.920 --> 59:09.920]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:41.920]  My name is John DeMartino. I'm from Colorado, and I started using Andy Willoughby's three-step plan. It's extremely encouraging for me.
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:49.920]  They've given me training on exactly what to say, and I don't have to be a salesman to talk to people that are calling me.
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:57.920]  It's made me feel like, wow, let's do business. I can only conceive of growing and growing and growing now.
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:04.920]  I'm 56 years old, and I feel young. I feel renewed. I'm happy. I'm excited about my financial future.
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:13.920]  In a short amount of time, less than an hour a day, if someone wanted to, they could have a system. This is a stress-relieving business.

[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:08.920]  Michael Jackson's doctor has been questioned by Los Angeles police for a second time.
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:16.920]  Accompanied by his lawyer, Texas cardiologist Dr. Conrad Murray was questioned by detectives for several hours Saturday.
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:30.920]  The attorney, identified as Matt Alfred by TMZ.com, issued a statement through his law firm that said, Dr. Murray is considered to be a witness to the events surrounding Michael Jackson's death and he is not a suspect.
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:40.920]  Police are thought to be investigating reports that Murray injected Jackson with the potent painkiller dimmerall before he collapsed and died Thursday.

[1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:07.920]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:15.920]  Here's Alex Jones.
[1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:25.920]  As promised, I pulled up that CBS News report, one of many. DHS sets guidelines for possible swine flu quarantine.
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:34.920]  That's got the executive order 13,375 for forced inoculation, forced quarantine for those of you living in denial out there.
[1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:41.920]  Also, I was mixing up two different issues of inflation and unemployment, but both those numbers are cooked.
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:47.920]  Depending on which brokerage firm you look at and other groups that actually look at real inflation, real unemployment,
[1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:53.920]  the government numbers will tell you real unemployment's at 9.8% and they'll tell you inflation's at 6%.
[1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:58.920]  But the private firms and folks out there say that inflation, depending on what you're looking at,
[1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:04.920]  but the overall average is over 15%, and unemployment is already over 20%.
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:06.920]  So there you have it.
[1:08:06.920 --> 1:08:10.920]  The point is they are manipulating those numbers.
[1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:17.920]  The state of Michigan officially says they're at 12.5, Rhode Island 11.4, South Carolina 10.9, Oregon 10.9,
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:25.920]  California 10.6, North Carolina 10.3, Nevada 10.2, but the feds have those with an even lower unemployment.
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:28.920]  So the feds in the states don't even agree.
[1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:35.920]  Depression-era level unemployment was only over 20%, so we're now in depression level.
[1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:42.920]  And this whole carbon tax and this giant new federal power for every federal agency to, at their own will,
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:48.920]  write up new regulations with force of law to regulate all carbon.
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:58.920]  Taxes on fireplaces, outdoor heating systems like space heaters or those butane or propane tank heaters
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:06.920]  that they have outside in the winter at restaurants, taxes, what kind of light bulbs, what kind of toilets, water footprint taxes,
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:08.920]  not just your carbon footprint.
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:18.920]  I'm going to go over that coming up because the House of Representatives passed this without letting the Congress read the bill.
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:23.920]  I mean, it just gets more and more incredible by the minute, so that is coming up.
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:30.920]  And then I want to go over the total takeover, the carbon takeover, the banking takeover, the water takeover,
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:37.920]  the police state takeover, the gun grab takeover, the attack on free speech, that takeover that's happening.
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:47.920]  The House has passed the hate crimes bill and slipped in similar language, similar language
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:53.920]  to the cyber bullying act saying if the government decides what a talk show host or somebody on the Internet says
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:59.920]  might have hurt someone's feelings or encouraged someone to carry out violence, then you are held responsible.
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:03.920]  Thought crime into the First Amendment, it's passed the House.
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:05.920]  Folks, it's all happening.
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:09.920]  They got bills to outright ban almost every gun out there, introduced racing through the House.
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:14.920]  They got bills for the federal government to give all its power over the private federal reserve to control anything that, quote,
[1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:17.920]  affects the economy from a restaurant to a car dealership.
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:19.920]  It's all happening.
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:21.920]  I am speechless.
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:26.920]  And the public's going through this like it's a dream, like it's not happening, or like the government's going to fix it
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:27.920]  and make it all go away.
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:28.920]  No.
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:30.920]  Offshore corporations are going to suck us dry.
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:32.920]  All right, let's go to a bunch of calls quickly.
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:33.920]  Make your point.
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:36.920]  I'm moving to the next person because I've got to get into all this, but also want to hear from you.
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  George in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:39.920]  Welcome.
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:41.920]  How are you doing, Alex?
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:42.920]  Good, sir.
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:43.920]  You're on the air.
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:44.920]  Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:46.920]  Well, that's that's hate crime right there.
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:47.920]  But go ahead.
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:48.920]  Yes.
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:54.920]  You know, the thing is, I'm going to start a little project because, you know, with the bankers, with the Federal Reserve System and the IRS,
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:11:00.920]  I mean, we pretty much rattled those institutions, but I'm going after the U.S. Senate because of the 17th Amendment,
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:03.920]  because I really see them as the gatekeepers for the bankers.
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:04.920]  That's right.
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:09.920]  Until 1913, the private IRS took over, the private Federal Reserve took over, the IRS collects for them,
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:15.920]  and before the state legislatures would vote and appoint the senator, so the senator was a creature of the state.
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:18.920]  And that's another huge reversal of liberty.
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:20.920]  We need to repeal the 17th Amendment.
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:21.920]  Very well said.
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:26.920]  Well, I really think we've got to pressure our legislatures to pressure our U.S. senators,
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:31.920]  either by grand juries or recalling them because each U.S. senators are entrenched in it.
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:35.920]  They are openly bought and paid for by offshore banks, openly paid for.
[1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:44.920]  They've had the head Democratic senator and the head Democratic congressman have openly said in Politico and ABC News
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:47.920]  that the foreign banks, quote, rule America.
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:49.920]  Banks, in fact, Google that.
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:52.920]  I want to, and I want you to come on there with a headline, Jarron.
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:55.920]  Top Democrats say banks rule America.
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:59.920]  I know there's a Politico, ABC News, and a bunch of others, but I want the people to hear it.
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:01.920]  I'm not just saying this.
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:07.920]  There's been a corporate coup d'etat, Northcom openly says they're setting up martial law.
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:13.920]  The head of the Naval War College, Thomas Barnett, goes on C-SPAN and says the military works for Wall Street.
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:14.920]  We've been conquered.
[1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:22.920]  They want your private property, brace for a bunch of made-off type SNL scammers to take everything you got
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:25.920]  backed up with paramilitary forces that are brainwashed.
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:27.920]  Heaven, help us.
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:29.920]  The cops are ready to eat their own guts and ask for seconds.
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:31.920]  They're paramilitary.
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:33.920]  They're ready to wage war on us.
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:35.920]  They're no longer peace officers.
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:37.920]  We're getting hit and hit hard.
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:38.920]  They're not going to stop.
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:39.920]  This is only the beginning.
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.920]  And the average cop in bad, they're part of a sicko system.
[1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:43.920]  The whole country's going to hell.
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:45.920]  The public's a bunch of jellyfish.
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:47.920]  Just Heaven, help us.
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:50.920]  Cops are basically cutting off your own nose despite your face.
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:52.920]  You need to understand you're part of tyranny.
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:53.920]  So are all you bureaucrats.
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.920]  But people call in going, I don't have a choice.
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:57.920]  It's the only job I got.
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:12:59.920]  I'm going to tell you about it later.
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:00.920]  Let's go over to more calls.
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:02.920]  Let's talk to Paul in Australia.
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.920]  Paul in Australia, you're on the air.
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:05.920]  Then Garrett and others.
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:06.920]  Go ahead, Paul.
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:07.920]  Hi, Alex.
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:08.920]  How are you doing, mate?
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:09.920]  Good.
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:10.920]  You've got the climate cops there as well.
[1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.920]  They're hitting you and they already took your guns.
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:13.920]  Oh, it's true.
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:15.920]  In the guy from Tasmania, you know,
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:17.920]  it shut up just a couple of people and it's like,
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:19.920]  oh, well, we're going to take everybody's gun.
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:20.920]  Now, first try it.
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:23.920]  And they're taking your private property and carbon tax in you.
[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:25.920]  How do you like it?
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:27.920]  Not too well.
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:29.920]  Not too well.
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:32.920]  What's on your mind today from the land down under?
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:33.920]  Yes, Alex.
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:35.920]  I was wondering about the color.
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:38.920]  It's a little bit old, but the color bind shooting.
[1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:41.920]  I've been trying to find a documentary and I can't recall if you've ever made one.
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:47.920]  I was doing a Wikipedia search on you and I couldn't find a color bind documentary.
[1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:49.920]  I haven't made a film on Columbine,
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:52.920]  but I have a short blurb in my film Road to Tyranny.
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:55.920]  Rocky Mountain Daily News.
[1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:59.920]  The Denver Post reported that police shot at least three of the children inside.
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:02.920]  All the witnesses said there were four men in black uniforms.
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:08.920]  They're planting, what is it, 126 giant propane bombs.
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:10.920]  The school was more than half empty.
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:15.920]  Harris and Clybold's parents both worked for secret projects in black ops.
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:19.920]  When they showed up at the school, bombs were already detonating.
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:21.920]  It was a total black op inside job.
[1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:23.920]  Just like the Russians have been caught,
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:26.920]  they'll go in and shoot a bunch of people in the building.
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:28.920]  The special forces pull out the back.
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:30.920]  Special forces out front fire into the building.
[1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:33.920]  And then all the kids know is men in black uniforms were there shooting them.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.920]  Then that's used as a way to crack down on Chechny in that case.
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:41.920]  The theater siege in Moscow was staged as well.
[1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:43.920]  This is how they do it.
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:48.920]  I watched you for the first time ever the Waco documentary you made.
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:52.920]  Yes, Delta Force slaughtering everybody.
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:54.920]  Exactly.
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:56.920]  And it reminds me exactly what just happened.
[1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:58.920]  I mean, not just what happened, but like in Calabine.
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:01.920]  It seems like the exact same type of people.
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:03.920]  Yeah, the feds go in and shoot and kill everybody.
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:06.920]  On video, on flare, shooting everybody as they try to run.
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:08.920]  Tanks running over people's bodies.
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:12.920]  And they tell the slaves on TV that they all killed themselves.
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:13.920]  Exactly.
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:14.920]  Oh, thank you very much.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.920]  By the way, it came out in Congress.
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.920]  The Delta Force admits they went in and slaughtered everybody.
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:21.920]  My goodness.
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:24.920]  Yeah, the head of the Army right now, Shoemaker commanded it.
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:27.920]  He was the head at Fort Hood at the time.
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:30.920]  Oh, man.
[1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:34.920]  Oh, it's a wicked world.
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:36.920]  Well, I mean, if they're going to kill all those kids,
[1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:37.920]  they might as well just admit it.
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:39.920]  Anything else going on from Australia?
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:41.920]  Nah, that's a lot.
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:42.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:45.920]  Hey, I hear folks are starting to wake up to the tyranny in Australia.
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:48.920]  Yes, they are, each and every day.
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:49.920]  Well done. Keep it up.
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:50.920]  We don't have a choice.
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:52.920]  All we can do is stand up and fight.
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:55.920]  You know, as serious and as crazy as things are,
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:59.920]  the globalist can steer and manipulate society and they can dominate it,
[1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:01.920]  but they can't control everything.
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:02.920]  It's like whack-a-mole.
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:05.920]  You ever played that game at the arcade where the little moles pop up
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:07.920]  and you got the big mallet trying to knock them down?
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:11.920]  Well, as we stand up and speak out and say no to their tyranny,
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:13.920]  it's like millions of moles popping up.
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:15.920]  They can't get us all.
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:17.920]  And just, we're about to audit the Fed.
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:20.920]  The Fed panicked this week and said the whole country will shut down
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:22.920]  and they'll go bankrupt if we audit them
[1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:24.920]  because they admittedly have stolen trillions.
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:26.920]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:28.920]  with more calls from around the country and the world,
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:31.920]  and I'll break down the total globalist takeover.
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:59.920]  Stay with us.
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:03.920]  We'll be right back.
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:35.920]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:39.920]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.920]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:42.920]  That's right.
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:46.920]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986,
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:49.920]  yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize
[1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:52.920]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:56.920]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:00.920]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:03.920]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:06.920]  of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:09.920]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:12.920]  call 800-686-2237.
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:14.920]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[1:18:14.920 --> 1:18:16.920]  and low return on your paper investments.
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:19.920]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:22.920]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:25.920]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:30.920]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:18:56.920 --> 1:18:58.920]  We use results.
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:01.920]  Life Change T's formula created by a PhD has been around
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:03.920]  for over 20 years.
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:06.920]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:08.920]  and not healthy.
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:11.920]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:15.920]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:20.920]  Our number is 928-308-0408.

[1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:36.920]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country,
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:39.920]  the economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures.
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:42.920]  And now, we are all at risk of being exposed
[1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:44.920]  to this new flu pandemic.
[1:19:44.920 --> 1:19:46.920]  The Center for Disease Control has declared
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:49.920]  a public health emergency across the United States.
[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:51.920]  What can you do to prepare yourself?

[1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:24.920]  Call 888-766-6066.

[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:52.920]  Thank you for watching.
[1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:02.920]  All the corruption, all the federalization,
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:05.920]  all the bureaucracy getting in your life,
[1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:07.920]  all the anti-terror systems being set up,
[1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:10.920]  they're openly admitting it's for the American people.
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:12.920]  They're openly saying they're going to bankrupt
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:14.920]  and take everything you've got.
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:17.920]  They're openly saying that there is going to be absolutely
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.920]  no freedom and no bill of rights.
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:21.920]  And all the legislation is introduced
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:27.920]  and passing every week and it's all racing through.
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:29.920]  They've passed hate crimes bill in the House,
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:33.920]  now in the Senate, which openly says there's no free speech.
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:36.920]  We have these stories linked right now up on infowars.com.
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:39.920]  With the bills, where it says no free speech,
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:41.920]  the government will arrest you.
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:43.920]  Forget fairness doctrine.
[1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:46.920]  The Cyber Bullying Act, all of it, the hate crime bill.
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:50.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is happening and it's just stunning.
[1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:53.920]  It's even shocking me at how fast it's moving.
[1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:55.920]  We have got to get mad and get angry.
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:58.920]  The system has decided to just totally rob everybody
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:00.920]  and to go ahead and set up a police state and go for broke.
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:02.920]  And we'll be just like Mexico.
[1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:04.920]  You know, don't think it can't happen here.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:05.920]  It is happening.
[1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:08.920]  And acting like chumps and living in denial
[1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:11.920]  is what is encouraging these criminals to go hog wild.
[1:22:11.920 --> 1:22:13.920]  They've also committed so many crimes,
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:16.920]  they've got to go for broke now or they know they'll get prosecuted.
[1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:18.920]  It's all a bunch of made-offs, folks,
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:23.920]  but they've got uniforms, they've got big government seals behind them.
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.920]  And God help us.
[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:27.920]  Garrett in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:28.920]  Garrett, go ahead.
[1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:30.920]  Hello, Alex. How are you doing, buddy?
[1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:33.920]  I'm doing all right, but I saw him pass a 1,300-plus page bill
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:36.920]  that nobody was allowed to read and I saw them asking the speaker,
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:37.920]  may we please read it?
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:39.920]  And I got her on video saying no.
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:41.920]  Well, Alex, I've been trying to get help,
[1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:46.920]  get through to your show this week to get a message that's on my mind.
[1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:50.920]  And this is directed to all the Joe Sixpacks out there.
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:53.920]  It's time to act now.
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:58.920]  This is a critical juncture in history, okay?
[1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:02.920]  Alex, I've been talking to you for 11 years, seems like, about.
[1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:08.920]  I've been in the Patriots' Last Militia Movement since about 2000,
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:11.920]  and I've seen it when a Democrat's in office,
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:15.920]  it's the membership and the involvement goes up
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:19.920]  and then the Republicans come in and then the people go back to sleep
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:22.920]  and they don't care anymore, but this is,
[1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:28.920]  I've been trying since the Paul campaign to break the left-right paradigm,
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:31.920]  and it's working and it's very encouraging.
[1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:36.920]  Look, one thing I've done, Alex, a lot of people have been receptive to,
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:41.920]  I wrote an eight-page Word document on basic preparations,
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:46.920]  just the simple stuff and sighted different works out there with more details,
[1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:50.920]  but people need to be getting ready.
[1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:52.920]  Money means nothing.
[1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:57.920]  If you have money now, you need to be investing in things out there,
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:01.920]  especially the yuppies out there of our generation, Alex.
[1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:04.920]  People with money in the bank need to be liquidating,
[1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:07.920]  they need to be buying weapons, they need to be buying ammunition.
[1:24:07.920 --> 1:24:09.920]  Well, you know what? People are.
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:10.920]  Oh, yeah.
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:11.920]  That's because they know.
[1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:13.920]  But listen, Obama keeps saying there's no gun bills.
[1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:16.920]  They've got bills to completely ban everything.
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:18.920]  They've got a bill, as you know, we've given the bill number out,
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:21.920]  where the attorney general could ban any or all guns at his discretion,
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:27.920]  and the attorney general has argued in federal court in the case last year in D.C.
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:30.920]  that he wants to ban all guns and no citizens can own guns,
[1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.920]  and the White House chief of staff has done it.
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:37.920]  And in the carbon tax takeover bill, and I appreciate your call, sir,
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:40.920]  people should get prepared, in the carbon tax bill,
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:43.920]  it funds the youth brigades.
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:48.920]  And it says that these new federal bureaucracies have unlimited power.
[1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:55.920]  See, used to they pass a bill, and it would say something like a felon can't own a gun.
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:59.920]  Or it would say you got to have an incident check, but it's not a registration.
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:01.920]  Now they just, yeah, it's really a registration,
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:02.920]  and yeah, you don't have to be a felon.
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:06.920]  We're just going to decide or not, no judge or jury, whether you can own a gun or not.
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:08.920]  That's the no fly, no buy act.
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:13.920]  And they got these bills where the attorney general can decide whether you can own a gun or not,
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:18.920]  and he's saying he's going to ban almost all guns, except for single shots.
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:21.920]  I mean, folks, it's happening.
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:24.920]  Do you understand it's really happening?
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:30.920]  They got a bill, the Clean Water Restoration Act, that says all land in the U.S. will now be federalized.
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:35.920]  Because if you read it, it says total federal jurisdiction, no judge, no jury, no warrant.
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:38.920]  Just like Game Wardens, they'll come on your property without warrants.
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:44.920]  If there's even water below ground, all land has water below ground, even the desert.
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:50.920]  They're saying, I mean, total, you know how they treat the states where it's half federal?
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:52.920]  They treat you like scum, folks.
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:54.920]  This is slavery.
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:55.920]  God help us.
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:58.920]  Danielle and Georgia, you're on the air.
[1:25:58.920 --> 1:25:59.920]  Oh, hi.
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:00.920]  Hi, Danielle.
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:01.920]  Welcome.
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:02.920]  Oh, okay.
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:03.920]  Hear me?
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:04.920]  Yes.
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:07.920]  I have something to tell you.
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:08.920]  Right quick.
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:09.920]  I'll try to make it quick.
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:16.920]  My mom, she took my sisters to their appointment to catch up with their shots so they can go to school.
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:18.920]  One of my sisters is 13.
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:20.920]  The other one is 15.
[1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:26.920]  And their doctor told my mom about this shot to prevent cervical cancer.
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:28.920]  Gardasil that kills girls that are in a hammer.
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:29.920]  Exactly.
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:34.920]  And I wanted to, yeah, let me finish with this.
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:40.920]  And my mom was asking, you know, she was interested to say what type of side effects they will go through.
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:44.920]  And the doctor said nothing major, just a little swelling, a little bruising.
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:52.920]  And the mom said, well, before you give them that shot, I would like to look into the information about that shot further.
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:55.920]  The doctor told her, this is what my mom told me.
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:00.920]  The doctor told her that this is for their own good.
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:04.920]  And if they don't take the shot now, they will have to take it on their next appointment.
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:05.920]  Where do you live?
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:06.920]  I live in Georgia.
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:08.920]  My mom lives in Florida.
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:12.920]  Well, you know, Georgia in places is where they've carried out a lot of the eugenics.
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  But ma'am, let me be clear with you.
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:20.920]  Only one state mandated mandatory Gardasil injections, and that's not even the law.
[1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:26.920]  The governor said he put it on his list of policies to tell people it's mandatory, but there's no law,
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:28.920]  and there's a waiver to get around the school policy.
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:29.920]  You've got to demand it.
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:31.920]  So there's no law in Georgia.
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:33.920]  There's no law anywhere, not even Texas.
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:39.920]  And so these doctors are on power trips, and they lie and tell you it's the law.
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:44.920]  Did she submit, did she shoot them up?
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:45.920]  Yes, they did.
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:48.920]  I mean, my mom lives in Tampa, and my sisters do as well.
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:50.920]  They took place in Tampa when they went to their place.
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:51.920]  Well, you know, there's three shots.
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:52.920]  Well, you need to go to...
[1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:54.920]  They gave them, like, all together, like, five or six.
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:55.920]  You're not supposed to do that.
[1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:56.920]  Look.
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:27:58.920]  And they also gave her a hepatitis shot.
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:01.920]  They treated my mom like she was some criminal.
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:03.920]  I mean, that's what my mom said.
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:05.920]  She thought she was being interrogated.
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:06.920]  No, no, no.
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:11.920]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, they're used to cornering people, beating people up in Nazi Germany,
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.920]  in Soviet Russia, and in eugenics America, where they sterilized 500,000-plus women up until the 1980s.
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:18.920]  That's how they do it.
[1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:21.920]  They bully you into submission.
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:23.920]  Now, explain to your mother.
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:24.920]  They gave them other shots.
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:26.920]  They only gave them one of the Gardasil that day.
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:29.920]  She doesn't have to take the other two shots, but all you got to do is...
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:30.920]  They only gave them all of those shots.
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:31.920]  They already...
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:32.920]  It's already happy.
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:34.920]  They gave them, like, six shots.
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:35.920]  Ma'am, you're not listening.
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:36.920]  You're not listening to me, and that's why...
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:37.920]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:39.920]  That's why they're going to hit you and hit you hard.
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:42.920]  They don't have the right to cut the uterus out of the girls,
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:45.920]  and they don't have the right to shoot them up with that.
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:48.920]  But as you know, they used to come in and cut women's uteruses out,
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:51.920]  or tie their tubes and tell them it was the law, too,
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:54.920]  and they get these ignorant women cornered, and they do it.
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:57.920]  They get their little girls to have them chopped open.
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:59.920]  The government isn't allowed to chop your uterus out,
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:02.920]  and they're not allowed to forcibly inject you.
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:03.920]  They're liars.
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:04.920]  Now, Ma'am, I want to explain something to you.
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:05.920]  Okay.
[1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:10.920]  They gave them other school shots in the first round of Gardasil.
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:11.920]  Okay.
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:13.920]  Do you understand me?
[1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:14.920]  I'm listening.
[1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:15.920]  I put her on hold.
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:17.920]  I'm not mad at this woman, and I'm glad she called.
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:21.920]  It makes me very upset that this government's so criminal
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:25.920]  and lies to everybody, and scumbag, power-tripping, filth doctors
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:28.920]  who were told by the AMA for liability protection,
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:30.920]  they got to lie and tell you you got to take these shots.
[1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:33.920]  If you're four of the shots, you still have the law.
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:36.920]  Springtime, now that you've planted your organic garden,
[1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:39.920]  how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?

[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:40.920]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:45.920]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:48.920]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country

[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:50.920]  GCN Great Talk Radio starts here.
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.920]  I'm going to go back to you in a minute.
[1:33:52.920 --> 1:33:54.920]  I'm going to hit my big news today.
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:56.920]  Sharon, go ahead and bring it in.
[1:33:56.920 --> 1:34:00.920]  During that three-minute break, we printed five mainstream news stories.
[1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:03.920]  I'm going to read these to you right now.
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:05.920]  Mail online.
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:10.920]  Alert over jab for girls is to die following cervical cancer vaccination.
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:12.920]  That was just in trials in Europe.
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:14.920]  There's hundreds of these articles.
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:16.920]  The way they report on it is death here, death there.
[1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:18.920]  Hundreds dead.
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:20.920]  Thousands having autoimmune diseases.
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:24.920]  It is a live cancer virus on the insert for Gardasil.
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:27.920]  It says it doesn't even protect you from cervical cancer.
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:30.920]  There are over 350 variants of it.
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:36.920]  Studies are out that having that virus then gives you more than a 70% reduction
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:40.920]  in not getting a whole class of fast-acting cancers.
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:43.920]  It's a buffer.
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:45.920]  You won't believe until you all die of cancer.
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:49.920]  Look, folks, a few decades ago, it was five or six vaccines.
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:51.920]  They said were mandatory and they'd lie about it and say it was.
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:53.920]  Then it was 30, now 40, now 50, now 60.
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:57.920]  These companies come in and lobby government and they force you to take it.
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:01.920]  The same companies like Merck that gave you Vioxx,
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:07.920]  Bayer that knowingly shipped HIV and hepatitis out in factor A.
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:09.920]  Don't roll your eyes at me.
[1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:10.920]  Google it.
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:17.920]  During the break, we Googled Gardasil deaths, thousands of articles.
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:19.920]  Here's another one.
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:21.920]  New York Daily News.
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:24.920]  My girl died as guinea pig for Gardasil.
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:30.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, Merck knew they had a vaccine three years ago in trials.
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:34.920]  I had doctors and scientists on that had killed a bunch of people in the trials.
[1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:44.920]  Just like they knew in 1981 that Prozac caused a 15 times fold increase in suicide in their tiny trials.
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:46.920]  And they covered it up and now they have to put on the insert.
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:50.920]  It makes you kill people and yourself.
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:52.920]  That's now on the insert.
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:54.920]  No more sucking your thumb and denying.
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:58.920]  Now they knew they had a bad drug that had cost them billions of dollars.
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:01.920]  But when they pay off a governor like Rick Perry,
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:05.920]  and it came out that they gave his campaign, everybody else who voted for it,
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:10.920]  the legislature, big scandal, when he makes it mandatory,
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:14.920]  quote, mandatory that schools try to push in on you, puts it on the mandatory list,
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:19.920]  then federal money for vaccine damage kicks in.
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:27.920]  So they can dump it on the market just like Bayer dumped factor A on the market full of HIV.
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:31.920]  Just Google factor eight AIDS. Don't you deny me. Your family depends on this.
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:34.920]  Your children depend on this listeners.
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:36.920]  My girl died as a guinea pig.
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:41.920]  Go put Gardasil deaths in on YouTube and watch all the local newscast.
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:47.920]  Nationally, they won't put it on TV, but you'll see the girls blood pouring out their eyes, their mouths, every orifice.
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:50.920]  It's like an Ebola death.
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:53.920]  Hell, don't believe me. Go ahead and murder your daughters.
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:58.920]  Maybe after your daughter dies, you'll listen to me. Go ahead and murder them.
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:01.920]  Or maybe after they're paralyzed in the hospital a few months.
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:03.920]  A lot of times they still have a convulsion that night.
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:06.920]  You take them back to the doctor and they go, oh, the vaccine didn't do it.
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:08.920]  I don't have any liability.
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:11.920]  These pimp doctors get $900 for the shots.
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:14.920]  That's why they tell people on Medicare and Medicaid it's the law.
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:17.920]  They got to take it because they know they're getting a big piece of it.
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:20.920]  Those pimp doctors are getting about 300 cash.
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.920]  They can go buy hookers with that. They can go buy drugs with that.
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:25.920]  They can go buy golf course fees with that.
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  You think they care about you?
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:31.920]  I'm sick of it.
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:35.920]  I'm not living in the middle of this eugenics pit anymore.
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:36.920]  Look at this.
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:38.920]  Let me tell you how evil the government is.
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:41.920]  New York Daily News admits they grabbed little black kids,
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:44.920]  CPS does from their kids and test pesticides on them,
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:48.920]  chained down over three months till the black kid dies.
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:50.920]  That's your government.
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:52.920]  They take little kids and radiate them to death and poison them.
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:54.920]  This government is completely criminal.
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:56.920]  I'm risking my life bringing this info.
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:57.920]  They don't control everything.
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:37:59.920]  See, that's why I'm on the radio.
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:02.920]  They can just sit there carrying out their evil and nobody prosecutes them.
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:03.920]  Here's another one.
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:04.920]  You think I'm joking?
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:05.920]  This is out of The Australian.
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:06.920]  Biggest newspaper in Australia.
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:08.920]  It's also ABC News.
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:13.920]  Vioxx maker Merck and co drew up Dr. Hit List.
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:16.920]  And it says doctors to be quote liquidated.
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:18.920]  And guess what?
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:20.920]  It just so turns out we did a database search.
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:23.920]  A bunch of doctors that were critical of them got their heads blown off.
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:26.920]  Oh, yeah, they really care about you and your family.
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:31.920]  Now, ma'am, I blew up at you because I'm worried about your family.
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:34.920]  I get angry and I'm going to go to her in a minute,
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:37.920]  but I'm trying to explain this to you.
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:42.920]  Most of the women that die taking the Merck shot take the second or third shot.
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:44.920]  I know you're saying they already got five.
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:48.920]  No, they got other IQ reducers and cancer implantators.
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:52.920]  Now, implantation operations put in them through the compartmentalized idiot
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:55.920]  that was lying saying, take the shots.
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:38:57.920]  Okay.
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:00.920]  They haven't gotten the other two shots yet unless they've been back.
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:02.920]  That doctor needs to have complaints filed on them.
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:03.920]  That doctor.
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:05.920]  Listen, pretty bother didn't believe me about this.
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:09.920]  I had the, the, the state's attorney on from Maryland a year and a half ago.
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:11.920]  It's up on YouTube.
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:15.920]  Cause I saw him on CNN with drug dogs barking at children.
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:19.920]  2000 children lined up outside being forcibly injected in front of the courthouse
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:24.920]  in St. George County, Maryland.
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:26.920]  And I saw them.
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:31.920]  They're crying saying, I don't want to take it, but it's the law and crying.
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:32.920]  And I call him up and I get him on.
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:34.920]  I go, sir, you know, there's a waiver for that.
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:35.920]  There's no law.
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:36.920]  It's a waiver for a regulation.
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:37.920]  So it's color law.
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:40.920]  And he laughed on air and said, yeah, I don't even vaccinate my own kids.
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:44.920]  And I said, but you and the judge told him all in the news told him it was the law.
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:47.920]  And he just said, well, look, there were waivers available.
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:49.920]  And I said, no, you were on the news saying it was mandatory.
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:55.920]  This is what these people do is they can wear a suit and be fancy and have people kiss their butt in some courthouse.
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:57.920]  It's all about fake baloney.
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:39:59.920]  Well, I don't care about fake baloney.
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:00.920]  I'm going to tell the truth.
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:02.920]  Now, who's turned the mic on.
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:08.920]  You were talking about Paul Harman was talking about talking to the doctor about his daughter and son and the doctor told him the truth.
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:12.920]  He said, it's the law. I got to push him on you.
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:14.920]  But but but no, I don't even carry him in this office.
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:17.920]  See, the good news is we're starting to win this fight.
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:21.920]  When I had my first child, they tried to act like I was a cult member and talk to me weird.
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:24.920]  When I had my third child a year ago, they were like, yeah, none of us take them now.
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:27.920]  Yeah, we know it's killing everybody, but we're not allowed to talk about it.
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  Yeah, we just have to ask you.
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:29.920]  Don't take them.
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:30.920]  I don't take them.
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:31.920]  I don't.
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:32.920]  I didn't vaccinate my kids.
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:33.920]  I agree.
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:36.920]  You know, the nurses now see they now because they see enough people flopping around the floor,
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:40.920]  blood pouring out when the black op gets run and see everybody just covers it up.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:43.920]  And it's, well, there's a federal fund pays that off.
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:46.920]  You know, that's how it is.
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:49.920]  Who's going to tell folks what they said to you.
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:58.920]  I just called up this pediatrician that I found just because I knew my present pediatrician probably was going to pressure me into
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:40:59.920]  vaccinating my son.
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:00.920]  Yeah, they'll lie to you.
[1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:10.920]  I called her and wanted to get her stance on it. She just told me that she's required by law to offer them to me and suggest that I do it.
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:17.920]  But she says that she doesn't even carry them in her office because they go bad too quick and that she won't pressure me into a vaccine.
[1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:20.920]  There is no law to take them.
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:26.920]  You saw the mainstream news articles in Bloomberg about a mixing weaponized bird flu with the vaccines and then they shipped it out and won't say what happened.
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:32.920]  And suddenly this new virus pops up and they're saying they're getting ready for martial law in the fall.
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:34.920]  Who's comments on that?
[1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:36.920]  It's just crazy, man.
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:37.920]  Something looks real shiesty.
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:38.920]  You work in this office.
[1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:42.920]  You know, I hired you because you were bored off up here at KLBJ and you worked at KI2 and TV.
[1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:45.920]  You didn't believe a lot of the stuff when I first hired you.
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:47.920]  You've now seen me do the show.
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:50.920]  Now, is everything I talk about documented even mainstream?
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:56.920]  Oh, yeah, I mean, you're kind of in disbelief until you see it.
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:04.920]  I mean, I mean, I've got ABC News in the Australian with Vioxx maker Merck drew up Dr. Hit List.
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:07.920]  It's like that one dude said, hitting it in plain view, right?
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:08.920]  It's totally everything.
[1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:09.920]  Exactly.
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:19.920]  Listen, folks, I can pull up New York Daily News and then I had the local families on because social workers finally said we can't be part of this where they would go grab little black kids
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:23.920]  and take them and chain them down and test pesticides on them and murder them.
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.920]  They murder children.
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.920]  I would be a weirdo if I wasn't upset about this.
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:32.920]  Folks, even if you're for vaccines, just find out there's no law.
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:36.920]  You got to take them and then ask yourself why the news gets up and says it's the law.
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:38.920]  This is all color of law.
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:47.920]  It's just like even if you're for the global warming tax and you want to pay $2,800 a year just to start and you want all the jobs shut down and you think it's great.
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:49.920]  They didn't let Congress read it.
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:51.920]  Now, Danielle, I'm sorry.
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:53.920]  Now I haven't even covered the big news.
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:55.920]  I said I will, but I'll do that in the final segment.
[1:42:55.920 --> 1:43:00.920]  The lines have been loaded the whole show, but this gets to me because I know they're a pack of liars.
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:02.920]  I know the cops are shooting themselves up.
[1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:06.920]  I mean, when I say they put cancer viruses in vaccines, it's been found everywhere.
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:09.920]  But does that answer your question, Danielle?
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:10.920]  Yes.
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:17.920]  I read some articles about that Gardasil thing and there are a couple of girls that died and were in critical conditions.
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:18.920]  Not a couple.
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:19.920]  No, no, no.
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:21.920]  The media does that as a tactic.
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:25.920]  I read that in an army psych warfare document, British army document from the 40s.
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:28.920]  When they're killing thousands, they'll only tell you about a couple of them.
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:30.920]  That creates the illusion it's only a few.
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:32.920]  Ma'am, it's mass death.
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:33.920]  It's not a couple.
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:36.920]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.

[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:38.920]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:42.920]  Think about that. Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:45.920]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:49.920]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health,

[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:59.920]  We got that video at the office of all those kids lined up crying with police and riot gear with dogs barking saying it's the law as they cry and inject them.
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:05.920]  And then we had news reporters there that I've interviewed who had video cameras and the cops would come over and say turn your cameras off.
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:13.920]  The government's just basically broken us. They've trained us to be slaves. They've trained us to put up with anything.
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:20.920]  I know we got Dan Criss, we've got people in Toronto, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Mass. You know, I'm not going to be able to take your calls.
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:25.920]  Call me back tomorrow or next week because I promise to break down the total takeover of society.
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:34.920]  I need to do that now here in the final segment, but I just told you how the Gardasil's killing a lot of people that are taking it.
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:43.920]  Because it's a live cancer virus and it's causing a serious autoimmune inflammation and inflammation on the brain.
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.920]  And I've seen the autopsy photos of these girls. I mean, it doesn't matter.
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:52.920]  I guess go ahead and kill your daughter or hurt her real bad when she's paralyzed.
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:59.920]  I've had a lot of people write me and call me and they'll call the office crying going, my God, my daughter's paralyzed now and she had a stroke after she took it.
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:06.920]  Look, I'm sorry. I try, you know, I get to be called a kook and attacked by the media for reading mainstream government documents.
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:15.920]  It's black ops. It's soft kill weapons and they're not going to stop and they're getting ready with this new flu.
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:18.920]  They're going to hype up in the fall to try to forcibly inoculate people.
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:26.920]  The good news is they tried to forcibly inoculate all the first responders in 2002 with the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:30.920]  Now they have the criminal law passed to forcibly inject us, but now they're going to try to implement it.
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:33.920]  You see, they're domesticating us now.
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:45.920]  And that's why they're testing their federalization takeover through economic crises, terror crises, and biological crises.
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:52.920]  And yes, the House of Representatives passed a 13 plus 100 page bill that no one was allowed to read.
[1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:57.920]  They let one copy be released on the floor 30 minutes before it was going to pass.
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:03.920]  So Bonner did a House filibuster and then shut it down and they passed it.
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:08.920]  It passed by the eight Republicans that went over and I gave you their names and numbers last hour.
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:12.920]  And that's up on info wars.com. Please call them their local bastard offices.
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:15.920]  And I mean, they are, they're just complete thugs.
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:21.920]  I mean, you ought to read the bill, just home inspectors, taxes on all electricity, taxes on all industry cars.
[1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:23.920]  No taxes on foreign countries.
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:29.920]  In fact, billions per foreign nation, Mexico, China of tax money to pay them to implement it.
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:38.920]  And then they admit that money is going to go back to the IMF and World Bank in open money laundering.
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:46.920]  Congressman John Bonner on the Hill newspaper called the climate bill a pile of bleep and said it's the biggest tax in U.S. history.
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:48.920]  And that's what it is.
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:54.920]  But they'll slowly implement it now and just squeeze the daylights out of us.
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:58.920]  Cap and traders again can change vote by July 2nd deadline.
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:03.920]  We got to get behind calling those people and some of the Democrats.
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:07.920]  There's another big lie going on. They're saying, oh, we're pulling out of Iraq.
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:12.920]  They're just pulling out of the cities into the big command bases and then moving the rest of the troops to Afghanistan.
[1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:18.920]  There's another big lie there.
[1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:24.920]  The other, the point is the big takeover, everything they haven't been able to pass the hate bill.
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:28.920]  We have the hate bill posted up on info wars.com.
[1:51:28.920 --> 1:51:36.920]  And it says word for word, it's past the house that if you say something that influences someone to commit to criminal act,
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:42.920]  someone's feeling or cause any form of distress that you will be arrested under a federal felony,
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:49.920]  just like the cyber bullying act says, it has passed the house never before.
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:53.920]  It is now in the Senate, which is even worse.
[1:51:53.920 --> 1:52:03.920]  The climate takeover bill with the federal government takes over all industry where their own private board set up by the government can selectively decide who can have a carbon footprint and can.
[1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:08.920]  Taxes on cows, taxes on sheep, taxes on anything that has flatulence.
[1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:10.920]  I'm not joking.
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.920]  Taxes on everything, total control.
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:23.920]  And they've got all the bills introduced on the verge of passing and national compulsory service bills on the verge of passing.
[1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:31.920]  The health care takeover, totally federalizing health care further, controlling what doctors and nurses do so the feds can order them how to operate.
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:40.920]  They're already jacked in under their insurance rules under Medicare and Medicaid and these federally controlled computers tell them what aid to give, what treatment to give.
[1:52:40.920 --> 1:52:42.920]  They openly say they're going to ration care.
[1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:44.920]  That's in the bill.
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:48.920]  Even Bloomberg's reported that and you tell people and they can't believe it.
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:50.920]  Everything's happening now.
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:51.920]  They got an amnesty.
[1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:53.920]  Remember the last three times they tried to pass amnesty.
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:55.920]  They wouldn't allow the bill to be public.
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:52:59.920]  They'd say it's a secret bill, but Senator Sessions leaked it and it was more than amnesty.
[1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:01.920]  It said they allow felons to stay.
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:05.920]  Have they signed a pledge to not commit felonies?
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:12.920]  And they could bring unlimited members of their family members here and unlimited worker visas for skilled workers.
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:24.920]  Well, now again, they're not letting people see the bill, but we've seen earlier versions and that bill's introduced.
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:31.920]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, it is coming down. It is going on.
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:35.920]  This carbon bill will completely shut down what's left of industry.
[1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:42.920]  It's all about artificial scarcity by the government putting taxes on all production and all carbon activity when we're carbon based life forms.
[1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:49.920]  When carbon is one fourth of the entire life cycle, water, sunlight, oxygen and air.
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:52.920]  It's a tax on the key building block of life.
[1:53:52.920 --> 1:53:57.920]  Tax, hail, carbon, plants, breathe it, animals and plants, animals and plants.
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:02.920]  It's the carbon cycle.
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:11.920]  Google the carbon cycle and then click Google images and look at the basic university or high school biology overlays and look at the life cycle and realize what they've done.
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:19.920]  It's a tax on breathing and Nancy Pelosi said in speeches, it will chronicle and tax everything you do and track everything you do.
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:25.920]  Your national ID card with the world sales tax when you scan it will track and trace everything you buy, sell and do.
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:29.920]  This is official policy.
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:40.920]  They've openly got city year and all and year up and all these ads on TV with people in blue and gray uniforms that say environmental police with these buck toothed,
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:49.920]  zipped face teenagers who have no future, no jobs, red and black uniforms for city year marching and doing military drills on TV.
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:51.920]  They're running with taxpayer money.
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:55:00.920]  Have you noticed the economy is dead now and the only billboards you see are click it or ticket and ads of state police pulling people over and searching their cars,
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:03.920]  training you, you're a slave, you're bad, the cops are watching you.
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:04.920]  Have you noticed all the billboards?
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:06.920]  I mean, it's like it was half of now.
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:08.920]  It's like 80% driving to work today.
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:10.920]  It's all government ads.
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:11.920]  There's nothing left.
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:21.920]  There's only the few big top corporate Fortune 50 who own the Fortune 500 and they get all the government contracts in all the major school.
[1:55:21.920 --> 1:55:27.920]  Tuitions and scholarships are all about law enforcement, police, spying, data mining.
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:32.920]  San Antonio just took the giant former Sony plant, turned it into a huge NSA base.
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:36.920]  They admittedly admit the NSA spying on all everybody's internet from there.
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:40.920]  And the local newspaper tried to go down there, the San Antonio current.
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:41.920]  It's like the Austin Chronicle.
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:45.920]  And the, and the, and the feds came off base and arrested them and took their film.
[1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:47.920]  That isn't about security.
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:50.920]  It's about letting you the milk cow know that you're a cow.
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:51.920]  What's a pimp do?
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:59.920]  A pimp beats his bitches to let them know that they're slaves and that he's going to take 110% of their money.
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:00.920]  And the cops are there.
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:02.920]  They've been told taser and beat them.
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:03.920]  Let them know you're the boss.
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:04.920]  Be rude to the scum.
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:08.920]  Let them know that we own these women.
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:12.920]  We're a, we're a stable of crack whores with cigarette burns all over us.
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:18.920]  And the feds just slap us around and say, shut up, shut up and do what I say whore.
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:20.920]  And we say, yes, yes.
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:25.920]  It's in the amnesty bill that all the crimes of the illegal aliens are waived.
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:26.920]  Local police all over the country.
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:27.920]  It's in the news.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:28.920]  They admitted they are rusty legals.
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:33.920]  The judges let them go because they want them here to undermine and drop the wages of everybody else.
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:36.920]  When they're done with them, they'll be treated like slaves too.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:37.920]  Don't worry.
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.920]  This is a nation going into hardcore scientific slavery.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:46.920]  And if you read about the pimp game, you'll understand how the new world order operates.
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:49.920]  Everything is how a pimp runs a whore.
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:52.920]  Everything they do is how a pimp breaks a whore.
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:53.920]  In fact, do we have under my thumb?
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:56.920]  Can we go out rolling stone under my thumb or no, we'll go out with deep purple.
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:57.920]  I doubt we have it.
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:02.920]  I want to play that because, you know, the changes come, you know, she doesn't look me in the eyes.
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:03.920]  She's under my thumb.
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:06.920]  Well, I'm not under your thumb and I'm not your whore.
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:10.920]  I'm not going to sit here while you have your way with me new world order.
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:12.920]  You can't get it.
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:13.920]  It doesn't matter.
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:14.920]  Take us out with deep purple.
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:15.920]  Again, it's all happening.
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:17.920]  They're moving with everything now.
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:19.920]  The new bank of the world.
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:29.920]  The biggest one is the Federal Reserve is a regional bank of the new bank of the world announced in the news that will be over all industry, all banking, anything to do with finance, anything to do that affects the economy.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:34.920]  It says the Fed is above it and no agency of government can oversee them or even question them.
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:39.920]  And Bernanke was before Congress this week and said Congress has no authority over money.
[1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:43.920]  When article one section eight says only Congress is, that's why they level the money.
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:48.920]  That's why they create the laws and levy the taxes.
[1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:51.920]  These people are incredible.
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:55.920]  They're out of control and they've got to be resisted.
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:00.920]  We've got to stand up against the new world order and say I'm not your whore.
