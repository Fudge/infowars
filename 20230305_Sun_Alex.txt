[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  It's Sunday, March 5th, 2023. Another massively important transmission is now live.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:20.000 --> 00:46.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:46.000 --> 00:57.000]  A global prison to enslave our bodies and minds is in the final stages of completion.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  But thanks to the work of Infowars and millions of other people around the world,
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  humanity is awakening quickly and is quickly moving towards a mass epiphany
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  or mass great awakening that will reverse the fortunes of the New World Order
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  and empower humanity to level 114C.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  I've been talking a lot about the great awakening and the fact that we've reached chain reaction.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  I can't even keep track of all of the prominent public figures and individuals,
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  even on state-run media like ABC News and Australia and CNN here in the U.S.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  Coming out and saying they were wrong about COVID and they're sorry.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  And why there is a globalist New World Order and Russell Brands, the new Alex Jones
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  and Elon Musk sounds just like Alex Jones and on, on, on, on.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  That's because now, ladies and gentlemen, it's safe to do it
[01:54.000 --> 02:03.000]  because a large minority approaching a majority now understands they're under attack by the New World Order.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  That said, this is not enough.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  We can't just wake up to the last attack and realize what happened to us.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  We have to bring the criminal's justice before they launch new attacks.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  We have to break down what those new attacks are going to be.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  We're going to be talking about Bill Gates and the U.N.'s new war games.
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  We've been talking about it for several months.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  But now it's starting to get some attention.
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  We're going to discuss their plan to target children with a new virus that mainly only kills children.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  They believe that will get everybody to permanently lock themselves in their houses and accept the World ID card,
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  the Cashless Society and more.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  But we have good news.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  Remember about a year and a half ago, the head British health minister, Matt Hancock,
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  got removed supposedly because he got caught during lockdown out partying with his girlfriend,
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  cheating on his wife.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  That wasn't the real reason.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  We now know that over 100,000 emails of the government officials communicating was leaked to the press at the time
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  and only now has hit the news.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  And what are they discussing?
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  Deploying a new variant to scare the hell out of the public and make them submit to tyranny.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  And how they only wore the mask to scare the public.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  Real criminal activity.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  Now, we already know all this.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  And then it was globally deployed and globally standardized, but this really is smoking gun information.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  It's up on info wars.com.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Project fear.
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  Authors discussed when to deploy new COVID variant.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  London Telegraph broke it a few days ago.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  Now, it's all over the news.
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  UK lockdown files, text message reveal how top British health officials conspired to quote,
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  scare the pants off everyone and asking, when do we deploy the new variant?
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  Now, does that mean they released the new variant?
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  Well, of course their bosses did, but they're speaking about a hypo new variant to scare everyone.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  And, you know, I talked about this back when it happened.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  And I said, look, a lot of these big events are staged.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  Sometimes they just use a real event that happened and exacerbate the crisis for control.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  Roman manual famously said as a White House head advisor to Obama, don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  But in this case, they got caught and had to admit that they recruited actors to go into a hospital and shoot a video about,
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  oh my God, I'm dying.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  Help me.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  You really should take the shot.
[04:28.000 --> 04:37.000]  But of all places, even ABC News of Australia came out and reported it was fake.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  And that never really got picked up here, but we've got the clip that's coming up.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  So, and they even call them crisis actors, so they don't want you ever questioning big events because so many times they are staged.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  Sometimes they're not.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Well, I went out on a limb and said, I thought Jesse Smallott was staged the first day.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  The news broke and I was proven right.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Whether I'm right or wrong, I have a right to question those things.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  And so do you.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[04:58.000 --> 05:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals and their own words planned for our future.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.000]  That is the hellish future.
[05:11.000 --> 05:18.000]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  at bookstores, Amazon or info or short.com.
[05:20.000 --> 05:28.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at info or short.com.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  You'll also know that you help keep info words on the air.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[05:48.000 --> 05:58.000]  I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info or short.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[05:58.000 --> 06:19.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you if you're...
[06:19.000 --> 06:28.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:28.000 --> 06:38.000]  It's Sunday, March 5th, 2023. I am here in battled talk show host and freedom loving compatriot Alex Jones.
[06:38.000 --> 06:50.000]  I'm honored and blessed to still be in the fight leading from the front with you here this evening very, very blessed and graced that you have decided to spend some time with us to really talk about saving our world.
[06:50.000 --> 07:01.000]  Not as far as ourselves and our children, but because that's the mission God has laid out before us facing the truth and defeating lies.
[07:01.000 --> 07:08.000]  All right, I've been a lot of preparation for today's show and I do like to make my points and I like to talk.
[07:08.000 --> 07:17.000]  But today I really in the next two hours am going to play a lot of clips for probably 60% of the air time will be clips because these have got to be played.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  You put the live show headline up for TV viewers, please.
[07:21.000 --> 07:34.000]  It says it all. Trump declares war on the globalist and the New World Order. Trump declares America will have retribution in final battle against New World Order globalist.
[07:34.000 --> 07:46.000]  Now countless top talk show hosts around the world including liberals like Russell Brand are coming out against the New World Order and saying they're deliberately depopulating us.
[07:46.000 --> 07:53.000]  And then Alex Jones was right. He just knocked you out of the park Friday night on Bill Maher. We've got clips of that.
[07:53.000 --> 08:03.000]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he's looking to run as a primary challenger, of course they killed his father because he was winning in the primaries back in the 60s.
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  But Robert F. Kennedy Jr. mulling primary challenge against Biden. I would support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the general election.
[08:12.000 --> 08:22.000]  A total integrity. Super good guy. Absolutely the real deal. I got to tell you, I'm not a partisan, folks.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  Just a Democratic Party is such a cesspool of evil. It could be reformed with that type of leadership.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  Because we need Republicans and Democrats that are anti-New World Order and pro-America and pro-freedom.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.000]  But I do like to say this. I do like Trump. But I got to tell you, that's really an awesome unifying idea of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  He's followed his work for decades and he's really grown a lot and knows a lot. I'm going to give you my take on that coming up.
[08:45.000 --> 09:04.000]  We've got some really dangerous war developments with the U.S. government confirming that they are indeed training Ukrainian pilots to be given F-16s in Ukraine to fight the Russians.
[09:04.000 --> 09:16.000]  We've got all of that information. But when it comes to COVID news, I've been covering COVID news so much and so intensely for three years.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  The last few months, I've kind of backed off a bit because there's so much other news that's important to hit as well, like stopping World War III.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  But if you stop the COVID rollout, you discredit the whole global system and we win.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  And so the stack of news on the COVID front is so incredibly important. That's what I'm going to cover first here.
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  It'll probably take a good 30 minutes, maybe 40 minutes to do. Then we'll shift gears into all the other subjects.
[09:42.000 --> 09:57.000]  And boy, there are a lot of them. Like Phil Washington, who they went ahead of the FAA, does not know basic things that even somebody that has a video game flight simulator knows the answers to.
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  I'm not a pilot, but I did when I was younger, had some video game flight simulation games that I got into a little bit.
[10:04.000 --> 10:13.000]  So I actually know these answers because I probably played 200 hours of flight simulator video games and I was 12 years old, got into it for a little bit.
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  My dad is a pilot and a lot of family have been pilots, so I'm a lot of flying around, but I don't, I'd call myself a novice.
[10:19.000 --> 10:32.000]  I know more than the new FAA nominee who is a high school dropout. And the reason I raise that is, why do they want somebody that's a high school dropout as the head of the FAA?
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  Because they can do anything they want and blame the administrator in the end.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  That's why they're putting like that crazy guy that robs all the luggage and steals all the stuff at airports that was in control of the whole spent fuel nuclear stockpile.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  They want clowns in charge.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  And look, they can find plenty of smart black people to be the FAA head that are pilots, okay, or that know the history of aviation or know how it all works.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  But this guy ain't it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  And so people like this are emblematic of how they're putting studios and fools in place.
[11:05.000 --> 11:14.000]  But the first thing I want to hit on the COVID front is something we saw a year and a half ago, two years ago in Australia, fake COVID actors, crisis actors,
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  posing as patients for a PR stunt.
[11:17.000 --> 11:28.000]  But what's amazing is it never made bigger news when it came out and I never even knew that ABC News, that's not our ABC, that's the Australian broadcasting company, it's the biggest outlet there, reported on this.
[11:28.000 --> 11:37.000]  So again, it's okay to question big events because a lot of times they're totally staged and crisis actors are a very, very real thing, not distributed around the world.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  The UN hires them, PR firms hire them, it's a big issue.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  We're going to play this crisis actor report and they did similar things here and in Europe and in the UK.
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  Just so you realize the level of brainwashing we've been dealing with, here's the report, we'll come back with a lot more.
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  This is real and this is for Australia, the whole of Australia.
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  You know, all I can think about is my children that I haven't seen in a very long time.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  And this is for them.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  It's a really huge impact on your family. You're not able to look after your kids at the moment.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  I've been working like I'm a single mum. It's not easy.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  Hello, I'm Paul Barry. Welcome to MediaWatch.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  And that was Single Mum Remoda, one of 700 COVID patients hospitalised in Australia at the end of last month.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  Who, along with two others in Sydney's Concord Hospital, was keen to warn people of the dangers of COVID
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  by sharing heartbreaking stories about their illness from their hospital beds.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  So please get vaccinated. I wish I could be forehead.
[12:43.000 --> 12:51.000]  Shortness in breath, something attacking the lungs. It was harsh.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  Footage of those patients identified only by their first names was recorded by Dr Lucy Morgan and released by NSW Health
[12:58.000 --> 13:06.000]  and made it onto all the major networks, including ABC News, Ten News First and Seven News.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  But soon, people on social media were wondering if the NSW Health video was actually a fake.
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  And among the skeptics was former One Nation Senator Rod Culliton, whose post received thousands of likes.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  And another former Senator David Lionhelm.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  And one intrepid tiktoker who went digging was able to reveal...
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  I found all three actors. Now, how can this be coincidental?
[13:29.000 --> 13:37.000]  Yes, all three, including Ramona, were supposedly paid crisis actors who did not have COVID at all.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  And another internet sleuth then set out to prove it, bringing Concord Hospital to show that Ramona Currie was not a patient there.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  Hello, is this Concord Hospital?
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  Yeah, can I help you?
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  Hi, it's John Currie. I'm just looking for my wife.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  Hey.
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  Ramona Currie.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  I just can't see anyone with that surname.
[13:57.000 --> 14:04.000]  Well, bingo. That video, which TikTok only removed today, had nearly 800,000 views.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  And elsewhere on social media, other punters were getting outraged by what they saw as TV's fake news.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  How stupid and outright deceptive is Channel 9?
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  Phone's the hospital, she's not a patient at all. More lies on our TV.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  So, is Ramona a crisis actor pretending to have COVID for NSW Health?
[14:23.000 --> 14:33.000]  No, of course she's not. As NSW Health made clear, the patient's name is not Ramona Currie, but Ramona Al-Nasha, who is a pharmacy worker.
[14:33.000 --> 14:41.000]  And as you can clearly see, they are two different people, despite the fact that both are women and both have dark hair.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  And as for the two male patients, well, we're happy to tell you they are not crisis actors either.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  As actor and comedian Mitch Garling, who was outed online as COVID patient Osama Ahmad, said on Instagram...
[14:52.000 --> 15:01.000]  Turns out that people are using my photo and my star now profile, saying that I am an actor sitting in a hospital pretending to have COVID.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  Look, I am an actor, but not pretending to have COVID. Not that. Doesn't even look like me. Has a beard. That's it.
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.000]  It is amazing what people will believe, isn't it? And even we have had viewers asking, is it true? And why haven't the mainstream media covered this?
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  But it's not just fun and games for the COVID conspiracies, because the hospital told me, watch...
[15:24.000 --> 15:34.000]  It has been highly distressing for Dr Morgan and the patients to see their powerful messages undermined by these baseless and dangerous accusations and to have their credibility questioned.
[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  Staff in Concord Hospital's intensive care unit have also received multiple intimidating phone calls from members of the public.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  So there you have it. They say they're not crisis actors, others say they are, but it's being reported on. The point is whether they're right or wrong.
[15:49.000 --> 16:00.000]  Everybody has the right to investigate this, because we have other confirmed articles here in the U.S. where they did have actors, poses doctors online saying take your shots.
[16:00.000 --> 16:12.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTour.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[16:12.000 --> 16:20.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to InfoWarsTour.com.
[16:20.000 --> 16:29.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTour.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show. That's great and I thank you.
[16:34.000 --> 16:44.000]  But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our Sweet Pate and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[16:44.000 --> 17:00.000]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out on these products, so get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTour.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[17:15.000 --> 17:24.000]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and competitors at the IA that manipulate the news in the United States.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  They took the babies out of the incubators and left the children to die on a cold spot.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in full, if you can take it.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  We need you to go into the capital!
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract.
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but...
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the soonest these globalists are going to prison!
[17:55.000 --> 18:08.000]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  World War III has already started.
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  There's mass censorship.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  It's away, but those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  and to hit the broadcast on the air by getting great products at infowarstore.com.

[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  it's all available at infowarstore.com.

[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[19:04.000 --> 19:11.000]  And info wars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.

[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  Ultimate bone broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  Real red pill plus, simply amazing.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  Nitric boosts what it does for your heart, your cardiovascular, critical.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  All these products, like ultimate krill oil, ultimate fish oil, supermelt, vitality,
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  they're all available at in stock, ready to ship to you right down in infowarstore.com.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset in the World for the World,
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[19:54.000 --> 20:18.000]  But now, I sign the last books and get them right now.
[20:24.000 --> 20:35.000]  Welcome back to The Alice Jones Show, this live Sunday edition.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  I'm going to plow back into all the big cover news, but again, it can get confusing.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  People say it's crisis actors, then they say, well, it looks like crisis actors.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  Well, then no, it's not crisis actors.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  Most of the stuff going on is real to a certain extent,
[20:51.000 --> 21:00.000]  but by the media focusing on tiny points of it, they can exacerbate that and make it look like it's actually the biggest story to ever happen.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  Just like police officers killing black people, look up the numbers,
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  maybe 25 black people are killed wrongly a year by police officers, a couple hundred total.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's a tragedy if you're the person killed wrongly by police,
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  but is it the number one story like it was for several years going back two, three years ago?
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  No.
[21:21.000 --> 21:28.000]  And it's the same thing with so many of these other issues that they will focus in on COVID deaths
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  and say this child died of COVID, you should be scared of it.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  When you find out the child had cancer or the child had heart defects and they didn't die of COVID.
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.000]  I saw the news on Friday that the first child to die in the UK of COVID,
[21:43.000 --> 21:50.000]  it turns out that they put the tube down their throat wrong and that the hospital killed them.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  That was mainstream news on Friday, but they've created a perception that everybody was dying of COVID
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  and so they could scare the public.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  And we saw this in mainstream news in the US, Canada, the UK, Europe, you name it,
[22:03.000 --> 22:13.000]  where they admitted that intelligence agencies and governments use psychological warfare operations
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  and military-grade propaganda, in many cases, run by the military,
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  to scare the public into accepting the lockdowns, the shots, the mask, all of it.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  And now the confirmed smoking gun of smoking guns.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  This isn't up for debate whether it's crisis actors or not.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  Project fear, that's what they called it.
[22:37.000 --> 22:45.000]  Authors discuss when to deploy new COVID variant.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  Manhandcock's plan to, quote, frighten the pants off, close quote,
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  of the public to ensure compliance with lockdown measures exposed in leaked WhatsApp messages.
[22:57.000 --> 23:03.000]  Manhandcock wanted to deploy a new COVID variant to frighten the pants off the public
[23:03.000 --> 23:14.000]  and ensure they complied with lockdown leak messages seen by the Telegraph have revealed.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  The lockdown files, more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages sent between ministers, officials and others,
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.000]  show how the government used scare tactics to force compliance and push through lockdowns.
[23:25.000 --> 23:32.000]  Another message, Simon Kass case, the cabinet secretary, said that the fear and guilt factor
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  was vital in ramping up the messaging during the third national lockdown in January 2021.
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  The previous month, Manhandcock then health secretary appeared to suggest in one message
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  that a new strain of COVID had recently emerged and would be helpful in preparing the ground
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  for the looming lockdown by scaring people into compliance.
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  Now I'm going to read through the things they said.
[24:00.000 --> 24:07.000]  UK lockdown files, text messages reveal how top British health ministers conspired to scare the pants off everyone
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  and asking when do we deploy the new variant.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  The Daily Telegraph released WhatsApp messages from ex-UK health minister, Manhandcock,
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  who resigned in 2021 over on a so-called affair.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  The British telegram has obtained 100,000 text messages from former UK secretary,
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  Manhandcock, showing how the British government conspired to frighten the pants off everyone
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  and asking when do we deploy the new variant.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  Actual quote, they go on to say,
[24:41.000 --> 24:49.000]  rather than doing too much forward signaling, we can just roll pitch with the new strain.
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  We frighten the pants off everyone with a new strain, Manhandcock wrote back.
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  Yep, that's what will get proper behavior changed.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  Pool replied, when do we deploy the new variant, Manhandcock asked.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  Been thinking a lot about this and think we need to be more cautious.
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  The strain is, Pool wrote back, think you made the point earlier,
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  but we need to keep schools off paperwork agenda.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  The Christmas lockdown 2020 was surprisingly announced on December 19th.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  In January 2021, Hancock was discussing further measures with cabinet secretary Simon Case,
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  including more mask wearing in all settings outside the home.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  Case wrote that the fear guilt factor is vital in getting more lockdown compliance.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  They wanted you locked down to train you, the mask were key to keep fear going.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  Basically, we need to get compliance up, Case wrote, but since some measures like a ban on fishing
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  will be parodied galore, it looks like we have suddenly decided fishing is the next step towards tier five.
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  I honestly wouldn't move on any small things unless we move on a lot of things.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  The only big remaining things are nurseries and workplaces Hancock wrote.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  I agree. I think it's exactly right. Small stuff looks ridiculous.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  Ramping up messaging, the fear of the guilt is vital.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  And they agree to deploy a new variant. Now, that doesn't mean they released it.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  Now, we all know that was done by Peter Dazek and Bill Gates and Fauci and the Blue Long Lamb.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  They're talking about deploying the next variant, which they're just basically making up,
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  to scare everyone into submission.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  How huge is that?
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  Let's continue with the COVID news. And there's hundreds of thousands of these released.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  I suggest you go read them for yourself.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  Doctors, scientists, call them, Mississippi officials to take COVID vaccines off the market.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  It's already been done in most of Europe.
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  Big article from Zero Hedge, also up on infowars.com.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  Another key video that we're going to get to when we come back.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  Narrative collapsing, unexplained deaths, a shift in the story is coming.
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.000]  And that's according to Edward Dowd's sources, which I know have been proven to be dead on.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  He said two years ago, I've got statisticians about to come out from biggest insurance companies,
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  showing mass die-offs happening from the shots. He did that a year later.
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  He says from his source, the White House is preparing a new narrative of sudden death.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  It's going to admit sudden death is here as a side effect from COVID, even though statistics show,
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  it's those that took the shots. That's coming up next segment.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  Here's one of the top insurance analysts finds a 7% increase in aggregate mortality from just one shot,
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  35% if you take five doses.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  And then a really important report, I won't air the whole thing, but I'm going to have it posted
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  under the Live Show Feeds 20-Minute Report, dates this next pandemic, and these researchers are dead on.
[27:47.000 --> 27:53.000]  Then that ties into Russell Brand, the great awakening, rips the pharmaceutical and military industrial complex
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  and explains how it all works. Russell Brand shuts down MSNBC Stooge,
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  calls network propaganda's nutcrackery for suppressing COVID debate.
[28:03.000 --> 28:13.000]  Who urges countries to reveal intel on COVID origins after FBI Director's statements saying it's China?
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.000]  That's just some of what we've got coming up here for you today on this broadcast.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  But what we know is what they admit. The shots don't work to protect you.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  They make you get more hospitalized, sicker, and die statistically.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  And they knew it the whole time and lied to everyone.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  We're going to be laying it all out when we come back.
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.000]  And then Trump's big announcements declaring war on the New World Order and pledging retribution against the globalists
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  and a lot more. That's coming up today as well.
[28:48.000 --> 28:54.000]  Band-Aught Video, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. We'll be right back. Please stay with us.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  So get your copy of the Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowars.com.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  You'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowars.com and get a signed copy
[29:52.000 --> 29:57.000]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give them to the local school.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.000]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  And again, I have infowars to thank for that.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info wars team
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping American people.
[30:50.000 --> 30:55.000]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  and the world is an insane place.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  World War III has already started.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  Biden is a puppet and this is all over our borders.
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  There's mass censorship.
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas.
[31:15.000 --> 31:18.000]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[31:18.000 --> 31:22.000]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at infowars.com.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  Whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out,
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  with a great reset in the world, or ultimate bone broth, finally back in stock after over two years.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  It's all available at infowars.com.
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  These are truly amazing products.
[31:45.000 --> 31:51.000]  So get your infowars products at infowars.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[31:51.000 --> 32:06.000]  It is your decision whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at infowars.com.
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  Think of what we've done with just one percent of our massive audience actually buying products.
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowars.com
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  and got some of these amazing products.
[32:34.000 --> 32:40.000]  I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  So you reorder and see how great it is.
[32:42.000 --> 32:48.000]  Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good if you're in neurological systems,
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  your brain, your joints, your bones as well, or real Red Bull Plus.
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.000]  Just go try the product, fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler together.
[32:56.000 --> 33:19.000]  infowarstore.com
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  infowarstore.com
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  So we talk about the great awakening being here and the corporate media being caught in more and more fake news
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.000]  and hysteria, the scares and the submission.
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.000]  We're going to get more into that in a moment with a powerful Russell Brand clip from Bill Maher.
[33:48.000 --> 33:55.000]  But first, let's play a short clip, narrative collapsing, unexplained deaths, a shift and the story is coming.
[33:55.000 --> 34:01.000]  Here's stock picker and researcher Edward Dowd on The War Room with Steve Bannon.
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  In this debacle that's unfolding, I'm privy to a lot of chatter and communication with sources.
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  And over the weekend, one of my sources in the government told me that there's going to be a narrative change,
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.000]  that the White House is potentially preparing to declare an epidemic, an epidemic of sudden death,
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  and that they might blame long COVID and potentially, believe it or not, climate change.
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  That's being debated now in the halls of government, whether they do it or not, it doesn't matter.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  But the reason why I put that tweet out, because I hear a lot of chatter, a couple things happen.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  One, we had the Monday night football incident, which raised the consciousness of the country.
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  And then the Rasmussen poll, which came out, which suggests that the awareness of vaccine,
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.000]  sudden death and injuries is going bigger than I think most people think.
[34:53.000 --> 35:00.000]  So I think the establishment has to address the issue of sudden death and disability,
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  and they're going to likely blame long COVID.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  And if they throw climate change in there, that would be even more comical.
[35:07.000 --> 35:16.000]  Dead on. Now, here's Dr. Martin McCary in must-see congressional hearings that we've got posted in FullWars.com.
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  He and other doctors and scientists destroying the official narrative that now is admitted a total fraud by design.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  Here's the clips.
[35:25.000 --> 35:34.000]  Misinformation. The greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  Misinformation that COVID was spread through surface transmission.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  That vaccinated immunity was far greater than natural immunity.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  That masks were effective.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Now we have the definitive Cochrane review. What do you do with that review?
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  Cochrane is the most authoritative evidence body in all of medicine.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  It has been for decades. Do you just ignore it, not talk about it?
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  Myocarditis was more common after the infection than the vaccine. Not true.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  It's four to 28 times more common after the vaccine.
[36:06.000 --> 36:18.000]  The young people benefit from a booster. Misinformation. Our two top experts on vaccines quit the FDA in protest over this particular issue,
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  pushing boosters in young, healthy people. The data was never there.
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.000]  That's why the CDC never disclosed hospitalization rates among boosts in Americans under age 50.
[36:30.000 --> 36:37.000]  The vaccine mandates would increase vaccination rates. The George Mason University study shows it didn't.
[36:37.000 --> 36:47.000]  It did one thing. It created never-vaxxers who are now not getting the childhood vaccines they need to get.
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.000]  Over and over again, we've seen something that goes far beyond using your best judgment with the information at hand.
[36:53.000 --> 37:02.000]  We've seen something which is unforgivable, and that is the weaponization of medical research itself.
[37:02.000 --> 37:10.000]  The CDC putting out their own shoddy studies, like their own study on natural immunity looking at one state for two months.
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  When they had data for years on all 50 states, why did they only report that one sliver of data?
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  Why did they salami slice the giant database? Because it gave them the result they wanted. Same with masking study.
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  Well, the data has now caught up in giant systematic reviews, and public health officials were intellectually dishonest.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  They lied to the American people. Thank you.
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.000]  And the same lies were put out in a standardized way all over the world.
[37:40.000 --> 37:50.000]  I Big Pharma controlling the United Nations and Big Tech, and now everywhere, even on CNN, they're coming out admitting that it was a lie.
[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  Because the rats are leaving the sinking ship. What was the larger plan? What's coming next in my view and my research?
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  I'll get to that coming up. And I wanted to play this Russell Brand clip.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  The full Bill Maher interview and debate is posted on FullWars.com.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  But again, Russell Brand, their sayings on New Alex Jones, because now it's safe to tell the truth. Here it is.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  I'll just say one more thing about the pharma part of it.
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  Purdue Pharma, you're familiar. There's a terrific movie, Michael Keaton movie, Dope Sick.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  That was, okay.
[38:23.000 --> 38:29.000]  If you need an opioid, Purdue Pharma will sell you them at a reasonable price, whether you need them or not.
[38:29.000 --> 38:39.000]  I should add, these opioids can be quite moorish, and even some would say addictive. So do be cautious.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  And then you would know. You were there, right?
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  There was a time where I did become a little bit dependent on heroin. Thankfully, Purdue were not operating in my country.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  So I may not be here now, and I'm very grateful that I am.
[38:51.000 --> 39:00.000]  Well, and we are too. And there's something called Hillbilly heroin. That's called OxyContin.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  And that's what they were pushing.
[39:02.000 --> 39:10.000]  But just in October 2020, when the Justice Department announced Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty of felony charges of defrauding federal agencies,
[39:10.000 --> 39:19.000]  violating anti-kickback laws, marketing opioids to hundreds of doctors that it suspected were writing illegal prescriptions,
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  and then lying about it to the DEA. So they got slapped with an $8.3 billion fine.
[39:25.000 --> 39:34.000]  I'm just, my last question is just the cognitive dissonance that I see, that people see, oh my God, the pharmaceutical industry is capable of doing this.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  But when it comes to COVID, no questions asked. It just does seem weird.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  Bill, if I may say.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Well, why don't you answer that one?
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  Oh, well, let's run to it.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  Well.
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  Yeah, you have a turn.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  Yeah.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  John, I'll offer you this challenge.
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  Get the word sputum into your answer for bonus points.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  I've been sitting here thinking about that the entire time.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  I could tell because I'm looking below the desk.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  Oh, here we go.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  Look, we have a complicated relationship with the pharmaceutical industry.
[40:07.000 --> 40:16.000]  Anybody who's ever had a family member who's had cancer and seen what life-saving drugs can do for people.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  It also may have given it to them.
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  It may have.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  But that's actually kind of my point.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  The reality is that if you have a black and white point of view, the pharmaceutical industry has engaged in a giant conspiracy to f**k us all over.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  You are denying the reality that many people have lies been saved by those drugs.
[40:31.000 --> 40:38.000]  If you say the pharmaceutical industry is incapable of error or malign behavior, you're equally an idiot.
[40:38.000 --> 40:45.000]  The reality is that in a capitalist society, there are going to be companies that seeking profit will do things that are incredibly innovative and good.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  And do things that are incredibly terrible and exploitive.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  That seems like the right position to have.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  I agree.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  Let's just be skeptical.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  Great.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  Right.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  Okay.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  And that's across the board.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  Sure.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  All right.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  Moving on.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Bill.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Yes.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  I have respect for you and your show.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  I've bought some facts.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  Would you?
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  If you'd like, they're actually...
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  You just get f**ked out of here.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  This is not the place.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  No, you're not a fact.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  We love facts.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  I love facts.
[41:12.000 --> 41:17.000]  I wouldn't have mentioned it. I'm English and you know that politeness is our fundamental religion.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  Yeah.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  But they do pertain to this issue.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  So may I say something?
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  Please.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  If they inconvenience you, I'll stop saying them.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  The pandemic created at least 40 new big pharma billionaires.
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer made $1,000 of profit every second from the COVID-19 vaccine.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  More than two-thirds of Congress received campaign funding from pharmaceutical companies in the 2020 election.
[41:39.000 --> 41:46.000]  Pfizer chairman Albert Baller told Time Magazine in July 2020 that his company was developing a COVID vaccine for the good of humanity, not for money.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  And of course Pfizer made $100 billion in profit in 2022.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  All right.
[41:51.000 --> 41:58.000]  And may I just mention finally, and this is also a fact, that you, the American public, funded the development of that.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  The German public funded the BioNTech vaccine.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  When it came to the profits, they took the profits.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  When it came to the funding, you paid for the funding.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  It's difficult not to...
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  But I will just add one thing.
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  It is possible that these are greedy capitalists who made a lot of money.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  And also there are a lot of people who did need the vaccine.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  Yes.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  There are a lot of people who did need the vaccine.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  I did never want to be told I was one of them who had to take it.
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  But there are lots of people who needed that vaccine and would be dead without it.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  That is true too.
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  Built.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  That is true too.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  More facts.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  All I'm querying is this.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  Yes.
[42:37.000 --> 42:43.000]  You have an economic system in which pharmaceutical companies benefit hugely from medical emergencies.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  Where a military industrial complex benefits from war.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  Where energy companies benefit from energy crisis.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  You are going to generate states of perpetual crisis.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  For the interests of ordinary people.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  Separate from the interests of the elites.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  That have gone to infowarstore.com and gotten the great products.
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  That enrich your life.

[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  And keep us on air.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  I am humbly.
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  Had in hand.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  Talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  Many of you for years.
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  And never gone to infowarstore.com.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  We know the vast vast vast vast majority of you.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  Never actually go to infowarstore.com.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  And never experience these great products.
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  And never find the operation.
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  Sure you share a link.
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  You share an article.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  You tell folks about the show.
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  That's great.
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  And I thank you.
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  But we need funds to operate.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  Plus we've got really great products.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  That do amazing things for people like our CBD oil.

[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  Plus you're missing out on these products.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  So get off the bench.
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.000]  Get in the game.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  Step to the plate.

[44:11.000 --> 44:12.000]  The bad news is.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  Around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners.

[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  And it is.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  Because of Lister's and viewers supporting us.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  When we talk about the crew at info wars.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  People behind the scenes.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  The researchers.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  The writers.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  And the hard work they engage in every day.
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  5, 6, 7 days a week.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  It's really just incredible.

[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  But most viewers and listeners.
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  Never go to infowarstore.com.

[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  Final segment of hour number one,
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  I'm going to shift gears out of the whole COVID narrative,
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  collapsing.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  And the poison injections.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  This segment, I'm going to finish up with the most important
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  information on this subject.
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.580]  Trump declaring war on the new world order and so much more that we're gonna
[47:42.580 --> 47:46.620]  get into the latest war news we're gonna get into how the globalists are putting
[47:46.620 --> 47:50.740]  in incompetent idiots everywhere at the top so they have plausible deniability
[47:50.740 --> 47:53.940]  when those idiots carry out the globalist agenda so the globalists don't get
[47:53.940 --> 47:59.420]  to blame that's all coming up in hour number two tonight and remember we're
[47:59.420 --> 48:03.460]  saving a lot of lives all of us are together by exposing the globalist
[48:03.460 --> 48:07.780]  agenda by exposing their biomedical tyranny about exposing their casual
[48:07.780 --> 48:12.620]  society and the system they're bringing in and that's why you're so important
[48:12.620 --> 48:17.460]  to spread in the word about the live show and taking interviews and clips from
[48:17.460 --> 48:21.420]  the show and sharing them you're the reason we're reaching in many ways more
[48:21.420 --> 48:25.180]  people than ever had roseanne bar in been talking to her for years on the phone
[48:25.180 --> 48:31.380]  she moved to Texas and in her words she showed the real roseanne bar not the
[48:31.380 --> 48:35.460]  comic not the lady getting laughs yesterday but a very serious smart lady
[48:35.460 --> 48:39.820]  that almost two-hour commercial free interview with her is posted right now
[48:39.820 --> 48:43.380]  for free for everybody that banned on video thought it was really powerful
[48:43.380 --> 48:47.220]  enjoy getting to meet her and her family in person and going to dinner with them
[48:47.220 --> 48:54.340]  last night okay this is a 20 minute report they knocked it out of the park
[48:54.340 --> 48:59.940]  we covered this months ago but it hasn't gotten the attention it needs but in
[48:59.940 --> 49:04.340]  this 20 minute report I'm looking there like nine minutes of right now they lay
[49:04.340 --> 49:09.300]  out the next shoot a drop in the biomedical tyranny the next bio attack
[49:09.300 --> 49:13.540]  it's gonna be much more serious in my view and that's Bill Gates and the UN
[49:13.540 --> 49:17.980]  and others running a drill a few months ago of this new contagion that only
[49:17.980 --> 49:22.820]  kills children they think that will really get their world government UN
[49:22.820 --> 49:27.780]  treaty passed that they're currently trying to get ratified in the US Senate
[49:27.780 --> 49:33.220]  or is about to be brought to be ratified by the US Senate so the great next
[49:33.220 --> 49:38.460]  pandemic Gates's newest New World Order weapon here's the first half the video
[49:38.460 --> 49:43.860]  we're posting the full video right now at info wars.com in the live show feed

[50:00.980 --> 50:05.260]  own article as well because this is the next shoot a drop this is the next
[50:05.260 --> 50:10.820]  bullet loaded the chamber aimed at our gun at our head this is what needs to be
[50:10.820 --> 50:13.940]  exposed because we're not just here to say oh we were right about this in the
[50:13.940 --> 50:19.060]  past we were right about that info wars is really about what's info wars is
[50:19.060 --> 50:24.380]  really about telling you what is coming next so we can stop it together so we
[50:24.380 --> 50:29.420]  go the live show feed Sunday live Trump declares America will have
[50:29.420 --> 50:33.940]  retribution and final battle against New World Order and the globalist under
[50:33.940 --> 50:37.460]  that we're going to post this full report and the full video so you can see
[50:37.460 --> 50:41.660]  it so you can share it so you get it out to people and I'm also going to have
[50:41.660 --> 50:47.820]  this video and article posted on its own to info wars.com Bill Gates's next big
[50:47.820 --> 50:56.220]  pandemic to target the children that's your headline here's part of the report
[50:56.220 --> 50:59.880]  Bill Gates has been caught targeting young people and children in a
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.060]  dystopian preparedness exercise called catastrophic contagion Gates is trying
[51:05.060 --> 51:08.580]  desperately to stop any information about this disturbing summit from leaking
[51:08.580 --> 51:12.700]  out to the public but unfortunately for him there are now too many brave people
[51:12.700 --> 51:16.500]  determined to expose his evil to the world thanks to the brave whistleblowers
[51:16.500 --> 51:20.860]  we have got all the information you need about catastrophic contagion but first
[51:20.860 --> 51:25.260]  let's take a look at Gates's form when it comes to what he calls preparedness
[51:25.260 --> 51:30.100]  exercises remember event 201 a preparedness exercise featuring a
[51:30.100 --> 51:35.500]  coronavirus pandemic conducted on October 2019 under the auspices of
[51:35.500 --> 51:39.220]  World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and involving
[51:39.220 --> 51:44.740]  the usual suspects including the World Health Organization China CDC Anthony
[51:44.740 --> 51:49.980]  Fauci and others the timing was exquisite and the COVID-19 pandemic
[51:49.980 --> 51:53.820]  started within weeks of the exercise and went on just as they predicted it
[51:53.820 --> 51:58.420]  would the globalist elite were in heaven the World Economic Forum could not
[51:58.420 --> 52:02.500]  resist gloating about the situation seeing praise as a brutally efficient
[52:02.500 --> 52:05.140]  lockdowns the average person was terrified into
[52:05.140 --> 52:10.260]  submissive compliance by mainstream media who shamelessly served as handmaidens
[52:10.260 --> 52:15.460]  for the elite we were locked down punished made ill injected and impoverished
[52:15.460 --> 52:19.980]  the economic consequences for everyday people have been disastrous and are
[52:19.980 --> 52:24.460]  continuing to mount in case you doubt that the elite are happy about this take
[52:24.460 --> 52:29.340]  a look at the size of Bill Gates's psychopathic smile when CNN host Farid
[52:29.340 --> 52:33.980]  Sakaria says the economy is going to take a long time to recover the economy
[52:33.980 --> 52:37.740]  is not going to be anything like it was it's going to take a long time to
[52:37.740 --> 52:41.340]  recover it's going to be you know people are going to be surprised at how slow and
[52:41.340 --> 52:47.460]  how how fitful this is boys it's going to take a long time to recover of course
[52:47.460 --> 52:52.180]  the rich got richer the elites are now more elites than ever before and of
[52:52.180 --> 52:55.140]  course the elites themselves did not have to suffer through the punishing
[52:55.140 --> 52:59.340]  lockdowns the World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum are both
[52:59.340 --> 53:02.780]  based in Switzerland which happens to be one of the few countries that did not
[53:02.780 --> 53:07.700]  enforce lockdowns or mask mandates it's one rule for the and another for me
[53:07.700 --> 53:10.820]  considering what humanity has been forced to go through these past few
[53:10.820 --> 53:14.740]  years it's imperative that we keep a very close eye on the actions of those who
[53:14.740 --> 53:18.820]  profited from the pandemic in particular you should be aware that Bill Gates just
[53:18.820 --> 53:23.260]  conducted another exercise actually called catastrophic contagion on
[53:23.260 --> 53:28.620]  October 23rd 2022 Bill himself showed up to conduct the tabletop exercise with
[53:28.620 --> 53:33.780]  luminaries from the world of biosecurity and global health including 10 current
[53:33.780 --> 53:38.300]  and former health ministers and senior health officials from a variety of WEF
[53:38.300 --> 53:42.540]  infiltrated countries including Germany Singapore and India what was
[53:42.540 --> 53:47.540]  catastrophic contagion planning it was planning a severe pandemic worse than
[53:47.540 --> 53:52.900]  COVID-19 targeting young people and kids
[53:55.260 --> 54:00.580]  officials in two Latin American countries alerted the WHO of several
[54:00.580 --> 54:05.500]  outbreaks of a new infectious disease that's mysteriously appearing across the
[54:05.500 --> 54:12.060]  region severe epidemic enterovirus respiratory syndrome 2025 over the past
[54:12.060 --> 54:15.500]  six weeks alone all right we're gonna go back to more of this report in a
[54:15.500 --> 54:20.460]  moment but you understand why they do these drills at the UN level if they
[54:20.460 --> 54:23.900]  get caught with actual battle plans to release bio weapons they'll all get
[54:23.900 --> 54:29.020]  executed so they always have drills and a pre-plan that matches what they
[54:29.020 --> 54:34.220]  actually roll out and do we know that and that's why the spars 2025 2028
[54:34.220 --> 54:39.420]  document done about a year before they released COVID did exactly that and
[54:39.420 --> 54:44.700]  even had the exact same tweets just moving around the acronyms that they
[54:44.700 --> 54:48.820]  then later actually used as their official tweets so they wargame this
[54:48.820 --> 54:53.460]  they drill this like the military does drills and does exercises they do
[54:53.460 --> 54:57.740]  before they do it so what you're seeing is what they're planning next let's
[54:57.740 --> 55:05.060]  continue 2025 over the past six weeks alone there have been 500 confirmed or
[55:05.060 --> 55:11.060]  suspected cases reported the virus could cause a severe pandemic if early
[55:11.060 --> 55:16.940]  containment and mitigation efforts are not successful the pandemic in this
[55:16.940 --> 55:23.500]  type of situation and trend would be a risk for the global health security
[55:23.500 --> 55:28.700]  pandemics are inherently political financial and so much broader we have
[55:28.700 --> 55:35.740]  not spoken on the leadership in country and I think that we need to be also very
[55:35.740 --> 55:41.660]  careful we cannot decide a lot of things without the leaders be involved and
[55:41.660 --> 55:46.860]  agree on that there is no substitute for national leadership it's important to
[55:46.860 --> 55:50.460]  support the local response of the national response training those that
[55:50.460 --> 55:56.980]  is these areas first enabling them with the tools protecting them and if needs
[55:56.980 --> 56:02.700]  the regional solidarity first at this stage communication is key and
[56:02.700 --> 56:08.940]  communication should include not just scientists with data but also social
[56:08.940 --> 56:14.820]  religious and political leaders trust this is an essential issue and trust
[56:14.820 --> 56:20.780]  was broken among countries between populations and health care systems
[56:20.780 --> 56:28.100]  in health care systems and governments very sorry to say that in 2025 we need
[56:28.100 --> 56:34.460]  to strengthen the health system WHO needs to be a voice for the voiceless
[56:38.300 --> 56:44.780]  all right ladies and gentlemen as of today there have been an estimate
[56:44.780 --> 56:49.820]  one billion cases worldwide with more than 20 million deaths including
[56:49.820 --> 56:54.260]  nearly 15 million children countless millions are alive but left with
[56:54.260 --> 56:58.940]  paralysis or brain damage the most successful countries are those which
[56:58.940 --> 57:03.860]  invested in preparedness and trained for this moment years in advance this
[57:03.860 --> 57:07.940]  included having full-time pandemic preparedness and response teams which
[57:07.940 --> 57:13.740]  conducted detailed operational planning hi pause the rest of reports about

[57:22.060 --> 57:25.540]  everything and take over your body to make you take more poison shots and

[59:50.340 --> 59:59.020]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[59:59.020 --> 01:00:18.300]  in Hollywood in the comic books growing up the super villains always hold the
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:24.500]  world hostage and promise to destroy it if you don't give in to their demands to
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:29.140]  let them rule the planet because again like making the brain says everybody
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.820]  wants to rule the world well the club of Rome a group of powerful robber barons
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:38.340]  and billionaires back in the 60s got together and they publicly wrote articles
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:42.540]  about this and said we want a way to unify the world into a world government
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:47.020]  and to do that we're gonna make people the bad guys and carbon the bad guy and
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:52.140]  then we'll get everyone to accept paying us carbon taxes and following all of our
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:57.220]  orders because we're the saviors of the earth that's so sick when somebody tells
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.500]  you do what I say or the world's gonna end they're a cult leader they're a
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.780]  criminal they're a threat to everybody and they use the whole attack on carbon
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.820]  dioxide and the carbon taxes they want us to pay them as a way to divert away
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.620]  from the genetic engineering the terminator seeds the toxic waste dumping
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:18.780]  all of it these people know what they're doing ladies and gentlemen they want a
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.860]  post-human world and one of their adherents of course is Ted Turner the
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.700]  founder of CNN and he set up a Georgia guide stones that calls for reducing the
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:31.580]  world down to 500 million people and of course these authoritarians the saviors
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.500]  of the earth they're going to oversee it all here at info wars we're fighting
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.660]  back against this cult we're fighting back against these people that are
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.100]  telling you that you're the bad guys you've been cast as that I've been cast as
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.580]  that and they are the saviors of the earth who are gonna fly around their
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.020]  private jets and live in palaces and have five kids but you can't have a car you
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.140]  can't have air conditioning and you can't have children this is a way to make
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.660]  slavery cool again surf them cool again an info war stands firmly against it so
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.300]  whatever you do remember your destiny is in your hands when you spread the word
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.220]  about info wars.com for its last show in band.video you shake these criminals to
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.420]  their very foundations we've reached a tipping point press the attack we will
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:21.020]  have a pro-human future. I don't think that we are discussing climate change the
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:27.940]  way we need to be discussing it. We are in the midst of climate change right now
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:32.740]  and it is only going to get worse. The world is gonna end in 12 years if we
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.340]  don't address climate change. The scientists also tell us have 12 years in
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:43.140]  which to answer that question 12 years within which to act. Like this is the
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.940]  war this is our world war two. We have 12 years to turn this around. We are
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:53.100]  less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. 10 years we
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.060]  have left to us. Within the 10 years that we have left to us we don't have more
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:02.820]  than 10 years to get this right. A little more than 10 years from now. There is no
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:07.460]  justice and there is no combatting climate change without addressing what
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:12.340]  has happened to indigenous communities. I speak to you as a human being a woman
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:17.220]  whose dreams of motherhood now taste bitter sweet because of what I know
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.180]  about our children's future. You have stolen my dreams my childhood with your
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:27.180]  empty words. This is about our lives this is about American lives. That our
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.540]  community will be uninhabitable not sustain human life along this current
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:36.100]  trajectory. I am here to say our house is on fire. It's a crisis that could at its
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:41.740]  worst lead to extinction. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. People
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:49.460]  are dying. People are suffering. People are dying. How dare you?
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.860]  Brock and Michelle Obama they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard. I
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:16.740]  shouldn't say house. This is a massive incredible beachfront estate and it's
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.060]  time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say I don't know what's going to
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:27.140]  happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:33.700]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:08.100]  This is their big move. So yeah you say why doesn't Biden address the
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:13.140]  disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.660]  president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:24.780]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed and that's
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:32.100]  who we are. Autocrats only understand one word. No. No. No. Exactly and that's why
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:38.700]  we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:43.700]  no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.980]  no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:52.180]  getting us into World War three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:58.380]  Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:23.060]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:38.060]  info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. We are now into hour number two on this
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:44.420]  live Sunday March 5th 2023 transmission. I'm your host Alex Jones. So here's some
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:50.380]  of the headlines. President Trump pledges to stay with 24 election race even if
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:56.380]  he is criminally charged and the word is out of Georgia. It is imminent by that
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:03.220]  kangaroo grand jury and the clowns that we've been seeing. So we're going to be
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.660]  monitoring and tracking all of that. Let's play the first clip. Trump I will
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:14.540]  totally obliterate the deep state. Here it is. And if you put me back in the White
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:20.940]  House their reign is over. Their reign will be over and they know it. And America
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:25.020]  will be a free nation once again. We're not a free nation right now. We don't have
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:32.780]  free press. We don't have free anything. In 2016 I declared I am your voice. Today
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:38.980]  I add I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:44.900]  and betrayed. I am your retribution. I am your retribution. Not going to let this
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:57.980]  happen. Not going to let it happen. I will totally obliterate the deep state. I will
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:18.900]  fire. Well that's got to scare the New World Order. And that's why they don't
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.780]  want him back in. Not saying Trump is a pick-headed. Not saying he isn't wrong on
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:27.700]  things. But he definitely was the president. Tried to run the country. But I'd like to
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:32.220]  see a pledge from Trump. No more Jared Kushner if he gets back in office. Because he did
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.900]  steal the election from Trump. He deserves to be in office right now. Regardless of what
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:41.220]  you think about it. But definitely those are fighting words in the New World Order. Look
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:46.940]  how far we've come in the great awakening right now. And if a country doesn't have borders
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:53.740]  it doesn't have sovereignty. Here's Trump on what he would do on mass deportation if
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:09:00.020]  it reelected to be the 47th president of the United States. When I'm back in the White
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:05.140]  House the very first reconciliation bill I will sign will be for a massive increase
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:18.420]  in border patrol and a colossal increase in the number of ICE deportation officers.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:23.940]  And I want to thank the border patrol. These are incredible people. And I want to thank
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:30.060]  ICE, and in particular I want to thank Brandon Judd, border patrol, and Tom Holman, central
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:39.420]  casting. He's central casting. Under my leadership we will use all necessary state, local, federal,
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:45.860]  and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:56.500]  history. Other countries are emptying out their prisons, insane asylums, and mental institutions,
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:04.020]  and sending all of their problems right into their dumping ground, the USA. Think of it.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.580]  They're emptying out their prisons, and you've heard me say that, but they're also emptying
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:14.500]  out their mental institutions. And to use a strong couple of words, insane asylums,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:21.180]  that's where anybody sees silence of the Lamb, that's where they come from, insane asylums.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.740]  That's a stronger word than a mental institution. And they're putting them into our country.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:30.900]  Thank you very much. I will ask every state and federal agency to identify every known
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:35.900]  or suspected gang member in America and every one of them that is here illegally, and the
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:41.500]  towns know who they are. The towns and cities are the police. We love our police. The police
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:54.380]  know who they are. And we will pick them up, and we will throw them out of our country,
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.500]  and there will be no questions asked.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:03.380]  Yeah, if you stayed in Mexico illegally, they'd throw you out the same way, or anywhere else,
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.540]  like Poland. But we are the dumping ground now, ladies and gentlemen, for the criminals,
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.220]  for the insane, for the fentanyl, for everything else, that's how the globalists are attacking
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:18.700]  America. Regardless of what you think of Trump, whether you love him, whether you're kind
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.660]  of in the middle of the road, like I am, or you hate him, this is going to be spectacular
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:30.220]  in the next few months, in the next few years, with what the system is going to do to try
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:37.060]  to stop Trump. It's just wild, absolutely wild. And in all the polls he's leading to
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:42.220]  Sanis, so it's going to be crazy. And when Robert Kennedy Jr. declares he's running
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:47.540]  for president, which the word is, he is, he's saying he's mulling it against Biden, because
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:51.220]  the Democratic Party won't even challenge Biden, they won't do anything against him.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.980]  Imagine when somebody like Kennedy runs, with his pedigree and his background and the work
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:12:00.220]  he's done against Biden, how big that's going to be. Something else Trump talked about that's
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:10.100]  the antithesis of the smart cities, the 15-minute cities, the whole New World Order, by June
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:16.260]  2030. He's talking about these new freedom cities built on federal land. And more than
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:22.260]  half the West is federal, this is really a great innovative idea to bring jobs and good
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:27.060]  foreigners and good workers and give American citizens jobs. Here's Trump talking about a
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:32.380]  quantum leap in the U.S. standard of living with creation of freedom cities.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:38.100]  Past generations of Americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:44.260]  absolutely impossible. They pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:51.860]  in the wild frontier. They transformed American life with the interstate highway system, magnificent
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:58.980]  it was, and they launched a vast network of satellites into orbit all around the Earth.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:05.180]  But today, our country has lost its boldness. Under my leadership, we will get it back in
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:11.380]  a very big way. If you look at just three years ago, what we were doing was unthinkable
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:18.100]  how good it was, how great it was for our country. Our objective will be a quantum leap
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:22.900]  in the American standard of living. That's what will happen. Here are just a few of the
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:28.220]  ways we can do it. Almost one third of the land mass of the United States is owned by
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:36.220]  the federal government with just a very, very small portion of that land, just a fraction.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:42.220]  One half of one percent, would you believe that? We should hold a contest to charter
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:49.740]  up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development. In other words,
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:55.580]  we'll actually build new cities in our country again. These freedom cities will reopen the
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:01.740]  frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:09.100]  and other people all hardworking families a new shot at home ownership and in fact the
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:15.220]  American dream. Another big opportunity is in transportation. Dozens of major companies
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:21.260]  in the United States and China are racing to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:27.140]  for families and individuals. Just as the United States led the automotive revolution
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:33.220]  in the last century, I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:40.700]  in air mobility. These breakthroughs can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:47.180]  into rural America, and connect families and our country in new ways. Likewise, through
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:53.620]  our strategic national manufacturing initiative, which is going to be very big and very, very
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:15:00.700]  successful, we will turn forgotten communities into hives of industry, producing the goods
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:06.420]  we will no longer import from China. We will also have a major initiative on lowering the
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:12.860]  cost of living with a special focus on lowering the cost of a new car and lowering the cost
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.780]  to build a single family home, and they will be beautiful homes.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.260]  Okay, fade this down, fade it down and back it up. I'm going to come back and finish this,
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:25.620]  but this is the antithesis of banning single parent homes, banning private ownership of
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:31.180]  homes. He's talking about the Jetsons future that we could have instead of the New World
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:37.500]  Order post-industrial future, literally. And it's not within our grasp, it's guaranteed
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:41.780]  that we decide to have a pro-human future and not an anti-human future. So now we got
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:47.620]  Musk and Trump, everybody's saying the same thing. Yes, that idea is doable, and it's
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:53.700]  very sellable versus the nightmare. This topia of the left will be right back with more on
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:58.700]  the other side.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:03.700]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government. Applying this
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:08.700]  has been found and is now in the possession of the Army. There was a bulletin from CBS
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:16.060]  News. President Kennedy has been shot. This is a different kind of war. The USS Liberty
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.900]  had just been attacked by Israeli jets after Peter Burns. The CIA could manipulate the
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.460]  news in the United States. They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:30.220]  die on a cold spot. It was almost as if it were a plan to give the folks a gift of tank
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:36.980]  and we need to go into the capital. You will always have conspiracy theories. They are
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:43.180]  nothing but distract. You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:49.140]  What we want to do in Davos is to reset, but as soon as we start exposing the great
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:58.740]  nation, reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:04.260]  There is a war for the future happening right now. There is a war that will control my destiny,
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.700]  your destiny, our children's destiny. And that war is something that we can win, but
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:13.620]  it takes dedication. It takes commitment. That's why I ask listeners, respectively,

[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:03.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World is a historic
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:07.660]  book that documents the global to their own words, plan for our future that is a hellish
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.820]  future. Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.100]  them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:20.380]  amazon or infowarstore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:25.100]  book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:30.380]  right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:34.860]  infowarstore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:38.940]  the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.580]  know that you help keep info wars on the air. I want to thank those of you that have gotten
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.700]  signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.340]  yet to go to infowarstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.740]  and donate to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war. I'm
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:00.460]  counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:07.460]  Anything of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:37.460]  So even if Trump doesn't do the things he says he's going to do, he did implement a lot
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:49.540]  of the things he said he would do eight years ago, six years ago. What Elon Musk and Trump
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:56.820]  were saying is, hey, prosperity, have children, build a better world, go to space, innovate,
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:03.820]  build new cities, America's open for business, single family homes, cars, cars that fly,
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:11.020]  not electric cars that don't work, but a real system. This is revolutionary against the
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:15.180]  globalist. This is what I've talked about. We can't just talk about how the globalist
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:20.100]  plan is horrible, but not have our own plan. This is part of the Great Awakening. It's
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.860]  beautiful. It's happening. Let's finish that clip of Trump.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:29.380]  The big opportunity is in transportation. Dozens of major companies in the United States
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:36.380]  and China are racing to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles for families and individuals.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:42.380]  Just as the United States led the automotive revolution in the last century, I want to
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:49.300]  ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility. These breakthroughs
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:56.020]  can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural America, and connect
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:02.820]  families and our country in new ways. Likewise, through our Strategic National Manufacturing
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:08.860]  Initiative, which is going to be very big and very, very successful, we will turn forgotten
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:15.860]  communities into hives of industry, producing the goods we will no longer import from China.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:22.340]  We will also have a major initiative on lowering the cost of living with a special focus on
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:28.500]  lowering the cost of a new car and lowering the cost to build a single family home, and
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:34.180]  there will be beautiful homes. And I will ask Congress to support baby bonuses for young
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:40.860]  parents to help launch a new baby boom. Finally, I'll challenge the governors of all 50 states
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:47.860]  to join me in a great modernization and beautification campaign, getting rid of ugly buildings, refurbishing
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:55.180]  our parks and our public spaces, making cities and towns more livable, ensuring a pristine
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:23:01.860]  environment, and building towering monuments to our true American heroes. Very importantly,
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:08.860]  I will also make sure all of these new places are safe. We love and cherish our police. They
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:15.020]  will do the job the way they have to. It is time to start talking about greatness for
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:21.140]  our country again. I will dramatically increase living standards and build a future that brings
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:27.140]  our country together through excitement, opportunity, and success. Thank you very much.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:32.140]  You see, the globalists are giving us false revolutions. Don't worry about the fact your
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.900]  privacy is being taken. Don't worry about the fact you're being censored. Don't worry
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:37.980]  about the fact you're being flooded with illegal aliens. Don't worry about all these
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:43.660]  other attacks and we're funding World War III. Our revolution is boys can be girls and
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:48.780]  girls can be boys and we're going to have drag queen pedo time. They give you all these
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:54.060]  fake leftist innovations. Oh, you get PCs on the ground and injection needles, but you
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:59.580]  get a drag queen. You get a drag queen story time. We've got a bunch of that coming up
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:04.620]  next segment. I also want to look at Nikola Tesla technology because people talk about
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:08.820]  Tesla being a genius and that's true, but his technology wasn't implemented because
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:16.940]  it'll fry your ass. A lot of it will kill you and they admit that. And I've got some
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:26.700]  demonstrations of it. And why am I attacking Tesla? I'm not. 5G is a Tesla technology. It's
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:32.860]  that it's radiation folks. It's high powered. I'm going to explain it. I'm going to show
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:38.260]  it coming up, but let's get back to what we're talking about. Trump's saying he'll totally
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:43.300]  obliterate the deep state. Support the illegals. Let's shift gears. What are the globalists
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.500]  are up to? Gates Foundation commits 200 million of digital ID and other public infrastructure
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:58.220]  for a world ID trying to implement Gigi Ping's computer program that China's already using.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:02.620]  Look at the military front. Two Ukrainian pilots are being trained by the U.S. military
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:08.220]  to fly F-16s as a test model to see if they can train them on simulators to then train
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:15.060]  hundreds or even thousands of pilots later. That's a beta test. Only NATO or nukes can
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:20.900]  save Ukraine from Russia. Estonian foreign minister says and Zelensky agrees, give us
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:26.220]  nukes. He says he'll nuke Russia. Oh, and he fires missiles into Poland when Zelensky
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.740]  does and blames on Russia like he did a few months ago. Giving him nuclear weapons is
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:39.300]  beyond insane. West may be deliberately concealing findings of probes and a Nord Stream blast
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:47.500]  says French general and maybe waters wet and fish swim in the ocean. Escalation. Biden
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:56.340]  men responds to Russian warning by handing Zelensky another $400 million. U.S. develops
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:03.780]  AI-powered facial recognition tech for military robot hunter killer drones. Digital ID. U.S.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:09.020]  government poised for national rollout while Australia finds its North Star to harmonize
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:15.780]  standards. Global government forum announces the world currency. London mayor's city
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:21.340]  cons says far right vaccine deniers behind bid to block expansion of carbon tax green
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:26.540]  zone. So the same smart folks that were against poison shots, they don't want the green zones
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:30.420]  all being locked down and controlled and tracked. Oh, they're the bad guys. He doesn't deny
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:35.460]  they're doing 15-minute cities. It's also happening here in the U.S., run by the U.N.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:43.500]  He's saying you're bad if you don't accept it. And it goes on and on and on. I played
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:50.100]  this yesterday. We're going to play it coming up in the next segment. But the Chinese government
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:54.980]  has put out a short one-minute video showing what it will be like under their social credit
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:58.540]  score that's already implemented. If you've done anything the government doesn't like,
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:05.140]  can't fly on a plane, can't get on a train, can't get a bank loan, can't get a job. When
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:11.220]  you don't have a job, you go to a slave labor camp. Want to see a vision of the future?
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:17.380]  This is it. And that's coming up. And then as I said, the Nikola Tesla information, the
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:28.260]  ties into the 5G and so much more. But I wanted to hit this information. Is it all ties together?
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:35.540]  And we will. Bill Washington is a high school dropout with no aviation experience. Biden
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:40.340]  nominated him to lead the Federal Aviation Administration because he's black. His Senate
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.620]  confirmation hearing went down, as you'd expect. That clip is next segment and that
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:50.580]  ties into this. Ivy League University ditches standardized testing, will now judge the applicant
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:58.300]  on their background and their voice. Wow. But some good news. Drag Queen's show for babies
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:06.140]  canceled in the UK after public backlash showing naked men dancing in front of six-month-one-year-two-three-year-old
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:13.900]  children. And the left totally and completely defends it. Same thing in the UK. School kids
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:21.420]  taught how to masturbate and the virtues of rough sex in lessons, kidding from parents.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:26.180]  The pedification of everything. Going after innocence. The Dutch farmers have another
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:31.180]  big national protest against a third of their farms, set to be shut down the next few years.
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:39.300]  It's all happening total and absolute control. They're trying to break your will and sell
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:43.420]  you on slavery, but you don't have to roll over. You can stand up and say no. We're doing
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:47.580]  it. We've already won some major battles, but we're going to win the war together with
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:54.780]  God's help. Remember the coordinates of freedom, band.video, infowars.com, newswars.com. Have
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:29:22.780]  you shared the links today?
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:39.620]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions. You guys
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:45.580]  censored Harvard-educated doctors. You silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:56.580]  push to reset, but as soon as we start exposing the great reset, the soon as these globalists
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:01.380]  start going to prison.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:07.340]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:11.580]  place. World War III has already started. Biden is a puppet and this is all over our
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:15.500]  borders. There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas. The list
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.660]  goes on and on of the bad things that are happening, but the good things that are happening
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:23.900]  is humanity is really accelerating its awakening. But those of us on the forefront are under
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:28.260]  more attack by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm counting on you to spread the
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:31.740]  word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to hit the broadcast on the
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:36.100]  ear by getting great products at infowars.com. And whether it's a final signed copy, they're

[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:06.300]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:23.300]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:44.820]  front lines of the info war. Remember, while most of us are somewhat healthy and happy
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:50.420]  and secure tonight, that people are starving to death around the world under UN globalist
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:55.260]  sanctions caused by the two years of lockdowns being organized into giant armies who invade
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.420]  the United States and Europe. And remember that nearly a million people are without
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:08.140]  power as blackouts and blizzards leave Americans stranded all over areas of Northern California
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:15.980]  and other parts of Midwestern states with the massive global warming blizzard. Now let's
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:23.060]  get to the new FAA, Federal Aviation Administration head. And you look at Biden who can barely
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:27.460]  talk, you look at Fetterman who hadn't been seen in a month. You ask, what's going on
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.060]  here? Well, it's the same thing in Europe. They do the same thing. They put people in
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:35.940]  that are totally controlled at the top. So they're puppets. So when they carry out these
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:43.140]  horrible agendas and do terrible things, they can just blame the puppet. So here's Phil
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:47.220]  Washington, the high school dropout. And the left's argument was, well, he runs the Denver
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:55.980]  Airport. Well, exactly. With no aviation history, no facts, no nothing. They put him in there.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:59.980]  The media says because he's black. No, you could find competent black people take that
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:05.220]  job. It's an important job, a hard job. No, he's there because he's a puppet they politically
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:10.020]  control who's in trouble with the FBI and a criminal investigation. So they can blackmail
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:16.700]  him for full control to then let them sabotage aviation by doing every other industry with
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:21.220]  the general public. And then they won't get the blame. He will. Just like in France, they
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:30.100]  banned this year, 200, 300, 400, 500 mile domestic flights. You can take a train because planes
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.380]  are bad for carbon. Here's the clip of him being grilled in Congress.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:41.420]  Can you quickly tell me what airspace requires an ADS-B transponder? Not sure I can answer
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:47.180]  that question right now. That's okay. We'll just keep going. So that's a pretty important
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:52.980]  part. So what are the six types of special use airspace that protect this national security
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:58.020]  that appear on FAA charts? Sorry, Senator, I cannot answer that question. So what are
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:03.660]  the operational limitations of a pilot flying under basic med? Senator, I'm not a pilot.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:11.260]  Obviously, you'd ever see the Federal Aviation Administration. So any idea what those restrictions
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:15.820]  are under basic med quickly? Well, some of the restrictions, I think, would
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.780]  be high blood pressure. Some of them would be... It's more like how many passengers for
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:28.340]  airplane, how many pounds in different categories and what altitude you can find or so. And
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:34.260]  the amount of knots, it's under 250 knots. So it's not having anything to do with blood
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:36.460]  pressure. So can you tell me what causes an aircraft
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:42.580]  to spin or to stall? Again, Senator, I'm not a pilot. Okay. Let's
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:48.860]  keep going. What are the three aircraft certifications FAA requires as part of the manufacturing process?
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:57.740]  Quickly, please. Three aircraft certifications. Again, what I would say to that is that one
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:03.580]  of my first priorities would be to fully implement that certification act and report...
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:07.020]  Do you know the three types? Mr. Washington, the three types?
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.220]  No. Okay. Yeah, that's type certificate, production
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:13.220]  certificate, airworthiness certificate. Okay. All right. Let's just keep going and see
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:19.020]  if we can get lucky here. So can you tell me what the minimum separation distance is for
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:23.180]  landing and departing airliners during the daytime, Mr. Washington?
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.740]  I don't want to guess on that, Senator. Are you familiar with the difference between
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:34.500]  part 107 and part 440809 when it comes to unmanned aero standards? Unmanned aero, unmanned
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.380]  like drones? Are you familiar with the difference? Yes.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:42.780]  Yes. Okay. You know the difference between those two, part 440809 and part 107? Do you
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:48.660]  know the difference there? No, I cannot. It's okay, let out.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.500]  We own some drones to cover the border and other events. We've got to follow federal
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.180]  law and know what it is. And the different regulations talking about is how high a drone
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:02.860]  can fly and how high it can't. So they want somebody in there that knows nothing about
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:14.060]  it so they can do whatever they want. Emblematic of Fetterman and of Biden and people like
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:21.980]  Phil Washington. There's a plan there. Remember 20 years ago, people didn't believe me or
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:28.020]  Rush Limbaugh. We were covering federal policy being proposed by the Clintons that passed
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:36.900]  in regulatory funding to teach fuzzy math, two plus two equals 10, not four. And then
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:41.900]  now 90 plus percent of school children can't pass reading, writing, or arithmetic at some
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:48.940]  school districts. No one can pass it. Not one person in places like Chicago. That's the
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.820]  deliberate dumbing down. But they know all about how America's racist. They know all
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:57.500]  about how private ownership of guns is bad. They know all about how pedophilias good.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:03.020]  They know all about how to be victims. They know about reparations. And now this out of
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:08.580]  Columbia University, Ivy League University ditches standardized testing will now judge
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:16.580]  an applicant background on their background and their voice. Their voice. What do they
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:25.420]  say? What do they do? What do they stand for? That will get you into college. Yeah, this
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:32.900]  is a piece they've got on screen for TV viewers of idiocracy. And there's a lot of idiocracy
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:42.060]  where he says, Yeah, you know, Max, wife's a tarred retarded, but she's a pilot now.
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:48.060]  And it really is the joke here. We'll we'll come back and play this in the intro of the
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:52.740]  next segment, ready illustrious as well. So they can hear it. But see, this is a designed
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:57.100]  plan. This is a crazies in academia that are just kind of randomly doing this. No, it's
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:02.060]  globally standardized run by big corporations to make humanity obsolete because the average
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:09.700]  person is a lazy jellyfish. The majority of millennials and polls don't want a car and
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:14.420]  don't want a job and don't think they need one because they're living off the fumes of
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:19.940]  the old civilization. What happens once there's nobody there to make them their food or deliver
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:23.380]  them their door dash? Don't worry, the government will come to them and say, We're ready to
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:27.740]  help you commit suicide. And now they've got regulations. Trudeau just put in without passing
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:33.700]  it in parliament in Canada to kill people as young as three years old without parental
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:38.260]  consent because the children have consent now and tell the government they want to be
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:44.020]  killed. So it's not just government bureaucrats and psychologists and teachers teaching your
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:48.220]  five or six year old son or daughter. They're really a different sex that should be sterilized.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:52.460]  Now it's them having discussions with them about you committing suicide. And the parents
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:41:00.580]  say, No, you're not going to kill my child. The government will take your child and go
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:05.860]  kill them. And it's now happening in Canada. That ain't coming, folks. That's here. Oh,
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:11.460]  your child's depressed. We say your child's autistic. We say we glorify him. We tell him
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.540]  how great they are. They're going to help the earth. Just let us kill you. And they
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:22.220]  do it because children are designed to think that the system and authorities are their
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.020]  friends and we sit here with mass Stockholm syndrome and we put up with it. You think
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:32.220]  having convicted pedophiles, dance, half naked in front of little kids was the end of this.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:38.100]  It was the start. Cutting their testicles off, cutting their panaces off, cutting their
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:47.180]  ovaries out, cutting their uterus out, cutting their breast off is just the beginning headline.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:50.860]  Canada considers allowing assisted suicide for children without parental consent. No
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:57.860]  trio says it's now the policy. But he's a liberal and he's nice and, you know, he says
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.900]  basic dictatorship in China is a good thing. So we should put up with it. And we have this
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:10.300]  article. School kids taught how to masturbate and the virtues of rough sex in lessons hidden
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:15.700]  from parents for elementary students in the UK and the government's defending it. I can't
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:20.940]  even read on air what they teach them. They don't tell the parents because they're pedos.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:25.660]  They're beyond pedos. They're killers of children. They wall you off. They shut you down. They
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:28.580]  keep you away from your children. You put them in the school when you're putting them
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:35.180]  in a murderous environment of evil. The globalist do exactly what they're doing. I'm going to
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.780]  play that idiocracy clip when we come in and get the Chinese social credits core clip.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:45.580]  I promise to get to and more in the final segment ahead of Sunday Live 6 to 8 p.m. with
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:50.340]  the great Owen shroyer with call special guest and more. He's loaded for bear tonight and
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.020]  it kicks off in about 17 minutes from now. Final segment straight ahead. Please stay with
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:43:02.340]  us at info wars dot com. Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.900]  the World is a historic book that documents the globalists and their own words planned
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:11.180]  for our future that is the hellish future. Now you'll be always while they still allow
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:14.500]  books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:19.420]  Reset and the War for the World at bookstores amazon or infowarsore.com. But you will never
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:24.220]  be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:28.660]  and there's about a thousand left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:33.420]  and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowarsore.com and there is a markup there
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:37.460]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.740]  memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:45.340]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:50.420]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarsore.com and
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:55.020]  get a signed copy and buy a couple unsigned copies and go to the library or get them
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:58.620]  to the local school. This is an info war, I'm counting on you and thank you for your
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:43:59.620]  support.
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:03.620]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.620]  Applying this has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:11.620]  There is a bulletin from CVS News. President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:15.620]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:20.620]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.620]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:27.620]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:31.620]  It was almost as if it were a plan in the police. It was your penchant.
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:34.620]  We need you to go into the capital!
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:37.620]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.620]  They are nothing but distractives.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:43.620]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.620]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:45:15.620]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the students start going to prison.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:20.620]  The good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating.
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:25.620]  Those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:29.620]  That is why I am counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:33.620]  the broadcast, and to hit the broadcast on the air by getting great products at infowarsore.com.

[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:11.620]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:44.620]  Thank you.
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:59.620]  Some had high hopes that genetic engineering would correct this trend in evolution.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:05.620]  But sadly, the greatest minds and resources were focused on conquering hair loss and prolonging
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:09.620]  erections.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:16.620]  Meanwhile, the population exploded and intelligence continued to decline until humanity was incapable
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:22.620]  of solving even its most basic problems, like garbage, which had been stacked for centuries
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:30.620]  with no plan whatsoever, leading to the great garbage avalanche of 2,505, which would set
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:47.620]  in motion the events that would change the world forever.
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:49:16.620]  Make no mistake, folks, we are here now.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.620]  So, China, for several years, has had the social credit score in place.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.620]  It's the model for the world.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:27.620]  Here is a short clip put up by the government of a man with his family unable to go on a plane,
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:32.620]  then get a hotel, a train ticket, or a bank loan, and then there's jumbotrons on the streets
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.620]  showing he's a bad person.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:35.620]  This isn't coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:36.620]  This is here.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:45.620]  This is their plan for everybody.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.620]  Go on your daughter-in-law on a trip?
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:48.620]  Nope.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:50.620]  Get in some government-in-line.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:57.620]  And we are opting into this, letting it be built all around us.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:58.620]  Sorry, can't find.
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:11.620]  Uh, nope, can't get a hotel room.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:21.620]  Sorry, can't find.
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:25.620]  Sorry, can't find.
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:27.620]  Already having the populace?
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:28.620]  Already having the patriots?
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:29.620]  Yeah.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:30.620]  Already having everybody?
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:39.620]  He goes out on the street and there he is on the jumbotron.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:49.620]  That's their plan if you criticize things like this.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.620]  New York Post.
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:57.620]  USA powerlifting to allow trans athletes to compete with women after losing suit.
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:01.620]  The courts say biological men can take over all the women's sports.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:08.860]  That's how we celebrate Women's Month is having the new Hershey spokesperson be a man saying
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:09.860]  he's a woman.
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:16.860]  NBA team forced to apologize for a cent of suggesting only women can have a baby.
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:22.020]  And then a few of these videos, these are not joke videos, these are people proud of
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.020]  their new identity.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:29.100]  You don't have a job, you're obese, you have no future, but the media says you're beautiful
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:35.860]  and wonderful if you're a 300-pound man with a beard who says he is a woman.
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:57.860]  Here's the clip.
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:02.860]  But at least this guy isn't trying to take women's place in sports.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:07.860]  Okay, that's social credit score violation there in the future, I'll be banned from living
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:08.860]  basically for saying that.
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:12.860]  I've committed my thought crime, but once you put up with this, you'll put up with anything.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:18.740]  Remember, you'll give in now and submit to this control grid to your own destruction.
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:20.700]  Only an idiot would submit to this.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.860]  Where's your fighting spirit?
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:23.740]  Where's your common sense?
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:28.500]  Here's a crazed man dresses a woman tells people to stop spelling woman with an X or
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.860]  a Y because trans women are real women.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:31.860]  Here it is.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:32.860]  Not this, but that.
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:34.340]  Here's a gender inclusive tip.
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.060]  Happy Women's History Month.
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:40.060]  As you celebrate all women this month, including trans women, instead of spelling women with
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:44.660]  a Y instead of an E or an X instead of an E to be more inclusive of trans women, instead
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.860]  just spell women W-O-M-E-N.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:48.860]  Women.
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:49.860]  Why?
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.860]  Because trans women are women and you can just spell it the regular way.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:55.260]  When you might be using an X or a Y to try to be more inclusive, what you're actually
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:58.020]  doing is suggesting the idea that trans women aren't really women.
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:01.660]  That you need a special spelling to include them, which again is not the case since trans
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:03.660]  women are women.
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:06.060]  Well, there you go.
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:10.620]  Here's another clip of Clown World today.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:15.820]  Drag Queen Story Hour is going to save children.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:16.940]  And again, it's not a woman.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:21.260]  This is a man dressed in the ceremonial clown outfit of this cult.
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:22.260]  Here it is.
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:28.300]  I don't know who needs to hear this, but drag story hour is not targeting children.
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:30.660]  Drag story hour is saving children.
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:31.660]  Now, hear me out.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:37.660]  Let's say you're a parent and you have a child who maybe doesn't fit in, maybe they're being
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:41.940]  bullied at school, maybe you're a little boy like to play with dolls, maybe your little
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:45.060]  girl wants you to call her by a boy's name.
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:46.060]  This happens.
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:50.460]  And sometimes even people in your own family don't understand it and they don't accept
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:51.460]  it.
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:55.860]  So maybe as a parent who loves their child, you want to bring them to a place where they
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:59.820]  can feel safe, where they don't feel like they're so weird and they don't feel like
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:03.860]  they're going to go to hell because they're different.
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:07.460]  So when are we going to hit bottom here, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:16.540]  Solace creatures attracted to the innocence of children, state sponsored, corporate sponsored.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:23.860]  When are we going to hit bottom and say no to this and say that this is wrong?
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:28.740]  That's really, really the big question here.
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:37.340]  What the good news is, all over the world, people are standing up in the UK.
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:40.780]  They have canceled the group itself.
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:46.860]  They're drag queen time with children because it was so sexual and so sick.
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:50.580]  It caused a major, major backlash.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:56.980]  And the only question is, what is the level that you will finally say no?
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:55:02.860]  Because that is the level that these people will actually stop.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:08.820]  Here's the headline I was looking for.
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.020]  Drag queen shows for babies canceled after public backlash.
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:17.260]  The UK cabaret company behind drag queen events aimed at infants as reportedly canceled future
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:22.260]  shows have receiving fierce public backlash in the wake of a recent performance that was
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:24.140]  recorded.
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:33.860]  They won't, I guess we're torturing you and showing you this, but again, this is nothing
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.380]  compared to footage we have.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:44.180]  This is degeneracy, this is attacking children, this is pure evil, but it's about breaking
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:50.780]  your will and getting you to accept literally anything.
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:58.220]  But if you think, again, this is bad, the UK and places like Canada are the cutting-edge
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:04.420]  spearheading killing children without parental consent because the child tells the government
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:05.700]  they want to die.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:10.220]  A child is not of the age to consent to buy alcohol, join the military, to have sex because
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.500]  they're a child.
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:16.060]  And if we don't protect our children, God is going to forget who we are.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:22.500]  Look, I got to almost everything, I did not get to the Nikola Tesla information, so I'm
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:31.140]  going to put that in the stack for tomorrow because it's a very important area to understand
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:36.420]  why Tesla's technology never got implemented, even though he was very smart.
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:38.260]  Some of his technology was doable.
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:44.660]  A lot of it was so toxic because transmitting power through the air affects your cells and
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:46.820]  hurts your body.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:52.900]  And we've got evidence and documents and information we're going to show tomorrow, 11 am central
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.580]  when I go live again, Lord willing.
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:59.780]  After Harris and Smith goes live, 8 am to 11 am with the American Journal, I'll enjoy
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:02.020]  your 3 pm central every day.
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:06.460]  We're fighting hard for humanity, not just America, and we're having some major successes,
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:11.900]  but I believe our most important work is to come, but that can only come if you support
[01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:14.140]  the broadcast and spread the word.
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:17.460]  So I'm counting on you to continue to support us, you know who you are, and I thank you
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.460]  for that support.
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:21.780]  We're going to go to break here, and for the next two hours, Owen Shroyer will come in
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:28.220]  here and has a lot of news to cover, great guests, phone calls, and his amazing analysis.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:32.340]  Owen Shroyer, and Sunday Live is in two minutes.
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.460]  Thank you for joining us, great job crew.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:39.780]  Now please share the article, share the videos, share our Roseanne Barr interview from yesterday
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:42.140]  as well at van.video.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:50.380]  We'll be right back with Owen Shroyer.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:56.140]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infoorstroyer.com
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:59.940]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.020]  and your body, and keep us on air.
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:07.180]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:10.580]  of you for years and never gone to infoorstroyer.com.
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:16.100]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infoorstroyer.com
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:18.940]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:22.860]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great,
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:23.860]  and I thank you.
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:27.940]  But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:31.980]  for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:34.220]  oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:37.740]  All of these are really great products, they keep us on air, plus you're missing out on
[01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:38.740]  these products.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:43.700]  Get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infoorstroyer.com right
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:47.900]  now and get these great infoorstroyer products at infoorstroyer.com.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:53.900]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:55.620]  This is their big move.
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:59.380]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:01.180]  He doesn't care.
[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:02.420]  That's not his job.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:04.140]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:12.460]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists, appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:21.340]  They must be opposed and that's only to understand one word, no, no, no, exactly.
[01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:24.020]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:27.940]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:30.460]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:32.940]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:36.540]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:39.140]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:40.140]  You're right.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:57.660]  We stand against autocrats like you Joe Biden and we say no and we say no to your war.
