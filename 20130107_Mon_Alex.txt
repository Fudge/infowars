[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.520 --> 00:26.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.960 --> 00:33.680]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January 7th, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.180]  Health Ranger, sitting in for Alex today. We have an amazing show lined up for you for
[00:39.180 --> 00:46.280]  the next three hours. And the reason I'm here is because Alex is on a plane headed to New
[00:46.280 --> 00:55.200]  York. He's going to appear on the CNN broadcast tonight. I think it's at, what, nine, eight
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.440]  o'clock, no, nine central, eight eastern, I think is what it is, right?
[00:59.440 --> 01:03.800]  Anyway, Alex is gonna be there with Piers Morgan, so we'll see how that goes. So I'm
[01:03.800 --> 01:10.480]  here covering for Alex today, and he called me before the show with some somewhat disturbing
[01:10.480 --> 01:19.080]  news as well. He has been detained and nearly arrested at the Austin airport. And he's gonna
[01:19.080 --> 01:25.920]  be uploading a video later that will explain what happened.
[01:25.920 --> 01:33.400]  And I'm not gonna go into any details right now, but he was very angry about how he's
[01:33.400 --> 01:39.280]  being treated as an American citizen just trying to get on an airplane. In any case,
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.640]  that's coming up later tonight. That'll probably make the InfoWars nightly news, but in the
[01:43.640 --> 01:44.640]  meantime, let's continue.
[01:44.640 --> 01:51.120]  We've got some great guests coming up for you today. We've got Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com
[01:51.120 --> 01:55.080]  joining us at the bottom of this hour with an update on how the state of Michigan has
[01:55.080 --> 02:03.760]  been forcing farmers there to shoot their own pigs. And now an economic embargo of sorts
[02:03.760 --> 02:09.340]  has been enacted against Mark Baker and other farmers there.
[02:09.340 --> 02:14.380]  It's an all out economic warfare against American patriots, okay? So anybody who tries to grow
[02:14.380 --> 02:19.660]  their own food, who tries to farm, who tries to exercise any kind of freedom whatsoever,
[02:19.660 --> 02:24.200]  whether it's free speech, food freedom, medical freedom, health freedom, you name it, they're
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.200]  all being assaulted, attacked at every angle imaginable.
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.240]  It's on, the war is on against the American patriots and Mark Baker will be joining us
[02:34.240 --> 02:39.300]  with some more details on what's going on there. Also in the next hour, we've got John
[02:39.300 --> 02:47.240]  Rappaport joining us with some breaking realizations about psychiatric drugs and how now these
[02:47.240 --> 02:48.860]  could be used.
[02:48.860 --> 02:56.240]  You see, the government has a record of prescription drugs. Who's been prescribed all of these?
[02:56.240 --> 03:03.360]  It's a patient database of prescription records. And this database not only has your name in
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.360]  it, but also what you've been prescribed. So if you're taking antidepressant drugs,
[03:08.360 --> 03:13.680]  if you're taking mind altering psychiatric drugs, if your children are taking drugs for
[03:13.680 --> 03:20.860]  ADHD or depression or anything, this is all being recorded by the government.
[03:20.860 --> 03:25.120]  And now that we've got new gun control, a new push, of course, happening in the Senate
[03:25.120 --> 03:33.820]  thanks to people like Feinstein, your prescription drug records could be used to deny you your
[03:33.820 --> 03:39.320]  constitutional rights. All they have to do is claim that everyone who's taking antidepressant
[03:39.320 --> 03:46.840]  drugs is now, quote, mentally unfit to own a firearm or to even perhaps invoke their
[03:46.840 --> 03:49.260]  Fifth Amendment rights or their First Amendment rights.
[03:49.260 --> 03:53.480]  Or basically they can just say, if you're taking these drugs, the Bill of Rights no
[03:53.480 --> 04:00.160]  longer applies to you. That's what they can say. So that is a very worrisome realization
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.960]  and a possible development in this gun control issue. And John Rappaport will be joining
[04:04.960 --> 04:06.860]  us to go over that.
[04:06.860 --> 04:13.200]  We've also got Richard Pearson popping in in the next hour. He is the head of the Illinois
[04:13.200 --> 04:19.240]  State Rifle Association that just narrowly defeated yet another sneak attack gun control
[04:19.240 --> 04:25.280]  bill last night. Yeah, they're trying it at all hours now. It's like, I guess these lawmakers
[04:25.280 --> 04:31.740]  are staying up until three in the morning on a Sunday night to try to sneak a bill through
[04:31.740 --> 04:34.000]  that is completely unconstitutional.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.040]  That would criminalize all citizens of Illinois who own firearms. It would criminalize the
[04:40.040 --> 04:45.280]  farmers and the ranchers and everyone in that state who legally owns firearms. But that
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.880]  bill was narrowly defeated last night. We'll get an update on that issue in the next hour.
[04:49.880 --> 04:54.400]  So stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show. All of that and much more straight ahead.
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.400]  We'll be right back.
[05:24.400 --> 05:29.120]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[05:29.120 --> 05:34.040]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic

[08:28.960 --> 08:36.400]  All right, we are live on this Monday, January 7th. Yes, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the Health
[08:36.400 --> 08:43.800]  Ranger filling in for Alex Jones, who right now is on an airplane headed to New York to
[08:43.800 --> 08:50.240]  be on CNN tonight. The Piers Morgan show. Apparently Alex is going to be there live
[08:50.240 --> 09:00.360]  sitting with Mr. Morgan. Mr. Redcoat Morgan, the guy that has a big successful petition
[09:00.360 --> 09:07.400]  calling for Morgan to be detained and kicked out of the country. That's a pretty good petition.
[09:07.400 --> 09:11.840]  But anyway, Alex is going to be sitting in there with him to have something that I'm
[09:11.840 --> 09:17.080]  sure will be a very mild conversation. And Alex, and by the way, that's going to be aired
[09:17.080 --> 09:23.440]  at, I think, let's see, let me get this right, 9 p.m. Eastern and 8 p.m. Central. So I guess
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.040]  that makes it 6 p.m. Pacific, right? Did I get that right? I can do math today. What
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.080]  a wonderful Monday. Yeah, normally the math doesn't work till Tuesdays, right?
[09:34.080 --> 09:39.520]  Okay, so we have a lot of news coming up today. Obviously the attack is on at every level
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.480]  at every angle on all Americans who believe in the Bill of Rights, who believe in the
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.800]  Second Amendment especially. And we've got a number of guests coming on today. And let
[09:47.800 --> 09:51.360]  me give you the rundown of what you're going to hear here for the next three hours. This
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.080]  is going to be an amazingly hard hitting show. At the bottom of this hour, we've got Mark
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.200]  Baker coming on from Baker's Green Acres talking about the state of Michigan and how they are
[10:00.200 --> 10:07.480]  now putting in kind of economic embargo on home small farmers who are trying to have
[10:07.480 --> 10:12.680]  a small family farm raising heirloom pigs basically and are being shut down by the state
[10:12.680 --> 10:13.680]  of Michigan.
[10:13.680 --> 10:17.520]  I know we've covered that issue before, but we have new information, new updates, and
[10:17.520 --> 10:22.880]  a worsening of the situation. So Mark will be here to give us that breakdown. Then the
[10:22.880 --> 10:30.160]  next hour, we've got John Rappaport from nomorefakenews.com joining us to give us more details on some
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.660]  additional breaking realizations that we had about the psychiatric patient prescription
[10:35.660 --> 10:41.880]  drug list. Look, the government is running a surveillance database on all the drugs that
[10:41.880 --> 10:45.440]  you are prescribed and purchased from pharmacies.
[10:45.440 --> 10:51.500]  That database could be turned into a no gun buy database. They could just say they can
[10:51.500 --> 10:57.240]  invoke this by executive order as has been admitted. The Washington Post over the weekend
[10:57.240 --> 11:03.840]  ran a story saying Obama was looking at executive order to just mandate new gun restrictions.
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.620]  And one of those, this wasn't in the Washington Post article, but this is in our article at
[11:07.620 --> 11:14.120]  Natural News and it's posted on infowars.com this morning, shows that that drug database
[11:14.120 --> 11:20.160]  could be copied and pasted into the no gun buy database, which essentially is the FBI
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.760]  instant background check system, NICS, to deny people the right to buy firearms who
[11:24.760 --> 11:27.600]  have been on antidepressants.
[11:27.600 --> 11:33.400]  So that's coming up. That's a very big important discussion because it means that if you are
[11:33.400 --> 11:41.400]  taking psychiatric drugs, which includes antidepressants and other classes of prescribed pharmaceuticals,
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.820]  you could be denied your constitutional rights. Outside of law, just with a regulation, no,
[11:47.820 --> 11:53.440]  this would not even require senators or members of the House to vote for any new law, wouldn't
[11:53.440 --> 11:55.760]  require anything at all.
[11:55.760 --> 12:01.840]  Just one stroke of the pen or one stroke of the robotic pen from Obama, who doesn't even
[12:01.840 --> 12:06.880]  sign his laws anymore, just has a robot do it. Hey, why not? He's a puppet anyway, just
[12:06.880 --> 12:13.200]  have a puppet sign it. Grab a puppet with a pen and sign the laws that way.
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.280]  All right, here's some other news. We've got welfare recipients. This is out of the New
[12:16.280 --> 12:23.360]  York Post. Welfare recipients take out cash at strip clubs, liquor stores, and X-rated
[12:23.360 --> 12:29.840]  shops. This was an exclusive story that broke on the New York Post over the weekend. And
[12:29.840 --> 12:36.640]  it turns out that if you track where these recipients are taking out their cash, they're
[12:36.640 --> 12:43.360]  taking out all their, with their EBT cards, their government paid welfare cards.
[12:43.360 --> 12:49.200]  They're taking it out at porn shops, hookah parlors. I've never heard that term before,
[12:49.200 --> 12:54.960]  a hookah parlor, and even strip clubs. Man, I must be out of the loop on that whole realm
[12:54.960 --> 13:00.680]  because I've never even heard of a hookah parlor. Anyway, I have heard of strip clubs,
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.720]  so that's where they're taking out their money and using it. So this is your money, folks.
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.800]  This is your taxpayer money when you go to work and you pay taxes or they take it out
[13:11.800 --> 13:15.960]  actually to sort of confiscate taxes from you and they're confiscating more now than
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.940]  ever before, thanks to the fiscal cliff negotiations.
[13:19.940 --> 13:29.080]  That money goes to these Obama-supporting EBT card owners who are using your money to
[13:29.080 --> 13:38.380]  get it on at X-rated porn shops and strip clubs. Man, how insane has it become when
[13:38.380 --> 13:45.980]  our tax dollars go to fund the compassionate welfare of people who use your money to hire
[13:45.980 --> 13:54.760]  strippers and buy porn? Yeah, that's called welfare in the new United States of America.
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.480]  Enough on that. Let's move on.
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.360]  Large cities all over America are degenerating into gang-infested war zones. This was by
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.560]  Michael Snyder at Economic Collapse and it's posted on Infowars.com as well. And in this
[14:09.560 --> 14:13.840]  article he looks at the large cities and how they're breaking down into total criminal
[14:13.840 --> 14:17.040]  gang-infested chaos.
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.080]  And there was a story posted on Drudge over the weekend where a woman in Detroit called
[14:21.080 --> 14:27.440]  911 reported that her car had been stolen and a firearm inside the car had obviously
[14:27.440 --> 14:36.960]  been stolen with the car. And the police or 911 told her, call back later. Call back later.
[14:36.960 --> 14:44.920]  Welcome to the suicide hotline. Please hold. It's like, forget about police in Detroit
[14:44.920 --> 14:51.000]  now. Didn't the police of Detroit even announce a few weeks ago for people not to even enter
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  the city?
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.800]  Because if you dial 911, we can't help you. We can't even help you. This reminds me of
[14:56.800 --> 15:02.640]  the movie RoboCop. Remember that? The original RoboCop movie from the 1980s? You gotta go
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.440]  back and watch RoboCop because that was based in Detroit. And in the movie, the city of
[15:08.440 --> 15:14.800]  Detroit had degenerated into a total corporate gang crime zone where the corporations were
[15:14.800 --> 15:15.800]  running the drugs.
[15:15.800 --> 15:21.920]  Ah, guess what's happened today? Exactly like that. The commercials in that movie RoboCop
[15:21.920 --> 15:29.900]  were so ridiculous then they seemed outlandish and today they are true. That movie, it really
[15:29.900 --> 15:36.200]  foreshadowed the future. And this is happening in cities all across the country, East St.
[15:36.200 --> 15:44.120]  Louis, Detroit, LA, East LA, you name it. It is all degenerating as, but look, you can't
[15:44.120 --> 15:48.200]  blame the police on this because the men and women in blue who are out there trying to
[15:48.200 --> 15:49.400]  do their jobs.
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.400]  And I know this because I've worked with these cops firsthand. They are trying to do their
[15:54.400 --> 16:00.560]  jobs. They are ridiculously underfunded. They are not given even enough money to buy the
[16:00.560 --> 16:06.280]  ammo that they need to police their local cities. They're denied their own gear in many
[16:06.280 --> 16:12.060]  cases. Hey, when I was working with the police in Arizona, we were raising money so they
[16:12.060 --> 16:18.160]  could buy their own bulletproof vest because the PD there didn't even give them bulletproof
[16:18.160 --> 16:25.600]  vest. Imagine being a cop and having to buy your own vest. It's ridiculous.
[16:25.600 --> 16:31.800]  But this is true. So as a result, as a result of the cuts, as a result of the insanity,
[16:31.800 --> 16:35.720]  the cops are being downsized everywhere. And of course the gangs are running completely
[16:35.720 --> 16:41.400]  out of control. Now here's another great article that I saw over the weekend from WorldNet
[16:41.400 --> 16:48.560]  Daily by the managing editor of WorldNet Daily, David Kapelian. I hope I am pronouncing his
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.420]  name correctly, Kapelian.
[16:50.420 --> 16:56.520]  This is a great story. The giant gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting. And in the story
[16:56.520 --> 17:05.980]  that's up at worldnetdaily.com, WND, he covers the mainstream media, their refusal to cover
[17:05.980 --> 17:11.380]  the psychiatric drugs and their links to violent shooting and suicides. And he runs down what
[17:11.380 --> 17:17.120]  we've been reporting on for years at Natural News, which is the link between psych drugs
[17:17.120 --> 17:18.360]  and violent shootings.
[17:18.360 --> 17:23.160]  If you go back to Columbine, those kids that shot up their classmates and shot up their
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.320]  school, they were taking antidepressant drugs. If you run down the whole list, most school
[17:28.320 --> 17:34.280]  shootings and most violent outbursts, even in the military, the military violence that's
[17:34.280 --> 17:41.840]  in, what was the shooting at Fort Hood? That guy was under psychiatric care. All of these
[17:41.840 --> 17:43.500]  people are under psychiatric care.
[17:43.500 --> 17:48.400]  You look at Aurora, Colorado, you look at Sandy Hook in Connecticut, the recent situation,
[17:48.400 --> 17:54.000]  that guy was on psychiatric drugs. It is the link that the media refuses to report. They
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.880]  want to focus on, the guns are bad. They don't wanna tell you that the guy left his AR-15
[18:00.880 --> 18:04.480]  vehicle in the car. He didn't even bring it into the school. They don't wanna tell you
[18:04.480 --> 18:05.480]  that he was on psych drugs.
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.080]  They don't wanna tell you that all these people are Satan worshippers, that they're all these
[18:09.080 --> 18:16.400]  goth-like characters who literally love the devil, love Satan or think they do. They probably
[18:16.400 --> 18:20.500]  never even, they don't even know what they're really dealing with. But they think they love
[18:20.500 --> 18:25.760]  Satan, and so they engage in this kind of behavior. In any case, check out that article
[18:25.760 --> 18:32.720]  called thatdailywnd.com, good article. Next item, this is up at infowars.com by Mark Slavo
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.400]  at shtfplan.com.
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.280]  America's biggest killer is the chart anti-gunners don't want you to see. Alex covered this briefly
[18:41.280 --> 18:47.040]  in yesterday's article, but I wanna make an addition to this chart. This chart shows the
[18:47.040 --> 18:53.160]  ten biggest killers in the United States. And at the top of the chart is tobacco use
[18:53.160 --> 19:01.340]  at 529,000 deaths per annum. And underneath that is medical errors at 195,000 deaths,
[19:01.340 --> 19:03.560]  and it goes on down the chart.
[19:03.560 --> 19:12.960]  And guns or firearm homicides are at the very bottom of the chart. Underneath falls, unintentional
[19:12.960 --> 19:21.100]  falls, people falling and dying. Motor vehicle accidents are three times, 300% larger than
[19:21.100 --> 19:27.960]  firearm homicides. Alcohol abuse is almost ten times higher in terms of deaths than firearm
[19:27.960 --> 19:34.880]  homicides. Unintentional injuries also 12 times higher and so on. And if you look at
[19:34.880 --> 19:40.480]  the firearm homicides, most of those are gang related crimes where gang bangers are shooting
[19:40.480 --> 19:42.180]  up each other.
[19:42.180 --> 19:46.000]  It's not like they're actually going after just random people on the street, they're
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.220]  going after each other. So that chart, it needs an update. I've got new information
[19:52.220 --> 19:56.240]  to add to it. And I'll bring that to you when we return here on the Alex Jones Show. This
[19:56.240 --> 20:02.400]  is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex today. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[20:02.400 --> 20:07.240]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[20:07.240 --> 20:11.760]  storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[20:11.760 --> 20:16.860]  drought in agricultural history. And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[20:16.860 --> 20:21.760]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
[20:21.760 --> 20:26.120]  more supplies from E Foods Direct and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own
[20:26.120 --> 20:30.480]  supply from E Foods Direct. I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom
[20:30.480 --> 20:35.800]  for food. I'm taking control of my future. And you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[20:35.800 --> 20:39.760]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with

[21:04.820 --> 21:10.740]  In the US, one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year. Burglars call it smash
[21:10.740 --> 21:18.300]  and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic
[21:18.300 --> 21:24.680]  device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates
[21:24.680 --> 21:29.380]  the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home
[21:29.380 --> 21:35.860]  watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only $34.95, Fake TV
[21:35.860 --> 21:40.500]  costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and it's perfect if you're traveling
[21:40.500 --> 21:52.800]  or away from home. Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388

[22:29.460 --> 22:33.860]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[22:33.860 --> 22:38.700]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry
[22:38.700 --> 22:43.420]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments,

[23:58.740 --> 24:21.780]  If you're just joining us, this is the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams sitting in
[24:21.780 --> 24:26.300]  for Alex. He's on an airplane right this minute headed to New York. He's going to be on the
[24:26.300 --> 24:33.420]  Piers Morgan show live tonight at 9 PM Eastern and you can do the math on when that is in
[24:33.420 --> 24:41.820]  your local area. So that might be interesting. Covering other news, the Orlando gun show
[24:41.820 --> 24:46.460]  sales, this was in clickorlando.com over the weekend.
[24:46.460 --> 24:52.080]  Orlando gun show sales reached record amidst the gun control debate. 8,000 people attended
[24:52.080 --> 24:58.020]  the first day of the gun show. Normally, they probably get 2,000 people. 8,000 people had
[24:58.020 --> 25:04.020]  to turn people away and give them a credit to come back the next day because they couldn't
[25:04.020 --> 25:05.980]  fit all the people in there.
[25:05.980 --> 25:11.940]  And of course, once they got there, all the guns were sold out. So it's like a gun show
[25:11.940 --> 25:16.840]  where you can't buy anything because it's all sold out. Actually, there were still some
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.540]  things for sale there. But gun dealers all across the country are completely wiped out
[25:21.540 --> 25:27.500]  of their supplies of firearms. This is continuing. The wait time is getting worse and worse.
[25:27.500 --> 25:31.540]  I've been talking to some of the gun distributors and dealers and manufacturers that I know
[25:31.540 --> 25:35.780]  personally and they're telling me it's still on, man. It's still people are buying like
[25:35.780 --> 25:39.940]  mad and people are lining up just handing them money.
[25:39.940 --> 25:49.260]  Handing them like here $3,000, just take this $3,000. Find me a.308 battle rifle the first
[25:49.260 --> 25:53.820]  chance you get and just hold on to my money until that happens. That's what we're seeing
[25:53.820 --> 26:00.220]  now. It's like put your money down now and hope, hope and pray. That should be Obama's
[26:00.220 --> 26:01.220]  new slogan.
[26:01.220 --> 26:06.100]  Hope and pray that you can never buy a rifle again because they've talked it up so much
[26:06.100 --> 26:11.460]  now. They've created like a one year wait period without even having a law for it. They've
[26:11.460 --> 26:19.340]  wiped out the gun supply nationwide. And the reason that I'm kind of happy today, you know
[26:19.340 --> 26:23.220]  why I'm happy?
[26:23.220 --> 26:29.780]  I'm happy because Feinstein and the liberals have finally shown their cards. And I actually
[26:29.780 --> 26:35.620]  welcome Dianne Feinstein to amend her bill. Let's just make it put everything in the bill
[26:35.620 --> 26:41.740]  that you really, really want, okay? Just put everything in there. Let's ban not just rifles,
[26:41.740 --> 26:43.580]  not just handguns and shotguns.
[26:43.580 --> 26:48.140]  Let's ban forks and spoons and knives cuz you could whack somebody in the temple with
[26:48.140 --> 26:53.220]  a spoon. That could hurt. We should just ban spoons and make people eat with sticks like
[26:53.220 --> 26:58.780]  they did in China. Just have Americans, all Americans, it's time for chopsticks. And you
[26:58.780 --> 27:03.200]  can't sharpen the chopsticks cuz those could be weapons of mass destruction.
[27:03.200 --> 27:08.140]  So everybody eat with chopsticks. And while we're at it, Senator Feinstein, why not just
[27:08.140 --> 27:13.600]  add into your bill that anyone who owns a gun can't have a website, can't have a First
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.300]  Amendment right, can't have a Second Amendment right. And that if you say anything against
[27:18.300 --> 27:22.780]  Obama, then let's say you shouldn't even have a Fifth Amendment right.
[27:22.780 --> 27:28.380]  In fact, all your Bill of Rights completely gone if you speak your mind. If you don't
[27:28.380 --> 27:33.620]  worship Feinstein and Obama, then you should be denied all of your right. Let's just get
[27:33.620 --> 27:40.420]  it all out in there. And Feinstein's bill, by the way, banned grenade launchers on semi-auto
[27:40.420 --> 27:46.140]  rifles as if you could just walk down to the gun store and buy a grenade launcher.
[27:46.140 --> 27:52.500]  Really, is she so ignorant that she thinks that you can buy grenade launchers? In fact,
[27:52.500 --> 27:58.980]  the NRA even pointed out, why not just add to the bill banning particle beam weapons
[27:58.980 --> 28:02.260]  on your rifle? Yeah, particle beam weapons.
[28:02.260 --> 28:10.480]  And how about laser blasters? And why not handheld rifle-mounted tactical nukes out
[28:10.480 --> 28:19.360]  of Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers? Let's just ban fully automated robotic body
[28:19.360 --> 28:28.380]  armor suits with self-seeking nuclear weapons and particle beams and laser blasters.
[28:28.380 --> 28:36.900]  Wonderful, we get sound effects today. Thank you, Feinstein, for painting such a wonderfully
[28:36.900 --> 28:47.020]  imaginative view of what America really needs today. I think we should get the Han Solo
[28:47.020 --> 28:50.980]  character on the show to talk about his laser blasters, and then have Feinstein threaten
[28:50.980 --> 28:56.580]  to ban Han Solo. That's what we should do. No more Han Solo, no more laser blasters,
[28:56.580 --> 28:58.300]  and God forbid, no lightsabers.
[28:58.300 --> 29:01.860]  Because if you had a lightsaber, you could go into a school and just wreak havoc. So
[29:01.860 --> 29:08.900]  no more lightsabers, Dianne Feinstein. That's something we can support, banning lightsabers
[29:08.900 --> 29:14.860]  in the hands of the Jedi. All right, now getting back to reality here in the short time we
[29:14.860 --> 29:19.460]  have left. Sorry to get carried away, but it's so insane. All we can do is laugh at
[29:19.460 --> 29:20.460]  it at this point.
[29:20.460 --> 29:27.500]  It's so insane that you don't have a right to self-defense. You don't have a First Amendment.
[29:27.500 --> 29:31.340]  You don't even have the right to engage in commerce. Here's a story of the Bank of America
[29:31.340 --> 29:39.220]  freezing the deposits of a licensed gun manufacturer that was selling parts online. It's an economic
[29:39.220 --> 29:44.540]  embargo on top of the insanity. All right, stay with us. We've got guests and more news
[29:44.540 --> 29:48.300]  coming up. This is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones Show. We'll be right back after this

[33:21.260 --> 33:36.740]  That was Han Solo there. That little quote you might have heard. What did he say? Your
[33:36.740 --> 33:43.060]  ancient arts and hocus pocus is no match for a good blaster or something? Anyway, that's
[33:43.060 --> 33:48.660]  one of my favorite lines from Star Wars. There are many. These are not the droids you're
[33:48.660 --> 33:55.260]  looking for, being another. All right, I'm geeking out here on the Alex Jones show by
[33:55.260 --> 34:01.460]  quoting Star Wars. If it gets any worse, I'll start quoting Star Trek lines too. Let's move
[34:01.460 --> 34:02.460]  on.
[34:02.460 --> 34:05.660]  We've got a guest coming up in just a couple of minutes, Mark Baker from Baker's Green
[34:05.660 --> 34:11.820]  Acres. He is the small farm owner who has been just endlessly harassed by the state
[34:11.820 --> 34:15.940]  of Michigan and its DNR, the Department of Natural Resources. They're going to go to
[34:15.940 --> 34:23.060]  him in a second. But first, let me cover this. This has been reported in a website called
[34:23.060 --> 34:29.780]  the ironicsterrealism.com. I'm not familiar with that site, but the Bank of America freezes
[34:29.780 --> 34:32.860]  licensed gun manufacturers deposits.
[34:32.860 --> 34:39.960]  And this is the company called American Spirit Arms at americanspiritarms.com. The owner's
[34:39.960 --> 34:49.220]  name is Joe Sarachman. And he posted on Facebook that Bank of America seized his deposits,
[34:49.220 --> 34:57.800]  his online retailing deposits. And that the manager in Bank of America told him that the
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.820]  reason they seized his funds was, quote, we believe you should not be selling guns and
[35:02.820 --> 35:05.260]  parts on the Internet.
[35:05.260 --> 35:12.540]  Wow, first of all, you can't sell guns on the Internet. Just for all the liberals that
[35:12.540 --> 35:18.080]  may be listening and don't know about FFL laws, you can't sell guns on the Internet.
[35:18.080 --> 35:22.120]  You can accept a payment for a gun on the Internet, but you can't deliver the gun to
[35:22.120 --> 35:25.980]  the person's house. You have to deliver it to a local dealer, obviously, where that person
[35:25.980 --> 35:28.540]  undergoes a background check and so on and so forth.
[35:28.540 --> 35:36.020]  FFL, Federal Firearms License. But the fact that this Bank of America representative reportedly
[35:36.020 --> 35:41.320]  said you shouldn't be selling gun parts on the Internet either. Well, there you go. It's
[35:41.320 --> 35:49.140]  all part of the economic embargo against actual Americans, against actual patriots.
[35:49.140 --> 35:54.140]  And another example of that economic embargo is happening right now against our friend
[35:54.140 --> 36:00.020]  Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com. And Mark joins us by phone to give us the latest
[36:00.020 --> 36:03.820]  breakdown of what's happening to him in Michigan.
[36:03.820 --> 36:06.940]  Mark, thank you for joining the show. How are you doing today, man?
[36:06.940 --> 36:09.100]  Good, Mike, how are you doing?
[36:09.100 --> 36:15.820]  Well, I'm flipping out. I'm just looking at all this news. It's so insane. It's off the
[36:15.820 --> 36:20.600]  charts. And what you're experiencing is similar to it. Go ahead and give our audience, go
[36:20.600 --> 36:25.860]  back to the beginning, but keep it brief in case people aren't familiar with your story.
[36:25.860 --> 36:28.380]  Take us back to what happened in the beginning and then bring us up to date.
[36:28.380 --> 36:35.180]  Okay. One year ago, about, we were told that the pigs that we raised are going to be considered
[36:35.180 --> 36:41.260]  illegal in the state of Michigan because they have one of nine characteristics that the
[36:41.260 --> 36:49.580]  Michigan Department of Natural Resources outlined in their declaratory ruling. The characteristics
[36:49.580 --> 36:56.540]  are as crazy as if a pig has a straight tail, it's illegal. If a pig has a curly tail, it's
[36:56.540 --> 37:01.940]  illegal. If a pig has a straight ear, it's illegal. Floppy ears, illegal. And then number
[37:01.940 --> 37:05.220]  nine is other characteristics not currently known.
[37:05.220 --> 37:07.420]  So anything they just want to invent, basically.
[37:07.420 --> 37:13.020]  Right, anything they want. And so we were told that we had to depopulate our animals
[37:13.020 --> 37:14.820]  by April 1st of 2012.
[37:14.820 --> 37:17.820]  And when you say depopulate, you mean kill them.
[37:17.820 --> 37:25.380]  Kill them, push them in a hole. I'm former military and I know that if I'm given an order
[37:25.380 --> 37:33.540]  that is illegal or unlawful, it is my duty to not carry that order out. So I chose to
[37:33.540 --> 37:40.340]  decline the order and we've leveled suit against the state for relief so we could go on and
[37:40.340 --> 37:42.340]  continue our business.
[37:42.340 --> 37:50.100]  The pigs that we raise are Mangalita and Mangalita hybrid and we use a Russian boar cross and
[37:50.100 --> 37:55.260]  they have some of the characteristics that the DNR has outlined. Anyway, we took them
[37:55.260 --> 38:03.580]  to court. It has dragged on. We still haven't argued the case in court and it's on and on
[38:03.580 --> 38:12.220]  and on. Finally, the last shot across our bow was two weeks ago. We wanted to have some
[38:12.220 --> 38:18.900]  of our animals butchered through the USDA slaughter plant that we've used for five years.
[38:18.900 --> 38:25.940]  And the man that owns the plant says he wasn't able to because the USDA showed him pictures
[38:25.940 --> 38:31.900]  and if our pigs had those characteristics, they couldn't go through it.
[38:31.900 --> 38:39.140]  So the order has come down from the USDA to all the pig processing plants, pork processing
[38:39.140 --> 38:47.940]  plants there to deny any farmer, to deny service to any farmer that comes in with a pig that
[38:47.940 --> 38:51.940]  matches those pictures. Is it like grunted by the FBI picture where they have floppy
[38:51.940 --> 38:54.300]  ears on there and curly tails? Is that what it is?
[38:54.300 --> 38:59.140]  You know, I wanted to get a copy of all that stuff from the guy at the plant but he's afraid
[38:59.140 --> 39:05.020]  of the USDA because they can shut him down. So I don't have any of that yet. Our lawyers
[39:05.020 --> 39:06.900]  are procuring that as we speak.
[39:06.900 --> 39:16.620]  Wow. So I guess porky the pig is the new al-Qaeda. But this sounds like an economic embargo against
[39:16.620 --> 39:21.620]  you where they, like you said, you had used this plant before. They had processed some
[39:21.620 --> 39:23.380]  of your pigs before for years.
[39:23.380 --> 39:25.620]  Yeah, five years we've used them.
[39:25.620 --> 39:27.540]  And now they say, sorry.
[39:27.540 --> 39:28.540]  Yeah.
[39:28.540 --> 39:31.460]  So you couldn't get your pigs processed which means you couldn't sell them.
[39:31.460 --> 39:36.180]  Right, right. And if we can't sell the pigs, then we can't afford to feed the ones that
[39:36.180 --> 39:42.820]  are coming up, the younger ones. And so we were forced to make some decisions and decisions
[39:42.820 --> 39:51.060]  that we made was right before Christmas, we would slaughter our mature cows, which are
[39:51.060 --> 39:58.020]  like 400 pound animals. And so we did that the weekend right after Christmas and then
[39:58.020 --> 40:01.940]  last weekend we finished, got them all slaughtered.
[40:01.940 --> 40:07.460]  So the government has forced you to kill your own animals, which will hurt your future business
[40:07.460 --> 40:13.660]  and they're denying you a source of revenue because your pigs have a characteristic that
[40:13.660 --> 40:14.660]  they don't like.
[40:14.660 --> 40:15.660]  That's it.
[40:15.660 --> 40:22.700]  Like fur color, it's almost like skin color. It's like saying, it's almost a kind of animal
[40:22.700 --> 40:24.100]  racism you could say.
[40:24.100 --> 40:30.980]  Well, it really is. They're saying that we have a problem with feral animals and feralness
[40:30.980 --> 40:40.580]  is a behavior, right? And now they're saying that if my pigs are black or they're black
[40:40.580 --> 40:48.740]  and white or they're black and red, then they are more likely to be feral. So I have to
[40:48.740 --> 40:55.880]  get rid of them. And the only cut out, the only carve out that they've given is the guys
[40:55.880 --> 41:01.100]  that raise pigs in confinement. And those are usually corporately held.
[41:01.100 --> 41:03.140]  Yeah, like corporate feedlot operations.
[41:03.140 --> 41:07.300]  Right, right. So they're not affected by this at all.
[41:07.300 --> 41:08.300]  Got it.
[41:08.300 --> 41:13.060]  It's the family farm that's affected. And you know, if you were to call, if your listeners
[41:13.060 --> 41:18.540]  were to call the Michigan DNR right now, they'd probably get a story like, oh, that doesn't
[41:18.540 --> 41:25.700]  apply to people that raise 4-H pigs. But then if you take the law that's sitting in front
[41:25.700 --> 41:28.660]  of me, it's the declaratory ruling that's available on our website if someone wants
[41:28.660 --> 41:33.100]  to download it, and you read it and then you have some pigs in your backyard and you look
[41:33.100 --> 41:38.180]  at them, you're going to say, well, by golly, my pigs do have floppy ears. That would make
[41:38.180 --> 41:41.420]  them illegal under the declaratory ruling.
[41:41.420 --> 41:48.300]  It's the floppy ears law. But look, listeners, check out Mark Baker's website, bakersgreenacres.com.
[41:48.300 --> 41:53.300]  There are some great videos there that describe all of this in more detail. And if you're
[41:53.300 --> 41:58.900]  able, you may also wish to offer some small donations of support. Mark Baker and his attorneys
[41:58.900 --> 42:04.460]  are fighting this, fighting against the highly oppressive Michigan government over this issue.
[42:04.460 --> 42:10.460]  What's the next step for your lawsuit, Mark? I know that the courts have been denying you
[42:10.460 --> 42:16.700]  an actual trial, but what's the next step? You mentioned something happening maybe in
[42:16.700 --> 42:19.100]  June of this year. I mean, what's going on?
[42:19.100 --> 42:25.740]  Right. The last step that we had, I mean, that will help put it in perspective, we filed
[42:25.740 --> 42:34.300]  a motion with the court and said that we believe that the declaratory ruling is vague, and
[42:34.300 --> 42:38.460]  therefore it's unconstitutional if it's vague, because if they're going to charge me with
[42:38.460 --> 42:44.220]  a felony for these pigs that I have, and that is what harboring an invasive species is punishable
[42:44.220 --> 42:49.180]  with, if they're going to charge me with a felony, then it cannot be vague. It has to
[42:49.180 --> 42:54.380]  be very to the point, very clear, so a person knows that they're breaking the law. And we
[42:54.380 --> 42:59.380]  felt as though the ninth characteristic, where it says other characteristics not currently
[42:59.380 --> 43:07.700]  known to the DNR, as a characteristic that could make me a felon, we felt that that was
[43:07.700 --> 43:14.200]  vague. And so we filed a motion with the court. The judge heard the motion. The judge said
[43:14.200 --> 43:19.700]  I'll let you know in 30 days, 35 days come, and he says, no, I don't think it's vague.
[43:19.700 --> 43:27.580]  I think it's good. So now we have to go back to court, and trying to schedule a court is
[43:27.580 --> 43:33.020]  tough, and they're telling us we're not going to be able to get in until June.
[43:33.020 --> 43:37.300]  All right, so he doesn't think that whatever we want to make up, that that's not vague,
[43:37.300 --> 43:43.660]  huh? That's wild. That's kind of like the United Nations treaty, human rights treaty,
[43:43.660 --> 43:51.900]  that says something like, yeah, you have all your rights, unless it opposes whatever we
[43:51.900 --> 43:57.080]  want the UN to do. Is it just a very general, vague statement that is kind of a blanket
[43:57.080 --> 43:59.700]  statement that nullifies everything else they just said?
[43:59.700 --> 44:05.260]  Right. Well, let me ask you a bigger question here, Mark. Let's take your situation and
[44:05.260 --> 44:12.620]  expand it to the nation. So just as you have been denied your right to engage in farming,
[44:12.620 --> 44:18.180]  and your food freedoms have been taken away, and you used to be in the military, you served
[44:18.180 --> 44:19.180]  this country.
[44:19.180 --> 44:20.180]  Right.
[44:20.180 --> 44:26.060]  Now, all Americans are being threatened with having their rights taken away by Dianne Feinstein,
[44:26.060 --> 44:31.100]  Obama, Biden, all the other gun grabbers who are suddenly saying, well, the Second Amendment
[44:31.100 --> 44:36.660]  doesn't apply, Bill of Rights doesn't apply, we can just take these away from you because
[44:36.660 --> 44:37.660]  we want to.
[44:37.660 --> 44:38.660]  Yeah.
[44:38.660 --> 44:43.260]  What are your thoughts on what's happening in America as a whole today?
[44:43.260 --> 44:47.300]  Well, did you ever see the movie Ants?
[44:47.300 --> 44:49.900]  Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that.
[44:49.900 --> 44:55.340]  I think that's my feeling. I was at an event yesterday and I looked out over the crowd
[44:55.340 --> 45:05.860]  and I saw probably 300 men from ages, say, 20 to 60. And the nature of that event, I
[45:05.860 --> 45:10.500]  felt as though most of those men feel the same way that I do about our country and our
[45:10.500 --> 45:17.900]  freedoms. And we have a few people like Dianne Feinstein that are going to level some new
[45:17.900 --> 45:25.300]  law because there's been some tragedies in the country. I think it's about time the men
[45:25.300 --> 45:31.100]  get together and start saying, we're going to come to the table and offer you our suggestion
[45:31.100 --> 45:35.820]  of what the way things ought to go. And it wouldn't be the first time that's been done
[45:35.820 --> 45:36.820]  in this country.
[45:36.820 --> 45:41.460]  Well, and when you say come to the table and offer you our suggestion, I mean, wouldn't
[45:41.460 --> 45:46.060]  that suggestion be to basically have all of you gun grabbers arrested as traitors? I mean,
[45:46.060 --> 45:47.940]  isn't that what the constitution really says?
[45:47.940 --> 45:53.380]  Yeah, if I was one of those gun grabbers, I think that I'd be barring the door.
[45:53.380 --> 45:58.580]  Good point. Hey, in fact, I've got an article that I'm going to read here, not the whole
[45:58.580 --> 46:05.540]  thing, but I'm going to read this in the next segment. This is by Paul Howe from combatshootingandtactics.com.
[46:05.540 --> 46:10.900]  Paul Howe, he is an outstanding firearms instructor. You may know who he is, Mark.
[46:10.900 --> 46:11.900]  I don't.
[46:11.900 --> 46:16.380]  Well, he's an incredible tactical instructor. His article is entitled Second Amendment and
[46:16.380 --> 46:19.300]  the Kool-Aid Drinkers. And I'm going to go through some of the highlights of that. It's
[46:19.300 --> 46:24.900]  very powerful because he talks about, and he's not a radical guy or anything. He's a
[46:24.900 --> 46:30.700]  constitutional patriot, very upstanding citizen.
[46:30.700 --> 46:35.800]  And he talks about like this, after the first few raids, he's talking about if gun confiscation
[46:35.800 --> 46:40.700]  is kicked off, the word would get out and Americans would start to fight back. It would
[46:40.700 --> 46:45.260]  only take one good ambush from a house or along a travel route to decimate a tactical
[46:45.260 --> 46:51.220]  force or make it combat ineffective. That seems to be what I'm hearing from more and
[46:51.220 --> 46:53.220]  more people, in fact.
[46:53.220 --> 47:02.980]  Well, they have to get young men to perform these gun confiscations. And those men have
[47:02.980 --> 47:09.140]  lives. They only have one. They have families. They have things that they like to do on weekends.
[47:09.140 --> 47:15.860]  And they would be going into a very precarious situation. These are American citizens we're
[47:15.860 --> 47:21.780]  talking about here. These are not Canadian. This isn't Australia. This is the United States
[47:21.780 --> 47:26.940]  of America. I think they better rethink what they're talking about.
[47:26.940 --> 47:32.700]  Well, I think we need more Americans to stand up like you have done. You refuse to lay down
[47:32.700 --> 47:39.320]  to the Michigan DNR and you're fighting it. And that is the path to victory. The victory
[47:39.320 --> 47:43.820]  is within our reach. All we have to do is call their bluff and stand up to them.
[47:43.820 --> 47:50.060]  All these people that are calling for gun grabbing, they don't have experience in the
[47:50.060 --> 47:54.740]  field with firearms. They're hoping someone else will do it for them.
[47:54.740 --> 47:55.740]  Oh, right.
[47:55.740 --> 47:58.780]  You know, Senator Feinstein, she's not gonna grab a gun and kick in your front door and
[47:58.780 --> 48:04.140]  throw a flashbang in there and say, I'm Feinstein, here to get your guns. No, she's gonna try
[48:04.140 --> 48:07.780]  to recruit somebody else to do that. Although, it would be an interesting video if she actually
[48:07.780 --> 48:10.060]  tried to do that, but she's probably not.
[48:10.060 --> 48:15.020]  No, no. She'll get some other American to do it, some 23-year-old kid that wants to
[48:15.020 --> 48:22.500]  be law enforcement. And yeah, they don't do their own dirty work, that's for sure.
[48:22.500 --> 48:28.220]  No, never, never. Even in war, they send somebody else's kids off to fight their wars to fight
[48:28.220 --> 48:37.780]  and die in too many cases, sadly. Well, where do you think this is all going? Either, not
[48:37.780 --> 48:39.660]  just in Michigan, but where do you think it's all headed?
[48:39.660 --> 48:44.960]  Because look, I think your issue that you're facing there, Mark, is just a symptom of America,
[48:44.960 --> 48:48.180]  the erosion of freedoms and liberties. It's all the same issue.
[48:48.180 --> 48:54.820]  I agree, Mike. Like with the gun issue, they want to take everybody's gun because one nut
[48:54.820 --> 48:58.260]  did something crazy, right? It's the same thing with the pigs. They want to take the
[48:58.260 --> 49:03.820]  farmer's pigs because there are supposedly some feral pigs that are doing damage to golf
[49:03.820 --> 49:06.180]  courses. It's kind of the same thing.
[49:06.180 --> 49:11.140]  Well, that's like saying that if somebody's bull gets loose and their bull runs around
[49:11.140 --> 49:14.180]  the golf course tearing up the golf course, which I'm sure a bull would have a wonderful
[49:14.180 --> 49:19.500]  time doing that, to say, well, now all bulls are going to be illegal or cows are going
[49:19.500 --> 49:21.980]  to be banned in Michigan. It's the same thing.
[49:21.980 --> 49:26.460]  Sure, it's the same thing. Or if a dog bites somebody, let's do away with all dogs.
[49:26.460 --> 49:28.900]  Right, right. Yeah, it's a felony to have a dog.
[49:28.900 --> 49:37.580]  Yeah. So this thing with Americans picking up guns, that's a really hot topic. And I
[49:37.580 --> 49:45.340]  know I come in contact with a lot of people that talk about this, and I think that is
[49:45.340 --> 49:51.020]  the one issue that is really going to kick the can over. And we're coming to a showdown.
[49:51.020 --> 49:55.900]  There's no doubt about it. And it's going to go one way or the other. And it's the same
[49:55.900 --> 50:02.300]  thing with the pigs. We're coming to a showdown. Either we have the right to farm or we don't.
[50:02.300 --> 50:06.420]  But if they want to take that right away from us, somebody's got to come take it.
[50:06.420 --> 50:10.900]  Well, Mark, I am confident. I'm absolutely confident. In fact, I have a great sense of
[50:10.900 --> 50:15.340]  optimism about all this over the last few days after really digging into this. The gun
[50:15.340 --> 50:21.380]  owners are going to win big time, big time, because the insanity has gotten so bad that
[50:21.380 --> 50:24.980]  it can't continue. I don't know if you heard the first part of the show, but did you hear
[50:24.980 --> 50:30.440]  the story out of the New York Post that welfare recipients now are using their EBT cards,
[50:30.440 --> 50:36.040]  that's their government handout cards, at strip clubs, liquor stores, and X-rated shops.
[50:36.040 --> 50:38.620]  That's where they're using your tax money, Mark.
[50:38.620 --> 50:44.580]  Well, yeah, I don't like that too good.
[50:44.580 --> 50:49.420]  Yeah, that's how insane it has become. But anyway, stay with us, Mark. We'll be right
[50:49.420 --> 50:54.660]  back after this break. More from Mark Baker here on the Alex Jones Show. This is Mike
[50:54.660 --> 51:01.400]  Adams sitting in. Stay with us a lot straight ahead.
[51:01.400 --> 51:06.260]  Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[51:06.260 --> 51:10.840]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[51:10.840 --> 51:15.900]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods
[51:15.900 --> 51:20.020]  Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm
[51:20.020 --> 51:24.540]  by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City
[51:24.540 --> 51:30.220]  wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[51:30.220 --> 51:34.980]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early
[51:34.980 --> 51:39.580]  than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

[52:01.260 --> 52:05.900]  this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want
[52:05.900 --> 52:11.460]  you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[52:11.460 --> 52:15.740]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could
[52:15.740 --> 52:21.220]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[52:21.220 --> 52:25.660]  the world to keep people healthy. Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in
[52:25.660 --> 52:31.500]  this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal
[52:31.500 --> 52:36.340]  cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your
[52:36.340 --> 52:40.500]  chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that
[52:40.500 --> 52:50.340]  don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

[52:58.820 --> 53:00.500]  It's the only one you've got.
[53:00.500 --> 53:06.580]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[53:06.580 --> 53:12.700]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[53:12.700 --> 53:17.980]  device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[53:17.980 --> 53:22.060]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[53:22.060 --> 53:26.880]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[53:26.880 --> 53:31.600]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[53:31.600 --> 53:37.700]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[53:37.700 --> 53:43.380]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[53:43.380 --> 53:48.560]  exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[53:48.560 --> 53:53.780]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online so go to weirddevice.com
[53:53.780 --> 54:14.700]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[54:14.700 --> 54:24.900]  All right. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger
[54:24.900 --> 54:31.460]  filling in for Alex. I'm the editor of naturalnews.com and a frequent contributor to infowars.com.
[54:31.460 --> 54:35.960]  Go to infowars.com right now, by the way. A lot of news stories being posted there.
[54:35.960 --> 54:43.480]  Every morning, Kurt Nemo and Don are cranking away and Paul Joseph Watson, of course, also
[54:43.480 --> 54:49.900]  working at the early hours of our morning in the US. He's based, obviously, in the UK.
[54:49.900 --> 54:57.260]  A lot of great information there. I was just thinking, we need a new B, like a B movie
[54:57.260 --> 55:05.540]  called Invasion of the Zombie Redcoats. You know how they have all that zombie ammo out
[55:05.540 --> 55:06.540]  there now?
[55:06.540 --> 55:11.460]  Like Hornady and all these companies have zombie ammo, Zombie Max. And there's even
[55:11.460 --> 55:18.380]  a company that has a varmint round called Zombageddon or something. It's really great.
[55:18.380 --> 55:27.100]  We should have a new B movie, the Zombie Redcoats, to try to take over Washington. I'm not going
[55:27.100 --> 55:30.420]  to go into that too much more. Sorry, I get carried away.
[55:30.420 --> 55:37.920]  But let's go into this article and ask for Mark Baker's feedback on it again. Mark Baker
[55:37.920 --> 55:43.360]  joins us with bakersgreenacres.com. And he, of course, has been threatened with felony
[55:43.360 --> 55:49.100]  crimes by the state of Michigan for raising pigs that he's been raising for many, many
[55:49.100 --> 55:50.100]  years.
[55:50.100 --> 55:56.380]  In fact, his family has been in the farming business for, I think, generations. Mark,
[55:56.380 --> 56:01.580]  we talked about what the reaction might be from Americans if there were a gun confiscation
[56:01.580 --> 56:07.860]  order. But I think people don't realize that if they turn in their guns, then they're going
[56:07.860 --> 56:12.540]  to lose all their other freedoms, such as farming freedom, as you're also experiencing
[56:12.540 --> 56:13.540]  now.
[56:13.540 --> 56:17.460]  But food freedom, medical freedom, freedom to say no to vaccines, all these other issues
[56:17.460 --> 56:21.260]  that people want to have a choice on. What are your thoughts on that, Mark?
[56:21.260 --> 56:27.180]  Oh, that's the easy one for me. I'm a student of history, and I know that gun registration
[56:27.180 --> 56:35.380]  is always followed by gun confiscation. And when the people don't have guns, the people
[56:35.380 --> 56:44.980]  who do have guns can tell them to do whatever they want. So if your guns are being confiscated
[56:44.980 --> 56:51.180]  from you, you might as well get ready to get herded onto cattle cars next, because they'll
[56:51.180 --> 56:56.860]  be able to do it to you, and you won't have any choice.
[56:56.860 --> 57:02.540]  Everybody knows that the right to own and bear arms is not about hunting or keeping
[57:02.540 --> 57:07.700]  the Indians out of the camp. It's really about the balance of powers. We're supposed to have
[57:07.700 --> 57:12.500]  federal troops, state troops, and then citizen militia. That's how it's supposed to be set
[57:12.500 --> 57:17.740]  up, so that the citizens can come to the table and have some say in what's going to happen
[57:17.740 --> 57:22.820]  across the country. Right now, we've got the federal government, the state government telling
[57:22.820 --> 57:25.420]  us, the citizenry, this is how it's going to be.
[57:25.420 --> 57:29.980]  Well, that's what's fascinating. You see, the gun-grabbing liberals, and I don't want
[57:29.980 --> 57:34.380]  to always use the term liberal in a negative connotation, but in this context, it is, in
[57:34.380 --> 57:40.020]  the sense that they're so naive. Apparently, they've never studied history. They don't
[57:40.020 --> 57:45.340]  know that they, too, will be rounded up eventually or oppressed eventually.
[57:45.340 --> 57:50.180]  You see, they want to have the federal government take away the guns, but then they don't think
[57:50.180 --> 57:53.980]  about, well, what about the next election? What if there's another tyrant that gets the
[57:53.980 --> 58:00.780]  White House, even the Republican tyrant, let's say, who's worse than Obama, worse than Clinton,
[58:00.780 --> 58:08.580]  worse than Bush, or whatever? And that person uses the power that Obama took from the people
[58:08.580 --> 58:09.580]  to then commit genocide.
[58:09.580 --> 58:12.900]  You see, the liberals don't think ahead. I don't know. I don't get it.
[58:12.900 --> 58:18.860]  Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of shortsightedness, but that's typical of what they do.
[58:18.860 --> 58:22.860]  Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess foresight requires intelligence, and that's just asking too much.
[58:22.860 --> 58:25.980]  But Mark Baker, thank you for joining us today. It's been a pleasure having you on.
[58:25.980 --> 58:27.700]  Thanks for having me on, Mike.
[58:27.700 --> 58:32.560]  Thank you, and go to bakersgreenacres.com. Learn more about the fight that Mark Baker
[58:32.560 --> 58:36.980]  is having with the state of Michigan and their attempts to oppress farm freedom and food
[58:36.980 --> 58:43.860]  freedom right under our noses. We'll be right back.
[58:43.860 --> 58:48.500]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:48.500 --> 58:55.220]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[58:55.220 --> 58:59.660]  you get sick and die? Start purifying your water with ProPure. My friends, I've done
[58:59.660 --> 59:04.860]  a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure. And it's
[59:04.860 --> 59:10.260]  available discounted at infowars.com. Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent
[59:10.260 --> 59:16.620]  bacterial growth. There's no priming required. It's NSF-42 certified. Optional fluoride filters
[59:16.620 --> 59:21.980]  can reduce fluoride up to 95%. Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[59:21.980 --> 59:27.200]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells. This filter system leaves in beneficial
[59:27.200 --> 59:31.820]  minerals, which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches
[59:31.820 --> 59:36.500]  from the plastic. ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there. It's what my family
[59:36.500 --> 59:41.380]  uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure. But if you add the promo
[59:41.380 --> 59:46.780]  code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com. You can also call

[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:29.860]  the second hour of the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:37.780]  for Alex today, who is on an airplane to New York right now to appear on CNN later tonight
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:42.780]  talking with Piers Morgan. And so I'm filling in for Alex today and having a good time doing
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:48.980]  it too, because you can't help but make comedy about all the insanity that's going on out
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980]  there.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.880]  It's so insane that you gotta laugh at it. But we also have some solutions that we're
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.940]  talking about today. I've got a good solution, in fact, coming up here. But first, let me
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.300]  give you a preview of what's happening this hour. At the bottom of this hour, we're gonna
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:10.820]  be joined by John Rappaport from nomorefakenews.com to discuss psychiatric drugs and how the government's
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:16.980]  surveillance of your prescription drugs could be turned against you to deny you your constitutional
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]  rights.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.820]  I also hope to take some calls when John is on the air with us. So I'll announce the phone
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:28.380]  number in the next segment. We'll get some calls queued up for John. And then in the
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:36.660]  third hour, Aaron Dykes is going to be taking command of the chair here and possibly reading
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.620]  from a Paul Revere book I heard. I don't know if that's true or if that was just some banter
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:45.240]  around the office here, but maybe something to do with Paul Revere.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.220]  We'll find out, and I'll let you know as soon as I know. Now in the meantime, I've got a
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:58.980]  solution for all the gun grabbers. This is the perfect solution for liberals. You can
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:05.740]  opt out of the Bill of Rights. If you hate the Second Amendment, give it up. If you hate
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:10.780]  the Bill of Rights, give it up. All you have to do, folks, here's all you have to do. Take
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:18.580]  your passport down to the US passport office, denounce your citizenship, book a flight to
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.820]  a nation called North Korea.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:29.380]  Once there, they will give you a new passport and you can enjoy utopia under the new regime
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:39.340]  of freedom. What's the guy's name there? Not Kim Jong-il, it's Kim Jong-un. Yes, because
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:46.140]  every generation they change one syllable. Next time is gonna be Kim Jong-un. But all
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.260]  the liberals could go there.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:54.860]  And there you have no Second Amendment, therefore everything must be A-OK. Never mind the barbed
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:03:00.420]  wire facing inward at the border checkpoints to prevent North Koreans from escaping their
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.980]  own country. Never mind that. Never mind the fact that the guards face inward with their
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:11.700]  assault rifles. Yes, they have guns in North Korea, but only in the hands of the government
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.700]  guards.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:18.020]  But I think the liberals would love that. So you see, the Bill of Rights is optional.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:24.940]  You can simply give it up for yourself, but you can't take it from me. You got that? You
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:29.140]  can't take it from me. And you can't take it from the other patriots and the other veterans
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.860]  and the other lawful and legal gun owners and the other peace officers who are actually
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.780]  trying to restore peace and liberty and freedom in this country.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:47.260]  You can't take it from us, you can only denounce your own. In fact, we should just have a website
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:56.580]  for liberals called Opt Out of the Bill of Rights. The leaders of that movement up there,
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.100]  put Michael Moore up there, you know, put Feinstein up there. The leaders of the Opt
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:06.100]  Out of the Bill of Rights effort, that would be very popular in certain circles in Hollywood,
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.300]  I imagine.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:14.500]  Now there's another thing that we have to remember here, that this very idea that because
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:22.140]  one person in Sandy Hook committed a terrible crime of violence, that everybody else in
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.940]  the country is supposed to give up all their rights. Wait a minute, wait a minute. One
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:29.540]  citizen does something bad, every citizen gets punished for it.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:35.660]  Well, by the same logic, if one government bureaucrat ever abuses the freedom of an American
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:40.800]  citizen and my gosh, they never do that, then we should ban all government. We should eliminate
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.540]  all government. I mean, using their logic, one person does something wrong, ban everybody.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:50.940]  We should say one government official does something wrong, defund the entire government.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:57.980]  That's their logic. But of course, they want it selectively applied, not rationally applied
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.140]  across the board. We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:06.580]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:12.220]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:17.380]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:22.900]  the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com. These are items
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.940]  that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:21.420]  Yeah, we're back on the Alex Jones Show. This is Monday. It's another Monday for just joining
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:27.980]  us, January 7th, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:32.700]  with some pretty energetic music. Thanks, guys. Always appreciate the extra boost, not
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:37.700]  that we need it around here, powered by freedom and superfoods. That's our slogan. That's
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:43.540]  our motto. And speaking of freedom, we've got joining us today, I guess, the executive
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:51.060]  director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, ISRA, is just going to be joining us for about
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.560]  five minutes or so to give us an update on this sneak attack that happened last night
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:04.300]  in Illinois, in Springfield, to try to destroy the Second Amendment rights of all citizens
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.460]  of the state of Illinois.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:12.220]  So Mr. Pearson, Richard Pearson is his name. And guys, if you'll bring up the website,
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:16.160]  I'll mention the URL during the interview. Mr. Pearson, thank you for joining us today
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.460]  on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.420]  Hey, I'm glad to be here. Well, thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:27.460]  Give us an update, a breakdown. What happened yesterday in the state Congress there?
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:34.220]  Well, what happened was we had been working all weekend with phone calls, and I got lots
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:40.540]  of complaints in that the phone lines were jammed up, melted down, plugged up, and they
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.200]  decided to withdraw all the bills yesterday at four o'clock.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.820]  So they were trying to sneak it through on a Sunday.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:54.540]  Right. But on Sunday, we were there, and they decided to voice the white flag at least temporarily.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:10:00.060]  So if this bill had passed, tell us exactly what it would have done in terms of criminalizing
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.940]  firearms in the state.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:07.900]  Well, you wouldn't have been able to own any semi-automatic anything, including 22 rifles
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.900]  with magazines.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:15.100]  Wow. Do these people not realize how many farmers and ranchers are in Illinois, and
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.740]  they need these as tools of the farm?
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:22.980]  They don't care. They don't like anybody that owns guns. They don't like you because
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.180]  you like guns. They don't like me because I like guns.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:33.940]  So surely they must realize that Chicago is already the murder capital of the world, even
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.620]  though it's a, quote, gun-free zone.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:40.260]  Well, that's right. But it's because of those guns, it's the murder capital of the world.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:46.860]  So the second largest city, which is not a gun-free zone, had no murders last year.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:47.860]  And which city would that be?
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:55.500]  That would be Aurora, Illinois. And so I don't know how they reconcile this, but they can
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.660]  do it in their own mind because they have magnificent mental power.
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.920]  How angry are the legal firearms owners in the state of Illinois right now? Because I'm
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.180]  sure you've heard from a lot of them. What's the word on the street there?
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:15.060]  They are angry. But that doesn't mean that this is piloted by the city of Chicago and
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.780]  Rahm Emanuel until they're going to bring this back again. It doesn't matter to them
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:25.300]  how angry they are. But so we'll see this again and we will resist with every effort.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:32.460]  But sir, do they think that they can just make a law on a piece of paper and that nothing
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:37.420]  is going to happen in response? Do they think that all the people of the state of Illinois
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:43.060]  are just going to turn in their guns and become slaves to Rahm?
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.620]  Do they really believe that's going to happen?
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:48.580]  Well, I actually think that they do actually believe that's going to happen. But I think
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:57.820]  the last few days have shown that that might be outside of what's going to happen here.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:01.100]  What is your website, Mr. Pearson, so that people can visit?
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:08.020]  www.isra.org. ISRA.org. Okay. And I see you have an urgent alert posted there. That's
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.260]  from yesterday. Yes.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:15.380]  Are you getting a lot of additional press right now across the country or across the
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.940]  state? What's happening with the media angle on this?
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:23.380]  We are getting lots of interviews, lots of phone calls, lots of emails. We have people
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:29.540]  joining. We have members from Texas, by the way. And so we appreciate everyone going to
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.700]  the website and joining. And we thank you for that.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:38.500]  Excellent. All right. Well, I appreciate the update, Richard. Thank you for joining us
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:44.560]  here on the Alex Jones show today and keep up the fight because we, the gun owners of
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.860]  America will win this. We just have to continue the fight. That's all.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.820]  Oh, yeah, we do. And we have to stick together too.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:56.660]  Absolutely. Well, good job defeating that bill and keep up the effort to fight for liberty
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.500]  and freedom in America.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.940]  I will. Thank you and thank everyone out there.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.860]  All right. Thank you. Take care then. All right. That was Richard Pearson from the Illinois
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:10.660]  state rifle association. And I'm sure similar events are happening elsewhere across the
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:16.580]  country. There are probably various nefarious plans by the state representatives of certain
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:21.380]  cities, let's say, to try to take away the second amendment rights of lawful and legal
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:27.500]  gun owners, which by the way, include many peace officers, many returning veterans, many
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.900]  active duty military and active duty cops as well.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.420]  And I did a story the other day too about airline pilots. Most people who fly airplanes
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:45.320]  don't realize that about 17% of the time, you're flying in a plane with an armed pilot.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  And that's a good thing. It's a good thing because we don't want pilots to be overpowered
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.500]  by terrorists, right? Or hijackers or anything else. So we arm the pilots and they carry
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:00.180]  concealed weapons in the flight deck and they're prepared to use them.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.860]  And I'll tell you what, the pilots that I know, one pilot in particular, he's a very
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:15.900]  good shot with a Colt 1911 and a 45 caliber. He'll put two right in the forehead of any
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:22.060]  terrorist that tries to break into the flight deck. No questions asked. So there you go.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:27.560]  Pilots, yep, good guys and gals, a few gals, but mostly good guys. All right, let's go
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.360]  on to this story here. Second amendment and the Kool-Aid drinkers. This was posted by
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.480]  Paul Howe. I mentioned it earlier. This was ahead of us being joined by John Rappaport
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.540]  at the bottom of this hour.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.900]  This is a very important story. And this was the most important story of the day in my
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:50.300]  opinion. Paul Howe is the creator of combatshootingandtactics.com. Combatshootingandtactics.com. Paul Howe
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:56.940]  is a very intelligent firearms instructor. I've learned a tremendous amount of information
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:04.740]  from his videos posted over at makeready.tv. That's the website, makeready.tv. I normally
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:11.220]  don't endorse just third party video companies, but in this case, I've seen so many millions
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:17.220]  of Americans purchasing firearms but not necessarily getting good training on how to use them.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:23.140]  And makeready.tv is a great place. You can get online training, tons of videos. I use
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:29.240]  it. It is top notch, top quality production. Panteo Productions is the company. And no,
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:34.100]  they didn't pay me to say that. I'm just a customer and a patriot. So go to makeready.tv.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:39.260]  You can see Paul Howe in action. Now getting to his article though, this is brilliant.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.020]  Second amendment and the Kool-Aid drinkers. Paul Howe discusses what would actually happen
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:49.080]  if gun confiscation were attempted in the United States. He asked the question, who's
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.020]  coming to get them, meaning the guns? Who's coming to get the guns? And he breaks it down
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:58.660]  because look, he trains with military. He trains with law enforcement and he has for
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:04.020]  decades. He knows all the tactics. He knows all the people. He knows their attitudes,
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:09.140]  their belief systems, their loyalties. This guy knows what he is talking about. The most
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:15.020]  qualified person to talk about this issue of gun confiscation in my opinion.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:20.860]  He says that, first of all, if the military were tasked with gun confiscation, here's
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:26.340]  what would happen. He says, quote, remember, these forces, the military forces, would have
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:32.740]  to come from a military base that is surrounded and supported by American communities. If
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:38.960]  the military began gun confiscation, the civilians would simply stop supporting the base, cut
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:45.020]  off the fuel, food, electricity on the bases, and it would stop the silliness, Paul Howe
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.300]  says in his article.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.160]  And he says also many service members that live in those local communities would have
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:57.560]  to travel from their houses to their base unless they were locked down. And the families
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.660]  in the community would not be too friendly to those engaging in gun confiscation. That's
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:07.460]  another way of saying, you're not gonna make it to the base, buddy. You may not even make
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.060]  it out of your house if you're one of these gun grabbers.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:18.580]  Now, another quote, if the federal government tries to engage in gun confiscation, DHS or
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:25.860]  TSA, can you imagine the TSA trying to engage in gun confiscation? These pathetic people
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:32.340]  wouldn't last a day. They'd be outgunned by all the patriots and all the police officers
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.300]  and all the preppers in no time.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:40.540]  TSA, give me a break. What are they gonna do, raid our house with a latex glove? Really?
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:45.360]  Paul Howe writes, after the first few raids, the word would get out and Americans would
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.780]  start to fight back. Yeah, no kidding. It would take one good ambush from a house or
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:54.900]  along a travel route to decimate a tactical force or make it combat ineffective.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:18:00.780]  Yep, that's all it takes. If you're gonna try to declare war on the American people
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.660]  by taking away their guns, you're gonna have a guerrilla war on your hands. And you're
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:10.060]  gonna lose, you gun grabbers, you're gonna lose big time. Paul Howe continues in his
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:15.660]  article, he says, quote, most federal agencies work out of a fixed location centrally located
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:16.660]  in a community.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:23.980]  Ah, yes, we know where you are. We know where you're based. And he goes on, those were my
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:28.380]  words, we know where you are, not Paul's words. But Paul goes on, also, their personnel live
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:32.220]  in those communities along with their families. Once the word got out that they were doing
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:37.540]  raids in violation to the Constitution, they and their families would be at risk.
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:43.940]  Yeah, they and their families would be more than at risk. They would probably have their
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:50.020]  homes burned out. Because think about it, think about it. If you're on a tactical police
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:55.500]  team and you're conducting armed raids on houses around your community, they know where
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:00.940]  you live. It's not a secret, your names, if you're on a force that's doing that, they
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.980]  know where your homes are.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:08.740]  You can expect your home to be burned out probably if this kind of thing gets going.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:13.860]  You're putting yourself in danger is what's gonna happen. And most sheriffs and deputies
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:18.340]  and police officers are gonna say, no way, I'm not doing that. Besides, I believe in
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.860]  the Constitution, I support the Second Amendment. That's what they're gonna say. I'm not gonna
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.820]  just run around and kick in people's doors.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:30.420]  All how continuous tactical teams could probably do only eight to ten hits in a day and then
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.740]  they would need a break. That's a lot of hits. So they hit ten houses and seize their guns,
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:40.380]  the word gets out. It would not go well. And if one or two determined Americans or combat
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:44.900]  vets fought back, the team would lose many, the TAC team would lose members to death or
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.140]  injury and they would admit, and well, they have to stop doing their raids cuz they're
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.300]  losing guys.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:55.140]  That's the way it would really work. So there you go. That's the truth on the situation
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.740]  of gun confiscation from Paul Howe. We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show. Stay
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.540]  with us.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:06.380]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:10.980]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:15.940]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:30.380]  wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:35.140]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared ten years too early
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:39.740]  than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:04.900]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:09.900]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.740]  of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:18.780]  line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:23.700]  Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.660]  questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:32.100]  Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:37.200]  central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.240]  cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone

[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:30.820]  guided entrance for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag

[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:23.860]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show. Alex is on an airplane headed to New York
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:29.220]  to be on a show tonight. This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:34.620]  Sort of a last minute deal. He called me over the weekend and was like, hey Mike, can you
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:41.340]  fill in? I said, okay, you got it, you got it, man. Anything for the cause of liberty.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:47.300]  So I am here. And by the way, a friend texted me over the break that we just had. And because
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:53.060]  earlier in the show, I sort of joked about Senator Feinstein kicking in doors and throwing
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:25:00.420]  flashbangs and engaging in her own gun confiscation. And my friend texted me and said, I'd pay
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:06.420]  good money to see that. I would pay money to see Senator Feinstein throwing a flashbang
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.980]  and kicking in doors and seizing guns.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:16.060]  Yeah, we all would. They said, hey, Joe Rogan out there, you should get a pay-per-view thing
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:22.700]  set up with the UFC called the Ultimate Confiscation Championship and have Senator Feinstein and
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:28.160]  Schumer and Michael Moore and dress them up in body armor and put guns in their hands
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.740]  and have them try to kick it. They probably couldn't even kick in the door. They just
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.020]  couldn't even get that far.
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:37.700]  They could kick the door and break an ankle. You know what I mean? It would be that pathetic.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:43.860]  But I think all these people talk about gun confiscation. Do it yourself, man. Don't hide
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:50.860]  behind a bunch of laws. If you wanna take our guns, do it personally, face to face.
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:26:03.740]  Bring it on. All right, man. Okay, drudgereport.com right now, top link. Showdown, talk host Alex
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:10.620]  Jones detained by the TSA. This is true. This is top link on Drudge. And there's a picture
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:11.620]  of it.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:17.480]  Go to drudgereport.com right now. There's a picture of it, I guess, looks like another
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:24.100]  passenger traveler grabbed this photo and sent it to Drudge. And Alex called me from
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:28.920]  the airplane right before I went on the air here, about 20 minutes before I went on the
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.260]  air today.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:39.380]  He was very angry and he said that the TSA had detained him and threatened him with arrest.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:47.060]  And really, what's this officer's name? Okay, John Bowne here just said that that's the
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:52.200]  same officer in the photo that detained or that threatened them when they were filming
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.280]  at the Austin airport.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.740]  So that officer, whoever, I don't know his name, apparently does not understand the Bill
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:04.580]  of Rights and the Constitution. And I guess we should thank that officer because what
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:12.080]  he did is he just sent Alex Jones to New York with extra steam. That's what he really did.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.620]  But there's gonna be a video on this later today. Alex filmed some of this on his iPhone.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:23.340]  I've been told. And that video is going to be edited shortly. There has to be some other
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.600]  travelers taken out of the video who don't have anything to do with it.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:33.300]  So they're gonna be edited out to focus on the actual conflict. Alex Jones detained,
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:38.780]  threatened with arrest at the Austin airport today, this morning, just hours ago. So that's
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:43.400]  the new America. You can't even get on the plane and fly to a media interview without
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:49.300]  being threatened with unlawful arrest by a bunch of goons who think that the Constitution
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.240]  doesn't apply in an airport.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:57.640]  People are fed up. I'm fed up. You're fed up. Patriots are fed up. Gun owners are fed
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.920]  up with the insanity. And this is not gonna last, folks. This is not going to last, believe
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:08.340]  me. And in just a couple of minutes, we've got John Rappaport joining us by Skype to
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.680]  give us some additional thoughts on where this was all headed.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.800]  But first, let me finish up this article about the Kool-Aid drinkers from Paul Howe because
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.300]  he has a couple more quotes in here that are very powerful. I just wanna get these in.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:26.440]  Paul mentions, and Paul's a firearms instructor, one of the best, most widely recognized in
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:33.400]  the country. I believe he trains people at a facility here in Texas, in fact. He says
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.680]  that America is a nation of combat veterans and patriots. We have the guns and ammunitions
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  out there and the talent to use them because thanks to the fact that we've been at war
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:49.020]  since about the early 1990s, our nation has effectively trained hundreds of thousands
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:52.700]  of soldiers how to use firearms.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:59.680]  And those soldiers, their loyalty is to the Constitution to which they took an oath. So
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:04.320]  that's a very positive outcome of the fact that we've been at war, even though I don't
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:09.560]  support all the wars. But I am happy that our soldiers have gained the skills that come
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:14.520]  from conflict so that we can protect our liberties here at home.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.320]  Paul Howe again, in every law enforcement, government, and military agency or branch,
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.520]  he says there are a small number of Kool-Aid drinkers who would blindly follow orders.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:30.160]  They would either be purged internally by their co-workers, he says, or the people they
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:37.520]  attacked would, quote, stop their gene pool. That's another, that's a euphemism for being
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.120]  terminated as a traitor to America. Those are the words of Paul Howe.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.560]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. John Rapoport coming up after this break. This is the Alex
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.600]  Jones Show. Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in, fighting for liberty.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:30:01.560]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:02.120]  Bye bye.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:32.120]  Bye bye.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.120]  Bye bye.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:32.120]  Bye bye.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:02.120]  Bye bye.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:33.120]  Bye bye.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:03.120]  Bye bye.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:33.120]  We know who you are. We know you're a critic. And just so you understand, Alex, we're in
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:38.480]  charge, not you. So that's the point that we're trying to make. But of course, they
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.400]  didn't make it because he got on the plane.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:49.320]  It's the raw exercise of juvenile tyranny. These people, they must have such small little
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:57.320]  souls. They must be such children inside these TSA officers. I can't even call them officers.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:05.000]  TSA goons, thugs, absolute thugs. They must be little emotionally immature children inside
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.200]  to get off on making people take their shoes off when they know that person's not a threat.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200]  They know the person.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.280]  Of course. They absolutely know that. And then you've got other people because I mean,
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:25.440]  I fly. I've seen TSA people who themselves are trapped in the system because, you know,
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:29.160]  they're broke. They're out of work. They can find a job. So they take the job and they're
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.220]  standing around. I've watched them and they look at the whole charade and they're thinking
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:37.840]  to themselves, you can see it written on their face. This is complete insanity, but I have
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.440]  to pick up a paycheck. And so they do this, right? And when I've talked to them, I can
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:49.440]  see that they know I know and I know they know I know. This is all insane, right? And
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:53.880]  yeah, that's what's going on. It's a police state in action.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.200]  Yeah. Well, and they're standing around and radiating themselves, giving themselves cancer,
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.400]  which I guess in a funny kind of Darwinist kind of way, they are actually eliminating
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.120]  themselves from the future human gene pool through infertility and they don't even know
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:11.940]  it. They're so uninformed. What was it Melissa Melton was telling me this morning when I
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:20.560]  walked through here, she said that there was a TSA agent who told her that the machines,
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.240]  they don't emit radiation. They only emit x-rays.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:31.120]  Oh, great. Yeah, really. Got that now from the top of the food chain. No x-rays. I mean,
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:37.400]  no radiation, just x-rays. Only x-rays. Yeah. Because in their minds, x-rays are not radiation.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:45.600]  And you know, where do you find these people? Do you put out ads to say, you know, maximum
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:52.280]  IQ allowed 72, you know, or, or answer this question, are x-rays and radiation the same
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:58.400]  thing as it says? No, you got a job, baby. Oh man. You tell him what you ask him, what
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.080]  is the table of elements? And they think that's the place where they eat in the break room.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.800]  It's like, okay. Oh my God. We're being ruled by morons.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:13.200]  The Twinkie element on the chart. Yeah. It's completely insane.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.780]  And it's like, Alex Jones, take off your shoes. Take off. We know who you are. We know you're
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:21.520]  a national radio host. We know you're no threat to anybody. We know you've never been arrested.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.960]  You have no criminal record. We know you, but take off your damn shoes or I'm going
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:32.720]  to arrest you. That's a quote. It's incredible. Yeah. Oh, okay. Do we have any, I'm sure there's
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:38.040]  no, nobody was there taking video of this where they, Alex was taking video and he said
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.360]  he's going to upload it. So we're going to, we're going to get to see some video tonight.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  It's not during this broadcast because Alex is on the plane and it's not landing for another,
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.000]  I don't know, hour or whatever. So tonight there will be video and I can't wait to see
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.120]  it personally. I'm just, you know, I think it'll be a great lesson. But the other point
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.660]  is if, if it was, if it was someone other than Alex Jones, they would have been arrested.
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:08.440]  You see, they let Alex go because they knew what would happen if they arrested Alex Jones.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.680]  Exactly. So if it was just somebody who said, no, you can't, you know, you can't make me
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:19.280]  take off my shoes. That guy's in jail. Right? Exactly. Exactly. So, so even Alex only got
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:26.260]  through there by his wits and his notoriety. If it had been someone who wasn't well known,
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:30.740]  they would have been in jail and probably, you know, punched in the face, beat up and,
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:34.300]  and whatever, tortured, who knows? And, or even sometimes killed, you know, they've been
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:39.860]  killed after being detained at the airport. Or somebody would say, well, this is prima
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:44.400]  facie evidence that you're a terrorist because you wouldn't take off your shoes. Right? Yeah.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:51.680]  You have, you have al-Qaeda shoes on. I see. I see your al-Qaeda. All right, let's go on
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:58.160]  to the other issues today, but it's just, it's, it's infuriating how much tyranny we're,
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:03.220]  we are suffering under in America today. And that all these, these, these liberals, I got
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:09.440]  to say that they, they think the answer is more tyranny. The answer is more government.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:13.480]  The answer is to take away more rights from the people. Put the, put all the guns in the
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.980]  hands of the worst goons imaginable. People like the TSA. Can you imagine if the TSA were
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.980]  armed?
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:26.000]  Oh yeah. Well, you know, that's another incident and they will be armed.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.180]  They I'm sure that's the plan. I'm sure that's what some of the 1.6 billion bullets are for.
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:36.420]  The 40 caliber hollow points. They're going to arm the TSA, which, you know, that's going
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:43.400]  to be interesting because I bet these people can't hit the side of a barn with a firearm.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.400]  You know-
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.820]  Guns, guns fired in the airport. Five innocent spectators killed, you know?
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:55.580]  Right. Right. All right. Let's, I'm sorry. This, this, I'm sorry to get off, off topic,
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.580]  but let's, let's get back up.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:00.180]  No, no. This is, I mean, this is completely on topic because it's happening right now.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:05.300]  Well, yeah, it is happening right now. You know what? Let's open up the calls, the call
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:12.260]  queue guys at GCN there. Let's open it up. Let me give out the number 1-800-259-9231.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:20.180]  800-259-9231. If you've got a question or comment for John Rappaport or myself, a comment
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:25.460]  about Alex Jones being detained and threatened with arrest this morning at the Austin airport
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:31.020]  or comments about gun rights, you name it. Call in, we'll take some calls.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:36.160]  Now let's get to the article. I got to give you credit for this, John. You called me yesterday.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.600]  We had a short conversation on the phone. You brought up this idea that the prescription
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:46.420]  drug records of patients all across America could be used to label everyone that's on
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:51.540]  antidepressants, for example, as being mentally unfit to own firearms and then deny them the
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.940]  right to own or possess firearms.
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:45:00.700]  Absolutely. And then you took off from that. I mean, this just knocked me over that you've
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:08.900]  discovered that there is indeed one giant database of Americans who are on medical drugs.
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:14.500]  Yes. Yes. I took your idea and I did some additional research on it last night and I
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:20.780]  found this National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, NASPR, signed into
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:26.180]  law by George Bush in 2005. And then a multi-state data sharing prescription drug surveillance
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:31.040]  program now run by 48 states that goes by a different name, which is funded by the U.S.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:38.660]  Department of Justice and the website is pmpalliance.org. So I got to give you credit, John, for bringing
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:43.420]  this up. And I think it's a huge story. Your thoughts?
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:49.700]  Gigantic. I mean, I have to assume, Mike, without having actually looked at this database
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:54.820]  because I'm sure I can't get into it, but whoever can get into it is going to be able
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:59.660]  to find out the names of people. Right. You take the drugs. Otherwise, what good is the
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:00.660]  database, right?
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:04.420]  No, it's got to have your name and the drugs that you're taking. That's in the database.
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.220]  That's the whole point of the database.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:13.780]  So therefore, inferring from that, somebody knows right away, right now, what psychiatric
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:20.580]  medications Adam Lanza was on. James Holmes was on. Any one of these people that I've
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.720]  been knocking on this door and you have and other people, who's the guy's doctor? What
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:29.940]  psychiatric meds was he on? Let's find out because we know these medications induced
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:36.200]  violence. Well, now you've proved people already know, people who have access to the database.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.780]  They could tell us.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:43.740]  And there's this article this morning in WorldNet Daily by David Kapelian that he called
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:47.900]  it the giant gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting where they're not talking about the prescription
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:53.740]  drugs. They don't want us to know what drugs they were on because if we knew, then they
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:56.340]  couldn't blame the guns, John.
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.340]  Exactly.
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:59.540]  They have to blame the guns.
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:04.800]  Exactly. So they don't want to say, they won't say the drug companies are in on this because
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:10.060]  the drug companies want to blame guns too. I mean, the drug companies are behind gun
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:16.060]  control because that deflects all responsibility away from the psychiatric drugs.
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:17.060]  Well, right.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:24.060]  So you've got this giant juggernaut monopoly, corporate government, et cetera, all against
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:27.860]  the guns. Let's take away the guns. We know it's the guns. Of course, the guns jump off
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:31.460]  the shelves and kill people themselves. It's not the drugs.
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:36.620]  No, it's not the drugs that alter the mind that controls the muscles that move the finger
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:45.780]  that touches the trigger that actuates the firing pin that strikes the primer. No, it's
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:51.820]  not any of that. The gun is a magic device, a magical device that leaps out of the holster
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:59.060]  and starts shooting children all by itself at like some kind of anime horror film or
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:00.060]  something.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.740]  I don't know. It's bizarre. Let's go to calls, John, if you're up for it.
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:03.740]  Sure, let's go.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:08.780]  All right. Let's Mark from Oregon. You're on the line. Welcome to the show, Mark. What's
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:09.780]  on your mind?
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:15.140]  Well, welcome to my home, gentlemen. I really appreciate all your great work. You're wonderful.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.140]  Thank you.
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:20.340]  You're most welcome. Thank you so much. Couldn't do any more than you've done.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:23.740]  Hey, we're just like you. We're just fighting for liberty here. That's it. That's it.
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.580]  Yeah, but you do it with such gusto, mate.
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:32.940]  Well, that's because we are real Americans. We are the real America. We are the ones who
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:37.140]  broke off from tyranny and we're going to defend the constitution that we were built
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.660]  on. That's it. Bottom line. End of story.
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.620]  We have to move into the spirit of 1776.
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:43.620]  Absolutely.
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:51.900]  Mike and John, I called in today about the... It's based around the Sandy Hook shooting
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:57.180]  and there are two areas I'd like to cover very quickly if I could. One is the situational
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:07.820]  basis and the legal basis of what everything is being revolved on against us as the American
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:15.100]  people being prepared to go into physical slavery relative to this last step which occurs
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:21.540]  historically before the actual physical enslavement of the people of a nation.
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:25.300]  Right. We're going through the cycle of civilizations right now and you're right. We're at that
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:30.020]  point of enslavement which is usually followed by revolution, by the way, historically.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:34.260]  So realizing how important this is, if I have the time to cover these two, I think it would
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:39.500]  enlighten you and the audience because it's just the conglomeration and the result of
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:43.340]  all the information I've taken in which is substantial from good men such as yourself.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:46.380]  Well, hit them as fast as you can. Go ahead. Get right into it.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.380]  Quickly here.
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:54.340]  In the situational basis, you have the glaring inconsistencies all around the Aurora shooting
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:50:00.660]  in Aurora, Colorado, the movie theater as well as Sandy Hook, moving back into 9-11,
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:07.580]  coming forward a ways to the underwear bomber. We have glaring inconsistencies which are
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:12.740]  in a court of law would eventually prove that U.S. government black operations were involved
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:17.780]  in all of these different false flag terror attacks.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:24.580]  So you have this existing in the Aurora, Colorado shooting in various places as well as up on
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:29.340]  the screen. The Joker points on a map to Sandy Hook.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:32.700]  Let me ask John to comment on that, Mark. That's a really great point. John has done
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:34.620]  more research on this than most others.
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:40.380]  You know, this business with the Sandy Hook map in The Dark Knight Rises and Gary Oldman,
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.700]  the police commissioner, Gordon, pointing to it in the movie.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:47.420]  Hey, we got to go out to break, John. Sorry to interrupt you, but continue to answer that
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.060]  on the other side of this break. And thank you for your call, Mark. We will be right
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:55.240]  back with John's answer to the inconsistencies in the shootings that continue to happen as
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:59.140]  a pretext for gun control in America. Stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show. We'll
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.640]  be right back.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:06.500]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:11.060]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:16.020]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:25.980]  Alright, in the next hour, by the way, Aaron Dykes is going to be taking over the broadcast
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:30.600]  at the bottom of the hour and covering some historical quotes on the Second Amendment
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:35.660]  and really breaking down where the Second Amendment comes from and why it is merely
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:42.260]  a confirmation of a sacred right that we're born with. A birthright, in other words, and
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:48.500]  he's going to have a very interesting collection of quotes of both patriots as well as historical
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:55.500]  gun grabbers such as Stalin. Well, they love guns too. They just love them in their own
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.380]  hands, not in the hands of the actual people.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:04.140]  In any case, we are taking calls right now with John Rappaport, the author of a wonderful
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:10.220]  new article that's posted up on Infowars.com right now that talks about psychiatry becoming
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:17.620]  the new police, where this national prescription drug database that we've now confirmed exists
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:23.400]  could be used to deny you the right to own a firearm or even other rights, perhaps the
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.940]  right to free speech, perhaps the right to have a website if you're on antidepressants
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:29.940]  or other drugs.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:36.020]  So this could be used against you in the days and months ahead. John, welcome back to the
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.300]  show. Do you want to continue with that question that was posed right before the break?
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:47.820]  Yeah, this has to do with this boggling coincidence in heavy quotes in the movie The Dark Knight
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:54.980]  Rises, where Commissioner Gordon, the character, is pointing to a map that says Sandy Hook
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:59.500]  and big letters on it. You can't see anything else on the map. You can't read anything else.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:04.980]  And he's pointing to that talking about an attack. So, you know, this is just one of
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:11.260]  a list of boggling quote coincidences tied to the Sandy Hook murders that I wrote about.
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:18.820]  Well this morning, I come across a piece, and it looks solid to me so far, that the
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:26.420]  property master on the film The Dark Knight Rises, the guy responsible for all the props,
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:28.460]  like maps and so forth, and bringing them in.
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:29.460]  Yeah.
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:38.720]  A guy named Scott Getsinger died in an auto accident in April of 2012, several months
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:45.540]  before, you know, Sandy Hook and so forth. And he died in a mysterious auto accident
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.860]  in Newtown, Connecticut.
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:49.180]  No way.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.180]  Right?
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:54.220]  All right, so I understand that's still preliminary. You're going to check it out some more.
[01:56:54.220 --> 01:57:01.100]  Yeah, but I mean, I saw the article in a Newtown, I mean a Connecticut paper, that said he died
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:06.540]  in April of 2012 in the accident, gave his name, said he was the property master on The
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:11.340]  Dark Knight Rises. This wasn't, I mean, it was just a regular local newspaper.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:16.100]  Yeah, here's the story. It's up on screen here, that Scott Getsinger was killed Friday
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:20.780]  night in a head-on collision in Stamford, Connecticut, when his truck was struck by
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:25.900]  a car. His credits include The Dark Knight Rises.
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:26.900]  Property master, yeah.
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.460]  And Men in Black.
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:30.100]  And Men in Black, and many other movies.
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.100]  Wow.
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:35.380]  Okay, so I'm just adding that to the boggling, you know, list of coincidences here.
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:39.220]  Well, I know the map you're talking about, the Batman map, the Gotham City map that has
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:46.580]  Sandy Hook on it. I remember seeing that map, and it actually has circled in red the area
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:53.540]  on the map that is that school. And that it has written in red something like the first
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.340]  strike point or something, right?
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.340]  Strike zone one.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.100]  Yeah, strike zone one, pointing to the school.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:03.840]  Yeah, I mean, so people say, well, this is just obviously an accident. I mean, it couldn't
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:11.860]  be anything more than that. But you keep piling these up, and you get storyline that is just,
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:18.620]  I mean, boggles your mind, right? And as you wrote in your article, Mike, you know, if
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:23.740]  somebody had said 15, 20 years ago, guess what? We're going to have airports where we're
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:28.700]  going to have basically cops strip-searching you and examining your orifices.
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:31.740]  Yeah, we're going to go to break again, John.
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:33.860]  How boggling is this?
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:37.380]  Well, I hate to interrupt such a fascinating sentence, but we'll be right back after this
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:41.660]  break. Stay with us, John. We'll continue on the Alex Jones Show.

[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:21.660]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:30.100]  Alex Jones. Welcome to the third hour of this broadcast today on Monday, January 7th, 2013.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:35.300]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex Jones, who is on an airplane right
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:41.460]  now headed to New York to appear on mainstream media today. And John Rappaport is our guest
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:46.780]  right now. And if you're just joining us, Alex Jones was nearly arrested this morning
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:53.620]  at the Austin airport after being threatened, threatened with arrest by some TSA goons there
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:56.100]  who demanded that he take off his shoes.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:01:01.580]  They knew him by name. They approached him by name, said, hi, Alex, take your shoes off.
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:07.900]  And I have now been informed of the reason why. Alex was hiding in his shoes the Dianne
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:13.700]  Feinstein sock puppet. And here it is. We have a copy of the Dianne Feinstein sock puppet
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:19.740]  right here in studio today. And let's see what Dianne Feinstein has to say on camera.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:28.260]  I'm gonna raid your homes and throw flashbangs and take your guns. Yeah, yeah. All right,
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:31.880]  sorry, John, you didn't get a chance to see that, but we actually do have a Feinstein
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:35.060]  sock puppet. And she's quite animated.
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:39.780]  Alex told me he was gonna take that inside his shoes, you know.
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:41.420]  That's the secret weapon, comedy.
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:42.420]  That is the secret weapon.
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:44.100]  He was hiding comedy in his shoes.
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:50.300]  Well, that's a crime. You can't do that. Everything that you're talking about, Mike, especially
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:57.260]  with what's happening here with Alex, imagine this now up in the future. You go to fly,
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:01.900]  and they type in your name, and they get that medical drug database that you were talking
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:02.900]  about.
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:03.900]  Right.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:08.620]  They say, okay, here is so-and-so. Let me see, he's taking pro sex. Well, he's a mental
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:15.020]  case. So we have to be very careful about this guy. We have to, you know, please take
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:19.740]  him in a room. We have to ask him questions, examine him, look at his papers. You know,
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:25.180]  because now with all these databases connected, whether it's, you know, about gun ownership,
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:30.380]  about medications, psychiatric meds, and so forth, they're just constructing one gigantic
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:31.380]  database.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:32.380]  So at the airport-
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:33.380]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:38.020]  For any travel checkpoint, they will be able to completely profile you in many ways that
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:41.460]  you don't even imagine, and then decide whether or not you can travel.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:45.460]  Well, no, let me tell you, this is a true story. James Stewart, the raw milkman from
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:51.020]  California, they profiled him. They had him flagged in the California database as a quote
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:56.020]  sovereign. And this is a new checkbox they have for criminals, so-called criminals. You
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.900]  know, this guy, all he did is distribute milk and cheese that the state didn't like.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:05.580]  And so they flagged him with the word sovereign. And then when they booked him into LA County
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:11.660]  Jail, he said one of the booking guard staff members there looked up from his computer,
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:18.520]  backed away from his desk, and said, my God, you attack guards. And so just being flagged
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:23.420]  as a sovereign now, and then they bound him with chains on his feet and his arms, and
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:30.940]  they put him in an isolation room, a very cold room, no light, you know, very cold hypothermia
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:31.940]  almost.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:36.100]  And then he got away from that starvation. I mean, they can flag you with anything now,
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:40.260]  John, and then treat you worse than you'd be treated in a third world country.
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:44.980]  Absolutely. So if they see, okay, this guy's taking psychiatric drugs, whatever, okay,
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:50.980]  let's not let him fly. Or let's arrest him if he causes any trouble or objects to what
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:56.940]  we're doing to him. Let's provoke him, in other words, and see how he reacts. And then
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:04:03.260]  we'll put him in lockup because he's a psychiatric patient. I mean, all of these things can be
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:06.020]  manipulated any way they want to manipulate it.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:11.580]  And when they say the word sovereign, which is now a code word for them for terrorism,
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:14.260]  all they're really saying is this is an independent mind.
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:15.420]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:20.380]  So we have to kill that off cuz that's the biggest threat to the country.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:27.020]  Diane Feinstein wants to say something else, the sock puppet. Mr. and Mrs. America, we're
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:31.140]  gonna profile your prescription drugs and use it to take away your rights.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.140]  Okay.
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.140]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:36.140]  Has she, by the way, given up her security guards with guns?
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.420]  No, no, they're all armed and they're probably all on psych drugs as well. By the way, we're
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:43.860]  gonna take calls when we come back. So Lori, Bill, Jason, Nick, Greg, and others, stay
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:44.860]  with us.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:47.960]  We'll take calls when we come back in the next segment with John Rappaport. Stay with

[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:46.940]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:24.900]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:28.440]  All right, we're continuing on the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams, the health ranger
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:35.040]  editor of naturalnews.com joined by John Rapoport, our guest right now from nomorefakenews.com
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:39.120]  and we're taking calls from people on all the issues of the day, including Alex Jones
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:45.040]  almost being arrested this morning at the Austin airport as a TSA tyrant demanded that
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:52.800]  he take off his shoes because I guess shoes are just too much for the globalist to bear.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:57.520]  You can't have shoes, John. Did you know that? Not only can you not have guns, but you can't
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:02.980]  have shoes because they need to have the exclusive right to stomp on you with their boots. So
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:07.020]  you can't have shoes. Does that make any sense to you? That's right. Yeah, it makes perfect
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:13.760]  sense to me if the world is completely insane. Yeah. And apparently it is. Are you up for
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:18.080]  taking calls or you got a comment? Yeah, let's go. All right, let's go to Lori in West Virginia.
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:23.560]  Lori, welcome to the show. Thanks for joining us. What's on your mind? Hey Mike, it's John.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.680]  I'm calling in because I'm part of a farm extension. Well, I'm a member of the farm
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:35.760]  extension and we were trying to start a program for the farm to schools. Have you heard of
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:39.680]  that? Not in West Virginia. I mean, just generally speaking, I've heard of those kinds of programs.
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:46.120]  Okay, they're trying to take where we supply those small local farmers to the school kids.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:51.480]  Well, when it first started and we had our meeting, a representative from the school,
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.120]  the purchaser, she brought her little price list of what she's paying the big shipping
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:00.800]  companies for food. And on there at first, the price list seemed like, okay, we could
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:04.960]  do this. We can afford to do this. It's not going to be that great big profit, but we
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:10.160]  can do this. And then we had another meeting four months later and just like in the first
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:16.520]  meeting, a dozen of eggs was going for $3 for them. But the second meeting, now they're
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:22.440]  paying $1 for it. And yeah, and the whole price list went down like that.
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:25.160]  So it's kind of like they're trying to bankrupt the local farms then?
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:29.400]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like. A lot longer than we can. And then everybody
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.040]  got discouraged and said, well, we can't do this. Well, anyway, another reason why I'm
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:40.040]  calling is because in the newspaper yesterday here at the Charleston Gazette Mail, they
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:46.020]  have an article that says the FDA proposes sweeping new food safety rules for outbreak.
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:55.960]  And in the article, it says that it's going to cost farmers $30,000 a year to implement
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:02.000]  and food manufacturers $475 million annually to implement these programs.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.320]  Yep, it's true. Let's go to John on that with a comment. And thank you for your call,
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:11.600]  Lori, and for your question. But John, this is a big epidemic year for the flu virus,
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.920]  but it's hitting mostly those people who are vaccinated. That's the thing the CDC won't
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:17.600]  admit. What do you think, man?
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:23.800]  Well, sure. I mean, what better way to pump up an epidemic than to give people an unnecessary
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:27.760]  and dangerous vaccine that actually causes what you're supposedly preventing.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:29.920]  Yes. And then you come in behind that and you say,
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:33.600]  wow, we have a heavy epidemic year. So everybody's got to get vaccinated.
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:38.920]  No, you nailed it. Vaccines are a medical false flag. They create the condition that
[02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:45.280]  sells more vaccines that causes more of the condition that the CDC uses to declare a state
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.600]  of emergency to sell more vaccines. It's a total false flag.
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:55.280]  Total false flag, and fewer people are going for it, but there's still a lot of people
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:01.420]  who are. What the caller was talking about is basically, look, if you're a gigantic Monsanto
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:07.800]  and you control huge amounts of farmland through your genetically modified seeds and so forth
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:13.360]  and it's all industrial farming and whatever, then we'll protect you from all of these unnecessary
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.360]  expenses and regulations and so forth.
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.060]  But if you're a small farmer, we're going to find a way to put you out of business because
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:22.840]  we want to take your land and give it to the big corporations. I mean, that's what they're
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:24.240]  doing in every way possible.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:28.520]  Well, that's what they're doing to Mark Baker, the guest we had in the first hour from bakersgreenacres.com.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.960]  Yeah, they're trying to put them out of business with an economic embargo by the USDA. Let's
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:38.000]  go to another caller, Bill in California. Thanks for calling, Bill. You're on the air
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.480]  with John Rappaport.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:49.000]  Well, thank you. My question for all of your viewers is how do the constitutional patriots
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.600]  identify each other? After all, not all-
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:54.600]  It's a secret handshake.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:55.600]  Yeah.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.960]  I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:08.160]  No, not all police, not all soldiers are going to want to be on the gun grabbing, but we
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:10.440]  need to know how we can identify each other.
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:17.320]  Yeah, that's a really good question. Of course, there's the obvious way to wear an Infowars
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:24.200]  shirt or something or a hat, but I think what you mean is, yeah, there they are, infowarsstore.com.
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.440]  You can get some good patriot gear, including and the TSA t-shirt. Wonderful. Good timing
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:35.320]  for today. But to answer your question, sir, I don't think there's any covert system that's
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.200]  known. What do you think, John?
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:43.360]  No, unfortunately, I mean, the whole idea of being a patriot to the founding principles
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:46.920]  of the republic is that you're out in the open about it.
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:47.920]  Yeah.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:53.480]  I mean, that's the whole idea. The Bill of Rights means you don't have to hide in a closet.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:59.880]  So you find people, they find you. You decide whether you can trust them or not. You see
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:04.680]  how much knowledge they have. Do they really understand what the basic principles of this
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:11.680]  country are all about? And do they think they're important enough to live by and defend? I
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:13.200]  mean, that's all I can say.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.640]  I think you're right. I think it just comes down to knowing your neighbors, knowing the
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:22.520]  people in your community. And like you said, caller, most police officers and law enforcement
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:27.120]  and soldiers, they are pro-constitution. They took an oath to it, unlike the TSA, which
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.200]  never took any oath to anything, except maybe swearing to their paycheck.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:36.160]  All right, let's go to another caller, Nick in New York, it looks like. Nick, you're on
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:39.880]  the air with John Rappaport and Mike Adams. Go ahead, sir.
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:41.600]  Good afternoon to both of you gentlemen.
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  You as well. Thank you.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.440]  Yes, two quick things. First of all, Mike, the gentleman that you had on earlier when
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:53.920]  you were speaking about the farm, the pigs and all that, my heart goes out to that to
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.160]  that gentleman. I know she's probably still listening. My question is, is this how in
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:03.920]  the world, how in the world or where in what rock are these judges going to hide under
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:09.960]  if this whole thing implodes? And one of the main causes of this thing imploding is because
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.560]  these judges are upholding illegal, illegal laws or face color, whatever they want to
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:20.960]  call it. It's all color of law. It's all illegal. And what rock are they going to hide under?
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:27.160]  Because these are the main perpetrators of the whole system falling in the direction.
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:28.160]  So I mean-
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:32.160]  Nick, you're right. You're right. I can only imagine that right now, people who are true
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:40.260]  Americans are making lists, lists of traitors. And that list is getting larger by the day.
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:47.400]  And it probably includes court judges who are openly violating the Constitution. I think
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.400]  you're right. I think these lists are being made. What's going to happen to the list?
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:54.000]  I don't know. Hopefully, it just means those people are voted out of office. In no way
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.160]  am I condoning violence against those people. But at the very minimum, we should distribute
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:04.720]  these lists and kick these people out of office, strip them of their power. Your comments,
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:05.720]  John.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:10.240]  Yeah, well, they're publishing, aren't they, lists of gun owners and where they live and
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:18.200]  their addresses and everything? I mean, to me, a court of law, the origin of the idea
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:26.240]  was it's local. People are there. The citizens are there. You see a trial. You want justice.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:31.240]  The people have presumably some degree of common sense. And now we have this system
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:37.160]  which is so remote, so complicated, so insane, that anybody with an agenda who has power
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:39.680]  can decide a case any way they want to, really.
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:44.040]  Well, and the courts were created so that people didn't have to settle things by shooting
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:45.040]  each other.
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:46.040]  Exactly.
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:49.040]  But if the courts become so corrupt-
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.920]  Yeah, exactly. The courts have become so corrupt.
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:55.840]  That's how it leaves then, it seems like. What option is left? When justice is taken
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:58.480]  from the people, what option do they have left?
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:16:59.480]  Nullification.
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:00.480]  Yeah.
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:03.360]  Any follow-up comments, Nick?
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:09.840]  Yeah, just one other thing. With regard to your other presentation, first of all, I want
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:17.080]  to say that I completely support everything that you guys do and your arguments. It just
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:24.240]  makes so much sense. And after being detoxified from all the fluoride, years of fluoride and
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:29.000]  all that through the Infowars program, I can honestly say that my head's on straight.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.440]  My question is, with regards to these people, let's say, who you said a little while ago,
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:38.920]  and I'm trying to understand your argument. You said that it's a violation if they come
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:46.240]  after people who have prescription drugs or for depression, all kinds of stuff, and yet
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:51.360]  they would be able to get guns and stuff like that. But isn't that the case with this kid
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:57.480]  who went out and did this horrific thing over in Connecticut, where he was on drugs and
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:01.040]  then he got into his mother's case, and she had legal firearms.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:06.120]  So my question, how do we reconcile the two? Because the other side of the argument is,
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:08.600]  well, if you're on drugs, you shouldn't be able to get-
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.400]  No, no, you're exactly right about that point. And I want your comments, John, but let me
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:18.520]  throw mine in first. I agree that people who are undergoing psychiatric care should not
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.480]  be allowed to purchase firearms.
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.680]  But the problem is, and this answers your question, caller, is how wide are they going
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.200]  to cast that net? Are they going to say one person who had one bottle of antidepressants
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:31.880]  at some point 10 years ago, they're denied the right. Or are they going to limit it just
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:36.720]  to the true psychopaths, devil worshiping, drug taking, whatever. That's who we have
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:41.560]  to limit it to. But I don't know the right answer. What are your thoughts, John?
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:45.600]  Yeah, it's a tough issue because look, on the one side, you've got psychiatry which
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:50.360]  wants to bring millions and millions more people into the system where they can drug
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:56.160]  them and so on. And so as that list expands, then they can say, well, all these people
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:01.060]  can't have guns because that satisfies the gun control agenda at the same time. So the
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:08.040]  ultimate solution from the medical point of view, to me, is you ban the drugs.
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:15.800]  You destroy that industry. You expose it completely and you alert all citizens everywhere to never
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:20.800]  let their children see a psychiatrist. Never let them take one of these psychiatric drugs.
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:28.640]  Never get on one of those lists and just completely destroy that criminal poisoning industry altogether.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.400]  This is a better solution. Sorry to interrupt you, John. We're about to go to break. But
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:36.420]  yeah, to the caller, you're right, John. If we gave these children fish oil supplements
[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:41.500]  or omega-3 fatty acids or trace minerals, all those things are crucial for healthy mind
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:47.320]  function. If we gave them those instead of the drugs, then they wouldn't be psychopaths.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:51.120]  They wouldn't be devil worshippers, probably, because their heads would be on straight.
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:54.240]  Nutrition has a role in all of this. If you don't talk about nutrition, you aren't talking
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:59.240]  about the real cause of violence in America. Most people in the prisons have nutritional
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.720]  deficiencies. We'll be right back after this break.
[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:06.560]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:11.140]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:16.240]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:06.600]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older
[02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:10.860]  one gets. The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:15.200]  older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention

[02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:29.760]  off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed. All

[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:05.120]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:10.080]  growth, slide into a recession or at worst depression? Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:14.360]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:18.840]  is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven. But what
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:24.040]  do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:28.840]  are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.040]  We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment. Hi, I'm
[02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:10.600]  Pastor Jenny and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:16.840]  drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:21.600]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs and other
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:25.840]  tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:31.540]  I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:37.040]  to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA

[02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:20.480]  All right, the caller from the last segment brought up a really good point and a good
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:27.880]  question. He said, shouldn't we deny people who are on psychiatric meds the right to own
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:35.160]  the firearms? And Rappaport and I both agree that we don't want firearms in the hands of
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:39.040]  medicated psychos, but that the real answer is to just stop medicating our children and
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:42.880]  put them on nutrition instead of psychiatric drugs.
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:48.040]  That's the real answer here. Any more thoughts on that, John, before we go to the next call?
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:56.880]  Yeah, that's the answer. The answer is looking at what creates health rather than what destroys
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:57.880]  the brain.
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:00.280]  Do you have a cough today, John? You got a little cough going on?
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:01.280]  I do indeed.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:04.560]  Oh, man. Did you forget your vitamin D or something?
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.540]  Actually, I've been taking it, but I don't know what's going on. It's something in the
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:10.720]  air and I have no idea what it is, but-
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:15.720]  Well, it's probably the superbugs that the CDC is releasing to encourage more vaccinations.
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:20.520]  Possibly, or maybe they're spraying today. I'm not sure, but I'm okay.
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:24.840]  All right, good. Yeah, I know you're generally healthy. You'll be back on your feet in no
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.840]  time, but yeah, good point. We got to keep these kids healthy instead of keeping them
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:29.720]  medicated. Are you okay to take another call now?
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:30.720]  Absolutely.
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:34.480]  All right, let's go to Jason in Ohio. Jason, thank you for your call. You're on the air
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.480]  on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead, sir.
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.040]  Hi, John and Mike. How are you doing today?
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:41.040]  Doing good.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:42.040]  All right.
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.880]  My question is, man, I kind of had the same question that the other guy asked. I mean,
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:51.520]  kind of relevant to the same deal on the energy.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:57.080]  Hey, Jason, your phone is really not working. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to let you go.
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:00.720]  I apologize, but it was breaking up there. Let's go to Thomas in Texas. Thomas, you're
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:01.720]  on the air. Go ahead.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:03.720]  How are you guys doing today?
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:04.720]  Hey, doing good.
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:05.720]  All right.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:13.280]  I just want to say that I can definitely agree with the genetically modified foods, how it
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:19.640]  is having an effect on the brain as far as, and the drugs and everything, how it's having
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:25.800]  an effect on the brain as well. But I think that we're kind of overlooking at the same
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:34.520]  time, the evil and the darkness that kind of became over the world, as well as like
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:36.920]  the United States as a whole. You know what I'm saying?
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.560]  Yeah. You mean like this demonic influx of energy that a lot of these kids seem to be
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:44.920]  attached to? Is that what you're talking about?
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:50.400]  Exactly. Exactly. Especially just throughout the years with all the terrorist attack, and
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:57.920]  then you relate back to the movies. And it shows before these incidents happened, boom,
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.640]  it was seen in a movie preview or something. And it's like, bam, it's happening. I think
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:09.160]  we got to start getting healthier, start cleaning our minds, start just cleaning up things period
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:12.000]  in this country.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.560]  We need some exorcisms is what we need around the country.
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:15.560]  I do, really.
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:19.160]  Go ahead, John. Good question, caller. Good question. Go ahead, John. What are your thoughts
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:20.160]  on it?
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:26.800]  I see this all the time when I force myself to go to the movies, which is less and less.
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:32.780]  You know, these films, for example, that are all about disasters, dystopian futures, horrible
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:37.440]  things going on. It used to be that when you saw movies where there were superheroes and
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:44.480]  so forth, the general impression was the good guy won. It was very kind of uplifting in
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:49.840]  a certain kind of way. And then gradually we saw this whole thing darken, where it doesn't
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:55.960]  really matter anymore in these movies who wins. Because the whole overall mood is evil,
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:00.760]  dark, gloom, disaster, diabolical forces at work.
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:05.880]  Oh, and it's cool. It's cool, right? The kids are taught that worshipping the devil is cool
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.400]  or being an agent of darkness is hip or whatever.
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  Exactly.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.040]  It's pretty safe.
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:16.300]  You're just programming. It's another way, along with the video games, of programming
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:22.880]  these kids' minds to accept the general darkness over everything and then to proceed from there.
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:23.880]  Well, what's going to happen?
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:24.880]  Well, I think-
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.320]  I'll tell you what.
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:32.080]  I think the caller is hinting at this combination. You take someone who's a devil worshipper,
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:37.940]  like Adam Lanza reportedly was, you put them on psychiatric drugs, you put them on violent
[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:43.920]  video games and slashers and so on. This combination creates a monster. And then they go steal
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:46.000]  someone's gun and use it to kill children.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:52.240]  But the gun is not the origin of the problem. The origin is all these other things that
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:56.160]  haven't been addressed and that they refuse to talk about. John, I got to let you go.
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:58.320]  We got to go to break, but it's been fun chatting with you today.
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:00.040]  Always, Mike. Thanks so much.
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:04.600]  All right. Thanks for joining us and heal up there. I know you'll get better for the
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:09.600]  next show. You've got your own superfood recipes as well.

[02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:44.420]  right of self-defense. So stay tuned for that. That's coming up right after this break as

[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:15.640]  The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:30.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back at info wars.com. I'm Aaron Dykes. I'm sitting in
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:37.200]  Alex's of course on his way possibly already arriving in New York to appear on Piers Morgan
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:42.240]  tonight on the CNN program, obviously to discuss the second amendment. If you want to tune
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:47.600]  into that, it's going to be 8pm Central, 9pm Eastern Time. Other time zones you figure
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:53.520]  it out. But that should definitely be interesting. Now something I want to talk about today is
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:57.960]  what is the second amendment? I realize I'm preaching to the choir regarding most of our
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:01.720]  audience and many of them probably know a lot more about it than I do.
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:06.400]  But I know this much. You can't repeal the second amendment. You can't infringe on it
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:11.200]  through legislation. Congress, the president can't just decide to suspend it. And there
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:16.680]  are many fold reasons for that. They are philosophical and they are grounded in history and common
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:21.560]  sense. And I just want to talk about some of that because that is a God given right.
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:26.100]  What is a God given right? It means that man cannot be the arbiter of whether or not you
[02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:31.280]  have a right on any given day under any given climate. Now here's from the 10th amendment
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:35.760]  center. Repeal of the second amendment would not abolish any right.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:40.000]  And they bring up of course the many so called news articles and letters to the editor that
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.960]  are calling for a repeal of the second amendment. You've seen many of them. These individuals
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:49.760]  believe that a right to own a firearm is based upon the second amendment and the right will
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:53.040]  magically vanish if the amendment can be repealed.
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:56.900]  Of course, the Bill of Rights came up after the Constitution. They were proposed starting
[02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:04.840]  in 1787 and added by demand then ratified by the states by 1791. By demand, many of
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:09.600]  the states, many of the founding fathers would not approve the Constitution, would not ratify
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:14.760]  it, would not sign off on it until the Bill of Rights were added to guarantee our individual
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:16.760]  rights, to guarantee the rights of the state.
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:20.800]  They are of the utmost importance. And if you infringe on the second amendment, you're
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:25.320]  infringing on all of them. No one is going to stand for this, ladies and gentlemen. And
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.400]  the people in power know it, but we just want to put them on notice. Now they bring up this
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:35.400]  very important point. The modern additions of the Bill of Rights typically don't contain
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:40.960]  the very important preamble, the paragraph preceding the listing of the first ten Bill
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:42.200]  of Rights.
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:45.360]  And there's generally a pretty good reason for that. I'm gonna read that to you right
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:51.240]  now. Again, from the preamble to the Bill of Rights, which itself is in addition to
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:56.760]  the Constitution. The first paragraph to that preamble after announcing how it's from the
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:00.600]  Congress of the United States begun and held in the city of New York on Wednesday, the
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:08.560]  4th of March 1789 reads, the conventions of a number of the states having at the time
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:14.440]  of their adopting the Constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent the misconstruction
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:21.700]  or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added.
[02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:27.200]  And as extending the ground of public confidence in the government will best ensure the beneficent
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:32.260]  ends of its institution. This, ladies and gentlemen, points out that the Bill of Rights
[02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:37.240]  was specifically added to acquiesce the demands of founding fathers who didn't wanna see their
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:42.820]  new government destroyed by people greedy for power, people who would use loopholes
[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:46.760]  in the Constitution to concentrate and exploit the populations.
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:51.120]  In other words, among the other rights listed in the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:57.700]  shall not be infringed. Well, one good reason why is that armed citizens make good government.
[02:36:57.700 --> 02:37:02.360]  Now I'm gonna read a number of quotes that refute these terrible ideas we've seen in
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.080]  the press from all kinds of hacks. One of the most extreme was in Vanity Fair last week
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:11.800]  from Kurt Eichenwald, whose headline was, let's repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:16.800]  He wants to replace it with this clause. The people retain the right to keep and bear arms
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:21.720]  subject to reasonable restrictions deemed necessary by the Congress and the President
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:27.320]  to secure the lives and well-being of others. Now this sounds similar enough to the right
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:31.740]  to keep and bear arms, and yet it completely is not. Notice again the language of this
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:34.600]  proposed hack writer from Vanity Fair.
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:40.740]  The people retain the right to keep and bear arms, sounds good so far. But subject to reasonable
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:45.400]  restrictions deemed necessary by the Congress and the President to secure the lives and
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:51.760]  well-being of others. Reasonable restrictions means that the idea is you have no right at
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:52.760]  all.
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:56.200]  But the fact is, even if you did outright repeal the Second Amendment and replace it
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:01.600]  with legalese lawyer language, you still can't legally suspend the Second Amendment cuz it's
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:07.200]  a God-given right. They talked as far back as Dante's Inferno, that even if you don't
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:12.960]  agree that there is a God or who is God or what God would want, in absentia, in absence,
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:18.920]  you should still throw to the higher powers rather than let man dictate what your rights
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:19.920]  are.
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:23.840]  And that's really what America is all about. Here's this caption right here, rights are
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:28.840]  not gifts from government. And now I'm gonna move on to a number of Founding Father quotes
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:33.240]  that point out this point. Now the Founding Fathers never agreed on much of anything.
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:37.600]  There were different factions who fought vehemently over how centralized their government should
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:43.060]  be, how much power should remain with the states, all kinds of other clauses. To what
[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:47.320]  degree should we let bankers have power? What should the currency be? But I have yet to
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.720]  find any Founding Father, I'd love to get emails on it, any Founding Father at all,
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:55.640]  no matter how reprehensible they are individually, who is against the right to keep and bear
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.640]  arms.
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.080]  They all seem to have backed it. Now here is Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, who
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:05.440]  upheld very early on the right to keep and bear arms. Quote, the right of citizens to
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:10.560]  keep and bear arms has been justly considered as the palladium of the liberties of the Republic,
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.520]  since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of the
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:16.520]  rulers.
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:20.400]  It will generally, even if they are successful in the first instance, enable the people to
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:26.500]  resist and triumph over them. It's to restrict the arbitrary power of the rulers, never forget
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:32.760]  that. George Washington said firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself.
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:37.940]  They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence. Now let's
[02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:43.360]  juxtapose these with just a few quotes from the modern 20th century dictators.
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:50.140]  Joseph Stalin said one death is a tragedy, one million is a statistic. An anonymous American
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:56.600]  adage reads, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Samuel Adams said the Constitution
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:01.880]  shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:07.180]  who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms, shall not be construed, shall not
[02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:08.880]  infringe.
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:13.040]  Now this is a key quote right here. Tench Cox, he's not that well known of a founding
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:19.260]  father, but he was a federalist from Pennsylvania. In 1788, he said, who are the militia? Are
[02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:24.760]  they not ourselves? Is it fear then that we shall turn over our arms, each man against
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:31.520]  his own bosom? Congress have no power to disarm the militia, their swords and every other
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:35.400]  terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of an American.
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.840]  Now there's all this legalese debate over the Second Amendment and the wording having
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:43.920]  to do with the militia. Who are the militia? Again from this founding father Tench Cox,
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:49.180]  who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? They certainly are. Now James Madison said
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:54.160]  the Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:58.480]  people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust their
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:01.440]  people with arms.
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:06.320]  President Stalin on the other hand said ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:12.400]  let our enemies have guns. Why should we let them have ideas? Zbigniew Brzezinski said
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:17.840]  quite recently, in earlier times it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:24.480]  kill 1 million people. Today it's infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to control
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:25.480]  them.
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.720]  And of course, through democide, government sanctioned murder, government is the number
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:34.880]  one non natural cause of death throughout history, particularly in the 20th century.
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.720]  Joseph Stalin said death solves all problems, no man, no problem. He also said the only
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:46.360]  real power comes out of a long rifle. Alexander Hamilton who I'm critical of for his banking
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:52.240]  stances even upholds the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment. The best we can hope for
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.240]  concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:02.000]  Then you've got things like the Nazi law from 1938. Those now possessing weapons and ammunition
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.560]  are at once to turn them over to local police authority. Firearms and ammunition found in
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:11.080]  a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation. Whoever willfully
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:16.480]  or negligently violates the provisions will be punished with imprisonment and a fine.
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.420]  We know where things went in Nazi Germany, of course. Thomas Paine, arms discourage and
[02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:26.760]  keep the invader and plunder and all and preserve order in the world as well as property. Horrible
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:31.960]  mischief would ensue where law abiding, deprived of the use of them. It is the duty of the
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:36.720]  patriot to protect his country from its government, Thomas Paine also said.
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:40.800]  And Thomas Jefferson said quite famously, when governments fear the people, there's
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:45.240]  liberty. When the people fear the government, there's tyranny. The strongest reason for
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:50.000]  the people to retain the right and keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:55.400]  against tyranny in government. Again, it has nothing to do about hunting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.160]  I'm just trying to point out how together the founding fathers were on the right of
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.840]  the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. Benjamin Franklin sort of foretold this common
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:10.280]  era of communism, where one of the big slogans, whether it's Mao or Stalin is turn your sword
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:13.640]  into a plowshare and basically be a slave to the government.
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:18.200]  Ben Franklin said those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:24.440]  those who didn't. Those who didn't turn in their swords, their arms, their guns, whatever.
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:29.520]  To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them. That's the
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:34.000]  founding father, George Mason, one of the individuals most responsible for getting the
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:38.720]  Bill of Rights instituted in the first place. Compared to disarm the people is the best
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:43.440]  and most effective way to enslave them with what Joseph Stalin said, if the opposition
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:50.260]  disarms well and good, if it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:54.360]  What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:59.880]  that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms, Thomas Jefferson. A free
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:04.700]  people ought not to be armed discipline, not only to be armed discipline, but they should
[02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:09.880]  have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:13.960]  attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government, George Washington.
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:19.120]  Now, Patrick Henry is another person who was individually greatly responsible for demanding
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:23.560]  and eventually getting the Bill of Rights to preserve the rights of the people and the
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:29.720]  states. He said, quote, guard with jealous attention the public liberty, guard it. Suspect
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:32.120]  everyone who approaches that jewel.
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:36.400]  Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:41.520]  force you are ruined. The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:46.800]  might have a gun. Are we at last brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:50.080]  that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense?
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.680]  It's also Patrick Henry. And here's another Alexander Hamilton. If the representatives
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.620]  of the people betray their constituents, then there is no recourse left. But in the exertion
[02:44:59.620 --> 02:45:05.000]  of that original right of self-defense, which is paramount to all positive forms of government.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:10.520]  First Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists, number 28. The supreme power in America cannot
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:15.920]  enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.720]  a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be or on any pretense raised in America.
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:30.120]  That's Noah Webster in 1888, 1787. I'm sorry, 1787. And the whole point is they want to
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:36.600]  disarm us because they want to institute unconstitutional arbitrary rule. They want dictatorships, whether
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.040]  it comes in an overt form that looks like Joseph Stalin or a friendly form where they
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:43.120]  continue to rotate presidents.
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:47.600]  Thomas Jefferson said a free people claim their right is derived from the laws of nature
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:55.400]  and not as a gift of their chief magistrate. 1774, the balance of power is the scale of
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:00.240]  peace. The same balance would be preserved for all the world destitute of arms for all
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:01.400]  would be alike.
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:06.520]  But since some will not, others dare not lay them aside. And while a single nation refuses
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.040]  to lay them down, it's proper that all should keep them up. Hard mischief would ensue where
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:18.520]  one half of the world deprived of the use of them. Thomas Paine, 1775. Mao Zedong, 1938.
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:23.480]  Chairman Mao, political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. He said the people must
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:28.400]  understand this for the revolution, the great revolution of China to take place. To preserve
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:34.680]  liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:37.920]  alike, especially when young how to use them.
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:43.840]  Richard Henry Lee, 1778. The right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:49.560]  arbitrary government. One more safeguard against the tyranny, which now appears remote in America,
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:56.000]  which historically has proved to be always possible. That's from 1960, Hubert Humphrey,
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:00.160]  a little bit unexpected but nonetheless right on the money.
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:05.240]  Adolf Hitler, of course, said or is quoted to have said in 1942, the most foolish mistake
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:10.560]  we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:14.520]  that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:16.860]  their own downfall by doing so.
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:21.400]  Why would a dictator not want an armed population so he can run roughshod over them, so he can
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:28.000]  try to rule them? Orrin Hatch, still in the Senate or maybe just possibly just retired.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.760]  If guns in fact, if gun laws in fact work, the sponsors of this type of legislation should
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.480]  have no difficulty drawing upon long list of examples of crime rates reduced by such
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:42.120]  legislation that they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:48.260]  That they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at gun control in 1870 to 1910 period,
[02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:53.420]  the northeastern attempts of the 1920 to 1939 period. The attempts at both federal and state
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:48:00.520]  levels through 1965 and 1976 establishes the repeated, complete and inevitable failure
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:03.680]  of gun laws to control serious crimes.
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:07.960]  And again, the Columbine school shootings happened during the assault weapons ban under
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:12.580]  Clinton. All these school shootings have taken a rise ever since they signed the gun free
[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:18.840]  school zones. And ever since all these people have been on medications, SSRIs. William Burroughs
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:24.440]  in 1991, the author said after a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns away
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:26.400]  from people who didn't do it.
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:30.680]  I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  are the police and military. George Washington said the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:41.720]  and everywhere restrains evil interference. They deserve a place of honor with all that's
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:46.880]  good. And the Second Amendment itself of course reads, a well regulated militia being necessary
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:49.120]  to the security of a free state.
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:53.920]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Now the choice is
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:49:00.040]  clear here, folks. It's freedom or tyranny. Disarmament is tyranny. It's a recipe for
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:04.660]  enslavement. If we want to uphold the rest of our freedoms, we have to stand by the Second
[02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:09.520]  Amendment. Even if you individually personally don't like guns, aren't comfortable around
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:10.520]  them.
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:14.700]  You should get guns and train them and learn how to use them safely so that bad things
[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:20.000]  don't happen. And so there's a buffer against intruders, against robbers, and against government
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:24.940]  itself, which is very quickly becoming more tyrannical by the day. Of course, this has
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:29.360]  nothing to do with just Obama. This has been going on through Bush. It's been going on
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:32.200]  ever since 9-11 through the Patriot Act.
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.820]  It's been going on through Clinton who put in the assault weapons ban. It's been going
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:40.500]  on through government, through Reagan who was going to scale down government even though
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:47.460]  government grew two or three fold times under his watch. It's been going on under Carter
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:54.340]  and under Ford and under Nixon. And for a long time, if nothing else since the assassination
[02:49:54.340 --> 02:50:00.100]  of JFK, it's really been going on since the time that Harry Truman seceded FDR after he
[02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:02.620]  took a broad executive power.
[02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:06.800]  And claimed that the buck stopped with him, the president, even though a shadow government
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:13.360]  was emerging under the 1947 National Security Act. And we've been in dire straits ever since.
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:17.700]  Do not give up your arms, people. Government democide and disarmament are the greatest
[02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:23.500]  threats of violence. That is a study academically at the University of Hawaii. We've communicated
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:27.460]  with RJ Rummel and we're looking to get an interview with him in the future.
[02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:34.020]  He's the one who's compiled statistics on more than 262 million deaths at the hands
[02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:38.580]  of government just in the 20th century alone. Mike Adams has wrote about it. Our writers
[02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:42.980]  at InfoWars have wrote about it. And it's something we better pay close attention to.
[02:50:42.980 --> 02:50:47.780]  We'll be back after this with a few more thoughts. But just remember, folks, the Second Amendment,
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:52.500]  the right to bear arms is a guarantee. It's a God-given right. It can't be given by men
[02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:57.780]  or taken away legitimately. InfoWars.com. Tune in to Piers Morgan tonight. Alex is going
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:02.020]  to take him on and explain what the Second Amendment's really all about. Stay tuned.
[02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:06.880]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:11.460]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:16.580]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods
[02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:20.640]  Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm
[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:25.160]  by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City
[02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:29.940]  wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just
[02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:35.600]  in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:40.180]  than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

[02:52:59.540 --> 02:53:04.860]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:53:04.860 --> 02:53:11.180]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:15.300]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:20.880]  president could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:25.420]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved
[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:31.100]  ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:36.300]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:40.540]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders

[02:53:59.020 --> 02:54:20.300]  It's the only one you've got. Ladies and gentlemen, the Second Amendment
[02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:25.840]  is in place to restrict tyranny. It's not about offensive action. It's not about enabling
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:32.020]  murders to kill more people. It's about the tendency of mankind individually and as groups
[02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:37.660]  to be corrupt. It's a tendency for mankind to want power, to want to hold on to power
[02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:42.860]  and then to crave more power because something inherent in us is wicked.
[02:54:42.860 --> 02:54:47.060]  There's of course a lot of good as well. And the whole point that our founding fathers
[02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:51.700]  saw, many of them were corrupt individuals themselves. Many of them were very good and
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:58.020]  brilliant people was to balance that power because anyone given too much power will become
[02:54:58.020 --> 02:55:01.900]  corrupt. There's that old adage, I forget the name of the guy off the top of my head,
[02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:06.260]  but power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:11.460]  And absolutely that's a theme throughout history. That's why the Obama administration wants
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:16.380]  to see the assault rifle ban renewed, but even that's not good enough for them. So they
[02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:23.140]  want thumbprinting and registration and closing the gun show loopholes, but that's not enough
[02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:24.140]  either.
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:29.740]  So they're going to take executive action and use new ATF policies and Joe Biden's gun
[02:55:29.740 --> 02:55:36.860]  panel to figure out what they can do outside of law, outside of Congress, not waiting on
[02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:41.700]  even that body to legislate against the Second Amendment. Again, you can't legislate against
[02:55:41.700 --> 02:55:46.060]  the Second Amendment, even if all of Congress and the President were unanimously in favor
[02:55:46.060 --> 02:55:51.500]  of scrapping the whole ordeal and completely disarming, that's an illegitimate law.
[02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:56.860]  First of all, they took an oath to uphold the Constitution and fight off all enemies,
[02:55:56.860 --> 02:56:01.060]  foreign and domestic, to that Constitution. Not to whoever's in charge, not to whoever
[02:56:01.060 --> 02:56:06.380]  has the reins of power during that season or that moment in time, but to the Constitution
[02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:11.500]  and Bill of Rights upholding and enshrining our individual rights and trying to maintain
[02:56:11.500 --> 02:56:14.660]  a balance of power so that nobody gets too much.
[02:56:14.660 --> 02:56:20.740]  Now the entire American Revolution was based on many things, of course, but it was sparked
[02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:28.060]  specifically by an attempt at disarmament at Lexington and Concord on April 19th, 1775.
[02:56:28.060 --> 02:56:32.340]  That's over a year before July 4th, by the way. And I think really that's probably why
[02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:39.420]  they chose April 19th as a favorite false flag date for Waco, for Oklahoma City, to
[02:56:39.420 --> 02:56:43.900]  kind of send the message that maybe patriots, armed patriots are somehow the enemy in this
[02:56:43.900 --> 02:56:44.900]  country.
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:49.180]  But then there's that little wink of the eye, that underlying message that government has
[02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:54.500]  come to try to disarm you on April 19th, as it seemingly always does. Now here's a letter
[02:56:54.500 --> 02:57:01.500]  dated April 18th from Thomas Gage of the British military to Lieutenant Colonel Smith, 10th
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:07.660]  Regiment on foot. Sir, having received intelligence that a quantity of ammunition provisions,
[02:57:07.660 --> 02:57:12.740]  artillery, tents, and small arms has been collected at Concord for a valid purpose of
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:17.580]  raising and supporting a rebellion against his majesty, you will march with me to the
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:20.860]  core of grenadiers and light infantry.
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:26.820]  Put under your command with the utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord, where you will seize
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:33.860]  and destroy all artillery, ammunition, provisions, tents, small arms, and all military stores,
[02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:37.740]  whatever. But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:43.180]  hurt private property. You have a draft of Concord, on which is marked the houses, barns,
[02:57:43.180 --> 02:57:46.140]  etc, which contain the above military stores.
[02:57:46.140 --> 02:57:51.460]  You will order of Trunian to be knocked off each gun. But if it is found impractical on
[02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:55.640]  any, they must be spiked and the carriages destroyed. The powder and flour must be shook
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:00.300]  out of all the barrels into the river. The tents burnt, the pork and beef destroyed in
[02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:04.780]  the best way you can devise. And the men may put balls of lead into their pockets, throwing
[02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:09.500]  them by degrees into ponds, ditches, etc. But no quantity together so that they may
[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:11.400]  be recovered afterwards.
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:16.580]  If you meet any brass or artillery, and it goes on from there, that letter, that action
[02:58:16.580 --> 02:58:22.300]  of disarmament sparked the American Revolution, because you should not try to disarm the militia.
[02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:27.140]  They are legitimate people armed to restrict an overreach of power. There are many other
[02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:29.900]  abuses, of course, and we must keep that in mind.
[02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:33.800]  Tyranical government is not welcome in the United States. Let's never give in. Let's
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:39.380]  defend the Second Amendment. Alex Jones, CNN, Piers Morgan, tonight, 8 p.m. Central. Nightly
[02:58:39.380 --> 02:58:41.380]  news tonight. We'll cover the TSA.
