[00:00.000 --> 00:24.680]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[00:24.680 --> 00:32.800]  We are now well into the DNC meltdown that's taking place in Philadelphia.
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.560]  Now day two of that, we have our reporters on the ground who will be joining us from
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.520]  inside and outside the convention center.
[00:40.520 --> 00:44.640]  A lot of big developments, obviously, we've got excerpts of some of the speeches last
[00:44.640 --> 00:45.640]  night.
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.640]  We have Bernie Sanders being booed when he first came out and said, I'm with her.
[00:49.640 --> 00:51.360]  I'm with her.
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.120]  And then you've got also Michelle Obama saying the same thing, oh, you're with her.
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.080]  She's a she, so it's okay, like the DNC memos said last year.
[01:01.080 --> 01:02.600]  We're doing whatever it takes.
[01:02.600 --> 01:04.400]  We don't care what voters say.
[01:04.400 --> 01:06.120]  We're going to put a woman in.
[01:06.120 --> 01:09.720]  So it's okay to get rid of voting as long as you have the gimmick.
[01:09.720 --> 01:15.440]  It's okay to block the voters as long as you have the stunt that it's a woman.
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.720]  Man, talk about emptiness.
[01:17.720 --> 01:18.720]  Talk about shallowness.
[01:18.720 --> 01:26.720]  We've got the Washington Post and others trying to spin this that it's okay to have the super
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.040]  delegates basically ignoring what all the other delegates are saying, who represent
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.800]  the voters, who were pledged to the voters.
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.160]  You know what is clear here, if they're willing to steal an election, if they're willing to
[01:40.160 --> 01:44.440]  steal a primary, they're willing to steal the big general election.
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.720]  And the big news that I've been reporting since Sunday with Roger Stone is the Trump
[01:49.720 --> 01:56.040]  camp is fully aware of that problem and is preparing major contingencies for it.
[01:56.040 --> 01:59.200]  So this is going to be a spectacular collision.
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.120]  As some polls have Donald Trump 10 points ahead, many seven points.
[02:04.120 --> 02:08.200]  Most scientific polls, five points ahead.
[02:08.200 --> 02:13.200]  A minority of polls, four points or three points, but all of it within the margin of
[02:13.200 --> 02:14.200]  error.
[02:14.200 --> 02:15.920]  That's a big deal.
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.920]  And there's obviously the whole closeted effect that most people are scared to say they're
[02:19.920 --> 02:23.480]  voting for Trump, especially if they're liberal trendies, because they're afraid of being
[02:23.480 --> 02:25.280]  called racist.
[02:25.280 --> 02:28.000]  And so they're very, very closeted in their activities.
[02:28.000 --> 02:38.040]  But my dead reckoning tells me Trump's probably, I think Trump's about 15 points ahead and
[02:38.040 --> 02:41.560]  we're able to reach the Bernie Sanders people that the majority of Democratic voters and
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.080]  get them out of their mind control and get them to actually vote for Trump, not just
[02:45.080 --> 02:49.080]  for one of the third party candidates because they hate Hillary rightfully so much.
[02:49.080 --> 02:51.960]  I think Trump could win by 25%.
[02:51.960 --> 02:56.360]  Way bigger than Reagan's landslide of what they call 10% or so.
[02:56.360 --> 02:59.360]  And that's because there's a major political realignment.
[02:59.360 --> 03:06.360]  We can hardly find whether it's Texas or California, New York or Pennsylvania, Florida, Oregon.
[03:06.360 --> 03:09.960]  We can hardly find anyone that supports Hillary.
[03:09.960 --> 03:13.520]  I was driving around Austin yesterday and saw Bernie Sanders stickers on every fifth
[03:13.520 --> 03:15.880]  or sixth car.
[03:15.880 --> 03:19.040]  And so I was driving up to a dental appointment and then I drove all the way back to South
[03:19.040 --> 03:20.520]  Austin, then to West Austin.
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.640]  I was driving around for about two hours yesterday, taking care of errands.
[03:24.640 --> 03:27.560]  Actually longer because thunderstorms hit and there was horrible traffic snarl going
[03:27.560 --> 03:28.560]  home.
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.560]  I was in traffic an hour.
[03:29.560 --> 03:32.960]  So I guess I was on the road two and a half hours yesterday, taking care of errands was
[03:32.960 --> 03:33.960]  one of those days.
[03:33.960 --> 03:41.840]  I've been out of town and there were just Bernie Sanders stickers everywhere.
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.840]  There were Donald Trump stickers everywhere.
[03:45.840 --> 03:52.240]  There were Info War stickers here and there, but there were just no Hillary stickers.
[03:52.240 --> 04:00.080]  I saw one Hillary sticker, one, one, one, because when you're stuck in traffic driving
[04:00.080 --> 04:06.560]  around in a giant city from the four corners of it, you start playing little games and
[04:06.560 --> 04:10.400]  stuff like listen to the radio or take phone calls and do business.
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.440]  And I was just on the lookout, amazing.
[04:13.440 --> 04:17.680]  But that's what our reporters have found.
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.440]  Where are the Hillary supporters and everybody's talking about this phenomenon.
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.080]  We could find almost no one on the streets that supports her.
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.000]  Most people say they're going to vote third party or for Trump.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.880]  And these are hardcore liberals.
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.880]  So good job to them.
[04:32.880 --> 04:36.760]  I mean, I was really ashamed of the fact they weren't able to stop the theft by Hillary.
[04:36.760 --> 04:37.760]  But I mean, what are they going to do?
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.880]  The mainstream media is allied with it, but what happens when the general public, local
[04:42.880 --> 04:47.600]  government and others realize that the mainstream media is allied with foreign interests that
[04:47.600 --> 04:50.800]  have hijacked the nation and are basically suspending our elections?
[04:50.800 --> 04:52.520]  What happens at that point?
[04:52.520 --> 04:53.520]  That's the big question.
[04:53.520 --> 04:56.000]  We have more Islamic beheadings and attacks.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  We're going to get to all of us right ahead.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.360]  A new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic, reports Fox News.
[05:05.360 --> 05:10.120]  Getting ink may lead to long term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer.
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.040]  According to a new report by the European Chemicals Agency, researchers found red ink
[05:15.040 --> 05:20.200]  was the most dangerous, but they warned blue, green and black ink is also risky.
[05:20.200 --> 05:25.880]  The most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic.
[05:25.880 --> 05:29.520]  Utogenic or reproductive toxic effects, the report stated.
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.640]  It's also being reported that governments in the EU do not regulate tattoo ink as they
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.560]  do drugs and food, and many shops operate without government regulations.
[05:39.560 --> 05:44.520]  In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates chemicals and products including
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.760]  tattoo ink, cosmetics and color additives.
[05:47.760 --> 05:53.080]  But due to other public health priorities, the FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo
[05:53.080 --> 05:54.400]  inks and pigments.
[05:54.400 --> 05:57.480]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.

[08:02.160 --> 08:28.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:28.160 --> 08:57.720]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[08:57.720 --> 09:04.320]  This is the 26th day of July, 2016.
[09:04.320 --> 09:05.320]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[09:05.320 --> 09:07.800]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live.
[09:07.800 --> 09:13.880]  Then kicking off at 11 a.m. tomorrow all the way through till 3 p.m. the next day.
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.880]  That is 28 hours of live broadcast.
[09:18.880 --> 09:25.000]  We'll have some special reports and boil down interviews and live reports from the ground
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.160]  in Philadelphia as Hillary has coronated.
[09:28.160 --> 09:33.360]  Queen, the first time in U.S. history that a presidential nominee publicly ignores a
[09:33.360 --> 09:39.880]  massive landslide by the other candidate and where the superdelegates newly created in
[09:39.880 --> 09:49.600]  the 1970s but never used openly steal the popular vote and appoint her the nominee.
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.040]  If you think they're going to do that nakedly out in the middle of plain view and not steal
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.280]  the general election, I've got a bridge I want to sell you, but here's the good news.
[09:59.280 --> 10:05.080]  I don't need to get this information from Roger Stone or other folks closest to Donald
[10:05.080 --> 10:06.080]  Trump.
[10:06.080 --> 10:08.760]  I can tell you point blank directly from Donald Trump.
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.600]  He is fully aware of what they're planning to do and they are fully aware of the fact
[10:14.600 --> 10:20.280]  that he is surging way more than four or five points in national so-called scientific polls
[10:20.280 --> 10:21.960]  conducted by CNN and others.
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.960]  Those polls are completely spun targeting Democrat voters, elderly people that have
[10:26.960 --> 10:29.400]  landlines and things like that.
[10:29.400 --> 10:33.560]  When you go out and do real focus groups, especially in battleground states, in some
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.840]  areas he's gone from three to five points ahead to 10 points ahead.
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.440]  Now, if you were Hillary Clinton who's already gone for broke and who's willing to do basically
[10:44.440 --> 10:50.280]  anything, what would you be pulling?
[10:50.280 --> 10:55.360]  We have over an hour of Nigel Farage interview that is not even aired yet because we got
[10:55.360 --> 10:56.800]  three different interviews with him.
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.560]  We've got some excerpts of that that are going to air today that are very powerful.
[11:01.560 --> 11:08.200]  Obviously the founder and leader of UKIP recently stepped down, but still the leader in spirit.
[11:08.200 --> 11:12.820]  We have a large part of that interview about 40 minutes that will be airing never before
[11:12.820 --> 11:17.380]  seen tomorrow during the 28-hour transmission and a lot of other interviews have never
[11:17.380 --> 11:19.720]  before been seen as well.
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.440]  Not just my co-hosts and anchors and reporters, not just our crew on the ground, not just
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.560]  a whole list of amazing guests.
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.480]  It's going to be a very, very important broadcast tomorrow where we really dig into every angle
[11:33.480 --> 11:39.440]  of what's happening in our society and track the latest things that are unfolding, not
[11:39.440 --> 11:42.720]  just here in the United States but geopolitically.
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.200]  So definitely stay with us for that.
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.400]  Here are some of the headlines up on infowars.com, this one by Steve Watson, Dems Panic over
[11:49.400 --> 11:56.600]  Trump Surge, Michelle Obama calls Trump hateful in DNC speech while she talks about Obama
[11:56.600 --> 12:02.880]  wakes up in a house built by slaves.
[12:02.880 --> 12:10.520]  That'd be like if you were in the Roman Colosseum and you were Italian or have a Latin background
[12:10.520 --> 12:15.920]  and you started crying going I had ancestors that might have been killed in here, I'm walking
[12:15.920 --> 12:24.600]  around, I mean this is the craziest, just invoking
[12:24.600 --> 12:27.600]  of division anyone could ever imagine.
[12:27.600 --> 12:34.680]  It's so incredibly clear that that's the game here and you have the new VP candidate of
[12:34.680 --> 12:40.840]  Hillary, Tim Kaine, promises Bill to legalize illegal immigrants in first 100 days.
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.040]  And of course that means legalize people with criminal records, that means legalize people
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.240]  that came here illegally, all people trying to come here legally, well they're just thrown
[12:50.240 --> 12:55.200]  to the wayside.
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.200]  But obviously let's get into the big story that's front and center, if you go to DrudgeReport.com
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.960]  you can see an image of the priest that had his head chopped off this morning, during
[13:04.960 --> 13:13.640]  morning mass, ISIS has celebrated the men who killed the priest and attacked and stabbed
[13:13.640 --> 13:23.760]  others, have given credit to ISIS and I'm quite frankly surprised that even UK newspapers
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.880]  and French newspapers admitted it was Islamic terror.
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.940]  Because with the machete attack, the hatchet attack, the shooting attack and the bombing
[13:30.940 --> 13:38.880]  attack that ran from Friday through Sunday, and we're talking about attacks every day
[13:38.880 --> 13:39.880]  now.
[13:39.880 --> 13:43.560]  In fact there's so many attacks, there's several here, I've got the stack, I can't
[13:43.560 --> 13:50.160]  even keep track of them anymore, because this is a worldwide ISIS offensive, I started telling
[13:50.160 --> 13:53.440]  people about three years ago when ISIS first came out with this new name, I said they fly
[13:53.440 --> 13:59.080]  the Al Qaeda flag, it's Al Qaeda renamed, in Syria because our military is refusing to
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.000]  back them, they want to confuse the public and try to have us now back ISIS.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.240]  When that failed, Turkey made a deal with NATO to bring them through and bring them
[14:08.240 --> 14:10.680]  into Europe to start a new crisis there.
[14:10.680 --> 14:17.840]  When you see 80% military aged men walking through Europe, getting on trains and Merkel
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.960]  inviting them in, you know it's an organized plan, and I said when they attack, when there's
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.760]  terror attacks, they will say it's not terror attacks, and they will say that anyone criticizing
[14:28.760 --> 14:34.560]  it will be arrested, that's now started happening.
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.680]  And that you have to have Islamic classes in all public and private schools so that you
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.800]  quote won't anger them.
[14:40.800 --> 14:45.960]  Germany started doing that two years ago, the United States is starting it next year.
[14:45.960 --> 14:48.960]  It's under federal common core standards.
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.680]  Many schools have already begun it, you can just type in public schools teaching Islam
[14:52.680 --> 14:57.680]  to teach tolerance in wake of attacks, that's how they spin it.
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.200]  We cut your head off, we shoot you, we blow you up, we go in your nightclub and murder
[15:02.200 --> 15:03.200]  you.
[15:03.200 --> 15:08.840]  You have to turn your guns in, you have to turn your free speech in.
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.600]  And we have seen, remember yesterday, BBC scrubs Ali from UnitKiller's name on TV and
[15:14.600 --> 15:17.280]  articles and on social media.
[15:17.280 --> 15:23.080]  And in some articles they changed his name to David, like here it is, his name's not
[15:23.080 --> 15:26.080]  been officially released.
[15:26.080 --> 15:34.720]  But he's being named locally, that's a weird way to spin it, as David Sambali, oh man,
[15:34.720 --> 15:42.640]  I mean, whoa, whoa, next level man, next level, ISIS always takes responsibility, they always
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.320]  take responsibility, the killers do, but it's never reported until about a week later, in
[15:47.320 --> 15:49.520]  the back of the paper.
[15:49.520 --> 15:59.080]  In fact, I had liberal media in Cleveland, many times look at me and say, you're a liar,
[15:59.080 --> 16:06.920]  the mass shooting, or the truck that ran over all the people in Nice, he didn't have accomplices,
[16:06.920 --> 16:11.240]  he wasn't Islamic, and it's like in the news he had five accomplices, in the news he was
[16:11.240 --> 16:20.640]  being coordinated, it's admitted that it was al-Qaeda training on how to use a vehicle,
[16:20.640 --> 16:21.640]  it's incredible.
[16:21.640 --> 16:25.360]  By the way, there's also this big white supremacist movement, a lot of it funded by Saudi Arabia
[16:25.360 --> 16:30.480]  and others we've learned, that is saying all those jihad attacks are being carried out
[16:30.480 --> 16:31.480]  by Israelis.
[16:31.480 --> 16:34.720]  Now, let me give you the facts, okay?
[16:34.720 --> 16:43.080]  If someone falls on a banana peel and you didn't do it, radical Islam does exist.
[16:43.080 --> 16:48.320]  It was a false flag to have NORAD stand down to allow the supposed hijackers back and forth
[16:48.320 --> 16:54.720]  when they were on a terrorist list, and that event of 9-11 was used to attack non-radical
[16:54.720 --> 17:00.320]  secular Muslim countries like Iraq and blame them for what the Wahhabi is to bear minimum
[17:00.320 --> 17:01.960]  were involved in on 9-11.
[17:01.960 --> 17:06.240]  So there are events where they're staged or where the door is opened up and we expose
[17:06.240 --> 17:08.240]  those.
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.920]  But these aren't false flags to blame Muslims because the controlled global media won't
[17:11.920 --> 17:19.080]  even say it's Muslims and covers it up with beyond 1984 Newspeak and Ministry of Truth
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.320]  Bizarness.
[17:20.320 --> 17:27.680]  They're screaming Allah Akbar and pledging allegiance to ISIS and they cover it up.
[17:27.680 --> 17:32.640]  They did that on the 9-11 tapes from the gay bar and these other events, the McDonald's
[17:32.640 --> 17:39.840]  attacker, the guys that chopped the priest's head off and started stabbing people today.
[17:39.840 --> 17:40.840]  Enormity.
[17:40.840 --> 17:49.480]  I mean, if I'd explain this to you, the false flag is that our governments are letting
[17:49.480 --> 17:54.720]  these people in and covering up what they're doing as a pretext to then take our liberties
[17:54.720 --> 17:57.920]  instead of a police state.
[17:57.920 --> 17:59.520]  That's the false flag.
[17:59.520 --> 18:01.960]  This is real terror.
[18:01.960 --> 18:05.120]  ISIS is hundreds and hundreds of thousands of fighters and allowed to recruit all over
[18:05.120 --> 18:06.120]  the West.
[18:06.120 --> 18:09.600]  I saw them being protected years ago under the name Al-Qaeda, five years ago when they
[18:09.600 --> 18:12.080]  started the Syrian Civil War.
[18:12.080 --> 18:15.960]  The globalists are running Islam.
[18:15.960 --> 18:20.320]  They're allowing the most radical forms of it to take over the entire religion and
[18:20.320 --> 18:24.280]  mass murder other Muslims.
[18:24.280 --> 18:34.440]  These attacks are real and our government's bringing them in is real and when they launch,
[18:34.440 --> 18:39.160]  these are probing attacks and I kept telling you they're going to get larger and they're
[18:39.160 --> 18:41.720]  going to get closer together.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.720]  We're being probed.
[18:42.720 --> 18:43.720]  We're being conditioned.
[18:43.720 --> 18:44.880]  We're being acclimated.
[18:44.880 --> 18:45.880]  We're being tested.
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.880]  This is a military technique where you do probing attacks, probing attacks that slowly
[18:49.880 --> 18:55.160]  increase until the enemy you're attacking gets used to being attacked so the enemy doesn't
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.360]  get really upset and mountain offensive.
[18:59.360 --> 19:05.640]  If there's a big attack, like a 9-11 or a Pearl Harbor, they know you'll stand up and
[19:05.640 --> 19:11.160]  take action in a big way but if you slowly escalate the attacks, you tend to actually
[19:11.160 --> 19:18.920]  evolve in their words or adapt to being killed and that's why the French Prime Minister said
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.920]  two weeks ago we must accept terror and live with it and it's right-wingers criticizing
[19:23.920 --> 19:25.720]  Islam's fault.
[19:25.720 --> 19:29.640]  They're telling you, get used to it and the Islamists have made deals with the leaders
[19:29.640 --> 19:33.720]  of France and Germany that they will be demies, they will be taken care of, they will be fined
[19:33.720 --> 19:40.920]  by Saudi Arabia and others if they accept the killing.
[19:40.920 --> 19:50.360]  Now what's happening in the DNC, we're going to be looking at all of that coming up.
[19:50.360 --> 19:57.240]  We've got the latest on exactly what happened in the religion of peace attack in Normandy,
[19:57.240 --> 19:59.840]  the latest on Hillary trying to steal the election.
[19:59.840 --> 20:03.840]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day but growing scientific evidence
[20:03.840 --> 20:08.400]  has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from
[20:08.400 --> 20:09.400]  these devices.
[20:09.400 --> 20:13.080]  The solution is Defender Shield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever

[20:33.720 --> 20:38.560]  The security industry uses hordes of salesmen to scare you into signing long-term contracts

[20:59.320 --> 21:03.200]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[21:03.200 --> 21:06.040]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[21:06.040 --> 21:12.040]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[21:12.040 --> 21:16.960]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[21:16.960 --> 21:21.880]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[21:21.880 --> 21:26.680]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, through the best
[21:26.680 --> 21:28.680]  job you can to purify your air.
[21:28.680 --> 21:33.680]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[21:33.680 --> 21:36.560]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[21:36.560 --> 21:38.800]  The general public doesn't.
[21:38.800 --> 21:42.720]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[21:42.720 --> 21:46.320]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[21:46.320 --> 21:51.400]  This is a system I put out of my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't
[21:51.400 --> 21:53.000]  do as good a job.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.040]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and in FullWarStore.com.
[21:59.040 --> 22:03.200]  Think about this, your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.840]  to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia,
[22:07.840 --> 22:12.240]  chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.840]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[23:55.800 --> 24:19.320]  There's a headline, Suicide Bomber had recorded video on his phone pledging allegiance to
[24:19.320 --> 24:26.560]  ISIS before blowing himself up, injuring 12, but by the time it hit the BBC and the
[24:26.560 --> 24:32.880]  Telegraph and others, it said that a Syrian refugee was killed in a bomb blast.
[24:32.880 --> 24:39.520]  That's right, BBC reports German suicide bombing as if Suicide Bomber was the victim.
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.720]  Syrian migrant dies in German blast.
[24:41.720 --> 24:44.800]  That's the headline.
[24:44.800 --> 24:46.480]  Think about that.
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.560]  That's how they operate.
[24:47.560 --> 24:49.720]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.840]  And imagine this collaborator media, if they stage false flags and blame it on patriots
[24:54.840 --> 24:59.080]  and start arresting people and disappearing us, the mainstream media will go along with
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.080]  it with pleasure.
[25:02.080 --> 25:06.080]  They told you Obamacare would make your healthcare free or cheaper.
[25:06.080 --> 25:08.360]  They told you you could keep your doctor.
[25:08.360 --> 25:11.520]  Then they said they never said that.
[25:11.520 --> 25:17.320]  And then Gruber said that he was hired by Obama to lie to the stupid public and say,
[25:17.320 --> 25:18.320]  God, you're so stupid.
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.720]  He said, and thank God, the Hillary delegate said, we're going to ban the guns, but we're
[25:22.720 --> 25:23.720]  keeping it secret.
[25:23.720 --> 25:25.120]  I've been talking to Hillary.
[25:25.120 --> 25:27.520]  The plan is, oh, we're going to deceive them.
[25:27.520 --> 25:35.360]  And of course, they stole the Bernie votes, but it's okay because they're liberal when
[25:35.360 --> 25:40.560]  they overthrow Libya and put al-Qaeda in charge or try to overthrow Syria and start a civil
[25:40.560 --> 25:47.760]  war because they have pseudo-intellectual followers with the IQ of muppets.
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.920]  When I say that, I'm serious.
[25:51.920 --> 25:57.240]  There's either evil Hillary minions that are preying on people who aren't even that
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.920]  smart or they're like muppet creatures.
[26:01.920 --> 26:03.160]  And then you talk to the Bernie people.
[26:03.160 --> 26:05.680]  They're pretty darn smart.
[26:05.680 --> 26:06.680]  Very articulate.
[26:06.680 --> 26:07.840]  I'm not kissing their butt.
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.760]  I've really attacked Bernie supporters because at the end of the day, socialism is one of
[26:12.760 --> 26:15.000]  the easiest things to corrupt and take over.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.760]  So is capitalism, but capitalism hands down produces more wealth and more choices and
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.840]  more opportunity in history than anything else times a hundred.
[26:25.840 --> 26:30.520]  Even our broken form of crony capitalism is better than socialism, but we're going into
[26:30.520 --> 26:31.520]  a pure monopoly.
[26:31.520 --> 26:33.520]  Don't worry.
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.040]  You'll get the crumbs like diamond silksay, they'll call that socialism.
[26:38.040 --> 26:41.800]  So you got fascism up here at the top, crony capitalism, and then they knocked some crumbs
[26:41.800 --> 26:47.280]  off the side to us down here on the floor, a little mice, and you go, here's your socialism.
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.760]  And then they control your whole destiny, your whole life.
[26:51.760 --> 26:57.120]  And now they've gotten to the point of where there's terror attacks every day in France,
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.120]  every day in Germany.
[26:58.120 --> 27:02.440]  I mean, they're covering a lot of these up.
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.520]  And there are resting Germans that mildly criticize it, but now Hollande can't ignore
[27:07.520 --> 27:08.520]  it anymore.
[27:08.520 --> 27:10.880]  See, they've reached that moment because he was saying this wasn't Islamic terrorist
[27:10.880 --> 27:11.880]  a few weeks ago.
[27:11.880 --> 27:16.800]  Hollande says France, that's their president, is at war with ISIS, Islamist's knife man
[27:16.800 --> 27:23.440]  chanting Allah Akbar, the head French priest, 86, and leave none fighting for her life.
[27:23.440 --> 27:26.920]  They were going to kill a bunch of people inside, but the cops showed up very quickly.
[27:26.920 --> 27:32.920]  Fighting for her life or storming the mass before police shoot them dead.
[27:32.920 --> 27:40.360]  Well, the headline should be knife, the head priest, because it said truck, you know, kills
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.120]  80 something in Nice.
[27:44.120 --> 27:48.280]  Catholic church where priest was murdered was among several targets found on the suspected
[27:48.280 --> 27:57.040]  jihadist arrest listed last year, yep, it's all about fear in Muslim nations.
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.400]  The last churches are closing all over the world because they'll come and kill you because
[28:00.400 --> 28:01.400]  it's a religion apiece.
[28:01.400 --> 28:03.920]  People say, but be nice to the Muslims.
[28:03.920 --> 28:05.760]  You know, there's nice ones.
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.040]  Yeah, but the dominant part of the religion is go murder.
[28:10.040 --> 28:11.560]  They're all killing each other.
[28:11.560 --> 28:15.920]  You got Sunnis killing Sunnis because this other group in radical enough.
[28:15.920 --> 28:16.920]  It's a joke.
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.360]  It needs to be reformed, admit it.
[28:21.360 --> 28:24.000]  Germany boost police presence and warns of further terrorism.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.040]  Well, I thought there was no such thing as terrorism.
[28:28.040 --> 28:35.480]  Alert rays after the latest bombing, Ansbach, the fourth bloody act of violence in the country
[28:35.480 --> 28:37.000]  in a space of a week.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.280]  Yeah, there's more than that.
[28:39.280 --> 28:44.160]  Meanwhile, the pub says open the borders more and that it's our fault.
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.320]  And remember, he says he didn't want to hear about the Christian roots that that makes him
[28:48.320 --> 28:51.760]  become physically ill.
[28:51.760 --> 28:56.000]  Of course, he lives behind giant walls himself.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.680]  And if you get caught trying to climb them, you get shot by the Swiss guard.
[28:59.680 --> 29:05.520]  But don't worry, the London mayor and admitted jihadi seeks more powers to protect post Brexit
[29:05.520 --> 29:06.520]  city.
[29:06.520 --> 29:07.520]  He wants powers.
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.640]  Reuters reports to ignore the federal government and make it an EU city.
[29:11.640 --> 29:13.240]  That's called immunization.
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.280]  Schwarzenegger heads up the global program for that.
[29:15.280 --> 29:19.400]  Austin, Texas, to a great extent, is under UN control.
[29:19.400 --> 29:22.720]  We have a pretty good police department and some good people in the city.
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.640]  But the top of the city is literally going under UN rules.
[29:26.640 --> 29:31.120]  They've got all these armed code enforcers running around harassing everybody.
[29:31.120 --> 29:35.080]  That is a police state and disgusting to the average cop around awesome.
[29:35.080 --> 29:36.080]  They're nice.
[29:36.080 --> 29:37.080]  You see a code enforcer.
[29:37.080 --> 29:38.080]  I saw some yesterday.
[29:38.080 --> 29:41.800]  We're just bugging their eyes out at people walking into a 7 11.
[29:41.800 --> 29:44.880]  I mean, if I didn't have to get somewhere, I was going to go in in front of it and say,
[29:44.880 --> 29:48.960]  why are you walking around like you're a third world in a North Korean police officer?
[29:48.960 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.920]  A Texas judge on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining charge against two California antiabortion
[30:05.920 --> 30:12.080]  activists who made undercover videos of themselves trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood,
[30:12.080 --> 30:13.680]  reports CBS News.
[30:13.680 --> 30:18.360]  A district judge dismissed the tampering with government records charge upon the request
[30:18.360 --> 30:21.280]  of the Harris County Prosecutor's Office.
[30:21.280 --> 30:24.680]  Defense attorneys said their clients should have never been indicted.
[30:24.680 --> 30:29.080]  If they had been convicted of the felony charge, each could have been sentenced to up to 20
[30:29.080 --> 30:30.760]  years in prison.
[30:30.760 --> 30:34.520]  Prosecutors alleged that the defendants use fake driver's licenses to conceal their
[30:34.520 --> 30:37.360]  identities while dealing with Planned Parenthood.
[30:37.360 --> 30:42.560]  The defendants, who founded a group called Center for Medical Progress, previously rejected
[30:42.560 --> 30:44.680]  plea deals offering them probation.
[30:44.680 --> 30:49.480]  A grand jury initially began investigating Planned Parenthood, but the group was cleared
[30:49.480 --> 30:51.400]  of misusing fetal tissue.
[30:51.400 --> 30:55.800]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[30:55.800 --> 31:03.760]  Clean, pure drinking water, you can't survive without it, but where do you get it?

[31:08.840 --> 31:09.840]  like no other.
[31:09.840 --> 31:15.160]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[31:15.160 --> 31:20.320]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with
[31:20.320 --> 31:27.480]  a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria,

[31:58.920 --> 32:02.680]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[32:02.680 --> 32:04.400]  Why is this so good?
[32:04.400 --> 32:09.120]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[32:09.120 --> 32:13.720]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[32:13.720 --> 32:14.720]  my system.
[32:14.720 --> 32:20.720]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[32:20.720 --> 32:22.760]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[32:22.760 --> 32:27.840]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[32:27.840 --> 32:29.120]  going on everywhere.
[32:29.120 --> 32:30.120]  These are all parasites.
[32:30.120 --> 32:32.840]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said, there's so many things that are in it.
[32:32.840 --> 32:37.160]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:37.160 --> 32:40.440]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:40.440 --> 32:43.640]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[32:43.640 --> 32:47.520]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[32:47.520 --> 32:53.720]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[32:53.720 --> 32:55.960]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:55.960 --> 33:21.240]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:21.240 --> 33:31.360]  23 hours, 27 minutes out from the kickoff of the 28 hour live broadcast tomorrow, infowars.com
[33:31.360 --> 33:35.060]  4-2-1 giant, define the free audio and video feeds.
[33:35.060 --> 33:38.520]  Stations are welcome to carry parts of it or all of it.
[33:38.520 --> 33:43.840]  Stations are welcome free to air to put their commercials over any segments they want.
[33:43.840 --> 33:46.040]  There's large parts of it that are going to be commercial free.
[33:46.040 --> 33:50.780]  We're going to be putting the links up at infowars.com 4-2-1 giant to the TV satellite
[33:50.780 --> 33:57.700]  feed, the radio satellite feeds, and also the HD video stream feed and a lower res feed
[33:57.700 --> 33:59.220]  as well.
[33:59.220 --> 34:06.140]  And it really, it's live coverage of the DNC coronation of Hillary to a great extent,
[34:06.140 --> 34:13.420]  but also what's happening geopolitically, and it is a super sale fundraiser.
[34:13.420 --> 34:16.900]  I don't really call this a money bomb because all we're doing is giving you some of the
[34:16.900 --> 34:18.620]  best specials of the year.
[34:18.620 --> 34:24.300]  And when I say best specials of the year, I've never offered 40% off on brain force
[34:24.300 --> 34:25.740]  one of our best selling products.
[34:25.740 --> 34:28.460]  It is a brain neutropic.
[34:28.460 --> 34:33.460]  It has amazing properties that are well documented.
[34:33.460 --> 34:36.620]  One of the ingredients is prescription in Europe.
[34:36.620 --> 34:42.580]  This in a healthy way boosts your mental faculties, it certainly has for myself.
[34:42.580 --> 34:48.600]  I'll warn you though, if you're already super tired and you take this because I was doing
[34:48.600 --> 34:54.740]  this some in Cleveland, it'll give you energy that coffee and stuff won't, but I've noticed
[34:54.740 --> 34:59.140]  do and I both get a little mean when we're on it, if we're already super exhausted.
[34:59.140 --> 35:06.540]  So you need to understand that it's some serious stuff, real serious stuff.
[35:06.540 --> 35:07.540]  So check it out.
[35:07.540 --> 35:11.300]  40% off a great way to support the broadcast, and more importantly, a great way to try out

[35:32.740 --> 35:37.820]  So there's a lot of specials, 20% off survival shield X2, the good halogen, 20% off super
[35:37.820 --> 35:39.020]  male vitality.
[35:39.020 --> 35:43.340]  Those are huge specials and a lot more at infowarslifes.com for the nutraceuticals
[35:43.340 --> 35:45.900]  or infowarstore.com, the umbrella site.
[35:45.900 --> 35:49.420]  We have the third edition Hilary for present t-shirts that are about to sell out.
[35:49.420 --> 35:51.500]  When those do, the fourth generation will be here.
[35:51.500 --> 35:57.220]  And we have the new Hilary Rape shirt, excuse me, Bill Rape shirt.
[35:57.220 --> 35:58.420]  She just covers up for him.
[35:58.420 --> 36:02.580]  It shows Bill Clinton and then under it says the war is rape on the iconic Obama Hope
[36:02.580 --> 36:03.580]  change shirt.
[36:03.580 --> 36:05.620]  You want to trigger a minion of Hilary.
[36:05.620 --> 36:07.260]  This is what you wear.
[36:07.260 --> 36:10.820]  Though, I'll be quite honest with you, and by the way, this shirt's already been the
[36:10.820 --> 36:14.700]  one in guarding in the New York Times, it's already got a lot of attention.
[36:14.700 --> 36:19.380]  We are the exclusive distributor of it right now, Roger Stone developed shirt with his
[36:19.380 --> 36:20.380]  crew.
[36:20.380 --> 36:23.540]  I will assure you that you will see triggering, but the problem is, there aren't really
[36:23.540 --> 36:26.460]  any Hilary supporters out there.
[36:26.460 --> 36:33.900]  And we also have the new Texas style Molan Lombay with the M4 in gray and camouflage
[36:33.900 --> 36:37.260]  and we have it with the good old Texas Canon variety as well.
[36:37.260 --> 36:40.140]  This fabric is so soft.
[36:40.140 --> 36:45.540]  These are made in America shirts, printed in America shirts, only $22.95, and the shirts
[36:45.540 --> 36:48.100]  almost cost us $10.
[36:48.100 --> 36:51.820]  So this is a designer style shirt.
[36:51.820 --> 36:55.180]  In fact, I love this type of fabric.
[36:55.180 --> 36:56.580]  It's cotton with a mix.
[36:56.580 --> 37:01.100]  So I actually went and found out who the manufacturer was of this style shirt, found out it was
[37:01.100 --> 37:04.820]  made in America and it was a lot less than some of the companies I'd used before.
[37:04.820 --> 37:09.060]  And so it is a type of shirt you pay $35, $40 for.
[37:09.060 --> 37:10.060]  We're selling it for $22.
[37:10.060 --> 37:11.660]  It is a designer shirt.
[37:11.660 --> 37:18.820]  Again, I have bought this shirt with a different design, but the same shirt for $35 at a shopping
[37:18.820 --> 37:19.820]  center.
[37:19.820 --> 37:21.820]  Okay, $22.
[37:21.820 --> 37:25.580]  But what matters is, it funds the operation, you know, the 10 bucks we make or so.
[37:25.580 --> 37:30.260]  Don't tread on me on the back, infowars.com.
[37:30.260 --> 37:31.940]  You don't have to be a Texan.
[37:31.940 --> 37:33.460]  It's just like wearing a Molan Lombay.
[37:33.460 --> 37:37.460]  You don't have to be Greek from Thermopylae in the Battle of 300 to wear a Molan Lombay
[37:37.460 --> 37:40.740]  shirt to celebrate, that means come and take it.
[37:40.740 --> 37:45.860]  So Texans were saying Molan Lombay, in fact, they had some flags, even had it in Latin
[37:45.860 --> 37:48.260]  and in Greek.
[37:48.260 --> 37:53.460]  And so they were taking that, they weren't stealing it, they were taking it at Gonzales
[37:53.460 --> 37:55.460]  at the Alamo from the 300.
[37:55.460 --> 37:58.180]  You had 180 something at the Alamo.
[37:58.180 --> 37:59.180]  Same deal.
[37:59.180 --> 38:02.540]  There's famous battles with the Japanese where a couple hundred, you know, held off a couple
[38:02.540 --> 38:03.540]  thousand.
[38:03.540 --> 38:04.540]  This is something in every culture.
[38:04.540 --> 38:10.420]  So whether you're Japanese or whether you're African, you know, from Nigeria or whether
[38:10.420 --> 38:12.340]  you're from Mexico, it doesn't matter.
[38:12.340 --> 38:14.500]  You can be part of this.
[38:14.500 --> 38:17.380]  This is just a modern example of come and take it.
[38:17.380 --> 38:19.140]  Everybody gets killed.
[38:19.140 --> 38:20.140]  But it doesn't matter.
[38:20.140 --> 38:23.940]  That then helps the sleeping giant awaken.
[38:23.940 --> 38:26.340]  It's the sacrifice, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:26.340 --> 38:29.180]  It's the will to commit.
[38:29.180 --> 38:35.540]  It's the art type that we see in culture, but it's not just in movies and in fantasy
[38:35.540 --> 38:42.220]  land where, you know, the old general gets cut down before he launches the whole next
[38:42.220 --> 38:44.020]  generation of resistance.
[38:44.020 --> 38:48.020]  The tree of liberty must be water with the blood of patriots and tyrants to quote Thomas
[38:48.020 --> 38:49.020]  Jefferson.
[38:49.020 --> 38:57.020]  So operation, sleeping giant, super sale fundraiser now live at infowarstore.com, infowarslive.com.
[38:57.020 --> 39:01.180]  If you have any questions you can call and order over the phone, triple eight, two, five,
[39:01.180 --> 39:05.620]  three, three, one, three, nine, take advantage today.
[39:05.620 --> 39:12.540]  Now, by the way, we've had election coverage before just with the free audio and video
[39:12.540 --> 39:17.380]  streams that has had 3.2 million people tune in on top of our regular radio and TV audience
[39:17.380 --> 39:18.380]  of millions.
[39:18.380 --> 39:23.580]  But a lot of times we do live election coverage and only 400, 500,000.
[39:23.580 --> 39:24.580]  Oh, that's terrible.
[39:24.580 --> 39:28.140]  Bigger than the average MSNBC show tunes in.
[39:28.140 --> 39:32.900]  But when you get the links to say infowars.com forward slash giant, infowars.com forward
[39:32.900 --> 39:38.860]  slash show, which will both have the live feed kicking off tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[39:38.860 --> 39:42.540]  When you spread the word about that or when you're listing a local station and call your
[39:42.540 --> 39:48.180]  friends and family and tell them tune in something special is happening right now on the radio.
[39:48.180 --> 39:49.180]  America's waking up.
[39:49.180 --> 39:51.640]  The sleeping giant is rising.
[39:51.640 --> 39:53.140]  It's your energy.
[39:53.140 --> 39:56.300]  It's your excitement that is infectious.
[39:56.300 --> 39:59.140]  It's the cure to this disease.
[39:59.140 --> 40:00.700]  The globalists see us as a disease.
[40:00.700 --> 40:03.300]  No, they're the disease.
[40:03.300 --> 40:09.300]  So we're reaching this epic title shift moment right now.
[40:09.300 --> 40:14.380]  And so take that link, put it on Facebook, Twitter, send those links out to everyone
[40:14.380 --> 40:21.460]  you know, not just for this special live event, for other special live events, because we're
[40:21.460 --> 40:31.380]  seeing the Liberty movement with the figurehead who has the courage and the honor to stand
[40:31.380 --> 40:34.780]  against the threats, the intimidation, the lies.
[40:34.780 --> 40:42.460]  We're seeing the incredible action take place right now with Donald Trump up there to where
[40:42.460 --> 40:45.100]  political correctness is being crushed.
[40:45.100 --> 40:49.620]  We are seeing a movement now where they try to steal the election from Trump, but we're
[40:49.620 --> 40:51.120]  unable to.
[40:51.120 --> 40:56.620]  They are now partly successful doing it with Bernie when he won by even bigger margins
[40:56.620 --> 41:00.020]  from the numbers I've seen than Trump did against other Republicans.
[41:00.020 --> 41:02.500]  I mean, it's staggering how bad he trounced her.
[41:02.500 --> 41:04.460]  Oh, you won by 20 points in New Hampshire?
[41:04.460 --> 41:05.460]  We're taking it.
[41:05.460 --> 41:06.940]  Oh, you won by 20-something points in California?
[41:06.940 --> 41:07.940]  We're taking it.
[41:07.940 --> 41:11.140]  Oh, we already met yesterday with Superdelegates who decided your vote doesn't count.
[41:11.140 --> 41:14.780]  And then it's hardly even in the newspapers, and the Washington Post is out there defending
[41:14.780 --> 41:16.980]  it today.
[41:16.980 --> 41:20.820]  There's no way long term they're getting away with this unless they bring in a total
[41:20.820 --> 41:26.340]  dictatorship, shut down the free speech, and really start arresting people in mass.
[41:26.340 --> 41:28.180]  That's what's happening in China.
[41:28.180 --> 41:29.740]  That's what's happening in Turkey.
[41:29.740 --> 41:31.740]  That's what's happening in Venezuela.
[41:31.740 --> 41:34.220]  That's what's happening in areas of Europe, folks.
[41:34.220 --> 41:36.020]  This is really happening.
[41:36.020 --> 41:41.980]  And if you think we're immune from this, we have all the hallmarks of a very dangerous
[41:41.980 --> 41:48.060]  third world country now with nuclear weapons and a very crazed, corrupt, decadent elite
[41:48.060 --> 41:52.060]  engaged in class and race warfare to keep the peasants all fighting with each other
[41:52.060 --> 41:56.820]  while they rob the entire show and try to steal the future.
[41:56.820 --> 42:02.140]  Now, that said, I've got a bunch of clips I want to go to, a lot of things I want to
[42:02.140 --> 42:03.140]  break down.
[42:03.140 --> 42:09.340]  The first thing I want to play is Nigel Farage talking to our reporter, Margaret Howell.
[42:09.340 --> 42:12.300]  And again, a lot of these interviews that we taped last week with him, we had three
[42:12.300 --> 42:16.700]  different, four different interviews with him, have never aired.
[42:16.700 --> 42:21.060]  Those are going to be cobbled together and aired tomorrow during the 28 hour special
[42:21.060 --> 42:22.820]  broadcast with a lot of other stuff.
[42:22.820 --> 42:23.820]  Just get ready.
[42:23.820 --> 42:25.020]  A lot of surprises.
[42:25.020 --> 42:26.020]  You name it.
[42:26.020 --> 42:31.340]  But before we go any further, I want to play what Farage had to say about, I'm not leaving
[42:31.340 --> 42:32.340]  the movement.
[42:32.340 --> 42:40.220]  And he told me some things at dinner a couple of nights after we did the interview and he
[42:40.220 --> 42:44.580]  said, listen, I've been the leader of the party since we founded it 25 years ago, 24
[42:44.580 --> 42:45.580]  years ago.
[42:45.580 --> 42:47.820]  I just can't keep leading it forever.
[42:47.820 --> 42:50.460]  I got to let new blood in.
[42:50.460 --> 42:54.260]  Obviously, there's been security threats.
[42:54.260 --> 42:55.260]  People have come after him.
[42:55.260 --> 42:56.260]  He doesn't get into that.
[42:56.260 --> 42:58.140]  He wants to spend some time with his family.
[42:58.140 --> 43:02.420]  He's still in the EU parliament for a couple more years, but he said, I'm not going to
[43:02.420 --> 43:05.020]  be the leader of the party anymore.
[43:05.020 --> 43:09.740]  I'm giving folks in the UK government, like the conservatives, a chance to do the right
[43:09.740 --> 43:12.060]  thing and follow the voters, eat it.
[43:12.060 --> 43:14.860]  And if they don't, I'll be forced to come back.
[43:14.860 --> 43:17.740]  And boy, they're putting the screws to us, trying to shut our economy down right now.
[43:17.740 --> 43:22.500]  And I'm going to be battling to make sure that the EU doesn't try to persecute us.
[43:22.500 --> 43:26.020]  So he's an amazing leader.
[43:26.020 --> 43:27.020]  He's very charismatic.
[43:27.020 --> 43:29.020]  He's very, very plain spoken, but it's powerful.
[43:29.020 --> 43:33.700]  And so I'm glad to hear he's not leaving the movement, even though they set up his plane,
[43:33.700 --> 43:36.380]  they attacked his car repeatedly.
[43:36.380 --> 43:40.940]  The police in France and elsewhere have said no, they're trying to kill him.
[43:40.940 --> 43:42.820]  And Farage does have folks coming after him.
[43:42.820 --> 43:46.940]  He's very serious, very serious.
[43:46.940 --> 43:47.940]  So can you imagine?
[43:47.940 --> 43:51.660]  I mean, the globalists aren't playing games and they have really, really tried to take
[43:51.660 --> 43:52.660]  this guy out.
[43:52.660 --> 43:53.660]  So he is a hero.
[43:53.660 --> 43:54.660]  Here's part of that interview.
[43:54.660 --> 43:56.940]  Margaret Hall reporting for InvoWars.com.
[43:56.940 --> 44:01.740]  Here in Cleveland where we just saw Nigel Farage speak to Tucker Carlson, he was addressing
[44:01.740 --> 44:03.420]  the questions of where is he going?
[44:03.420 --> 44:04.900]  Why is he leaving?
[44:04.900 --> 44:05.900]  What's he going to do next?
[44:05.900 --> 44:10.860]  He said he's going to stay in an advisory position and be very much a part of leading
[44:10.860 --> 44:12.580]  Britain out of the EU.
[44:12.580 --> 44:13.820]  He answered our questions.
[44:13.820 --> 44:17.100]  He wouldn't comment, though, on whether or not he felt safe.
[44:17.100 --> 44:20.380]  He said he doesn't discuss the personal side of this.
[44:20.380 --> 44:22.660]  But victorious leader came to Cleveland.
[44:22.660 --> 44:27.260]  He wouldn't comment on the RNC other than to say that he doesn't like Hillary Clinton.
[44:27.260 --> 44:28.860]  And we asked him some pretty interesting questions.
[44:28.860 --> 44:30.580]  You're going to catch our interview in just a second.
[44:30.580 --> 44:32.580]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InvoWars.com.
[44:32.580 --> 44:36.620]  Ask you why you're going to quit because we're just wondering, like, what's going to
[44:36.620 --> 44:38.020]  happen to the movement if you go?
[44:38.020 --> 44:39.260]  Well, I'm not going completely.
[44:39.260 --> 44:40.260]  I'm not disappearing.
[44:40.260 --> 44:44.580]  I'm not moving up into the mountains to live in a shed, you know?
[44:44.580 --> 44:49.700]  I mean, I'm going to go on being an MEP until we exit the European Union overseeing that
[44:49.700 --> 44:52.100]  process and commenting on it.
[44:52.100 --> 44:55.540]  And I will, if I can, hold the government's feet to the fire to make sure that they hold
[44:55.540 --> 44:58.260]  faith with the people that have voted.
[44:58.260 --> 45:03.020]  And I'm still going to be around and commenting and saying things and doing things and supporting
[45:03.020 --> 45:04.100]  the party.
[45:04.100 --> 45:06.460]  You can't be leader forever.
[45:06.460 --> 45:07.460]  Nobody can be leader.
[45:07.460 --> 45:09.580]  No matter who you are, you can't do it forever.
[45:09.580 --> 45:11.300]  I've been doing this a hell of a long time.
[45:11.300 --> 45:16.380]  I've dedicated 25 years of my life to getting back the democratic independence of our country.
[45:16.380 --> 45:17.660]  We've won this referendum.
[45:17.660 --> 45:19.220]  I think now was the right time.
[45:19.220 --> 45:20.620]  You're not retiring fully.
[45:20.620 --> 45:21.620]  You're just...
[45:21.620 --> 45:22.620]  I am not retiring.
[45:22.620 --> 45:23.620]  You know, I haven't...
[45:23.620 --> 45:27.580]  I'm not going to go and sit and, as I say, up in the hills and smoke a pipe all day, no.
[45:27.580 --> 45:32.020]  Are you worried that the globalists are going to try to hijack this Brexit?
[45:32.020 --> 45:36.140]  They can try if they want to, but it won't work.
[45:36.140 --> 45:41.540]  Those people who made their minds up to vote for Brexit, despite all the threats that they
[45:41.540 --> 45:43.900]  were getting from the international community, the political...
[45:43.900 --> 45:44.900]  I mean, good to be...
[45:44.900 --> 45:48.500]  The U.S. president even came to London to tell them what they should do, and they made
[45:48.500 --> 45:49.580]  their minds up.
[45:49.580 --> 45:50.740]  They struck out.
[45:50.740 --> 45:53.340]  They voted for freedom.
[45:53.340 --> 45:54.340]  That's what they voted for.
[45:54.340 --> 45:57.300]  If they don't get it, they don't get it.
[45:57.300 --> 46:01.380]  If they're betrayed, then you'll see even bigger political shocks than we saw with the
[46:01.380 --> 46:02.380]  Brexit result.
[46:02.380 --> 46:04.700]  Are you worried about your personal safety at all?
[46:04.700 --> 46:09.220]  Well, hey, whether I am or not, I don't discuss that sort of thing in public.
[46:09.220 --> 46:10.220]  It doesn't make sense.
[46:10.220 --> 46:11.220]  All right.
[46:11.220 --> 46:18.620]  Now, again, we're going to have, like, I think it's 45 minutes, at least a clip I saw, several
[46:18.620 --> 46:24.540]  interviews, lean-handed interview, how did, others did, so our crew interviewed three
[46:24.540 --> 46:25.540]  different times.
[46:25.540 --> 46:26.540]  So it's big.
[46:26.540 --> 46:28.500]  We got a Tucker Carlson interview in there as well.
[46:28.500 --> 46:29.500]  That's all coming up tomorrow.
[46:29.500 --> 46:31.820]  I tell you, get to know Tucker Carlson in person.
[46:31.820 --> 46:35.820]  He's been under to visit me a couple of times, and I got to have dinner with him for about
[46:35.820 --> 46:38.740]  two hours, and he's a patriot.
[46:38.740 --> 46:42.300]  He's just kind of been waiting for America to wake up so that he could successfully,
[46:42.300 --> 46:46.740]  I guess, keep his job at Fox News, tell him the truth.
[46:46.740 --> 46:49.940]  You can also see the writing on the wall that they're not going to let people tell the truth
[46:49.940 --> 46:50.940]  at Fox News.
[46:50.940 --> 46:56.100]  Just since they forced Ailes out last Wednesday, I've already been watching Fox every day.
[46:56.100 --> 46:58.060]  Massive difference in coverage.
[46:58.060 --> 47:04.420]  I'm watching it, and it's like I'm watching CNN, unless it's Hannity, and I think they're
[47:04.420 --> 47:05.420]  going to fire Hannity.
[47:05.420 --> 47:09.780]  I mean, they are, they want to destroy it.
[47:09.780 --> 47:10.780]  They want to destroy it.
[47:10.780 --> 47:14.180]  They want to shut this country down.
[47:14.180 --> 47:18.260]  Rupert Murdoch's a Hillary supporter, and his sons are even worse.
[47:18.260 --> 47:25.620]  A lot of folks go, good, everybody will just come to your show.
[47:25.620 --> 47:29.940]  I don't want to be successful on the backs of people who were censored and shut down,
[47:29.940 --> 47:32.220]  but it's more important than that.
[47:32.220 --> 47:34.100]  I'm not a moron.
[47:34.100 --> 47:39.220]  If they can hijack and infiltrate and take down Fox News, as David Brock swore he would
[47:39.220 --> 47:44.660]  do in a Politico article four years ago with, quote, infiltrators, he said, we got Soros
[47:44.660 --> 47:45.660]  money.
[47:45.660 --> 47:46.660]  He was in Politico.
[47:46.660 --> 47:48.820]  We have already infiltrated alternative media.
[47:48.820 --> 47:53.220]  We're targeting it, and we're going to sabotage it and bring it down, and Fox News is front
[47:53.220 --> 47:54.220]  and center.
[47:54.220 --> 48:02.740]  And we have specifically, folks, I can tell you, dealt with media matters, operatives.
[48:02.740 --> 48:15.220]  And he said, we are infiltrating, infiltration, military operations, they mean business.
[48:15.220 --> 48:18.860]  And now that they're finishing up at Fox, they're going to try to absorb that, that's
[48:18.860 --> 48:22.940]  a big elephant to eat, they're going to move on to Drudge next, Rush Limbaugh and then
[48:22.940 --> 48:23.940]  yours truly.
[48:23.940 --> 48:26.860]  And they're like, well, Alex, you don't agree with Rush Limbaugh on a lot of few things,
[48:26.860 --> 48:27.860]  it doesn't matter.
[48:27.860 --> 48:28.860]  He's pro-gun.
[48:28.860 --> 48:29.860]  He doesn't want to destroy the country.
[48:29.860 --> 48:31.660]  He doesn't want to deindustrialize this.
[48:31.660 --> 48:32.860]  Rush is not a globalist.
[48:32.860 --> 48:33.860]  They're going to get him.
[48:33.860 --> 48:37.820]  People will, wow, you've been up against him for 19 years, aren't you glad?
[48:37.820 --> 48:38.820]  No, I'm not glad.
[48:38.820 --> 48:40.820]  I never wanted to be up against Rush Limbaugh.
[48:40.820 --> 48:44.500]  The network I'm on doesn't tell me what to say, but they told me what time slot I was
[48:44.500 --> 48:48.180]  on if I wanted to be carried on that network.
[48:48.180 --> 48:53.020]  Now, I'm separate from the network down for many years on my own show, control it, have
[48:53.020 --> 48:56.900]  my own separate media operations, but this is the slot I'm in.
[48:56.900 --> 49:01.100]  I was a nighttime host, but I know I take no pleasure.
[49:01.100 --> 49:04.940]  I mean, I don't know if people's brains work that have drudged one away, I would get way
[49:04.940 --> 49:05.940]  less traffic.
[49:05.940 --> 49:07.180]  See, people don't get it.
[49:07.180 --> 49:10.380]  A movement needs to grow and take back the country and the world.
[49:10.380 --> 49:15.660]  I'm not a movement of myself that wants to be the one big guy as the ship goes under,
[49:15.660 --> 49:19.660]  and I'm sitting on top of the crow's nest as the last person to go into the ice.
[49:19.660 --> 49:27.660]  No thank you, I mean, it's just the way people think, no wonder some of you aren't successful.
[49:27.660 --> 49:30.780]  I can't tell you the so-called Liberty Movement, how many of you other talk show hosts and
[49:30.780 --> 49:35.460]  people have come and gone who had talent because all they wanted to do was hijack the movement,
[49:35.460 --> 49:41.260]  control it, and make stuff up about people like it was some kind of junior high prom
[49:41.260 --> 49:45.980]  where everyone's putting out rumors about the quarterback because they're jealous of
[49:45.980 --> 49:46.980]  him.
[49:46.980 --> 49:48.220]  I mean, it's mental illness.
[49:48.220 --> 49:53.820]  I'm in a war to try to defeat tyranny for my family because I believe in a level playing
[49:53.820 --> 49:58.460]  field and know how dangerous tyranny is historically.
[49:58.460 --> 50:01.820]  And so everybody better understand what's happening in Fox News is bad news.
[50:01.820 --> 50:06.060]  I've had so many people celebrate it to me, oh, I hate them, they're fake conservatives,
[50:06.060 --> 50:09.540]  look at them, oh my gosh, of course they're going to make it liberal now, ha ha ha, and
[50:09.540 --> 50:12.580]  I'm like, do you understand what this means?
[50:12.580 --> 50:13.580]  I guess you don't.
[50:13.580 --> 50:17.500]  It's not even bad people that are talking to me like this, I mean, they're overall
[50:17.500 --> 50:23.660]  smart folks, but yes, Fox has been controlled for a certain extent because Ailes was being
[50:23.660 --> 50:25.940]  threatened the whole time.
[50:25.940 --> 50:30.380]  They want to control the conservative movement and they want to model it after kind of the
[50:30.380 --> 50:34.900]  Rockefeller Republicans and kind of slowly put it to sleep and slow it down.
[50:34.900 --> 50:37.620]  And so folks think that there's really an opposition.
[50:37.620 --> 50:42.540]  But it became a real opposition because a lot of people that were host weren't going
[50:42.540 --> 50:44.460]  to go along with the destruction of the country.
[50:44.460 --> 50:49.020]  And so Roger Ailes wouldn't punish and fire people like Sean Hannity.
[50:49.020 --> 50:53.260]  But now you're going to see the hatchet come down, folks.
[50:53.260 --> 50:54.260]  Absolute tyranny.
[50:54.260 --> 50:55.820]  And you're going to see Hillary try to steal the election.
[50:55.820 --> 50:59.540]  We're seeing the real fall of this country right now, America's fighting for its life.
[50:59.540 --> 51:03.900]  Are you prepared to bug out infidel body armor and an army ranger have produced a high speed

[52:04.940 --> 52:08.660]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[52:08.660 --> 52:12.100]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[52:12.100 --> 52:14.300]  it's very, very important.
[52:14.300 --> 52:20.900]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[52:20.900 --> 52:23.220]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[52:23.220 --> 52:25.220]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[52:25.220 --> 52:29.580]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.

[54:36.220 --> 54:40.180]  and quite frankly, we just bit off more than we could chew with the RNC and DNC and the
[54:40.180 --> 54:42.380]  size of our crew, everything else we're doing.
[54:42.380 --> 54:45.460]  We normally have weeks to get ready for the 28-hour broadcast.
[54:45.460 --> 54:47.060]  We started getting ready Friday.
[54:47.060 --> 54:54.900]  I was up here Saturday and Sunday working with Anthony Gutiardi and one of the tech people.
[54:54.900 --> 54:56.420]  Anthony worked until about midnight on Sunday.
[54:56.420 --> 54:59.060]  I'm not complaining or not about having to work.
[54:59.060 --> 55:05.020]  It's just that I've got to get this ready because we've got some big breaking news, we've got
[55:05.020 --> 55:06.340]  a lot more taking place.
[55:06.340 --> 55:09.260]  I've got to make some phone calls.
[55:09.260 --> 55:18.500]  Right now, I know a whole bunch of huge developments that if I could tell you would be probably
[55:18.500 --> 55:27.460]  top stories in the country and I've pretty much been authorized to talk about this, but
[55:27.460 --> 55:34.900]  it's so big, a lot of this, I kind of hesitate because if I don't put it out there just right,
[55:34.900 --> 55:40.020]  I mean the truth is the truth, but it's how it's put out.
[55:40.020 --> 55:42.260]  Something mega huge almost has no effect.
[55:42.260 --> 55:46.500]  Petty little stupid stuff gets picked up and it's huge for some reason, but really important
[55:46.500 --> 55:54.660]  stuff just gets ignored and I don't know how to describe this.
[55:54.660 --> 56:05.020]  It's surreal to watch Hillary Clinton steal all those states, so I have to go back and
[56:05.020 --> 56:07.860]  get all those states she stole.
[56:07.860 --> 56:12.260]  That's what I'm going to basically take off and do in the next few hours and go get all
[56:12.260 --> 56:15.380]  the articles and show the states they took and show the states Sanders really won.
[56:15.380 --> 56:16.540]  I've got to add up the numbers.
[56:16.540 --> 56:19.620]  We've done this before, but when I add up the numbers, show the graphs so people can
[56:19.620 --> 56:25.700]  see it and show the New York Daily News article about it to their credit they reported on
[56:25.700 --> 56:29.580]  it and illustrate it for people.
[56:29.580 --> 56:35.740]  We've got to illustrate it for people that Sanders really did win and that the super
[56:35.740 --> 56:39.940]  delegates have just told everybody we don't care what you do, starting in New Hampshire,
[56:39.940 --> 56:43.500]  ending in California, we're going to give it to Hillary and all the articles where
[56:43.500 --> 56:46.900]  they said look we don't care, we're going to do it and the Republicans saying we don't
[56:46.900 --> 56:48.220]  care, we're going to do it.
[56:48.220 --> 56:52.660]  I've got to somehow put that out to just ask America, is this really who we are?
[56:52.660 --> 56:56.300]  Because they just hope we're too lazy to get into the minutiae of it and understand it's
[56:56.300 --> 57:02.260]  total suspension of the election, but they act like there was an election, so the Soviet
[57:02.260 --> 57:05.260]  Union would do things.
[57:05.260 --> 57:09.740]  But really it's how Communist China does it with a central committee and a Politburo.
[57:09.740 --> 57:14.860]  Now the Bernie people know it and they're hopping mad, but this is a major referendum
[57:14.860 --> 57:18.420]  on can you steal a primary, can you steal an election?
[57:18.420 --> 57:23.500]  And then the big news is the Trump camp has been working late into the night, the last
[57:23.500 --> 57:31.100]  few evenings with top experts on this, chronicling Hillary's frauds and to their credit, just
[57:31.100 --> 57:36.900]  like Trump came out and said hey, the Republicans are stealing states from me and the Republicans
[57:36.900 --> 57:41.740]  are trying to say super delegates count, this is a fraud, that forced them to back off and
[57:41.740 --> 57:43.500]  not try to actually steal it.
[57:43.500 --> 57:47.460]  They said they were, but Trump spoke out so it backfired.
[57:47.460 --> 57:51.420]  Well Trump's going to have to speak out about if crooked Hillary stole this from Bernie
[57:51.420 --> 57:55.740]  and show the numbers and show the graphs, and if I got to do the work for the campaign
[57:55.740 --> 57:59.940]  I will, because I know they're going over all of it.
[57:59.940 --> 58:07.100]  We need Trump to come out and say listen lady, I'm ahead of you in the polls, don't you think
[58:07.100 --> 58:11.260]  for a minute you're going to steal Jack Squat, it's the only thing that will stop her doing
[58:11.260 --> 58:13.260]  it.
[58:13.260 --> 58:19.280]  And I know they agree with me, but I'm just sitting here just with this feeling of history
[58:19.280 --> 58:27.300]  in front of us, almost like desperation if in the future I nostalgically look back and
[58:27.300 --> 58:28.820]  have it done my job.
[58:28.820 --> 58:32.540]  It's like desperation before the fact, it's just totally animating that I shouldn't even
[58:32.540 --> 58:37.140]  be here on the radio, I should be dropping all of this to try to collate and codify all
[58:37.140 --> 58:38.140]  that info.
[58:38.140 --> 58:40.460]  And folks don't wait for me to do it, you need to put it together.
[58:40.460 --> 58:44.940]  I mean this is other media, Daily Caller rolled that daily, I don't care about the credit,
[58:44.940 --> 58:49.460]  we got to put the case on, it's a fact, it's already been admitted, we got to show it.
[58:49.460 --> 58:53.340]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[58:53.340 --> 58:56.220]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[58:56.220 --> 59:02.260]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[59:02.260 --> 59:07.220]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[59:07.220 --> 59:12.180]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[59:12.180 --> 59:17.300]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, do the best job
[59:17.300 --> 59:19.020]  you can to purify your air.
[59:19.020 --> 59:24.020]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[59:24.020 --> 59:27.020]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[59:27.020 --> 59:29.220]  The general public doesn't.
[59:29.220 --> 59:33.180]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[59:33.180 --> 59:36.780]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[59:36.780 --> 59:40.340]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[59:40.340 --> 59:43.540]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[59:43.540 --> 01:00:12.540]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, then fullwarstore.com.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:26.540]  In the age of wonder, another world, another time, in the age of wonder, and do the crystal
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]  fact.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:32.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:38.540]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:45.540]  People ask me, do I get on a power trip with the fact that info wars is the leading edge,
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.900]  tip of the spear against globalism?
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.900]  And no, it's the opposite.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:53.660]  But my mom, I was talking to her on the phone yesterday and she said, I'm so glad to hear
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:58.420]  you're at least excited and happy for the first time in years when it comes to talking
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.660]  about the state of the world.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.740]  Because I know we're losing.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.300]  I know we're under total world government.
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.300]  I know they're horribly evil and the public's in a trance.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.940]  But I have been celebrating a little bit in the last few days because I already knew this
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:18.340]  from sources, but I confirmed in the highest levels of the resistance in Europe, Russia,
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.020]  and here in the United States that what I'm seeing on the street is what they're seeing
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:27.060]  and that I'm not only influencing and my crew is only influencing with general public
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:33.780]  and helping awaken them, not telling them what to see, but taking the blinders off, but
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:39.060]  that also world leaders, as I already knew, but I've confirmed across the board, listen
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:43.940]  to this broadcast, whether it's the UK government or the Syrian government or the Russian government
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:51.460]  or the Japanese government or the South African government, I mean, it is mind blowing.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.860]  And that's what one of these major leaders just kept telling me.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.340]  They said, listen, it's the same way.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.300]  You don't realize when you're fighting, how big an effect you're having until you finally
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.420]  go through the storm.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:10.860]  And it's not a feeling like, oh, I'm a, you know, I won the football game.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.820]  That's such an empty feeling, stupid.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.900]  It's like, at least I'm struggling and I'm in the fight and we may have a chance.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:23.260]  But then you get desperate, like, and you're like, I want to do this, I want to do that.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.900]  It's all this number crunching and all this documentation and, you know, all this digging
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:33.500]  the info up that you already see and know, and it's just like, and then you want other
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.900]  people around you to have the same energy, but they aren't going to have it until they're
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:44.660]  out of the trance because most people are in a trance from entertainment and the culture.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.900]  They're in fantasy land.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:52.460]  All the archetypes in their mind and soul are tied to things growing up that were based
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.020]  in fantasy.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:59.700]  So their passion is in fantasy, their passion is in fiction, their passion is in sports.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.180]  It's a vestigial ceremonial combat.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:08.700]  And so they are just spectators, but we can't be mad at the general public because slowly
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.900]  they're coming out of that.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:18.580]  But I'll tell you this, history's actors that are in opposition to the planetary dictatorship
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:26.020]  and the eugenics program, they're on the same page as info wars because info wars is a clear
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:40.580]  eyed, historically based, researched, battlefield analysis, compendium and a chronicle of the
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.140]  human struggle.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:54.980]  And then there's the responsibility, not a power trip, that you're doing a terrible
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.780]  job, but you're the best there is.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:06.460]  And I was talking to some highly decorated special forces soldiers famous in their work,
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:13.420]  not Tim Kennedy, some other guys, one guy with more kills than Chris Kyle, army.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.940]  And I said, when I think about this, I get tears in my eyes and then it's embarrassing
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.220]  about what we're up against and the fact that we could beat it, people would just wake up
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.420]  and they said, no, that's what all everybody out who's out there doing everything, putting
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.140]  everything into it.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.540]  And then you're sad that people are unconscious and aren't awake and don't know what's going
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:36.860]  on and it's a feeling of pain or humanity.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.180]  And it's just so incredible that when you actually talk to seasoned soldiers, they're
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.940]  the most awake, involved human people you will ever meet.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.260]  And that's why the left and the dehumanizers hate them.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.220]  And on average, cops are the same way, despite all their problems and the bad.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:59.820]  That's why the globalists hate them because these are still real people.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:05.180]  A new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic, reports Fox News.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.020]  Getting inked may lead to long-term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.900]  According to a new report by the European Chemicals Agency, researchers found red ink
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:20.060]  was the most dangerous, but they warned blue, green, and black ink is also risky.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:25.620]  The most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic,
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.100]  mutagenic, or reproductive toxic effects, the report stated.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.460]  It's also being reported that governments in the EU do not regulate tattoo ink as they
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.380]  do drugs and food, and many shops operate without government regulations.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:44.380]  In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates chemicals and products including
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.620]  tattoo ink, cosmetics, and color additives.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:52.940]  But due to other public health priorities, the FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:59.180]  inks and pigments, you can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:04.620]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.940]  produce about a group you took years for to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.340]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.580]  it's very, very important.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:21.220]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.740]  Our telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, but when it runs out,
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.740]  you start dying.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.900]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.780]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.460]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.260]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.540]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.580]  It's in powder form.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.260]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260]  I take this.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.180]  This is the product that I take.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:07:03.940]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.420]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.420]  Here's why.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.340]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.420]  So please listen.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:18.580]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators,
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.780]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.780]  sun.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.260]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.660]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.340]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.940]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:42.460]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.580]  price for M4Wars listeners.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.300]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.740]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.580]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:08:19.140]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:29.820]  All right, I'm about to hand the baton to Paul Watson because I have got to go meet
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.660]  with crew about the 28-hour broadcast that I'm going to be hosting, I don't know, like
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:40.140]  10 hours of or more coming up, kicking off at 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:48.940]  I then have to get on the telephone, obviously, to New York and get the latest intel on what's
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:53.860]  going on with the globalist and Hillary's operations.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:59.460]  I've got to tell you right now, some of the folks like Roger Stone have amazing intel.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.780]  So it's come out in the WikiLeaks now that Hillary was sending the Bernie people dressed
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.340]  up like Bernie Sanders supporters to attack Trump supporters, that they were trying to
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:15.620]  blame Bernie and Trump at the same time, and that came from Stone's sources inside the
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.580]  Democratic Party, Stone exposed the Koch brothers were funding Hillary, that now has come out
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:26.260]  six months later, and the exact numbers he put out, I mean, he's got moles everywhere.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:32.860]  And he doesn't even want me to get into the stuff, actually, that he's been going through.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:42.020]  Just to say that incredible IRS stuff, all of a sudden, computers broken into threats.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.700]  I mean, this is a real war, folks.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.100]  This is not a game.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.260]  We're not playing tiddlywinks here.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:53.180]  They are coming after the second amendment.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:58.060]  They're coming out to the first amendment, but they first have to steal this election.
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:03.100]  And we need a total landslide to defeat the fraud that will be engaged in.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:07.700]  The good news is Donald Trump is not going to roll over if there's fraud.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:12.900]  And Hillary better understand that and better know that.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.940]  And so that's where we're going here.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:23.740]  But if we get the word out and explain to people, and go back to the news articles from
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:29.260]  New Hampshire and California and eight other states, 10 total, admittedly, where Sanders
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:34.820]  won by huge margins, 20 or more points per state admitted, and so they just said it doesn't
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.820]  matter, superdelegates.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.540]  And we have superdelegates bragging about it.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.820]  We have the Republicans trying it, and they just hope you forget about all that.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:50.860]  This is a referendum on do we have voting in this country and to votes count.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.060]  It's never been clear.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.300]  So many people thought Bernie Sanders was going to get up there last night, have people
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.140]  calling in and the news saying, what will he do?
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:00.820]  Will he do a Ted Cruz?
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.820]  No.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.100]  He's with the establishment.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:07.260]  Ted Cruz is with the establishment, the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Koch brothers,
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:11.700]  the Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.620]  They're all against Donald Trump.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.900]  And if you don't support Donald Trump, you're a moron.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:24.780]  It has never been clearer that Donald Trump is taking the globalists for a run for their
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.500]  money and going all out.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:35.380]  And I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that Donald Trump has pledged to me directly.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.940]  I'm going to just stop right there.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.820]  But he is going to fight the New World Order, and he knows what's going on.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:47.140]  He's aware of it, and he's never backing down.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.660]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:55.860]  Just the issues he's talking about and the things he's covering and saying are irrevocable
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.420]  damaging to the globalist.
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.620]  Now, here is Bernie Sanders being booed last night.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.620]  I'm with her.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:08.900]  I mean, she is the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan candidate.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:14.180]  And he won by massive percentage points.
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:19.500]  I mean, you can break them all down, but it doesn't matter.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:26.100]  Superdelegates decided the party decided for the first time in U.S. history, and he went
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.100]  up there and went along with it.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.100]  Here it is.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:39.180]  And we have God to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim K.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.900]  Is there going to finish busting the borders up and bringing globalism?
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:47.940]  And the whole thing boozing.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.540]  Elizabeth Warren got booed.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.540]  Brothers and sisters.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:51.540]  Oh, look, the Politburo is not going along.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:58.540]  Brothers and sisters.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:07.060]  Oh, they don't like her votes not killing.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.940]  Nexel says a conspiracy theory that Bernie ever even existed, just like, you know, when
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.500]  your name's Ali, and you know, Allah Akbar and pledge allegiance to ISIS and blow people
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.500]  up.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:21.540]  The ABC comes out and says your name's not Ali, it's David.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:29.420]  And I guess David Johnson or David Wilhelm or David Pierre, I was random names, David
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:39.140]  John Doe cut off the head and stab the nuns in France today.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.140]  In Normandy.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:44.980]  We're going to go to Paul Watson now, but I wanted to play one more clip.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:49.220]  This is, this is just classic here.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:54.700]  This is the comedian, Sarah Silverman, what she said about Hillary previously, what she's
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.660]  saying now, the total flip-flop here it is.
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:05.220]  So let's talk politics because I know you care deeply and you've been a Bernie supporter.
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:13.380]  So I tell you this, I will vote for Hillary with gusto.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:18.940]  Hillary takes money from banks and big business and super PACs, so did Barack Obama.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.140]  She's no different than anybody else.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.140]  She was the best choice I thought.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.140]  Considering they all do it.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.140]  Then someone came along who doesn't take steroids.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:34.740]  Can I just say, to the Bernie or bust people, you're being ridiculous.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:42.380]  He's not going to tell, not playing the game, and it says what he means.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:48.900]  I am proud to be a part of Bernie's movement and a vital part of that movement is making
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:15:00.140]  absolutely sure that Hillary Clinton is our next president of the United States.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:13.020]  Listen, listen, listen to what you did, this is a comedian, this is a power of comedy.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:23.500]  Thank God they can fix this in post.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.500]  So there you go.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:29.180]  Paul Joseph Watson, we have entered a twilight zone, zone here my friend.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.820]  I want to ask Paul Watson this question as I hand the baton to him and then Jakari Jackson
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.340]  is going to be coasting in the fourth hour.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:40.620]  I'll be back tomorrow, 28 hours kicked off at 11 a.m. central.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.860]  They won't call jihadi's terrace.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.020]  They won't say as Islamic.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.740]  Now they changed their names from Ali to David.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:51.500]  I mean, I have the BBC screenshots here.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.540]  They openly steal the election.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.300]  You're going on a well-deserved vacation tomorrow, but I need your help to go back to the New
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.700]  York Daily News, how they admitted that they met in secret, decided that Hillary would
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:04.780]  win even though Bernie was getting more votes and then just ignored the election in California.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:09.940]  He got 20% more, but she got more delegates in New Hampshire and eight other states.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.940]  I've done the math.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.940]  We've covered it.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.060]  They admit he's really the winner.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.500]  You see the vast majority supporting, but now they have these new superdelegates that
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.500]  are ignoring it.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.460]  To me, that's the epic issue to actually do an article showing those numbers to people
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:24.900]  again, kind of a postmortem.
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.540]  We have an article out today with the Washington Post is trying to cover that up.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.940]  To me, this is the key.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:32.540]  And then the big question is if they're going to steal the nomination, they're going to
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.540]  go after Trump.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.540]  And Trump knows that.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.540]  So what do we do?
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.540]  What do we expect?
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:42.220]  But it's so twilight zone where the level of their deception and lying is something I've
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.940]  never even seen.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.620]  It's like five times worse.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.780]  Is this desperation?
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.780]  Is it backfiring?
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.540]  Where do you think we're going in all of this madness?
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:57.700]  At the same time, they're being honest, Paul, saying, hey, we are going to ban your guns
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.380]  and the stock market is rigged and mega elites don't pay taxes.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:02.380]  So sit down and take it.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:07.180]  I mean, is this just the arrogant political class and the whore media thinking they're
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.540]  invincible because they're not, Paul?
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:15.580]  I think it's a hangover from, you know, legacy media in general, Alex, they're still under
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:20.640]  this illusion that they can completely control the narrative, that they control all sources
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.140]  of information.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.180]  Mainstream media is completely pathetic.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.380]  Not only is it not trusted, it's slow.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.380]  It's inaccurate.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.540]  I mean, if you're following a breaking news event, you don't watch BBC, you don't watch
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.540]  CNN.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.780]  You go on Twitter.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.260]  They report everything 30 minutes to an hour beforehand.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.060]  And usually it's more accurate because it's not being covered up.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:46.100]  I mean, today with this priest beheading, which I'm going to talk about, you know, two, three
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.660]  hours after it happened, after we knew that the attackers were shouting Alarakbar, they
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:57.100]  were shouting pro-ISIS slogans, they were wearing Muslim garb, they were beheading priests.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.980]  Where else have we seen that GI wonder?
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:05.980]  The BBC three hours after we're still saying the motive isn't known.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:06.980]  Completely pathetic.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.940]  In fact, it's a running joke.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.780]  There's a joke headline now, which is on the, you know, a mock-up of the BBC website.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:19.360]  It says, clumsy French priest stumbles upon peaceful Muslim's butter knife and accidentally
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.740]  beheads himself.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.860]  That's the level that it's got to.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:29.340]  Remember with the Germany suicide bombing, they were like, Syrian migrant dies in blast.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.340]  Not suicide.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.340]  Bomber blows.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.340]  They actually said that.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.340]  That's not a joke headline.
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.340]  So here's what I'm getting at.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:39.700]  If the media will go this far, they will sit there and lie if we're putting FEMA camps
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.780]  and killed and say we never existed.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.860]  I mean, they're now getting to that level.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:48.740]  How do they get an entire industry of people to engage in such bizarre criminal behavior?
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:53.220]  I mean, it's criminal to cover up this, this jihad offensive.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.340]  Because if they don't parrot the narrative, the consensus, they get fired.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.380]  I mean, the head of German ZDF, what their top broadcaster came out a couple of months
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:07.060]  ago, a few months ago and said, look, we report what the German government tells us to report.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.060]  Period.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060]  That's it.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.300]  They're state media.
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:13.020]  It's just, they don't admit to being state media.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:16.380]  It's just, it's almost as bad as Chinese state media.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.420]  At least they admit to it.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:23.780]  You know, we've got a BBC that fails to report unknown details for hours afterwards.
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:25.820]  So they can claim there was no known motive.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.340]  So they can claim, oh, this guy didn't have Ali in his name.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.460]  He was influenced by Anders Brevik.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.100]  This was a right wing inspired attack.
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:39.940]  But hours after that shooting in Munich, they were just obsessing about Anders Brevik.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.940]  That's right.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.980]  I forgot to mention that they don't just cover up the Ali or the Muhammad in the names.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.380]  They then again, call them David and then blame the right wing and actually say the
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.500]  right wing did it.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:56.700]  Why don't they just say that John Wayne did it for that matter?
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:00.740]  They've got a narrative to push and they push it after every single attack, which is why
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.900]  nobody trusts them.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:07.660]  You know, what was it down to 5% media trust in the recent polls?
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.540]  People are turning away from them in droves.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.780]  That's why our traffic's gone up because they're simply not credible anymore.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.260]  We've won that these attacks would happen over and over again.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.620]  We specified the reasons why.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:19.780]  And that's my next question.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.780]  Now it's accelerating as part of a Jihad worldwide offensive that their imams are openly proclaiming
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:26.900]  worldwide that Saudi Arabia is funding.
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.180]  Where does it go next?
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:31.540]  And how does the West think it's going to get away with this?
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]  The Western leaders?
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.740]  They're not going to get away with it.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:40.500]  You had vowels in 2013, the French prime minister saying it's okay that we allow Jihadists in
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.780]  and out of friends.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:47.420]  Again, this is the guy who beheaded the priest today, tried to go to Syria to fight for ISIS
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:52.740]  last year, was stopped in Turkey, was able to get back into France.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.340]  Two years before that, the French prime minister said, we don't care about these Jihadists
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:00.300]  coming back and forth because they're fighting Assad.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.700]  Now that's not the only problem.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.420]  Obviously, Islam's a violent and intolerant religion.
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:10.060]  That's their inspiration, but not overthrowing secular leaders in the Middle East would be
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.060]  a start.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:16.860]  But as you mentioned earlier in the show, this attitude, after Paris, it was all hogger
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.460]  Muslim and everybody was cuckolded.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.620]  After Nice, they were booing and hissing at the president, the prime minister.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:30.460]  Even the BBC today reports that the mood has turned noticeably sour again after this attack.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.860]  So it remains to be seen.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.460]  I mean, the head of the French police came out and said, one or two more terror attacks.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.900]  There'll be riots on the streets.
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.700]  There'll be, quote, civil war.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.420]  You've got local council members saying that people are buying guns.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.220]  They're joining gun clubs in record numbers.
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:49.500]  And that's the prime minister being booed when he said, at the funeral, we've got to
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500]  accept this.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.340]  And again, that's to break your will.
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:55.540]  Why would you go to a funeral and say, accept being murdered?
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.060]  Because this is their, what Bracken pointed out is what the Muslims do in these countries,
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.180]  especially with hobbyists.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:03.100]  They tell leaders, we're going to pay you off, we're going to put you in office, we're
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:06.660]  going to protect you when we take over, but you've got to let us start killing people
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.060]  and cover it up to prove you're our dimming.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:14.100]  So I didn't realize it was a cult gang initiation is why the Germans and the French and the
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:20.660]  Swedes and others, folks in Finland, if you defend yourself, you get put in prison.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:24.420]  This is the criminals breaking our will, Paul.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:29.260]  And you notice that the solution to the problem of bringing in millions of Muslim migrants
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:33.660]  is to turn Western society into basically a Sharia law situation.
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:41.340]  You've got yet another story today where this group of Muslims go to a nude bathing swimming
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:44.460]  pool in Germany and start chanting Alarak Bar.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.420]  They start yelling at the young people there simply for their choice that they want to
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.420]  bathe.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:53.780]  And really, they're just a bunch of perverts when they get in control, raping and murdering.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:56.980]  They just want to actually come and see it because they get off on it, but then dominate
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:04.500]  it and control it because it's a culture of rape and torture and pedophilia and devil worship.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:09.900]  Dozens of cases in England, other countries of Muslim pedophile gangs abusing, abducting
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.700]  young children, you know, and they grandstand on this supposed virtuous moral platform.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:20.020]  As he said, they're the most wicked, they're the most deviant when it comes to those kind
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.020]  of situations.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:26.740]  So they chanted at these women, quote, German women are all slots and basically they threaten
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.700]  to quote, exterminate them while chanting Alarak Bar.
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.340]  But what's the solution?
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:37.660]  It's not to stop allowing in millions of people who hold these beliefs, which are intolerant
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.700]  and not progressive, even though the progressives defend them.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.940]  The solution is to have segregated swimming pools.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.420]  The solution is to have segregated trains.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.420]  That's right.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:49.340]  Make us go under Sharia law.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:50.340]  That's the plan.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.940]  I heard this from people 10 years ago.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.020]  I didn't believe it.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.500]  I have to say they're correct.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.380]  I have to say it's true.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.380]  There is no doubting at Paul.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:00.420]  I'm going to turn over the rest of the broadcast to you.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.060]  Please listeners, it is so important for everyone to remember that it's absolutely, totally
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.580]  critical that you support the broadcast.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:12.260]  We now have an in-game response to Carl Rove 1%.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:18.300]  We're an empire creating our own reality for you to study, studies over, you're under arrest.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.780]  Washington blog, I've had enough of these war murderers and created poverty that annually
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780]  kills millions.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:27.300]  The reason I ask for this article is, you told the New York Times and Washington Post,
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:31.700]  and while you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will, we'll act again creating our
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.100]  new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:39.260]  We're history's actors now, and all of you will just be left to study what we do.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:44.700]  That's why the BBC says that David, literally that David Jones, this is Bizarre, the most
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:50.940]  common British name, David Bowie's name, my dad's name, murdered these people or blew
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:55.820]  them up, one of the guys' names, Ali Mahbubu or whatever it is, I can actually look up
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:00.180]  the name, it's Ali something, I mean this is getting, but it's on purpose to break
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:05.180]  our will and just say that blonde-haired women raped everybody in Cologne in order the police
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.180]  to say so.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.460]  And a German minister gets raped by four Muslims, she says German men did it.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:15.860]  She was happy to frame Germans with it, it's a self-hate, just evil.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:21.100]  We're fighting back, ladies and gentlemen, and we're running a special, through the 28-hour
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:25.180]  broadcast, a 40% off brain force, the ultimate new tropic.

[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:30.340]  Please help us spread the word.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:33.940]  Please help us reach out to folks in your area.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.340]  Please get this intel out to everyone you know.
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:41.660]  Paul Watson, you're going to be hosting for another hour and about 35 minutes, five minutes
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:47.100]  into the two o'clock hour, the Jakari Jackson comes in to take over for the balance of that
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.780]  hour, then the nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central, and of course you'll probably
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.780]  be taking calls as well.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:55.020]  Paul, I'm going to go ahead and hand the baton to you from London, England.
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:28:00.900]  Okay, thanks Alex, and we've got David Knight coming up in a little while with an update
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.940]  from the DNC, so look out for that.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:10.060]  The top of the hour, we have Tommy Robinson, activist, author of course, has received numerous
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:15.340]  death threats and physical assaults for talking about the religion of peace, to talk about
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:19.380]  what has unfolded today in Normandy, France again.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:24.420]  The sun came up this morning, so the religion of peace has struck again.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:31.300]  It's Gallo's humor, but it's virtually every single day now that this happens, and bear
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:36.740]  in mind, we've got a political class, we've got a media that tells us every single day,
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:43.020]  and in fact, Trevor Noah was on MSNBC trying to make this point yesterday, that the biggest
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:50.820]  danger, the biggest danger to the West is Donald Trump's politically incorrect rhetoric.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:58.300]  That's the biggest danger that we face as a Western civilization, not a belief system
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:05.300]  that has sworn to subjugate and kill us, that is killing us on the streets of Europe now
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:07.260]  nearly every single day.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:08.700]  No, no, no, no.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:14.540]  That's not a threat Donald Trump's politically incorrect comments and remarks.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.780]  That's the biggest threat to the West.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.340]  We've had a political environment in the UK after Brexit, where we've been told over
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:27.260]  and over again, that people saying mean things to Muslims on public transport, so-called
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:33.180]  hate crimes, so-called Islamophobia, that's the biggest threat we face.
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:39.780]  Making xenophobic comments on social media, that's the biggest danger that we face.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:45.260]  Meanwhile, we have people dying every day on the streets of Europe, we'll be back with
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.260]  the latest.
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:48.900]  This is the Alex Jones show, don't go away.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.620]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:59.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:05.860]  A Texas judge on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining charge against two California anti-abortion
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:11.860]  activists who made undercover videos of themselves trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood,
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.620]  reports CBS News.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:18.260]  A district judge dismissed the tampering with government records charge upon the request
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:21.220]  of the Harris County Prosecutor's Office.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:24.620]  Defense attorneys said their clients should have never been indicted.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:29.060]  If they had been convicted of the felony charge, each could have been sentenced to up to 20
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.740]  years in prison.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.220]  Prosecutors alleged that the defendants used fake driver's licenses to conceal their identities
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.300]  while dealing with Planned Parenthood.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:42.500]  The defendants, who founded a group called Center for Medical Progress, previously rejected
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.580]  plea deals offering them probation.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:49.380]  A grand jury initially began investigating Planned Parenthood, but the group was cleared
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:51.300]  of misusing fetal tissue.

[01:59:52.020 --> 02:00:14.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:16.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:26.580]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:31.740]  Final hour of the Alex Jones show, we got Tommy Robinson coming up, of course we had yet another
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:38.060]  horrific attack in Normandy, France today, a priest beheaded another hostage in critical
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:39.060]  condition.
[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:44.700]  Thankfully, the police in that area were able to respond quickly and shot the two assailants
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:49.180]  dead, but of course, it's just the latest in a long line of attacks.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.700]  We had the axe attack on a train in Germany.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:55.480]  We had the machete attack on the streets of Germany.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:02.900]  We had the Syrian migrant suicide bomber who blew himself up outside a restaurant bar after
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:05.420]  he had tried to enter a music festival.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:08.820]  Thankfully, he only succeeded in killing himself.
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.100]  That attack could have been far worse.
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:16.300]  And then today's outrage, but of course, our governments, as I've said, are more outraged
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:21.900]  about xenophobic comments on Twitter than they are about Islamists killing us every
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:23.660]  single day.
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:25.340]  Let that sink in.
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:30.860]  The amount of resources, the amount of attention they're devoting to hunting down alleged
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:37.220]  racists who make mean remarks on social media, again, that gets the visibility.
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:41.700]  That gets the play in terms of mainstream media narrative.
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:46.860]  What doesn't get the play or doesn't get any attention whatsoever in this conversation
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:56.660]  about why we keep being attacked is the fact that in France, Muslims, 35% of them across
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:06.340]  all Muslims living in France support suicide bombings, 42% of Muslims aged 18 to 29 support
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:08.220]  suicide bombings.
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:13.020]  So don't tell me that it's a tiny fringe radical minority.
[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:19.060]  Yes, the ones who actually go out and slaughter people are, but the support network around
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:27.220]  them, the Islamist buffer zone around them, as we saw with Abdeslam in Malambique, Brussels,
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:30.140]  they protect them, they support them.
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:34.140]  This problem goes way deeper than, quote, G had it.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:39.500]  As we see in Germany with the story I mentioned earlier, a group of six Muslims, again, go
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:45.980]  to this nudist bathing pool, start chanting Allah Akbar, start harassing all the people
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:50.140]  there, start saying, you're all slots, we're going to exterminate you.
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:52.740]  Again, this is cultural enrichment.
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.380]  This is diversity.
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:03:02.500]  This is refugees welcome, attacking the very core supposedly progressive principles of
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:06.060]  the carefree lifestyle that left this one to lead.
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:10.860]  But of course, they're okay to do it because in the oppression, Olympics League table,
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:14.220]  they rank above everyone else.
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:17.620]  I mean, I made the point in my video yesterday, which we're going to play later in the show
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:19.500]  if we've got time.
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:26.060]  Imagine if right wing neo-Nazi skinheads were literally killing people on the streets of
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:28.260]  Europe every day.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:33.300]  Imagine if they were going to events and harassing women, molesting women.
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:37.900]  Imagine if they were beheading imams at mosques throughout Europe.
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:44.220]  Imagine if they were driving trucks through crowds of Muslims praying on the street.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.560]  What would the media narrative be?
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:52.500]  Would they analyze the hateful ideology that was inspiring, that was motivating those kind
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:53.500]  of attacks?
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:54.500]  Well, of course they would.
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:58.460]  They would even try to do that when it has nothing to do with the right wing.
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:03.900]  So of course, they would be completely obsessed with that would be right wing apocalypse descending
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:06.260]  on the West.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:10.900]  But when Muslims do it, we can't talk about that.
[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:16.060]  We just have to hug a Muslim, keep saying that it's a tiny radical fringe minority.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:19.300]  Even though it's not, I mean, how many attacks is it going to take?
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:24.660]  Are we going to have to have 10 attacks a day for people to finally recognize that this
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:29.220]  is not a tiny minority, that this is not a religion of peace?
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:31.060]  Can we reform the religion of peace?
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:32.980]  Is it beyond that?
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:39.580]  Given that, nobody, they can't gather together 12 people to have a not in my name protest
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:45.460]  after these Islamic terror attacks, but they can have riots globally after somebody draws
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:48.140]  a damn cartoon.
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:49.740]  Can we reform Islam?
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:50.980]  Or is it completely impossible?
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:55.220]  We're going to talk about that with Tommy Robinson on the Alex Jones show live after
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:56.220]  the break.
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:57.220]  Stay tuned.
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.220]  Breaking news at info wars.com.
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:05.140]  A new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic, reports Fox News.
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:09.980]  Getting inked may lead to long term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer.
[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:14.860]  According to a new report by the European Chemicals Agency, researchers found red ink
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:20.020]  was the most dangerous, but they warned blue, green, and black ink is also risky.
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:25.700]  The most severe concerns are allergies caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic,
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:28.260]  mutagenic, or reproductive toxic effects.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:33.220]  The report stated, it's also being reported that governments in the EU do not regulate
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:39.340]  tattoo ink as they do drugs and food, and many shops operate without government regulations.
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:44.340]  In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates chemicals and products including
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:47.580]  tattoo ink, cosmetics, and color additives.
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:52.940]  But due to other public health priorities, the FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:54.220]  inks and pigments.

[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:00.940]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:02.340]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.060]  Why is this so good?
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:08.540]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:13.340]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:14.340]  my system.
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:19.580]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:22.380]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:27.460]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:28.700]  going on everywhere.
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:29.700]  These are all parasites.
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:32.420]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:33.660]  You have the neem in there.
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:36.740]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.020]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:41.020]  All right.
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.260]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:44.260]  It just came back in yesterday.

[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:55.540]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:08:09.340]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:15.100]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:25.180]  You're listening to Alex Jones, your back, it's the Alex Jones show live.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:29.260]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming up here in a minute, but first I want to draw your attention
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:32.380]  to Operation Sleeping Giant.
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:38.580]  This is the special 28 hour broadcast that launches tomorrow to help us break the globalist
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:42.260]  stranglehold, stranglehold on free humanity.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:49.540]  This is 28 hour broadcast, again, begins tomorrow with the main show, continues for 24 hours
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:54.780]  after the main show, and it's going to take place in the middle of Queen Hillary's coronation
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:58.700]  at the DNC again on Wednesday, July 27th.
[02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:05.380]  Be sure to tune in for Operation Sleeping Giant again for that marathon.
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:08.700]  Broadcast more details at infowarsteam.com.
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:13.940]  And we've got fresh in stock the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:19.100]  If you thought that Hillary for Prison was a conversation starter, then just wait for
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.100]  this.
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:26.420]  Of course, this was the t-shirt that triggered Jank Yuga of the Young Turks during that infamous
[02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:33.500]  confrontation with Alex Jones with Infowars at the RNC, going to trigger a lot of other
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:34.500]  people too.
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:40.220]  You're a massive conversation starter, and of course, your purchase goes to support us,
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:46.020]  to support the outreach, to enable us to fly people at great expense to all these global
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:52.060]  media events, to take on the mainstream media narrative face to face.
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:57.660]  So that is the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, and again, of course, alleged rapist.
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:10:03.600]  It's not as if he flew around on a private jet with a convicted pedophile and underage
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.740]  sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, that didn't happen.
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:12.340]  But get the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt at infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:18.460]  Now we're joined by activist, author, Tommy Robinson, of course, we've had this horrible
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:19.460]  attack today.
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:24.340]  Tommy, I just want to get your initial reaction to the beheading of the priest.
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:31.820]  We've got BBC telling us that calling a terrorist a terrorist might be politically incorrect.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.820]  How much blood running through the streets of European cities will it take before our
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:40.420]  leaders actually identify the root cause of this problem?
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:43.660]  I don't think our leaders are coming through.
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:47.220]  I don't think it's going to come from our leaders.
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:51.540]  I think it's going to have to eventually come from the people.
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:54.100]  When we look at this most recent attack, it's daily now.
[02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:55.100]  It's daily.
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.340]  But still, we've seen the same reactions.
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:00.580]  When you look at what's recently gone on, you look at all these terrorists, actually.
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:04.860]  You look at Nice, you look to Germany, you look to today, you look at everything that's
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:05.860]  gone on.
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:12.020]  There's still ships going and bringing more refugees in as this is happening.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:13.020]  Every day.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:18.500]  There's not like any steps have been taken at all to fortify or protect the citizens
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:19.500]  of Europe.
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:20.860]  We're still bringing people in.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:21.980]  We don't know who they are.
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:24.060]  Was it yesterday, today?
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:29.100]  There's been a murder in the Calais jungle, in the refugee camp in Calais, where those
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.980]  people who are committing that murder and committing these walkthroughs and committing
[02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:36.700]  this violence will soon be in the back of a lorry and jumping out of the M25, or jumping
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:39.580]  out in Toddon, just 10 minutes from my house.
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:40.580]  It's still happening.
[02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:43.100]  Nothing's been done, so nothing's changed.
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:49.140]  When you talk about what will our leaders do, Lee Rigby got beheaded, David Cameron
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:53.300]  set up a government task force who had a five-year plan.
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:56.500]  I remember saying at the start of that five-year plan, we're going to be in a worse situation
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:57.500]  in five years.
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.300]  You're not going to solve anything.
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:03.860]  During those five years, we've allowed 2,000 British Muslims to go and fight and train
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:04.860]  devices.
[02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:07.860]  We've allowed 450 of them to come back.
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:12.940]  I believe today's terrorist was walking around the tag on his ankle, electronic tag.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:13.940]  He's a terrorist.
[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:15.140]  He's already a convicted terrorist.
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:16.460]  We know he's a terrorist.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:20.980]  What is he doing walking the streets of our cities with us, or with us waiting to be
[02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:21.980]  targeted?
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:23.500]  No, that's all right.
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:28.420]  The French Prime Minister, Val's, a couple of years ago, said, listen, we know these
[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:30.340]  jihadists are coming in and out of the country.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.340]  They're going to Syria to fight for ISIS.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:35.540]  We're just going to let them back in because we want to overthrow ISIS.
[02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:37.860]  They're not attacking France or Europe.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.260]  Well now they are.
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.820]  You talked about the migrant attack.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:46.620]  We've got people in these migrant camps hacking each other up because of their inner tribal
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:51.380]  differences between Afghans and northern Africans.
[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:55.300]  If they have that kind of behavior towards each other, even though they're all Islamists,
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:59.060]  I mean, Lawrence Southern went to the Calais camp and they were saying, yeah, we have
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:01.020]  actual ISIS supporters here.
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:03.340]  What are they going to do when they come into the West?
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:06.540]  Well, we know what they're going to do because they're doing it almost every day.
[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:12.940]  We've got 21% of Syrian migrants, according to polls, support ISIS.
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:13.940]  21%.
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:17.580]  We've got over a million coming into Germany.
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:21.620]  All of them are Syrian, a lot of them are economic migrants taking advantage of it.
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:24.780]  But 21% of the Syrians alone support ISIS.
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:31.340]  We've got 35% of Muslims living in France support suicide bombings.
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:33.780]  So when they say, oh, it's just a tiny minority.
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:36.540]  Why are you painting, castigating all Muslims?
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:39.780]  Well, you know, Tommy, I made the point earlier.
[02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:45.580]  After somebody draws a stupid cartoon of Muhammad, they're out globally rioting.
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:51.500]  But after every single Islamic terror attack, how many Muslims are out on the streets protesting?
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.740]  How many of them are out there saying, not in my name?
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:55.740]  Basically not.
[02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:56.740]  There's none.
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:03.700]  You've made the point again, like, for example, the attack, the attack recently on the train
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:04.700]  in Germany.
[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:08.740]  I spoke to people I know, and I see on their day to day, I said, you hear about the attack
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:09.740]  last night?
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:11.740]  Do you hear about the attack yesterday?
[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:12.740]  No.
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:16.260]  And I talked to them then about the Polish, the pregnant Polish woman who was butchered
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:18.980]  to death by another Syrian refugee.
[02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:19.980]  No.
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:22.420]  People haven't even heard of them, yeah?
[02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:27.460]  So the media is, and when the media plays a clever game by just using headlines, like
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:32.660]  Syrian migrants killed by German blasts, most people only read the headline.
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:35.460]  Most people only read and flip through the news and read the headline.
[02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:39.940]  So I heard you making the point yourselves about doing this show.
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:46.300]  Imagine two white men, English men, or European men, French men or German men, walked into
[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:51.340]  a mosque, got the imam out and chopped his head off.
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:58.260]  Imagine the outcry, the uproar, the world uproar in every country, the protests, everything.
[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:03.460]  Imagine the reaction to it, and then there's nothing in comparison.
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:08.340]  And then when we talk about, so then we hear the argument that, well, actually, the Polish
[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:12.580]  pregnant girl who was murdered, she was in a previous relationship with this man, that's
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:13.820]  where we differ.
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:19.060]  We are bringing in, well, Angela Merkel brought in one million young, fighting-aged Muslim
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:25.740]  men who are culturally different to us, morally, ethically, their belief system is the opposite
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:26.740]  to ours.
[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:30.180]  Right and wrong are completely different.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:34.500]  There was a girl in Sweden who had petrol port poured over and was burned to death because
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:39.740]  she finished the relationship with an Afghan refugee because in his country you can't finish
[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:40.740]  that relationship.
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.300]  We're bringing in people and putting ourselves in danger, putting our communities in danger.
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:48.780]  We have no hold over who they are, what their beliefs are.
[02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:52.220]  As you said, when you go through the statistics, it's terrifying.
[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:56.980]  And the demographical change that's currently happening in Europe, America should be watching,
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:00.140]  the world should be watching, you should be learning from what's happening, but still
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:05.180]  we see the world divided where we still have these people, I had today a BBC journalist
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:10.340]  message me at 20 minutes after a beheading of a priest, messaging me saying how disgusting
[02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:16.380]  it is that hate crime is on the rise, like I'm supposed to be bothered or care that someone
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:21.700]  has got a dirty look on a train or on a bus because that's the problem and they make more
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:23.860]  of a deal is made by the media.
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:28.300]  Just recently you had two men in England who put some bacon on the Moss door handle.
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:33.580]  They've been sentenced to nine months in prison, they're in prison now, probably being beaten
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:38.060]  by Muslim gangs because they control our prison systems, because our prison systems are like
[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:42.540]  ISIS training camps, they're being beaten for simply putting bacon, now it's a pretty
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:45.020]  stupid thing to have done.
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:50.220]  And so is hate crime, but it's speech, no one's getting hurt, but yet we're coming down and
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:54.580]  stamping down and the authorities will crush anyone who dares to do any of these things.
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:17:00.460]  Now, I don't see any, I get so angry and so frustrated daily at what's happening and
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:04.100]  the path we're being led down because we're all going to have to pick up the pieces of
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:08.540]  this mess that our liberal, pathetic, weak leaders have got us into and they're still
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:09.540]  continuing.
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:13.060]  It's not like, and the problem you'll face, but you're at will face and it's going to
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:17.860]  happen and God forbid I don't want it to happen, but it will happen at some point, Europeans
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:19.060]  are going to react to this.
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:23.980]  Now, the reason why they react to it in a disgusting barbaric way, which will happen
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:28.660]  is because when there's no light at the end of the tunnel, when no one sees a political
[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:32.580]  solution, when they don't see their police force or their military or their leaders or
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:38.020]  anybody stepping in to deal with this problem, to put their citizen safety first, that's
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:42.820]  most of first and foremost, the safety must be of European citizens, not helping people
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:47.500]  from Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, people who despise our culture and our way of life.
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:53.700]  Your job as our leaders, we're using, you're elected by us to keep us safe, you fail to
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:58.380]  keep a priest safe today, you fail by putting an electric tag on a terrorist rather than
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:02.500]  turning him and putting him in a prison of war camp, which is where he should be.
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:07.420]  We are at war, we are at war and it's a war we will not win if we can't even identify
[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:12.940]  who we're fighting and we can't even begin to take all these liberal, pathetic ways of
[02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:18.340]  dealing with these terrorists, these ways of dealing with this pure hatred and vile poison
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:22.700]  by putting an electric tag on their ankles, by sending them on courses and rehabilitation
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:28.060]  courses, anti-extremism courses, the most recent terrorists in Australia have just finished
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:34.740]  his anti-radicalisation programme, it's pathetic and what you will see and what we will see,
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:40.700]  if Marie Le Pen was in power, would a terrorist be walking around France with a tag around
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:47.180]  his ankle, no he wouldn't, no he wouldn't, it's about time we got rid of these weak,
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:52.740]  obsessive leaders and replace them with people who put their country's people first, their
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:57.700]  safety, their security, their military, their people need to come before anything else,
[02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.700]  ran over.
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:05.060]  It would be an improvement wouldn't it Tommy, I mean you talk about bowing down to these
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:10.100]  people it only seems to make them more emboldened, I mean we had a headline last year, Lesbian
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:15.620]  Swedish Bishop wants Christian crosses removed from church to please Muslims, she didn't
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:20.220]  want to offend the precious Muslim migrants so she had all the crosses removed, that didn't
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:26.100]  seem to help today did it, you mentioned how the media would react if you know some right
[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:30.540]  winger killed someone on the street, well we saw it with Joe Cox, you know two weeks

[02:22:57.980 --> 02:23:02.740]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:06.180]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:07.180]  Here's why.
[02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:11.100]  On the weekends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:12.180]  So please listen.
[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:15.700]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:20.340]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and
[02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:22.020]  produce electricity from the sun.
[02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:26.980]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:29.380]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:32.060]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:36.660]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:41.140]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:43.180]  price for M4Wars listeners.
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:44.900]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:46.660]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:48.340]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:52.180]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.

[02:23:53.740 --> 02:24:16.420]  We're live on The Alex Jones Show with Tommy Robinson talking about the religion of peace
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:20.340]  after this latest Islamist atrocity in Europe.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:25.580]  Well, you know, Hillary Clinton tweeted, quote, Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:29.100]  have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:34.300]  Really Hillary, is that why 35% of Muslims in France support suicide bombings?
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:41.860]  Is that why amongst Muslims in France aged 18 to 29, 42% of them support suicide bombings?
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:45.020]  Yeah, it sounds really peaceful to me.
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:49.820]  You know, I guess the Pope didn't wash enough migrants feet.
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.940]  I guess maybe that offended them.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:53.860]  Listen to this out of the BBC.
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:54.860]  This is not the onion.
[02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:55.860]  This is the BBC.
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.020]  This is what they reported today.
[02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:01.940]  With four attacks in southern Germany coming shortly after the mass murder of 84 people
[02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:09.180]  in Nice, counter-terrorism officials are struggling to detect a common thread.
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:15.460]  Is there a single defining feature to these attacks that could offer clues on how to prevent
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.460]  more of them from happening?
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:20.020]  On the surface, the answer would appear to be no.
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:24.300]  The truck driver in Nice was known to have had psychiatric problems and violent outbursts.
[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:28.460]  Yeah, he had a clear enough head to keep his plans hidden for months.
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:31.820]  Tommy, they're openly, I mean, this is not the onion.
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.100]  This is actually the BBC.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:38.540]  They're saying, could there be a common thread between all these attacks in Germany, all
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:40.580]  these attacks in Nice?
[02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:45.740]  Is there a clue that we could somehow find to stitch together why these vicious attacks
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:47.740]  are happening?
[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:48.740]  Completely insane.
[02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:51.220]  They didn't even mention Islam.
[02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:53.980]  Never mind, you know, push it to the front of the conversation.
[02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:57.940]  They didn't even mention it, you know, for hours after this attack today, Tommy.
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:01.700]  They were talking about, they were saying, there was no known motive.
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:07.380]  You've got Muslims shouting al-arabab, beheading people, shouting pro-ISIS slogans.
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:08.740]  That was all reported.
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:11.100]  The BBC said no known motive.
[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:13.740]  Tommy, I guess it must be the priest's fault, right?
[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:19.020]  He must have slipped over and decapitated himself on the Islamist bread knife.
[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:25.740]  Out of the five attacks, 100% of the attackers have been Muslim.
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:29.180]  60% have been refugees.
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:32.540]  Yeah, there's a, there's a link.
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:33.540]  There's a link.
[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:39.180]  It's hard not to, it's hard not to laugh when you hear that from, that's our taxpayer money
[02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:41.180]  paying for that nonsense.
[02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:43.380]  That's our taxpayer money.
[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:49.780]  And when you talk about, even like, for example, the refugee, again, the refugee who had caused,
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:53.780]  who chopped the pregnant Polish girl up in Germany, he'd been in trouble with the police
[02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:54.780]  already.
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:58.380]  If you've got refugees coming into Europe, who are getting into trouble with the police
[02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:01.420]  and breaking the law, they need to be booted straight out.
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:03.140]  They're not refugees, they're invaders.
[02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:04.140]  We know that.
[02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:05.140]  They're fake refugees.
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:06.140]  But they need to be booted straight out.
[02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:14.020]  The BBC, to be honest, what I do now is, after anything, for the truth in what's happening
[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:22.820]  to yourself, I look to Raheem Kasan, I look to Breitbart News, thank God for the different
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:27.820]  now media outlets, which are telling us the truth, because so many people are being lied
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:28.820]  to.
[02:27:28.820 --> 02:27:29.820]  That's what I do now.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:34.420]  I don't even, your videos are great and so I won't point with the points, but I look
[02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:35.420]  to, that's where I look.
[02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:36.420]  I don't bother looking anywhere else.
[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:37.420]  That's what other people say.
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:41.260]  What we need to understand, we are the media, each and every one of us are the media.
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:47.460]  We have to be the media now, because the mainstream media is just fed and lying, completely lying.
[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:51.540]  Before they tell you who it was, or the religion of what it was, or why they've done it, it's
[02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:52.540]  days later.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:56.140]  It's days and days later and it's sniffing, so all the headlines have gone with, we don't
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:59.940]  know the motive and no one knows the motive, and that's where we're at.
[02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:00.940]  People have no idea.
[02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:07.980]  I don't really, I don't see a solution, so I've been searching for a solution for so
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:08.980]  long.
[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:16.020]  There isn't any solution to this, other than implementing strong, tough laws and trying
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:22.020]  to de-Islamify Europe, and in doing so, there will be huge conflict, but there will be huge
[02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:23.020]  conflict anyway.
[02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:27.860]  So I was on another radio show earlier where basically I said, if you tried to ban the
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:32.220]  Birken now in the UK, you couldn't, the police could not enforce it.
[02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:33.220]  They would riot.
[02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:34.220]  They would be conflict.
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:36.860]  That's now 4% of the country's Muslim.
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:40.540]  You tried to ban the false-face Nicarb, if you tried to do it, if the government tried
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:41.540]  to do it, they couldn't do it.
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:45.420]  If they did, it would cause huge conflict, and because of that, he said, well, that's
[02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:49.540]  what I mean, there's no point in causing more problems, so we're bullied and dictated
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:51.940]  to when that's 4%.
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:56.100]  What does anyone, this is just a demographical statistical growth.
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:59.820]  Muslims having 5.6 children, we're having 1.3, right?
[02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:03.620]  So there are things we can do to combat that and address that, like stopping the benefits
[02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:08.140]  from more than two children, because the majority of these Muslims are on benefits, 50% of the
[02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:12.140]  men and 75% of the women, we're paying for our own demise.
[02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:15.540]  So you could try to address these problems, but we're not even trying.
[02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:16.540]  We're not attempting.
[02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:21.380]  I'm waiting to see what the church leadership, because you see, the church in the UK is very
[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:23.500]  different to the church in America.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:27.220]  Our church has been infiltrated by people, and many of them, when I listen to them speak,
[02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:30.140]  I don't even believe they believe in Jesus Christ or God.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:33.620]  I believe they're using the church for their own political sway.
[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:37.300]  Is it not like, for example, the representative of the church in Luton, he's just a complete
[02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:39.300]  apologist in support of Islam.
[02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:43.380]  And Christianity isn't still around all these years later, if we've been weak and expected,
[02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:44.380]  like it is now.
[02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:45.380]  Because that's what we're...
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:46.380]  Okay, Tommy, hold that thought.
[02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:47.380]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:29:47.380 --> 02:29:48.380]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:49.380]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:50.380]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:52.780]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:59.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:05.700]  A Texas judge on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining charge against two California antiabortion
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:11.660]  activists who made undercover videos of themselves trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood,
[02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:13.460]  reports CBS News.
[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:18.100]  A district judge dismissed the tampering with government records charge upon the request
[02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:20.620]  of the Harris County Prosecutor's Office.
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:24.460]  Defense attorneys said their clients should have never been indicted.
[02:30:24.460 --> 02:30:28.860]  If they had been convicted of the felony charge, each could have been sentenced to up to 20
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.540]  years in prison.
[02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:35.100]  Prosecutors alleged that the defendants used fake driver's licenses to conceal their identities
[02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.140]  while dealing with Planned Parenthood.
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:42.340]  The defendants, who founded a group called Center for Medical Progress, previously rejected
[02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:44.460]  plea deals offering them probation.
[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:49.260]  A grand jury initially began investigating Planned Parenthood, but the group was cleared
[02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:51.180]  of misusing fetal tissue.
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:55.180]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:31:01.060]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:03.100]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:05.980]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:05.980 --> 02:31:12.020]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:16.980]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[02:31:16.980 --> 02:31:21.940]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:27.020]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:28.780]  you can to purify your air.
[02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:33.820]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:36.780]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:38.980]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:42.940]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:46.540]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:50.100]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:53.300]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:59.420]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:02.660]  sale at infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:08.620]  And we have fresh in stock, the Bill Clinton Rape t-shirt that triggered Cenk Yuga in that
[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:13.420]  now infamous confrontation with the Young Turks at the RNC.
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:19.460]  If you think Hillary for Prison was a conversation starter, was a headline maker, then wait until
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:27.700]  we see the impact of the Bill Clinton Rape t-shirt and you can get that at infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:35.340]  Infowars.com forward slash giant for all the information on that Marathon historic 28-hour
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:38.540]  broadcast that's set to begin tomorrow.
[02:34:38.540 --> 02:34:40.460]  Be sure to join us for that.
[02:34:40.460 --> 02:34:45.540]  Now, Tommy, you were talking before the break about riots, if they banned the burqa, the
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:51.300]  Muslims would riot in the United Kingdom, it's like in America, they can kill some criminal
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:54.260]  thug who attacks a cop.
[02:34:54.260 --> 02:34:58.100]  People riot over it and the leftist media supports them.
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:01.580]  We had Time Magazine in defense of rioting.
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:02.580]  That was their headline.
[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:08.820]  So if people on the left, if so-called minorities have riots, it's a social justice cause and
[02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:11.940]  they're supported by the leftist media.
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:19.500]  But God forbid, and we're not encouraging it, but I'm not joking when I say the conversation,
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:24.980]  the narrative in this country is there's more outrage about people being mean to Muslims
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:31.660]  on a boss than there is actual Islamist atrocities happening throughout Europe.
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:34.380]  That's not hyperbole, that's real.
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:39.420]  But if God forbid, you had some disturbance by Pagida, they would classify it.
[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:42.700]  They would characterize it as some right-wing Nazi apocalypse.
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:48.820]  If you had anything whatsoever, they would be all over it, framing that in those pejorative
[02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:49.820]  terms.
[02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:55.860]  But Tommy, there was a comment by Old Holborn who is quite a prolific commentator on Twitter.
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:36:01.300]  He said, quote, beheading a Catholic priest in a church in France will unleash some serious
[02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:02.900]  public disorder.
[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:04.620]  This is a game changer.
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:08.020]  We've got council members saying that people are joining gun clubs, they're getting weapons
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:09.020]  in France.
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:14.780]  We've got the head of the French police saying this is almost about to lead to civil war.
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:20.300]  Is that likely, in your view, or will French people continue to just curl up in a fetal
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:23.460]  position and hug a Muslim and hope that everything's going to be okay?
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:28.620]  I don't think it's going to happen yet, no.
[02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:33.820]  I think they're inevitably, yes, they have to do something huge.
[02:36:33.820 --> 02:36:38.740]  Unfortunately, one person's dying, whether it be a priest or anyone, they're going to
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:44.980]  have to do something where thousands die, thousands, but then in order for people to,
[02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:52.740]  oh, in our country, everyone so becomes so selfish, so I'm so selfish for themselves.
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:57.740]  And so long as they're okay, and they're okay, and even if they've moved out, I see
[02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:02.420]  it even with my friends, who they've made a bit of money, and they're all working and
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:06.860]  they've all got jobs, and they're all mortgaged and financed up to the top that they can.
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:09.820]  They can't step out of line in case their jobs are affected, in case they lose their
[02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:13.140]  career because they'll lose their house, they'll lose theirs, and they just sit, and as long
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:16.580]  as they're okay in their house, so all the problems are in loot, and so then everyone
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:20.180]  leaves loot and moves to these nice areas, and then they don't care what's happening
[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:25.420]  anymore, and that's what we've created, a generation of selfish counts.
[02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:28.980]  Now at some point, those people are going to have to realize that the problems that
[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:32.460]  they've moved away from are going to come to where they are.
[02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:35.060]  If not where they're going to come to where they are, their children are going to have
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:36.580]  to deal with it.
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:41.500]  Now once people accept that, once the British public understand the reality of Islam and
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:46.460]  the agenda, and what it's going to bring, once people understand that, I believe we'll
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:54.100]  see a revolution style, a style of a revolution, because people, when the time comes people
[02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:55.100]  will stand up.
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:58.260]  I always used to think, I've gone through many things, and I used to convince myself,
[02:37:58.260 --> 02:38:02.540]  when I was leading the English defense league, I convinced myself that if they kill me, it's
[02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:07.060]  going to be the final thing in this country, because defining moments change the direction
[02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:08.860]  of a country's history.
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:13.580]  Bloody Sunday changed the direction of Northern Ireland, who knows what that moment's going
[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:14.580]  to be.
[02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:18.540]  If it's not a soldier being beheaded like Lee Rigby, if it's not a Catholic priest
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:22.260]  being beheaded in his church, what the hell's he's going to be?
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:23.820]  When are people going to rise up?
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:25.500]  When are people going to stand up?
[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:28.300]  When are people going to look at themselves, and take a hard long look at themselves, and
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:33.180]  every Englishman, or every European man who's watching this, and reading this, and listening
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:34.180]  to this?
[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:35.180]  What are you going to do?
[02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:36.180]  When are you going to do so?
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:37.180]  What are you going to do?
[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:38.180]  If you can't, everyone has a role to play.
[02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:40.900]  I'm not saying go out and start writing, start telling, start kicking off, but people,
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:44.820]  even when marches are organised, or rallies are organised, people are scared to go on
[02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:45.820]  them.
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:51.900]  You can't be scared, and it frustrates me, even at my own country's men, it just frustrates
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:52.900]  me.
[02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:53.900]  I think, what have we become?
[02:38:53.900 --> 02:38:57.620]  When you look at our history, and you look where we come from, and you look at our forefathers,
[02:38:57.620 --> 02:39:03.140]  and what people gave and sacrificed in order to hand down this beautiful country to us,
[02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:08.380]  this beautiful lifestyle, this beautiful freedom, and you're just letting it all go.
[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:14.740]  We're letting it go bit by bit by bit, and the future Americans who are watching this,
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:19.700]  you have an opportunity, you have a chance to change the world, to save the world in
[02:39:19.700 --> 02:39:25.940]  your next election, because if you vote for Hillary Clinton as elected, as a world leader,
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:27.940]  it's going worse.
[02:39:27.940 --> 02:39:33.780]  Every time you think it can't get worse, or the future can't get any more depressing,
[02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:34.780]  it does.
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:39.060]  But then you see, you see currently, I see people shining through, and people coming
[02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:42.540]  through, and politicians, whether it be Marie Le Pen, whether it be Gert Wilders, whether
[02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:43.540]  it be Donald Trump.
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:46.220]  I don't know all the Donald Trump's political views.
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:50.420]  What I know is that he's moved the goalposts to the debate, which needed to be done, because
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:54.020]  for too long people are too scared to say this, so it's so refreshing when you see someone
[02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:57.780]  just stand up and speak, honestly, without worrying about the people who have financed
[02:39:57.780 --> 02:40:01.180]  him and then backing him, and worrying about their money and their profit.
[02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:08.460]  So I think that I always say 10, 20, 30 years time, this is all going to come to a head.
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:10.460]  This has come to a head a lot sooner than that.
[02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:11.860]  It's come to a head a lot sooner than that.
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:15.660]  And actually, if you look at Al Qaeda's plan, this is one thing that, when I read their
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:21.340]  plan, read 12 years ago, when one of their leaders was speaking about their plans for
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:23.020]  what they're going to do.
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:28.460]  They spoke about how weak the West would be after intervening in the Middle East with
[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:29.460]  Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.620]  They were predicting everything, how weak would be.
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:35.580]  So when they do launch their caliphate in Islamic State, we will not send our military
[02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:36.580]  in.
[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:40.860]  Then if each, it gives a four year plan every four years of what they'll be doing.
[02:40:40.860 --> 02:40:44.740]  2016, it says total confrontation with the non-believers.
[02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:47.740]  Now, what happened on New Year's Eve?
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:48.740]  New Year's Eve of 2016.
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:50.540]  What happened on the New Year's Eve?
[02:40:50.540 --> 02:40:54.580]  The first day of 2016, they attacked 1,000 women in Cologne alone.
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:56.500]  They attacked women across the whole of Europe.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:03.660]  It's actually word-for-word what he said, are in Europe, are invaded Islamic army, will
[02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:07.900]  start full confrontation with the kafar.
[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:12.020]  What's the first thing they go for, the weakest people they go for that are women, which is
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:14.020]  exactly what they did on New Year's Eve.
[02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:19.180]  And then they say there will be a five year battle where they will have complete war and
[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:20.820]  no confrontation with us.
[02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:24.100]  Anyone who looks at last week in Europe, we're at war.
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:25.100]  We're at war.
[02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:26.100]  It's ain't going away.
[02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:29.860]  When people understand that you're hard, they haven't even launched their jihad yet.
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:30.860]  Not a property hard.
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:34.180]  When it's properly launched, we're dealing with 4%.
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:41.100]  We're dealing with a pathetic, small, poor 4% and look at the chaos that they're bringing.
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:47.060]  So you think when Europe hits 20%, the Europe already that you think you know or America
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:50.740]  thinks you know, it's changed beyond belief, it's changed beyond belief.
[02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:57.460]  Everything's changing and turning in the way of Islam and fully supporting it, our politicians
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:41:59.260]  and our political elite.
[02:41:59.260 --> 02:42:04.020]  And as the Islamic demographic grows, their vote bank politics will become stronger and
[02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.900]  stronger and stronger.
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:12.340]  And then I know it's depressing, but we have a very difficult future.
[02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:18.700]  No, I mean, it's, you talked about why more people don't speak up.
[02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:22.460]  I mean, I made a video saying Islam's not religion of peace.
[02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:26.140]  It wasn't even that inflammatory seven months ago.
[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:30.140]  I'm still getting death threats every week for a YouTube video.
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:35.100]  I mean, that's why people don't speak out because if you criticize Islam and say it's
[02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:39.940]  not religion of peace, they send you messages, they give you threatening calls, they leave,
[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:45.620]  you know, no saying, I'm going to prove Islam's a religion of peace by violently killing you.
[02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:50.980]  This is why reformists within Islam, you know, ex-Muslims don't want to speak out against
[02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:54.780]  it because it's not fun getting death threats all the time.
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:58.900]  You had Iain Hersey Ali's colleague, you know, killed on the streets of Amsterdam, I think
[02:42:58.900 --> 02:43:05.140]  it was, simply for working with her on projects that try to reform Islam from within.
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:11.700]  It's an environment that encourages intimidation and violent threats to anyone who questions
[02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:12.700]  this religion.
[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:14.860]  Then you've got pressure from above.
[02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:22.020]  My cousin who is gay retweeted me when I criticized Saudi Arabia for executing gay people.
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:27.540]  He was hauled in, works for a major university, was hauled into a meeting and said, you can't
[02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:33.060]  even retweet that information because it might offend the Saudi Arabian students who are
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:35.260]  coming to our college.
[02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:38.820]  And you know, concurrent to this, they'll have gay pride marches and they'll fly a
[02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:41.660]  rainbow flag over the university.
[02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:47.220]  But God forbid you would actually try to criticize governments that execute homosexuals.
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:48.740]  That might offend somebody.
[02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:49.740]  That's bad.
[02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:54.660]  And so people are scared to talk out because they might get death threats, they might lose
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:59.060]  their lives or at the very least they might lose their jobs and their careers because
[02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:01.940]  of this public shaming culture.
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:05.100]  That's why the left is just as much to blame for this.
[02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:06.100]  Correct, Tommy?
[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:08.900]  I've experienced everything you've just spoke about.
[02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:12.980]  In my five, six years of leading the English defence, I had schoolteachers on the phone
[02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:20.220]  in tears to me because what the left, and these are organisations that are funded by
[02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:25.540]  people supporting open borders, many of whom have funded them from America, such as Searchlight,
[02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:26.700]  Hope Not Hate.
[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:31.820]  What they do is say you've got a member of one of my organisations and he's making
[02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:36.620]  comments about Islam, free speech, not inciting hate, just telling the truth about Islam.
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:39.540]  And he works for BMW, for example.
[02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:44.340]  Then they would screenshot everything, then they would contact the HR department of BMW.
[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:45.780]  These people are being paid to do this.
[02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:50.580]  They're being paid to do this and it works, it's a tactic that works as well because before
[02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:54.460]  you know it, that's why when people use fake names, I get a lot of hassle, you use the
[02:44:54.460 --> 02:44:59.580]  pseudonym and people don't, and our demonstrators, people cover their faces, you're going to
[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:01.980]  lose your job, you're going to lose your career.
[02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:06.460]  What you have to understand as well is many people, for example, people that I know, their
[02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:08.140]  bosses will be Muslim.
[02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:14.700]  This is everywhere, they're infiltrated everywhere at different levels, and this is a far-left
[02:45:14.700 --> 02:45:19.380]  tactic, which is quite a successful tactic that they use to intimidate people into silence.
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:24.500]  But it's also quite encouraging when you have people, I feel my load this week, I think
[02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:25.500]  it's brilliant.
[02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:30.180]  When I see someone who doesn't care, that's the attitude, when I see someone who just
[02:45:30.180 --> 02:45:34.980]  doesn't care, yeah, what anyone's going to say or do, I think it's brilliant yourself.
[02:45:34.980 --> 02:45:40.740]  I know, it's not like you don't get scared because if you walked through Luton, buddy,
[02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:44.780]  you'd get attacked, you'd get violently attacked.
[02:45:44.780 --> 02:45:49.740]  So it's not like it's not scary or intimidating, but it has to be done, and I always think
[02:45:49.740 --> 02:45:53.580]  that the more people that do it, the more inspiration it gives to others to do it, and
[02:45:53.580 --> 02:45:57.260]  all we're doing is telling the truth, but in the times that we're currently facing,
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:03.660]  we're facing, telling the truth is a revolutionary act, that's where we're at, and everyone
[02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:04.660]  is scared.
[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:08.740]  And I always say, when I walk through Luton, and there's plenty of videos, I've been punched,
[02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:13.380]  I've been beaten, I've been attacked, that's why my local politician didn't say what I
[02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:18.340]  say, because he probably quite enjoys walking through Luton and going across to coffee, yeah,
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.180]  and that's the same with everyone.
[02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:24.940]  First politicians, and I know from my experience, and you know, I've been on to about every
[02:46:24.940 --> 02:46:31.380]  debate show, every talk show in the UK, whether it be news night, all of them, yeah, and everywhere
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:34.540]  I go, I don't get a bad reception, and in fact, everyone shakes my hand and tells me
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:35.540]  to keep going.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:38.900]  So I even know that people interview me, but when the camera's on, they're grilling
[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:42.220]  me and giving me a hard time, but as soon as the camera's off, they shake my hand and
[02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:47.020]  say, they admire what I do, and because they're scared, because everyone's scared, and you
[02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:52.940]  know, you said like, there's more of a hoo-ha about, there is a very loud, prominent voice
[02:46:52.940 --> 02:46:57.420]  given to the far left, these apologists, these liberals, but they're not the majority at
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:46:58.420]  all.
[02:46:58.420 --> 02:47:04.340]  The majority of people in the UK have had enough of Islam and the effect it's going to have
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:06.500]  on our nation and our children's future.
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:08.620]  The majority of people, that's the reality.
[02:47:08.620 --> 02:47:12.140]  So we've been punching well below our weight for a long time, but we need to understand
[02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:14.820]  that we're on the majority side, not some minority.
[02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:19.260]  We've seen that, even with the Brexit case of people trying to vote for Brexit, and the
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:26.860]  way they tried to turn that into a race issue, which it never was, it was a vote for culture,
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:32.860]  a vote for culture and identity before it was a vote for the economy, but we still kept
[02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:36.860]  crying on about it, but yeah, I don't know.
[02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:38.860]  We are in big problems.
[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:43.140]  Well, I mean, the majority of Sikhs voted for Brexit.
[02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:44.820]  They're racist right wingers.
[02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:49.900]  I think the point to make is, it's an unfortunate term, but if we've got a target rich environment
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:54.300]  where everybody is speaking out against Islam, there won't be so much pressure on people
[02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:55.460]  like you.
[02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:59.740]  It won't be as easy to demonise people like you, because again, there'll be a lot more
[02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:00.740]  people speaking out.
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:05.460]  The balance, the load will be more balanced amongst those people, and they won't be able
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:11.180]  to isolate and attack us both in terms of character assassination and actual assassination,
[02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:12.820]  actual death threats.
[02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:14.940]  Let's just finish up with this though.
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:19.540]  I'm predicting next, and this is what Al Qaeda have called for, their leader, they're going
[02:48:19.540 --> 02:48:22.940]  to start abducting and killing celebrities.
[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:25.660]  That's their next big step up that they're going to do.
[02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:31.420]  You put out a tweet talking about Muslims getting control of commercial airliners, tell
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:35.460]  us about that, because we know they've got the jihadists actually working in secure areas
[02:48:35.460 --> 02:48:38.100]  of major airports throughout Europe, right?
[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:46.140]  What was it, in the hundreds before the Euro 2016, was it in the hundreds of Muslims who
[02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:51.780]  were on terror watch lists had got jobs in the Euro 2016 football tournament scene?
[02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:57.860]  We've seen, I believe it may be up to 30 or 40 police officers have been booted out in
[02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:01.700]  Paris alone due to their links to radical extremist organisations.
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:07.780]  It's only a matter of time because, God forbid, you can't just sack them, which they don't.
[02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:12.500]  For example, when we had the most extremist organisation, Al-Masruddin, when we had them
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:17.100]  protest against our armed forces in the UK, one of the main people was a baggage handler
[02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:18.100]  at Luton Airport.
[02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:21.100]  He was a baggage handler at Luton Airport.
[02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:22.100]  How far away are we?
[02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:26.780]  That's why I said, how far away are we from a Muslim who, there are plenty of Muslim pilots
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:31.380]  now, ordinary Muslim pilots, how far away are we from one of them being switched on?
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:36.380]  Because that's all this is, they're switched on to their jihad, switched on to Islam, and
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:40.140]  taken down a passenger plane, and all these things, that's why we have to start putting
[02:49:40.140 --> 02:49:46.700]  in, which, whether people say they're unfair laws or not, we have to put things in play
[02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:48.660]  that protect our citizens.
[02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:53.500]  And yeah, when you're on about celebrities as well, I think the next thing that's going
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:56.260]  to happen, and God forbid, you said, how long is it till people react?
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:50:02.780]  I believe in the Northern Ireland-style conflict, there were two IRA bombings a day, two attacks
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:08.460]  a day, when a Palo military British terrorist organisation was set up.
[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:15.700]  We don't want that, no one wants that, but our leaders, our political leaders, our politicians,
[02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:17.900]  they must start dealing with this problem.
[02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:24.340]  Because when you, as you said, when you have a political platform or a process where you
[02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:27.900]  can demonstrate, that's what democracy is, when you're angry you demonstrate, they try
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:30.020]  and take that away from you.
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:34.380]  I'm, I face court, think about this, in France, in Nice, look at what happened in Nice, look
[02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:42.060]  at what happened today, I'm in court on September 19th in the UK, for having a fuck ISIS flag.
[02:50:42.060 --> 02:50:47.220]  In France, not in the UK, so I was in France at a football game, and I had my picture taken
[02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:51.900]  with a flag, and the British authorities, come round my house, come in my house with
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:57.180]  my wife and children there, take me to court, and now I face charges, where they're trying
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:58.180]  to give me a ban.
[02:50:58.180 --> 02:51:00.180]  Okay, we'll divide some.
[02:51:59.180 --> 02:52:03.980]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:08.180]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message, here's why.
[02:52:08.180 --> 02:52:12.780]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse, so please
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:17.540]  listen, solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power, and unlike gas
[02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:22.500]  generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity
[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:27.740]  from the sun, whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:30.820]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep, and here's
[02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:33.300]  the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:37.900]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:42.420]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear, in addition to the low
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:46.180]  price, for M4 Wars listeners, so it's a good time to check it out.
[02:52:46.180 --> 02:52:52.420]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com, it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:53.420]  with minimum money.
[02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:58.700]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:01.060]  Honey, I'm really worried about our retirement funds.
[02:53:01.060 --> 02:53:02.220]  Oh, me too.
[02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:05.820]  We lost so much value in the recession and the stock market, I'm worried we won't have
[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:06.820]  enough to retire.
[02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:10.980]  Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold silver group.
[02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:15.420]  He said how simple and safe it was, it's a private storage IRA, and we could have real
[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:17.420]  gold and silver in our hands.
[02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:18.420]  Really?
[02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:20.300]  You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:21.300]  Absolutely.
[02:53:21.300 --> 02:53:24.820]  He said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build our retirement income.
[02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:28.940]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset, and we would have the security of knowing
[02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:31.180]  we're protected, no matter what the economy does.
[02:53:31.180 --> 02:53:32.180]  What do you think?
[02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:35.140]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA.
[02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:37.340]  We need to call the gold silver group right now.
[02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:39.300]  Are you ready to protect your future?
[02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:44.540]  Call 800-421-3432 now to find out how easy and safe it is to set up a private storage
[02:53:44.540 --> 02:53:50.300]  IRA with gold silver group, and find out how you can qualify for up to $700 in free silver.
[02:53:50.300 --> 02:53:53.060]  All transactions are privately delivered and fully insured.

[02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:55.060]  800-421-3432.
[02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:56.060]  800-421-3432.
[02:53:56.060 --> 02:54:14.060]  We have our final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:20.860]  Tomorrow is operation sleeping giant, the marathon historic 28-hour broadcast.
[02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:22.060]  Again begins tomorrow.
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:26.300]  All the information is at infowars.com slash giant.
[02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:29.460]  You can also support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:35.180]  Now, Tommy reminded me of a story which happened, I think it was last summer here in London.
[02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:42.060]  There was a guy openly walking around Westminster and the Houses of Parliament draped in an
[02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:43.800]  ISIS flag.
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:46.740]  The police didn't even take him in for questioning.
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:48.240]  They let him go.
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:55.740]  Meanwhile, Tommy is over there at the Euro 2016 football tournament, has an F ISIS flag,
[02:54:55.740 --> 02:55:02.180]  basically making fun of a terrorist organization, and now he's being charged.
[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:06.300]  Tommy, tell us about that, and then in the final few minutes, just tell people how they
[02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:09.580]  can support you, how they can get your book and follow you on Twitter.
[02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:10.580]  Go ahead.
[02:55:10.580 --> 02:55:15.020]  Let's look at the reasons why the police in the Far East do this.
[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:20.460]  In fact, I've got the police from Luton, the Beds police, have openly said, and I've
[02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:25.820]  got a recording of them saying that they've been forced to do this to me by the Home
[02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:26.820]  Office.
[02:55:26.820 --> 02:55:32.220]  So I'm in France, I have a Royal Marine, a British, a black British Royal Marine who
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:36.940]  has a flag, and he says, I can have his photo, I have my photo taken with him, I hold the
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:40.540]  flag out, and it has F ISIS on the front.
[02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:45.300]  That's what, when I returned home from the football, from the Euros, my children come
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:48.780]  running upstairs crying their eyes out, Daddy, Daddy, police are here, police are here.
[02:55:48.780 --> 02:55:52.300]  I go down, there's three police officers, so what are you doing in my house?
[02:55:52.300 --> 02:55:56.300]  They're there over this, and that's the comparison.
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:56:00.340]  People were walking around with ISIS flags in the UK, nothing, but the reason for this
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:03.540]  is all part of the same campaign you talk about, of intimidation.
[02:56:03.540 --> 02:56:09.260]  I said to them, you're here to intimidate me, to intimidate my family, to harass us
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:12.500]  into silence, and they've been trying it for six years, I don't know why they don't
[02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:16.220]  just give up, and no matter what they do or say or try to do, I'm not going to be silent
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:17.740]  ever in anything they try.
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:20.940]  They should just get that message and give up on it, but they don't.
[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:24.780]  But it does cause me, whether they succeed, did they succeed, yes, my children were crying,
[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:28.500]  yes, my wife was upset, yes, it disrupts my home life, yes, the next day, rather than
[02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:30.540]  going to see my mum in hospital, I have to go to the court.
[02:56:30.540 --> 02:56:35.380]  Now I have another court case pending again and again, it costs money, finance, and it
[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:38.740]  takes up your time and your energy, and I know when I walk into that, well, I'm never going
[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:39.740]  to get convicted of anything.
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:40.740]  What have I done?
[02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:43.780]  I've done nothing, but they don't buy that time, they've already got a sentence to
[02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:47.220]  have you anyway, because for the last six years, I've had court case after court case
[02:56:47.220 --> 02:56:51.340]  after court case for stupid little things like this, but it all weighs on your shoulders
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:55.820]  and causes you problems, and it's a strain on your life, and that's what they want to
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:56.820]  do.
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:56:57.820]  And it's a chilling effect, isn't it?
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:00.860]  It prevents other people from saying the same kind of thing.
[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:01.860]  It does, yes.
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:05.420]  It has to affect people, look at what they're doing, I had it in the early days of the
[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:09.540]  year, I started kicking off my doors, I had my other friends stepping back, well, I don't
[02:57:09.540 --> 02:57:12.900]  want my door kicked in, even though they're kicking your door in for no reason, and they're
[02:57:12.900 --> 02:57:18.420]  not charging you, but it has the effect, people see it, people feel fearful, it's like a police
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:19.420]  tape.
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:26.260]  And yeah, so I'm in court for that on September 19th, I'm actually quite looking forward to
[02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:30.380]  it now, if I'm honest, now, because I can't wait to see their argument, and now that the
[02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:33.500]  media have got involved, now that everyone's watching what's going on, I can't wait to
[02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:37.260]  see them try and argue, I shouldn't have a flag that says FIsis, in France.
[02:57:37.260 --> 02:57:41.700]  It's amazing, Tommy, we've just got about 30 seconds left, tell people how they can
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:44.300]  get your book, how they can find you on Twitter.
[02:57:44.300 --> 02:57:48.260]  You can buy my book currently on Amazon, it's Tommy Robinson, Enemy of the State, it's
[02:57:48.260 --> 02:57:52.180]  on Kindle, you can download it in America, you can download it wherever you are, it's
[02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:56.980]  the story of my life, it tells the story of the state and the persecution that I face
[02:57:56.980 --> 02:58:01.300]  for trying to tell the truth and identify it, and warn people of what we're now facing
[02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:06.780]  on a daily routine, I try to warn prior to that, and you can follow me on Twitter, Tommy
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:08.260]  Robinson, New Year.
[02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:13.860]  Okay, there goes Tommy Robinson, thanks for joining us, get the book, again, it's Enemy
[02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:19.060]  of the State, support Tommy, he's been harassed so much by police, simply for speaking out
[02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:21.700]  against the religion of peace.
[02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:25.340]  That's going to wrap it up for today's edition of the Alex Jones Show, remember, tomorrow
[02:58:25.340 --> 02:58:33.260]  is Operation Sleeping Giant, our historic 28-hour broadcast, all the information at infowars.com
[02:58:33.260 --> 02:58:37.620]  forward slash giant, that's going to wrap up the show, thanks for joining us again, Breaking
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:38.620]  News, infowars.com.

[02:58:49.220 --> 02:58:55.740]  We're selling a product, DNA force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce,
[02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:58.940]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:02.380]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:04.580]  it's very, very important.
[02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:11.220]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:59:11.220 --> 02:59:13.500]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:59:13.500 --> 02:59:15.580]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:59:15.580 --> 02:59:21.380]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials, it's one of the most effective
[02:59:21.380 --> 02:59:26.740]  substances in the world, it works like an antioxidant, it works to repair nerve growth
[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:27.740]  factor.
[02:59:27.740 --> 02:59:31.580]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount, it's in powder form.

[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:32.180]  This is the Overdrive segment, the fourth hour, and I have a lot of hot news for you here
[03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:33.180]  today.
[03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:35.820]  There's many things that we want to discuss, we want to talk about what's going on at the
[03:00:35.820 --> 03:00:40.820]  DNC, we want to talk about terror attacks, we want to talk about media and propaganda
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:44.220]  stuff, but first we want to talk about the exact opposite of that, we're going to talk
[03:00:44.220 --> 03:00:50.340]  about Operation Sleeping Giant, that's going to be our 28-hour broadcast that starts tomorrow,
[03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:53.540]  11 a.m. Central with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:59.100]  Now to tell you about this, this is a fundraiser, this is a huge sale, you can get a lot of
[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:04.940]  great products for a great discount, you can get BrainForce for 40% off, Survival Shield

[03:01:15.460 --> 03:01:20.180]  David Knight, Joe Biggs, Darren McBreen, everybody here in the crew as well as many
[03:01:20.180 --> 03:01:21.180]  special guests.
[03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:24.780]  I know Leanne has a special guest, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk about it yet,
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:30.060]  but I'll say it's a rather smashing interview that should be rather impactful if you happen
[03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:34.020]  to be walking through a pumpkin patch, and I'll leave that at that.
[03:01:34.020 --> 03:01:39.140]  So audio guy, can you take my voice out of my head please, thank you so much.
[03:01:39.140 --> 03:01:44.740]  So with that said, I personally will be on the air from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. and this is
[03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:45.980]  going to be tomorrow.
[03:01:45.980 --> 03:01:52.340]  Also I'll be back at 2.30 a.m. with Margaret Howell and 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. with Gerald
[03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:56.460]  Salente or more accurately he'll be hosting the show and I'll be riding shotgun with him.
[03:01:56.460 --> 03:02:00.100]  So you can tune in and see all that coming up tomorrow, you definitely do not want to
[03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:05.140]  miss it, it's a great opportunity not only to see the show but also to support the broadcast
[03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:09.220]  and it's your contribution, it's your support that make everything possible because this
[03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:14.700]  room I'm sitting in right now, when I first started here four years ago, this was just
[03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:18.740]  a basic room, it looked like a regular office building, this is where the reporters were
[03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:22.580]  stationed, the producers were stationed, and now it's this big massive studio and it's
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:27.060]  your contributions, your support that make this broadcast possible, so thank you and
[03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:29.660]  definitely keep that in mind when it comes to tomorrow.
[03:02:29.660 --> 03:02:34.340]  Now let's get into some other news and we're going to talk about, you guys remember the
[03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:37.420]  Center for Medical Progress, said the group that were putting out the Planned Parenthood
[03:02:37.420 --> 03:02:41.980]  videos, they were going in filming these people, getting them to say that or allowing them
[03:02:41.980 --> 03:02:46.940]  to say more accurately that they plan to use the proceeds from these abortions to buy Lamborghinis,
[03:02:46.940 --> 03:02:50.780]  all types of atrocious things that were going on with that.
[03:02:50.780 --> 03:02:55.380]  Now we see that the last charge has been dismissed against the duo who made the anti-planned
[03:02:55.380 --> 03:03:00.260]  parenthood videos, and this is a report from CVS, it says a district judge dismissed the
[03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:06.460]  tampering with government records charge upon request of the Harris County Prosecutor's
[03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:08.460]  Office.
[03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:13.100]  Now the thing about this was, it's a kill the messenger of kind of society, whether
[03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:19.220]  you're talking about Snowden or Assange or Bradley Manning, and of course in some cases
[03:03:19.220 --> 03:03:23.660]  they put out maybe more information than they should have as far as government secrets
[03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:28.460]  would Bradley Manning and things to that nature, but it still lets go after the person who
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:32.300]  put out the information, not the people who are actually doing the deeds, it's the same
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:38.100]  thing that we see with the Center for Medical Progress, because we see that initially Texas
[03:03:38.100 --> 03:03:42.820]  authorities, they were doing an investigation of Planned Parenthood with the fetal tissue
[03:03:42.820 --> 03:03:45.980]  and all the things that they had going on, and then they dropped that to go after these
[03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:51.540]  guys, but fortunately their last charge has been dropped because they were charging them,
[03:03:51.540 --> 03:03:58.460]  what was it, with tampering with documents, fraudulent documents, basically they were
[03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:02.820]  saying that they entered the facilities with a fake ID or something to that sort, and they
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:07.780]  wanted to charge them for misleading people by using the fake ID, I'm like okay, so let's
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:11.820]  say for the sake of argument they did do that, they're in a facility exposing how people
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:16.420]  are using proceeds from fetal tissue to go buy Lamborghinis and you don't see anything
[03:04:16.420 --> 03:04:21.780]  wrong with that, but thus is society, but granted they did drop and dismiss it, so good
[03:04:21.780 --> 03:04:25.940]  job to those guys over there at the Center for Medical Progress, and from what I understand
[03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:28.980]  they actually had more videos, so they had more stuff that they wanted to release that
[03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:32.300]  just wasn't released for whatever reason, now stay tuned after this break we'll have
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:36.380]  more special reports, we'll have some clips from the guys at the DNC, I have some stuff
[03:04:36.380 --> 03:04:41.780]  about terror attacks, about media propaganda, how they're running the spin cycle and overdrive,
[03:04:41.780 --> 03:04:46.900]  could you just confuse you to manipulate you to get you to believe their narrative, meanwhile
[03:04:46.900 --> 03:04:50.420]  there are real true stories that are going on that aren't getting exposed because of
[03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:59.700]  all this bull, so stay tuned right after this for more special reports.
[03:04:59.700 --> 03:05:05.580]  A new study suggests that tattoo ink may be toxic, reports Fox News, getting inked may
[03:05:05.580 --> 03:05:11.020]  lead to long term skin problems and an increased risk of cancer, according to a new report
[03:05:11.020 --> 03:05:16.140]  by the European Chemicals Agency, researchers found red ink was the most dangerous, but
[03:05:16.140 --> 03:05:21.940]  they warned blue, green and black ink is also risky, the most severe concerns are allergies
[03:05:21.940 --> 03:05:27.420]  caused by substances in the ink and possible carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductive toxic
[03:05:27.420 --> 03:05:32.580]  effects, the report stated, it's also being reported that governments in the EU do not
[03:05:32.580 --> 03:05:38.060]  regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food, and many shops operate without government
[03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:43.180]  regulations, in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates chemicals
[03:05:43.180 --> 03:05:48.620]  and products including tattoo ink, cosmetics and color additives, but due to other public
[03:05:48.620 --> 03:05:54.220]  health priorities, the FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo inks and pigments, you can
[03:05:54.220 --> 03:06:14.900]  find more reports on infowars.com.
[03:06:14.900 --> 03:06:31.140]  And now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[03:06:31.140 --> 03:06:36.220]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[03:06:36.220 --> 03:06:59.300]  from what I recommend doing a parasite, at least twice a year.
[03:06:59.300 --> 03:07:13.900]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[03:07:13.900 --> 03:07:26.260]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.

[03:08:16.260 --> 03:08:21.260]  And welcome back to the 4th hour.
[03:08:21.260 --> 03:08:24.260]  This is the Alex Jones show and I am your host, Jakari Jackson.
[03:08:24.260 --> 03:08:27.260]  Now let's talk about the terror attacks that are going on worldwide.
[03:08:27.260 --> 03:08:30.260]  It seems that there's just no end in sight.
[03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:33.260]  You know, you get one, then you get another one, then you get another one, then you get
[03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:34.260]  another one.
[03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:37.260]  And everybody wants to talk about the violence here in the United States.
[03:08:37.260 --> 03:08:41.260]  And yes, we do have a violence problem, whether it's the citizens or the police, police
[03:08:41.260 --> 03:08:42.260]  the citizens too.
[03:08:42.260 --> 03:08:44.260]  I understand that, but I'm trying to make that distinction here.
[03:08:44.260 --> 03:08:48.260]  But you also have legitimate terror attacks that are going on on the other side of the
[03:08:48.260 --> 03:08:50.260]  planet that people really don't want to give much credence to.
[03:08:50.260 --> 03:08:56.260]  And as Paul Joseph Watson was discussing earlier with his guests, as bad as these things are,
[03:08:56.260 --> 03:09:00.260]  you know, the priests who got beheaded recently next week, people are just going to forget
[03:09:00.260 --> 03:09:01.260]  all about it.
[03:09:01.260 --> 03:09:03.260]  It's going to be like it never even happened.
[03:09:03.260 --> 03:09:05.260]  And that's the very sad thing about these type of attacks.
[03:09:05.260 --> 03:09:07.260]  Let's start here with this article.
[03:09:07.260 --> 03:09:12.260]  French terrorist suspect beheading the priest or suspected of beheading the priest, excuse
[03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:15.260]  me, was allowed to roam unsupervised.
[03:09:15.260 --> 03:09:21.260]  And it turns out one of the attackers who killed and beheaded a 86 year old Catholic priest
[03:09:21.260 --> 03:09:23.260]  was a convicted terrorist.
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:29.260]  Now, the thing I want to point out in this article, great article by Kurt Nemo, is that
[03:09:29.260 --> 03:09:34.260]  this man is a convicted terrorist, not even a suspected terrorist, a convicted terrorist.
[03:09:34.260 --> 03:09:39.260]  And they were basically putting him under house arrest with an ankle monitor.
[03:09:39.260 --> 03:09:46.260]  It blows my mind that they would do this with a suspected terrorist because I used to work
[03:09:46.260 --> 03:09:47.260]  in a jail.
[03:09:47.260 --> 03:09:52.260]  And the people who got ankle monitors were like maybe a person at your somebody who stole
[03:09:52.260 --> 03:09:56.260]  some stuff at Walmart, you know, just really petty offenses that nobody got hurt in.
[03:09:56.260 --> 03:10:01.260]  This guy is a known terrorist, but they are going to put him basically on the honor system
[03:10:01.260 --> 03:10:04.260]  and say, please stay home with your parents.
[03:10:04.260 --> 03:10:07.260]  Don't go out and kill anybody so we can keep you under surveillance.
[03:10:07.260 --> 03:10:11.260]  The man is a known terrorist and you expect him not to cut off that ankle monitor.
[03:10:11.260 --> 03:10:14.260]  But this is the type of world we live in.
[03:10:14.260 --> 03:10:19.260]  And Nemo points out the attack occurred despite extraordinary surveillance and police state
[03:10:19.260 --> 03:10:24.260]  measures imposed on the country following the attacks in Paris in November and an earlier
[03:10:24.260 --> 03:10:26.260]  attack on Charlie Hebdo.
[03:10:26.260 --> 03:10:31.260]  So as we see, these attacks continue to happen against a largely dishonor populace.
[03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:34.260]  And every time it happened, there's like, oh, we didn't know how this happened.
[03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:38.260]  We're so surprised. We're so shocked. I'm like, well, they keep happening and they keep happening
[03:10:38.260 --> 03:10:39.260]  and they keep happening.
[03:10:39.260 --> 03:10:43.260]  At what point are you going to realize that you have a problem with the terrorist in your
[03:10:43.260 --> 03:10:44.260]  country?
[03:10:44.260 --> 03:10:49.260]  And but this is a more straightforward article than I've seen in other places because at
[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:52.260]  least they're admitting that these terror attacks are happening.
[03:10:52.260 --> 03:10:54.260]  I cover this article last week and have it pulled up here.
[03:10:54.260 --> 03:10:56.260]  This is a CNN whitewash.
[03:10:56.260 --> 03:11:01.260]  And this is why a case in the point example why I don't go off press releases because
[03:11:01.260 --> 03:11:05.260]  we go to these events and you get one from a senator or from congressmen or the police
[03:11:05.260 --> 03:11:09.260]  and they say, we want you to regurgitate this to your viewers and tell them our version of
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:10.260]  what happened.
[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:15.260]  And as I can tell you from being on the scene in many of these examples, situations, scenarios
[03:11:15.260 --> 03:11:22.260]  around the country, what the police report says, what the press release says isn't always
[03:11:22.260 --> 03:11:23.260]  exactly that accurate.
[03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:25.260]  And this is one of those reasons.
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:29.260]  Rebels in Syria call boys beheading a mistake.
[03:11:29.260 --> 03:11:36.260]  So basically the western back Syrian rebels, which we've been funding, aiding, arming, making
[03:11:36.260 --> 03:11:42.260]  excuses for, we continue to make excuses for because a group of rebels, Syrian rebels, quote
[03:11:42.260 --> 03:11:46.260]  unquote, many of them have sworn their allegiance to al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations,
[03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:48.260]  but let's not go too deep into that.
[03:11:48.260 --> 03:11:54.260]  They went into a village and they rounded up a group of men that they said were anti-fighters
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:11:55.260]  were fighting against them.
[03:11:55.260 --> 03:11:59.260]  One of the people that they rounded up was a little boy, which in CNN's own report could
[03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:02.260]  have been as young as 10 years old.
[03:12:02.260 --> 03:12:09.260]  They then proceeded to saw the boys head off with a knife.
[03:12:09.260 --> 03:12:13.260]  And the gentleman you see on your screen right there is a representative from the State Department.
[03:12:13.260 --> 03:12:19.260]  And he's like, well, we'll look into it and we're allowing the Syrian rebels to investigate
[03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:20.260]  themselves.
[03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:22.260]  At one point, a reporter jumps up.
[03:12:22.260 --> 03:12:27.260]  He says, Mr. State Department man, if it comes out that it is true and accurate that your
[03:12:27.260 --> 03:12:32.260]  western back Syrian rebels did cut this boy's head off, will you stop your funding to the
[03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:34.260]  Syrian rebels in that gentleman right there?
[03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:37.260]  He said, quote, it would give us pause.
[03:12:37.260 --> 03:12:42.260]  It would give us pause if we found out the Syrian rebels that saw the somebody's head off,
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:44.260]  a little boy's head off on video.
[03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:47.260]  It would give us pause to continue to fund them.
[03:12:47.260 --> 03:12:48.260]  We're going to stop funding them.
[03:12:48.260 --> 03:12:50.260]  We're going to go attack them, not anything else.
[03:12:50.260 --> 03:12:54.260]  It would give us pause to think about it in such a way.
[03:12:54.260 --> 03:12:59.260]  And the rebels who did the killing of the young man, the little boy, they said it was
[03:12:59.260 --> 03:13:00.260]  an individual mistake.
[03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:06.260]  That is a quote, is a individual mistake that they held a boy down and cut his head off.
[03:13:06.260 --> 03:13:11.260]  And then they had the heads at CNN just regurgitate the talking, the press release.
[03:13:11.260 --> 03:13:14.260]  And I'd like to think of the person who wrote this article didn't like it.
[03:13:14.260 --> 03:13:17.260]  They were just trying to, you know, play it straight down the middle, but there's times
[03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:22.260]  you can't, you just can't do that because the news is so egregious.
[03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:27.260]  And I would not want to vouch for the people who made this quote mistake or the State
[03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:35.260]  Department who came out with just a very milk toast lackluster response to this very sinister crime.
[03:13:35.260 --> 03:13:39.260]  And this isn't anything new because as we've pointed out, whether it's the Syrian rebels
[03:13:39.260 --> 03:13:44.260]  or other groups, the people who just killed the priests the other day, these attacks continue to happen.
[03:13:44.260 --> 03:13:48.260]  They've been happening for a very long time, but they're just now starting to get the media attention
[03:13:48.260 --> 03:13:49.260]  that they deserve.
[03:13:49.260 --> 03:13:51.260]  We've given you several articles.
[03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:55.260]  Apologize for watching, leave the charge on that about these groups that are going into villages.
[03:13:55.260 --> 03:13:56.260]  They're killing the priests.
[03:13:56.260 --> 03:13:58.260]  They're burning down the churches.
[03:13:58.260 --> 03:14:01.260]  They're knocking down the monuments and so on and so on and so on.
[03:14:01.260 --> 03:14:03.260]  And this has been going on for a number of years.
[03:14:03.260 --> 03:14:08.260]  But as I said, it's just now starting to get some traction in the media.
[03:14:08.260 --> 03:14:13.260]  And as we talk about the media propaganda machine, one of the things that's really hot and heavy right now
[03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:19.260]  is trying to blame Russia for the hacks at the DNC and Assange has come out and countered this.
[03:14:19.260 --> 03:14:22.260]  And he says it's nothing but media propaganda.
[03:14:22.260 --> 03:14:24.260]  This article from the site.
[03:14:24.260 --> 03:14:30.260]  The establishment media has virtually ignored the revelations contained in the WikiLeaks DNC email hack
[03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:36.260]  and has instead pushed the accusation Russia is attempting to influence the U.S. election.
[03:14:36.260 --> 03:14:43.260]  A Monday WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told NBC News there's no proof whatsoever his outfit received
[03:14:43.260 --> 03:14:47.260]  the 20,000 plus DNC emails from the Russians.
[03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:51.260]  The real story is what these emails contain.
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:58.260]  And they show collusion at the top of the Democratic Party to derail Sanders' campaign, he said.
[03:14:58.260 --> 03:15:01.260]  In a very similar way, it reminded me of the Sony hack.
[03:15:01.260 --> 03:15:07.260]  You guys recall that hack that was supposedly done by North Korea because of the movie, the interview.
[03:15:07.260 --> 03:15:13.260]  You know, it was just so offensive that they had to hack into Sony's server and stop this move from coming out.
[03:15:13.260 --> 03:15:20.260]  But if you recall, I have this throwback article, FBI busted falsely blaming North Korea for Sony hack.
[03:15:20.260 --> 03:15:25.260]  And this is what I was talking about with the media manipulation, whether it's with the Russians or somebody else.
[03:15:25.260 --> 03:15:27.260]  There's always some boogeyman out there.
[03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:35.260]  And this article says, here's a sample of top cybersecurity experts who say that North Korea was not behind the Sony hack.
[03:15:35.260 --> 03:15:37.260]  And we have Peter Singer.
[03:15:37.260 --> 03:15:44.260]  He's one of the nation's foremost experts in cybersecurity, renowned hacker and DEFCON organizer, Mark Rogers,
[03:15:44.260 --> 03:15:52.260]  John Dixon, former Air Force Intelligence officer, cyber risk consulting company, risk-based security,
[03:15:52.260 --> 03:15:57.260]  Kim Zetter, who works for Wired and on and on and on the list goes.
[03:15:57.260 --> 03:16:00.260]  But once again, they tell you that it was North Korea.
[03:16:00.260 --> 03:16:03.260]  They tell you that it's the Russians because those are the boogeyman at the time.
[03:16:03.260 --> 03:16:05.260]  By no means making excuses for those people.
[03:16:05.260 --> 03:16:09.260]  All those groups have various issues and things that need to be dealt with.
[03:16:09.260 --> 03:16:13.260]  But I'm one of those people you blame the person who actually did the crime.
[03:16:13.260 --> 03:16:15.260]  You know, say, I don't like this person.
[03:16:15.260 --> 03:16:21.260]  So I'm going to pin something else on them because it'd be a situation, say, a bank robbery, for example.
[03:16:21.260 --> 03:16:26.260]  Right. So you don't know who did the bank robbery, but you know, you know, Joe down the street.
[03:16:26.260 --> 03:16:32.260]  He's a bad character, you know, bad actor, been up to some stuff all these years and then you go blaming on him.
[03:16:32.260 --> 03:16:35.260]  Well, even if you are happy, you got Joe off the street.
[03:16:35.260 --> 03:16:40.260]  You still got the guys who actually robbed the bank running around free and easy and they're not looking over their shoulder
[03:16:40.260 --> 03:16:43.260]  because they know that nobody is looking for them.
[03:16:43.260 --> 03:16:46.260]  And those are the type of things that you have to deal with when you go through the media cycle.
[03:16:46.260 --> 03:16:50.260]  It's all types of things, all types of propaganda, things you have to deal with.
[03:16:50.260 --> 03:16:56.260]  The lies, the disinformation, just as we were talking about with the Syrian rebels beheading the boy.
[03:16:56.260 --> 03:16:58.260]  It's a complete spin cycle.
[03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:01.260]  And then somebody was showing me this article earlier today. I forgot to print it out.
[03:17:01.260 --> 03:17:07.260]  But there was the attack of the Syrian man with the suicide bomb.
[03:17:07.260 --> 03:17:09.260]  He went to some music festival.
[03:17:09.260 --> 03:17:13.260]  I can't recall exactly where it was blew himself up, injured 15 or so people.
[03:17:13.260 --> 03:17:19.260]  And then the whitewash article was a Syrian rebel or Syrian refugee was killed in a bomb blast.
[03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:25.260]  I'm like, that is technically accurate, but you left out the part where he assembled the bomb and then blew himself up.
[03:17:25.260 --> 03:17:27.260]  Oh, there it is. You guys got it right there.
[03:17:27.260 --> 03:17:31.260]  So he tried to spin it and make it seem like he was the victim.
[03:17:31.260 --> 03:17:37.260]  He's a victim of his own stupidity, I guess you could say, but he blew himself up on purpose.
[03:17:37.260 --> 03:17:39.260]  So I don't see how you could spin that.
[03:17:39.260 --> 03:17:46.260]  But this is just the political correctness of the world we live in where they say Syrian migrant ties in German blasts.
[03:17:46.260 --> 03:17:50.260]  It kind of killed yourself in that situation.
[03:17:50.260 --> 03:17:54.260]  And these are the things that they want you to believe the whitewashers that go on out there.
[03:17:54.260 --> 03:17:58.260]  This is why you have to have a very well rounded view of the news.
[03:17:58.260 --> 03:18:03.260]  And get your news from multiple sources because not everybody's going to be right all the time.
[03:18:03.260 --> 03:18:09.260]  So I do encourage people to go to various sources, look around at different articles on different sites,
[03:18:09.260 --> 03:18:16.260]  see what this, what New York Times says versus Washington Post versus whoever and try to see are their consistencies
[03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:22.260]  or in some cases they just do the straight talking point thing like don't get something from Reuters or AP or whatever else.
[03:18:22.260 --> 03:18:26.260]  And they'll just rebranded just put their own headline on it. I'm not talking about that.
[03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:31.260]  I'm talking about if different people are writing it, try to see if there are other angles and aspects to it.
[03:18:31.260 --> 03:18:39.260]  A case in point, when you talk about the 1993 World Trade Attack, 1993, they wanted to blame it on the guy.
[03:18:39.260 --> 03:18:43.260]  But he said, no, I have the tapes. I have the tapes of me talking to the FBI.
[03:18:43.260 --> 03:18:46.260]  Many people didn't know that until the guy came out with the tapes.
[03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:49.260]  And I believe it was on CBS and New York Times or something like that.
[03:18:49.260 --> 03:18:54.260]  And this is why you have to have a very wide view of the news because I have meet people and say,
[03:18:54.260 --> 03:18:57.260]  well, how do you know what to believe? Really just do your research.
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:19:03.260]  You try to find who you consider to be reputable and reputable isn't just because they work for agency X.
[03:19:03.260 --> 03:19:08.260]  I mean, I'm sure there are some good things that come out of CNN, but the one I just told you about isn't one of them.
[03:19:08.260 --> 03:19:14.260]  So you try to find people that you find reputable and then from that aspect, you try to look at the stories,
[03:19:14.260 --> 03:19:18.260]  find consistencies, inconsistencies and see the State Department's driving it.
[03:19:18.260 --> 03:19:24.260]  If somebody who has some skin in the game, so to speak, is the one putting out the article or trying to influence the narrative.
[03:19:24.260 --> 03:19:26.260]  And that's just a little brief piece of that.
[03:19:26.260 --> 03:19:29.260]  Now, when we come back after this break, we'll be talking about the DNC.
[03:19:29.260 --> 03:19:37.260]  We'll have some special reports, some videos that's going on up there because they have all these celebrities coming out to support Mrs. Clinton.
[03:19:37.260 --> 03:19:41.260]  And then on the opposite side, they have people who aren't supporting Mrs. Clinton.
[03:19:41.260 --> 03:19:45.260]  Those people aren't really making the headlines like the people who are just towing the party line.
[03:19:45.260 --> 03:19:51.260]  And even the Bernie Bros are filling the burn because now the guy who told him that he was anti-establishment,
[03:19:51.260 --> 03:19:55.260]  he wasn't with the big banks is saying, you need to support the person who is with the big banks.
[03:19:55.260 --> 03:19:58.260]  We'll have that coming up right after this break.
[03:20:25.260 --> 03:20:27.260]  We'll see you in the next one.
[03:20:55.260 --> 03:21:10.260]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[03:24:37.260 --> 03:24:42.260]  It is the Supercell Fundraiser. It kicks off tomorrow at 11am.
[03:24:42.260 --> 03:24:49.260]  It is a 28 hour broadcast, live broadcast. You can catch, of course, Alex, myself, Rob Do, Leanne, Darren McBreen,
[03:24:49.260 --> 03:24:53.260]  the guys out there in the field, David Knight, Joe Biggs, and so many more.
[03:24:53.260 --> 03:24:58.260]  We're going to be joining us on that broadcast. In addition to all the great content that you're going to get live,

[03:25:04.260 --> 03:25:10.260]  20% off of Survival Shield X2, and also 20% off of Supermail Vitality.
[03:25:10.260 --> 03:25:17.260]  That's just the beginning. You definitely don't want to miss all the great things we have coming up for you in that broadcast tomorrow.
[03:25:17.260 --> 03:25:20.260]  Now let's talk about the DNC.
[03:25:20.260 --> 03:25:25.260]  In the DNC, it's a little bit different from the RNC because you go out to the RNC,
[03:25:25.260 --> 03:25:30.260]  you see people fighting, shoving in the crowds, all this kind of stuff.
[03:25:30.260 --> 03:25:36.260]  A lot of different types of people. I don't know the best way to say it when you go to the DNC
[03:25:36.260 --> 03:25:40.260]  because when you go to the DNC, you meet all these anti-Hillary people.
[03:25:40.260 --> 03:25:46.260]  You go to the RNC, you had a lot of pro-Trump people, but DNC, you have the anti-Hillary people.
[03:25:46.260 --> 03:25:49.260]  You have the Bernie bros, so to speak.
[03:25:49.260 --> 03:25:52.260]  And many of the Bernie bros are feeling the burn because they're saying,
[03:25:52.260 --> 03:25:59.260]  hey, I want to back Bernie Sanders because he was this guy who was going to come in and be different from everybody else.
[03:25:59.260 --> 03:26:03.260]  He wasn't going to take money from the big banks. He was going to fight for the little guy.
[03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:11.260]  And now they're seeing him shift to pushing this big establishment candidate who does take money from the big banks.
[03:26:11.260 --> 03:26:14.260]  And you have the Bernie Sanders people. I keep seeing these articles.
[03:26:14.260 --> 03:26:20.260]  They're wearing the Hillary for Prison t-shirt or they have the chant, lock Hillary up.
[03:26:20.260 --> 03:26:25.260]  And we have the Sanders campaign manager saying, stop chanting, lock her up.
[03:26:25.260 --> 03:26:29.260]  And he says, I know emotions are running high now.
[03:26:29.260 --> 03:26:40.260]  But I think people really have to consider the implications of what a Trump presidency would mean to those who support the kind of agenda that Bernie Sanders has laid out for the country.
[03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:45.260]  It's so funny to me. They're so adamant about booing Mrs. Clinton.
[03:26:45.260 --> 03:26:50.260]  These people are so upset that they are going out there and they're chanting.
[03:26:50.260 --> 03:26:53.260]  They're telling people to get off the stage. They're booing people off the stage.
[03:26:53.260 --> 03:26:58.260]  And we have some of these people right here because when you go to the DNC, they have this very long list of celebrities.
[03:26:58.260 --> 03:27:00.260]  I'm sure more coming up. They had a big list.
[03:27:00.260 --> 03:27:07.260]  It was Lena Dunham and Snoop Dogg and Eva Longoria, Sarah Silver, who we have this article right here.
[03:27:07.260 --> 03:27:12.260]  Sarah Silverman gets booed at the DNC for telling Bernie Sanders supporters that they're ridiculous.
[03:27:12.260 --> 03:27:15.260]  And we have that video coming up. You guys can get that ready to run.
[03:27:15.260 --> 03:27:21.260]  So basically you have this famous comedian movies, TV shows, all that kind of stuff.
[03:27:21.260 --> 03:27:26.260]  And in the spirit of the DNC of booing the people who support Mrs. Clinton,
[03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:29.260]  the Bernie Sanders supporters booed Sarah Silverman.
[03:27:29.260 --> 03:27:35.260]  And she wasn't very happy about this, but she's just one of the many people who have been booed at this event.
[03:27:35.260 --> 03:27:40.260]  We have also clips of Elizabeth Warren, of course, Bernie Sanders himself.
[03:27:40.260 --> 03:27:44.260]  And we'll get those all ready for you in just one second.
[03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:46.260]  So you go to the DNC.
[03:27:46.260 --> 03:27:51.260]  And in addition to the people who are supporting Bernie Sanders, you have many people who are not.
[03:27:51.260 --> 03:27:54.260]  Susan Sarandon, who's been a long time activist on various things.
[03:27:54.260 --> 03:27:56.260]  I don't agree with them all at all.
[03:27:56.260 --> 03:28:03.260]  But she's taken to the DNC to say that, hey, I'm not supporting this woman just for the fact that she is a woman.
[03:28:03.260 --> 03:28:05.260]  Also, you have people like Rosario Dawson.
[03:28:05.260 --> 03:28:10.260]  She's been in Sin City and Daredevil, many other movies and TV shows as well.
[03:28:10.260 --> 03:28:14.260]  And she's saying, no, I guess for lack of a better term, a Bernie bro.
[03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:16.260]  She wanted to show her support for Bernie Sanders.
[03:28:16.260 --> 03:28:18.260]  She was a diehard Sanders supporter.
[03:28:18.260 --> 03:28:24.260]  And now she's feeling that burn because she has to go to the DNC and be told by people like Sarah Silverman
[03:28:24.260 --> 03:28:28.260]  that she's supposed to support the Democratic candidate no matter what.
[03:28:28.260 --> 03:28:35.260]  And though I don't agree with all the Sanders supporters, I don't agree with many Sanders policies.
[03:28:35.260 --> 03:28:39.260]  The things that he said, self-proclaimed Democratic socialists.
[03:28:39.260 --> 03:28:46.260]  But I do respect the fact that these people are not blindly pushing the Democratic party line.
[03:28:46.260 --> 03:28:52.260]  They're not going to say that I'm going to vote for anybody on a straight ticket just because they're in my party or supposed party.
[03:28:52.260 --> 03:28:56.260]  I'm going to vote for the person who I think is best for the nation.
[03:28:56.260 --> 03:29:00.260]  And that's what you see when you look at celebrities like Rosario Dawson and other people as well.
[03:29:00.260 --> 03:29:05.260]  I may not agree with the politics, but I do respect the fact that they're standing up for what they truly believe in.
[03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:09.260]  Do you guys have those clips ready?
[03:29:09.260 --> 03:29:12.260]  Okay, I go ahead and roll those.
[03:29:12.260 --> 03:29:21.260]  And we have God to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim King.
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:30.260]  He's like stressing the crowd like a college professor.
[03:29:30.260 --> 03:29:34.260]  He's not liking it. There's people in the background telling everybody to be quiet.
[03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:38.260]  There's people in the crowd putting their thumbs down. They don't want anything to do with this.
[03:29:38.260 --> 03:29:46.260]  Brothers and sisters, I've sold you out to the establishment.
[03:29:46.260 --> 03:29:48.260]  You need to vote for Mrs. Clinton.
[03:29:48.260 --> 03:29:49.260]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.260 --> 03:29:52.260]  And the Empire is on the run. We'll be back right after this.
[03:29:52.260 --> 03:30:20.260]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:20.260 --> 03:30:24.260]  Defense attorneys said their clients should have never been indicted.
[03:30:24.260 --> 03:30:29.260]  If they had been convicted of the felony charge, each could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.
[03:30:29.260 --> 03:30:36.260]  Prosecutors alleged that the defendants used fake driver's licenses to conceal their identities while dealing with Planned Parenthood.
[03:30:36.260 --> 03:30:44.260]  The defendants, who founded a group called Center for Medical Progress, previously rejected plea deals offering them probation.
[03:30:44.260 --> 03:30:51.260]  A grand jury initially began investigating Planned Parenthood, but the group was cleared of misusing fetal tissue.
[03:30:51.260 --> 03:31:17.260]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com.

[03:31:55.260 --> 03:32:15.260]  Hi everyone, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:15.260 --> 03:32:44.260]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids that needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfowarsTeam.com.

[03:32:51.260 --> 03:33:18.260]  On the web at InfowarsTeam.com. That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:26.260]  So, let's talk politics because I know you care deeply and you've been a Bernie supporter.
[03:33:26.260 --> 03:33:32.260]  Yes, I am a Bernie supporter.
[03:33:32.260 --> 03:33:37.260]  So I tell you this, I will vote for Hillary with gusto.
[03:33:37.260 --> 03:33:45.260]  Hillary takes money from banks and big business and super PACs, so did Barack Obama. She's no different than anybody else.
[03:33:45.260 --> 03:33:52.260]  She was the best choice, I thought, considering they all do it. Then someone came along who doesn't take steroids.
[03:33:52.260 --> 03:34:01.260]  Can I just say, to the Bernie or bust people, you're being ridiculous.
[03:34:01.260 --> 03:34:06.260]  He's not for sale, not playing the game, and says what he means.
[03:34:06.260 --> 03:34:17.260]  I am proud to be a part of Bernie's movement and a vital part of that movement is making absolutely sure that Hillary Clinton is our next president of the United States.
[03:34:17.260 --> 03:34:46.260]  Leah, probably.
[03:34:46.260 --> 03:34:51.260]  And that was Sarah Silverman, the comedian.
[03:34:51.260 --> 03:34:56.260]  I'm glad they could fix this in post. I think it's already out there, Sarah.
[03:34:56.260 --> 03:35:04.260]  And that's the mentality that we've seen. These hardcore Bernie people, like I said, I got much respect for people who continue to support them even though I don't support them.
[03:35:04.260 --> 03:35:09.260]  But the people who are switching gears and they're saying that now you have to support Mrs. Clinton because Bernie does.
[03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:15.260]  You can see people are booing Bernie himself, much less a celebrity or supporter like Sarah Silverman.
[03:35:15.260 --> 03:35:22.260]  Now, before we go on to our calls, I know we have people holding, but we have this new report that Alex just shot, and this is emergency.
[03:35:22.260 --> 03:35:31.260]  Hillary plans to steal election from Trump. This is a brand new video, hot video from Alex Jones, and let's play a little bit of that.
[03:35:31.260 --> 03:35:46.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 26th day of July, 2016. In less than 24 hours, we're going to be live for 28 hours with a very special broadcast kicking off at 11 a.m. tomorrow,
[03:35:46.260 --> 03:35:54.260]  carried by radio stations, TV stations and cable stations across the United States, almost 200 radio stations alone.
[03:35:54.260 --> 03:36:03.260]  But anyone can watch at infowars.com forward slash show, also infowars.com forward slash giant.
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:10.260]  It is Operation Sleeping Giant. The Sleeping Giant is already partially awakened.
[03:36:10.260 --> 03:36:17.260]  The information we cover about the globalist takeover of America is now being mainstreamed by Donald Trump here in the U.S.,
[03:36:17.260 --> 03:36:24.260]  Nigel Farage and the British exit movement in Europe and more. Info wars is the tip of the spear.
[03:36:24.260 --> 03:36:30.260]  A lot of people claim to be the tip of the spear. We are the leading edge. You are the tip of the spear.
[03:36:30.260 --> 03:36:34.260]  You are the resistance. Our 28 million viewers and listeners a week.
[03:36:34.260 --> 03:36:42.260]  I'm here on Facebook mentions YouTube and Periscope to break down the fact that I have talked to high levels of the Trump campaign.
[03:36:42.260 --> 03:36:50.260]  I'm not just Roger Stone and they are fully aware of the fact that Hillary has stolen the election from Bernie Sanders.
[03:36:50.260 --> 03:36:57.260]  He was like 25 points ahead of her. He won California, New Hampshire and eight other states by massive points.
[03:36:57.260 --> 03:37:04.260]  They've now stolen that. They've now created super delegates to ignore the voters and the delegates.
[03:37:04.260 --> 03:37:17.260]  Trump is surging five to ten points depending on the scientific poll ahead of Hillary as the emails come out and the corruption and the fact that she sent protesters to Trump events to cause violence dressed up as Sanders supporters.
[03:37:17.260 --> 03:37:25.260]  Trump is surging. Even mainline analysts admit the Democratic Party is in full panic right now. Full panic.
[03:37:25.260 --> 03:37:31.260]  They're going to strike back with a staged event, an attempted assassination attempt I think is possible.
[03:37:31.260 --> 03:37:36.260]  Get in the mind of Hillary and her foreign bank, Goldman Sachs handlers. What would you do?
[03:37:36.260 --> 03:37:41.260]  Stage an assassination attempt, a terrorist attack, blaming on Trump supporters.
[03:37:41.260 --> 03:37:51.260]  What would they pull? Because she's imploding. They're booing Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and all of them.
[03:37:51.260 --> 03:37:57.260]  Debbie Washington Schultz when they get up there and push all this garbage. When they say your vote doesn't count.
[03:37:57.260 --> 03:38:04.260]  What are they going to do when upwards of 70, 80% of the people we've talked to were Sanders voters around the country?
[03:38:04.260 --> 03:38:11.260]  They weren't for Hillary. We've done exit polls at 80% in California going for Sanders in LA. Live on TV.
[03:38:11.260 --> 03:38:14.260]  What are they going to do when most of those Sanders voters don't vote for Hillary?
[03:38:14.260 --> 03:38:22.260]  That's the special broadcast from Alex. You can catch the rest of that report on infowars.com talking about Operation Sleeping Giant, which of course kicks off tomorrow.
[03:38:22.260 --> 03:38:27.260]  Let's go to our calls. Let's see who's been holding the longest. I believe it is Cole in Georgia.
[03:38:27.260 --> 03:38:30.260]  Cole, you want to talk about Mrs. Clinton? Go ahead.
[03:38:30.260 --> 03:38:33.260]  Hey, Jocari, what's going on?
[03:38:33.260 --> 03:38:35.260]  How you doing?
[03:38:35.260 --> 03:38:43.260]  I just wanted to see you guys take on what you think about Hillary. What kind of false flag do you think she's not cool?
[03:38:43.260 --> 03:38:47.260]  Do you think it might be like a school shooting?
[03:38:47.260 --> 03:38:55.260]  I'm not so much saying a false flag or anything. I'm more concerned about her agenda if she gets into office.
[03:38:55.260 --> 03:39:01.260]  She's been very blatant about her views on firearms, on personal liberties, things of that nature.
[03:39:01.260 --> 03:39:11.260]  She's been covering up for her husband, I guess that's the best way I could put it, the man who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults,
[03:39:11.260 --> 03:39:17.260]  not consensual stuff with Monica. That's a whole other game. I'm talking about people who said that he held them down and took something from them.
[03:39:17.260 --> 03:39:23.260]  That concerns me very deeply, so I'm more concerned about those type of things.
[03:39:23.260 --> 03:39:33.260]  There's one thing I was talking about too. I heard a little birdie tell me one time about how they got private contractors,
[03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:44.260]  you know, Blackwater, because I mentioned that name, Blackwater, that work in the CIA, they got it in the FBI and the Secret Service, all into there.
[03:39:44.260 --> 03:39:53.260]  Yeah, I mean Blackwater has been caught in some, you know, very murky waters. I believe they changed their name at some point because the situation where they shot some civilians overseas,
[03:39:53.260 --> 03:39:58.260]  so yeah, definitely some tough customers and only time to tell.
[03:39:58.260 --> 03:40:03.260]  Thank you so much, Cole. Let's go now to Michael in Texas. Go ahead, Michael.
[03:40:03.260 --> 03:40:11.260]  Hey, Jakar, your pleasure. I want to talk about how it seems to me, with all due respect to the entire Info Wars team,
[03:40:11.260 --> 03:40:22.260]  that Paul Joseph Watson seems to be the only one that truly gets it. This is not radical Islam. This is fundamental Orthodox Islam.
[03:40:22.260 --> 03:40:32.260]  It has been a 1400 year scourge on this planet. It never had a renaissance, like Christianity is the renaissance to Judaism.
[03:40:32.260 --> 03:40:42.260]  This is fundamental. And you guys, your material supports my claim. You guys put out a very powerful video after the Orlando shooting,
[03:40:42.260 --> 03:40:57.260]  showing the Florida Imam asking his jam-packed Sunni congregation if they were extremists and radicals. They all said no. And he said that the best punishment that we could give human kind is to kill homosexuals and
[03:40:57.260 --> 03:41:11.260]  adulteresses and the like. As a matter of fact, your video was so great that I cut it into an MP3 audio from my morning show, like Topsy, and I played several times because it's so powerful.
[03:41:11.260 --> 03:41:18.260]  This is fundamental Islam. We've got to stop the political correctness and call it what it is.
[03:41:18.260 --> 03:41:29.260]  Well, when you talk about, I know the video you're referencing, and I definitely understand the points you're making with that. The thing that I think everybody has to realize is when you talk about fundamental Islam,
[03:41:29.260 --> 03:41:38.260]  not everybody is participating in these activities. Now, I'm very much aware, like when you say that, the video where he's saying, we're not extremists if you believe X, or it's not extremists if you do that.
[03:41:38.260 --> 03:41:48.260]  The majority of Muslims don't go out and commit these actions that we see these terrorists doing, whether it's the train attacks or the mass shootings or the axe attacks.
[03:41:48.260 --> 03:41:58.260]  Most Muslims, they go home, they do a seemingly normal life. There are those who don't believe it's an extremist ideology, but they do participate in those actions. Yes, I do definitely recognize that.
[03:41:58.260 --> 03:42:13.260]  I want to counter that real quick. First of all, yeah, it's true that not everyone carries it out, but I want to equate that to our support as Americans for the United States military,
[03:42:13.260 --> 03:42:31.260]  but it's the military industrial complex that shoots off American imperialism. Alex Jones had interviewed someone a couple of weeks ago, who brought up pure research, and it shows that 26% of Muslims in America approve of suicide bombings,
[03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:46.260]  22% in France, and those are the only ones that were brave enough to answer the survey honestly. So that is enough to do it, that only a few are carrying out. It is the thought, then you have the action.
[03:42:46.260 --> 03:43:01.260]  So it's support, then it's action, cause and effect. So I disagree with you that it's only a few people. You have a few executioners, but you have many supporters, and that's the bottom line behind this ideology.
[03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:17.260]  It's an evil ideology and should be declassified as a religion and banned in the United States of America or, sir, mark my words, we will be French and Germany. And you heard it here from me, Mike Totsi.
[03:43:17.260 --> 03:43:32.260]  Well, my guy, much of what you just said, I understand the point that you're making. I mean, you made the allusion to the American military. I understand there are many things that I don't agree with them doing, but once again, not everybody's in the military.
[03:43:32.260 --> 03:43:39.260]  So I'm not so much, I wouldn't say I disagree with everything you say. I probably agree with most of what you said there, but I guess it's just a tomato model. You have your views and I have mine.
[03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:41.260]  Is there anything else that you'd like to say?
[03:43:41.260 --> 03:43:59.260]  Yes, I would. Just real quick about Bernie Sanders. I thought he was a riot last night. He said that this collection is about the 1%. Meanwhile, the guy recently endorses the space of the 1%. So I just find that beautiful.
[03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:07.260]  And again, I challenge anyone to watch Hillary's America and then tell me that they can vote Democrat ever again. And that's about it. And I really appreciate your time.
[03:44:07.260 --> 03:44:16.260]  Thank you so much, Michael. All right, let's go on. Well, let me give the number out again if we move on to our next call. The number to call in is 1-800-259-9231.
[03:44:16.260 --> 03:44:24.260]  Once again, it is 1-800-259-9231. Let's go now to Cash in Missouri. Go ahead, Cash.
[03:44:24.260 --> 03:44:26.260]  Hey, Jacarie, how you doing?
[03:44:26.260 --> 03:44:28.260]  You doing good yourself?
[03:44:28.260 --> 03:44:38.260]  Good. Fine, thanks. It's been a while since I saw you. I met you on the Missouri campus at the Thomas Jefferson Statue when you were up here in Missouri.
[03:44:38.260 --> 03:44:51.260]  But I have some ideas to help fund the Hillary for Prison meme. My wife and I are loyal customers of your great products and loyal listeners as well.
[03:44:51.260 --> 03:45:00.260]  But every time we receive an order, we get a bumper sticker that you throw in there for free or two or three sometimes. And I've deployed those very well.
[03:45:00.260 --> 03:45:10.260]  They're on our cars or they're on my truck. I give them away. I wear my Hillary for Prison shirt. And when somebody says, wow, where'd you get that?
[03:45:10.260 --> 03:45:20.260]  I go out to the car and get a bumper sticker that has infowars.com on. I give them a bumper sticker. But why don't you have a Hillary for Prison bumper sticker here?
[03:45:20.260 --> 03:45:33.260]  That is beyond me. That's not my department. I'm sure the guys are listening to this and they may take that under action. But as far as why we do, we don't have X product. That's not my department.
[03:45:33.260 --> 03:45:43.260]  Get to the marketing department because you can sell those for a dollar a piece or you buy a shirt and get one free. But bumper stickers, I mean, I could pass those things out all day long.
[03:45:43.260 --> 03:45:53.260]  That's the first one to buy it under them. Oh, great. Okay. Stickers hat. You know, I'd love to have one of those, you know, those see-through screens you put on your rear mirror or rear window on your pickup truck.
[03:45:53.260 --> 03:45:59.260]  Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I'd love to have the artwork and the Hillary for Prison on the back of my truck.
[03:45:59.260 --> 03:46:04.260]  Okay. I'll definitely pass that along to everybody else. Anything else, Cash?
[03:46:04.260 --> 03:46:10.260]  Nope. I just think you could make tens of thousands of dollars if you were selling bumper stickers for a buck a piece.
[03:46:10.260 --> 03:46:20.260]  Very good. All right. Thank you so much, Cash. All right, let's go on now to who's it? Eric? Is that Mississippi? Hello, Eric.
[03:46:20.260 --> 03:46:24.260]  Hey, what's up, Descartes? Hey, how you doing? You're doing a great job, dude.
[03:46:24.260 --> 03:46:35.260]  Oh, doing pretty good. My question was, you know, at what point does Hillary become a liability to all her backers? I mean, and what would happen if that happened?
[03:46:35.260 --> 03:46:45.260]  It seems like, I mean, we're going to watch her tomorrow or whenever she speaks in her, you know, mousetongue outfit telling us we're all racist.
[03:46:45.260 --> 03:46:52.260]  You know, at what point do the people that are backing her and, you know, helping her, or is she just at the very tip top of it?
[03:46:52.260 --> 03:46:58.260]  Well, I think she's just in that house of cards. And if she goes down, a lot of people go down with her.
[03:46:58.260 --> 03:47:12.260]  And it's to the point where you talk about the things with the election, how she had all the super delegates before, you know, Bernie even, you know, put his pants on to, you know, the crimes of her husband, to the Benghazi thing, to the email thing.
[03:47:12.260 --> 03:47:25.260]  I mean, there's really nothing they won't do to prop up this woman. So I think people just view it as backing a winner because regardless of what she does, you know, it's kind of like, you know, a fixed boxing match or some type of sporting event.
[03:47:25.260 --> 03:47:32.260]  You know, if you hamstring all the horses, and you know, Hillary's horse isn't the best, but you know, it has at least four healthy legs, you may back that.
[03:47:32.260 --> 03:47:43.260]  So I think that's what it is. It's just more people backing somebody who they know is going to get the ultimate backing in the cover ups to be successful in her campaign.
[03:47:43.260 --> 03:47:45.260]  That's just my.
[03:47:45.260 --> 03:48:02.260]  Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Well, man, I got a rebuttal to the dude with about the Muslim. I mean, the Muslim stuff, you know, these people need to understand we need like some Muslim leaders to step up to have a renaissance in Islam.
[03:48:02.260 --> 03:48:05.260]  We can't say that just can't be done. And we got to kill them all.
[03:48:05.260 --> 03:48:20.260]  They ain't going to work. Trump needs to say, look, we'd love to have you here if you're going to be love our people, love this freedom we have. Otherwise, we're not putting up with y'all blowing up crap every other week.
[03:48:20.260 --> 03:48:21.260]  And it's just not going to happen.
[03:48:21.260 --> 03:48:23.260]  It's not going to do it here.
[03:48:23.260 --> 03:48:36.260]  Yeah. And I mean, I definitely don't want to put words in the guy's mouth. You know, I agreed with some of the points he made, you know, I ultimately, you know, I'm not trying to kick people out the country or anything like that. I definitely don't want any type of physical confrontation.
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:47.260]  You know, if it comes to you in a case to case basement basis, then you do what you have to do at that point. But you know, he's welcome to his views and opinions and you have yours just as I have mine.
[03:48:47.260 --> 03:48:55.260]  All right. Well, I think that could be a renaissance with his law. I mean, I really do, which is not has anybody asked him to step have some people step up or, you know,
[03:48:55.260 --> 03:49:05.260]  Well, I think the issue is, you know, just like the video that he was referencing that I was aware of, you know, is a is a big room. I don't know if you saw it of, you know, Muslim men, and they're talking about you.
[03:49:05.260 --> 03:49:12.260]  Do you think this is extreme? Do you think that's extreme? And people are like, No, I'm not extreme. So I think that's very orthodox. So I understand the point he was making.
[03:49:12.260 --> 03:49:23.260]  But the point I was trying to counter with is like, not everybody does these things. There are people who, you know, claim to be Christian and don't go to church or they view church as the other right to get straight to God.
[03:49:23.260 --> 03:49:34.260]  It's much more than that. Just like in the situation we talked about Islam or any other faith, you have people who may self identify with it, but they don't take the the rules of principles within the sacred text all the way to heart.
[03:49:34.260 --> 03:49:44.260]  And that's the point. I guess I made a little more eloquently than I did earlier. Sorry, Eric. I got to cut you off. I got to move real quick. Let's go to Steven in Florida.
[03:49:44.260 --> 03:49:59.260]  Yeah. Hey, I wanted to say this, okay, on the heels of the man that called in and talked about Islam and, you know, your last car and just basically the overall scheme of what info wars covers.
[03:49:59.260 --> 03:50:08.260]  And I mentioned to the screen and I want to talk about basically the overall scheme of politics in America, but this gets into a bigger issue.
[03:50:08.260 --> 03:50:18.260]  You know, Alex's theme is there's a war on to your mind and he uses the term info wars from basically psychological operations in the military.
[03:50:18.260 --> 03:50:33.260]  And we are in a war. I wholeheartedly support info wars. I mean, I give out information from them all the time. I dial out of your product. But the thing is, this is much bigger than a war for people's minds.
[03:50:33.260 --> 03:50:39.260]  This is really a war that's been going on since creation started.
[03:50:39.260 --> 03:50:49.260]  Actually, yeah, since creation started, and that is a war. And then Alex says, oh, it's just one second, one second. See, we have to go to break. I'll come back and let you finish up very fast.
[03:50:49.260 --> 03:50:59.260]  We also have some other college. So just stay right there. We'll be back right after this break here on the Alex Jones show.
[03:50:59.260 --> 03:51:09.260]  Extendivite, a seven herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hotthorn, bilberry, ginkgo bloba, valerian and milk thistle.
[03:51:09.260 --> 03:51:19.260]  Extendivite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal itself. Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they are seeing in their patients health who are taking extendivite.
[03:51:19.260 --> 03:51:31.260]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better. Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patients health, more doctors are calling to order extendivite for themselves.
[03:51:31.260 --> 03:51:40.260]  Help extendivite make your doctor a believer. Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two month supply.

[03:51:58.260 --> 03:52:03.260]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[03:52:03.260 --> 03:52:14.260]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[03:52:14.260 --> 03:52:22.260]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:52:22.260 --> 03:52:29.260]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[03:52:29.260 --> 03:52:32.260]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[03:52:32.260 --> 03:52:40.260]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:52:40.260 --> 03:52:44.260]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.

[03:54:44.260 --> 03:54:55.260]  Now, as Stephen in Florida, I have five callers on the board. I'd like to get to all of them. So if you could maybe take 30 seconds and wrap up your final point, then I'm going to get to Retroactive, Jason, Jim, and Her Valley.
[03:54:55.260 --> 03:54:57.260]  Go ahead, Stephen.
[03:54:57.260 --> 03:55:06.260]  Yeah, what I wanted to say is this. There's a war that's been going on. This is what the war is about. It's a spiritual war between Satan and God.
[03:55:06.260 --> 03:55:14.260]  I don't care if anyone says there is no Satan, there's no God. My Bible says there is. And the bottom line is this, Chikari.
[03:55:14.260 --> 03:55:21.260]  This war is only going to be won if we recognize that we have made God our enemy. That's the main problem.
[03:55:21.260 --> 03:55:31.260]  Not the New World Order. It is God who is allowing our enemies to take over because this nation has turned away from the God of our founding fathers, Jesus Christ.
[03:55:31.260 --> 03:55:44.260]  And the main problem in America is the fake Christianity that is complicit with the world and complacent about the mission God has given them to reach souls with the message of Jesus Christ and stand up against the evil.
[03:55:44.260 --> 03:55:58.260]  And until that turns around, it's going to get worse and worse. I'm going to make a prediction. America is facing a crash and a total collapse, and it's not going to be stopped by Donald Trump or Alex Jones or anyone else.
[03:55:58.260 --> 03:56:06.260]  It's only going to be stopped by Jesus Christ when his people turn back to him. If we don't do that, we are done as a nation.
[03:56:06.260 --> 03:56:13.260]  Alright, thank you so much. I definitely agree that the country is lost spiritually. I will agree with you on that. Thank you so much, Stephen.
[03:56:13.260 --> 03:56:17.260]  Let's go now to Retroactive in Indiana. Go ahead.
[03:56:17.260 --> 03:56:19.260]  Yes, Mr. Chikari, can you hear me?
[03:56:19.260 --> 03:56:21.260]  Yes, very quick.
[03:56:21.260 --> 03:56:37.260]  Alright, I just wanted to talk about and inject some common sense into the talking points of the DNC, trying to say that the Russians, you know, hacked the DNC, saying that their evidence is geography, language, forensic evidence, and motive.
[03:56:37.260 --> 03:56:46.260]  Alright, who's to say when hackers are hacking? Alright, you know, most of them are up at 3am, you know, in our time zone, so that's just ridiculous.
[03:56:46.260 --> 03:56:59.260]  In language, they said that they left a Cyrillic character from an alphabet. Are you serious? I mean, honestly, who's going to leave, you know, leave anything on purpose other than just to kind of offset the blame?
[03:56:59.260 --> 03:57:10.260]  And then the evidence that they said that they had was metadata suggesting that the attack came out of Russia. Okay, so who's going to be hacking from their own, you know, their own computer and their own home state, let alone their own country?
[03:57:10.260 --> 03:57:19.260]  And then you got the motive saying that they've previously tried before. Well, so has China and all these other places that actually go after our infrastructure, right?
[03:57:19.260 --> 03:57:32.260]  And she's saying that Hillary's saying that Trump is dangerous while she's like willy-nilly pointing the finger at Russia. It was like she would start a war just to gain power. That's ridiculous.
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:37.260]  I mean, don't you agree? That's just kind of crazy just to say, oh, they did it.
[03:57:37.260 --> 03:57:46.260]  Oh, yeah, I definitely agree that they need more information. As I was saying earlier with the Sony hack, you know, if somebody could have a VPN or any number of other things to make it show up in some other location.
[03:57:46.260 --> 03:57:53.260]  Sorry, retroactive. We got to move quick. Let's go to Her Valley in Texas. Go ahead.
[03:57:53.260 --> 03:58:05.260]  Good afternoon. So the question that I want to pose is, let me preface by saying that, you know, before the globalists can further their movement, a collapse, economic or social collapse,
[03:58:05.260 --> 03:58:21.260]  which may I add is inevitable, is necessary. The question that I have is do you believe that we're all being played for fools and that if, you know, Trump was to be elected, that he's going to be used as a scapegoat to blame for the fall?
[03:58:21.260 --> 03:58:31.260]  I mean, I've never supported Trump in general. So I'm probably not the best person to ask that question to. I don't expect either candidate or candidates to solve the problems facing the nation right now.
[03:58:31.260 --> 03:58:37.260]  Sorry to our other collars, Jason and Jim, calling tomorrow and you can get to the front of the line. That's it for this episode of the Alex Jones show.
