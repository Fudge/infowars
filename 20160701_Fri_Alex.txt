[00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:18.852]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:23.819]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.975]  I tell you ladies and gentlemen, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:00:45.975 --> 00:01:05.328]  I just screeched into my studio desk like a runner coming into home plate sliding in because it is so incredible.
[00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:07.191]  That's what we're witnessing.
[00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:25.416]  I talked about this yesterday being completely over the top and one of the biggest illustrations of arrogance, hubris-filled, disconnected corruption I've ever seen out of some of the most hubris-filled people in history.
[00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:34.019]  And that of course is the Clintons and their crime machine that has held this country under their iron fist.
[00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.833]  And under their fog of false flags for 20 plus years.
[00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:53.837]  The Attorney General, who we have a whole stack of articles in the past, who says she wants to restrict free speech, she wants to restrict the Second Amendment, she wants to have the UN run our local police departments.
[00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:55.897]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:01:55.897 --> 00:02:05.101]  She stands by while Obama orders the Border Patrol to stand down, which is an act of sedition and treason against basic national security and the Constitution.
[00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:12.950]  She has continued to cover up Fast and Furious and Benghazi and everything else you can imagine.
[00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.055]  The IRS persecution of Christians and conservatives just continues on.
[00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:22.019]  It is truly insane.
[00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.843]  Richard Nixon would be about a 1 on a Richter scale corruption-wise.
[00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:28.085]  And 1 is too much.
[00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:29.186]  Loretta Lynch is about a 580.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.160]  I'm not joking when I use numbers like that.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:44.603]  The open, naked magnitude of persecution that's been going on is so over the top, it's intended to just set the precedent that we're going into a dictatorship.
[00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:55.085]  I had a former senior Secret Service agent on, Mr. Byrne, yesterday, who was with the Clintons for years, and he said, look, she wants to create a socialist dictatorship.
[00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:03.619]  And that's exactly what these people are trying to establish, at least at the governmental level and the citizen level.
[00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:11.002]  Above that, the multinationals will control it from offshore.
[00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:12.403]  But we have them now.
[00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:16.485]  This can bring down the Clemsons like nothing we've ever seen before.
[00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:26.449]  And I do want to get a few of our regular guests just to pop in for like five minutes today to give us a quick statement.
[00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.331]  I want five minutes with Larry Nichols.
[00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.632]  I want five minutes with Roger Stone.
[00:03:32.632 --> 00:03:34.953]  I want five minutes with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:37.415]  Just five minutes.
[00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:38.775]  And others.
[00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:47.240]  To talk about how big a deal this is and to get their perspectives, but... We have a transcript of it.
[00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:56.077]  We're getting it clipped out of the softball interview she just did for about 40 minutes with the Aspen Institute, a globalist organization.
[00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:59.559]  Loretta Lynch's non-recusal recusal.
[00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:04.641]  She said, well, I'm not been involved or going to be involved and I'll take, you know, probably what the FBI director says.
[00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:06.242]  She leaves a proviso in there.
[00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:10.844]  But she goes on to say, but I can't recuse myself because then I won't know what's going on and won't be involved.
[00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:12.285]  Total oxymoronic.
[00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:19.201]  Bizarro land, 2 plus 2 equals 15 type statements.
[00:04:20.646 --> 00:04:21.386]  So we've got that.
[00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.067]  We're going to be going over.
[00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:30.688]  And then here's the really big one up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and DrudgeReport.com is linked to a hot air story on it.
[00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:32.449]  We have an InfoWars.com story.
[00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.190]  Kit Daniels, FBI at Clinton Lynch meeting, ordered press blackout.
[00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.470]  No photos, no videos.
[00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.771]  So this was totally a powwow.
[00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:48.412]  And you notice when I was in there watching her backing it up on the DVR and this talk she just gave that is like 30 minutes ago.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:58.207]  She says to the man, quote, interviewing her with softballs, that, oh, well, she mainly talked about grandkids and, you know, golf and stuff like that.
[00:04:58.207 --> 00:04:59.108]  Mainly!
[00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:00.009]  You talk about guilty.
[00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:05.144]  Does 2016 feel more like 1984 to you?
[00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:15.451]  Life is certainly imitating art, with Uber's announcement that its fleet of more than 1 million drivers will now be tracked, traced, and henpecked throughout every ride they provide.
[00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:22.356]  This is the next step toward totalitarian control of transportation and the end of individual autonomy on our roads.
[00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:31.382]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the ride-sharing app has launched new and invasive technology called Telematics, which records drivers' behaviors behind the wheel.
[00:05:31.662 --> 00:05:40.827]  When a driver exceeds the speed limit, brakes abruptly, cuts corners, or sends a text while driving, Uber alerts the driver of their mistake in real time.
[00:05:40.827 --> 00:05:45.629]  In the future, drivers who receive low scores throughout their driving history may be penalized.
[00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:55.434]  In addition, negative driving data, such as speeding, could easily be sent to law enforcement to enhance the tactics they use to pilfer the public through draconian fines.
[00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:56.875]  This is Ashley Beckford.
[00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.617]  Stay tuned for more special reports at InfoWars.com.

[00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.430]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.731]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:05.952]  Why is this so good?
[00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:11.237]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:24.790]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.151]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.573]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.134]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:32.434]  These are all parasites.
[00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:33.555]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:34.895]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:39.397]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:42.659]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.720]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.780]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.601]  Living Defense.
[00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:48.701]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:52.563]  And...
[00:07:53.303 --> 00:07:54.324]  You support the broadcast.
[00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:55.685]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:57.927]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:12.719]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:18.965]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:37.370]  Everyone knows that I was a massive critic of George W. Bush and called for his impeachment, for launching the illegal war in Iraq, framing Iraq for what the Saudi Arabian government and elements of our government really did on 9-11.
[00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.391]  I'm not a Republican hack.
[00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:41.273]  I'm a libertarian constitutional patriot.
[00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:51.298]  So when I sit up here and tell you from my historical research that Loretta Lynch is undoubtedly the most corrupt U.S.
[00:08:51.298 --> 00:09:01.343]  Attorney General in history, and there's been quite a few that were corrupt, that is by thousands and thousands and thousands of percentage points.
[00:09:01.343 --> 00:09:09.106]  I mean, the nakedness, the open, unbelievable arrogance
[00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:27.488]  I've got a stack of articles here, mainstream news, where she said that she's going to restrict and criminalize speech, where she's going to, outside of law, go after our guns, where she's going to put the UN in charge of our local police departments.
[00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:33.369]  That's why they're in a war against the police, to break the police so that they accept that takeover and control.
[00:09:35.077 --> 00:09:36.258]  I'm not saying the police are perfect.
[00:09:36.258 --> 00:09:38.419]  I'm just saying there are police.
[00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:40.040]  This is our country, our government.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.342]  We're not going to sit by and watch this multinational takeover.
[00:09:43.342 --> 00:09:47.224]  I have the articles right here in front of me.
[00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:52.047]  The smart cities initiatives of the UN, the strong cities initiatives.
[00:09:52.047 --> 00:09:53.387]  Look at these.
[00:09:53.387 --> 00:09:54.028]  Look at this.
[00:09:54.028 --> 00:10:00.711]  Obama administration, UN announced global police force to fight extremism in US.
[00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:03.173]  Obama's Attorney General promises to criminalize speech.
[00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:14.726]  This is just some of the background, and there she is, protecting the government.
[00:10:14.726 --> 00:10:17.289]  Criminal elements of it, carrying out Fast and Furious.
[00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:22.716]  We have the CBS News reports where they got the documents, where it was meant to blame the Second Amendment, a false flag.
[00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:25.920]  We now know, confirmed, that one of the shooters
[00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.591]  In Paris, had a gun from Fast and Furious.
[00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:31.951]  We told you that a year ago.
[00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:36.072]  That they were shipping guns into Mexico and then out to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:38.253]  Now it's confirmed.
[00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:40.453]  She's covered up the IRS persecution.
[00:10:40.453 --> 00:10:41.874]  She's covered up Benghazi.
[00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:46.635]  She's allowed Hillary to disengage in all sorts of criminal activity.
[00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:49.035]  The Justice Department has blocked things at every front.
[00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:51.356]  Not just with her, but her predecessor, Eric Holder.
[00:10:56.061 --> 00:11:13.771]  And now, she meets earlier in the week in Arizona, in front of the press corps.
[00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:23.696]  She goes on to a plane, her private plane, with the former President of the United States, William Jefferson
[00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:42.173]  Clinton and meets in secret and then has the nerve to tell us it's no big deal when by every federal and state statute it is totally illegal.
[00:11:42.173 --> 00:11:53.776]  She met with a man who is under admitted criminal investigation by the FBI, supposedly by her Justice Department,
[00:11:57.336 --> 00:12:16.475]  All of this unfolding in our face, the email scandals, the IRS criminal investigations, the Benghazi investigations, all of it, this is like if you're in a bankruptcy trial.
[00:12:17.412 --> 00:12:22.636]  And you met for 10 minutes at a restaurant with a judge presiding over it.
[00:12:22.636 --> 00:12:30.563]  You and the judge would get indicted even if you weren't doing anything wrong, quote, trying to fix it.
[00:12:30.563 --> 00:12:32.385]  It's illegal to meet.
[00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:36.728]  Bare minimum, she has to recuse herself.
[00:12:36.728 --> 00:12:44.555]  If she was caught at the grocery store bumping in to Bill Clinton and talking to him in front of witnesses for two minutes, she'd have to recuse herself.
[00:12:46.127 --> 00:12:56.895]  I've been involved in court cases before and you see the judge walking down the hall from the bathroom or their office and they won't even talk to you.
[00:12:56.895 --> 00:12:58.236]  And that's just in civil court.
[00:13:02.236 --> 00:13:03.297]  And they think we're ignorant.
[00:13:03.297 --> 00:13:08.319]  This is that moment though when the whole facade starts to collapse.
[00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:13.462]  This is that moment when the big lie starts to go in on top of itself.
[00:13:13.462 --> 00:13:16.204]  Because everybody knows the Clintons are above the law.
[00:13:16.204 --> 00:13:21.887]  Everybody knows they've gotten away with bloody murder for years and years and years and years and Vince Foster and Cattle Futures and
[00:13:22.387 --> 00:13:29.013]  The carbon tax scams and her getting off the airplane in Bosnia-Herzegovina and claiming she's being shot at by snipers.
[00:13:29.013 --> 00:13:34.557]  Then there's NBC and CBS and ABC News footage of a beautiful sunny day with kids giving her flowers.
[00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:37.139]  Her Brian Williams moment.
[00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:40.282]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of just incredible scandals.
[00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:42.043]  Missile secrets to the Chinese.
[00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:45.626]  Nuclear reactors that can make fissile material to North Korea.
[00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:48.008]  On and on and on.
[00:13:48.008 --> 00:13:49.069]  Listing their crimes.
[00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.930]  It makes your head spin.
[00:13:51.516 --> 00:13:58.200]  And the insider deals, and screwing us on the trade deals, and all of it.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:06.445]  And then for some reason, when she's been caught lying to Congress about, I never was in my emails, or I didn't know I had any emails, or I didn't have any secret emails.
[00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:12.768]  I mean, the head of the EPA had to resign because she had secret emails.
[00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:13.989]  All of this is illegal.
[00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:15.049]  All of this is to get around the
[00:14:18.035 --> 00:14:25.578]  For your law, the open records law, all of this is to abscond justice and our laws.
[00:14:25.578 --> 00:14:26.818]  That's what this is.
[00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:30.219]  Period.
[00:14:30.219 --> 00:14:31.660]  Period.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.720]  No debate.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.842]  And so they do this out in the open in front of everybody.
[00:14:38.842 --> 00:14:40.343]  And she's so arrogant.
[00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:43.299]  Here's the bigger news.
[00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:48.567]  It is confirmed in local newspapers and reporters are on record saying, oh yes.
[00:14:50.097 --> 00:15:03.968]  The FBI ordered all of us to turn our cameras off and to not record anything as Bill Clinton went by us, as we were waiting to try to interview her on the whole Clinton investigation, and they just met in front of everyone.
[00:15:03.968 --> 00:15:07.431]  That is, the secret meeting commenced in front of them.
[00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:18.540]  They went in, the press saw the secret meeting commence, they saw the jet door close to the fuselage, and they did it in front of everybody.
[00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:27.799]  And then she has the nerve, yesterday in a press conference, to say, yeah, you know, I met with him and talked about some family stuff.
[00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:28.600]  Mainly.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.061]  Mainly.
[00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.966]  And she leaves a proviso in there, that's pretty much what they talked about.
[00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:36.691]  Looks so incredibly guilty, but the question is, that shows how they're megalomaniacal.
[00:15:36.691 --> 00:15:39.515]  They're so delusional, they do this stuff out in the open.
[00:15:41.786 --> 00:15:45.729]  And then Charlie Rose comes out and says, oh, just two politicians getting together.
[00:15:45.729 --> 00:15:46.650]  Yeah, from the same party.
[00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.271]  She's not supposed to be a politician.
[00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:50.192]  She's sworn to uphold the law.
[00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:53.215]  She's really a political hack of the Clintons.
[00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:55.577]  Brought into power by the Clintons.
[00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:59.520]  And Charlie Rose is a Bilderberg attendee and CFR globalist.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.761]  An open enemy of the country.
[00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:05.785]  Now let's go ahead and go to the first clip of her in the press conference yesterday, then we'll go to the new clip.
[00:16:05.785 --> 00:16:06.085]  Here it is.
[00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:16.471]  Was it appropriate for you to meet with former President Clinton while your agency is in the middle of an investigation of his wife's email service?
[00:16:16.471 --> 00:16:19.313]  Well, I did see the president at the Phoenix airport the other night.
[00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:21.554]  As I was landing, he was headed out.
[00:16:21.554 --> 00:16:29.118]  He did come over and say hello and speak to my husband and myself and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that.
[00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:30.398]  So that was the extent of that.
[00:16:30.398 --> 00:16:33.420]  And no discussions were held on any cases or anything of that.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.501]  And he didn't raise anything about that either.
[00:16:36.206 --> 00:16:39.827]  There's another clip I saw on Fox where she's doing a press conference.
[00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:47.269]  There's a blue background, not a California flag background, and I saw her this morning say, oh, we mainly just talked about that.
[00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:49.609]  Now let's go to the other clip.
[00:16:49.609 --> 00:17:02.813]  This is her speaking to the Aspen Institute just about 45 minutes ago, and this is one of the most Orwellian statements I've ever seen, where she's talking to the reporter, and she says, well, I can't really recuse myself
[00:17:03.953 --> 00:17:05.755]  Because then I wouldn't know what's going on.
[00:17:05.755 --> 00:17:09.218]  But I'm not involved in the case, though.
[00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:10.039]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[00:17:12.938 --> 00:17:18.042]  No, what's interesting here is you say you fully expect to accept the recommendations.
[00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:28.829]  One thing people were saying this morning when the news broke was that you were, quote, recusing yourself from having any kind of role in the final determination.
[00:17:28.829 --> 00:17:30.330]  Is that the case?
[00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.131]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:36.895]  Well, a recusal would mean that I wouldn't even be brief on what the findings were or what the actions going forward would be.
[00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:49.463]  Um, and while I don't have a role in those findings, in coming up with those findings, or making those recommendations as to how to go forward, I'll be briefed on it, and I will be accepting their recommendations.
[00:17:49.463 --> 00:17:54.426]  And when you say... Again, this must be the journalist in me in the link.
[00:17:54.426 --> 00:17:55.007]  Alright.
[00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.228]  I had a little problem with that clip.
[00:17:57.228 --> 00:17:58.649]  I guess we'll go back to it in a moment.
[00:17:58.649 --> 00:18:01.271]  Uh, but that's mainly the extent of it right there.
[00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:19.097]  She's saying, oh, I'm going to accept the findings, but she wants to then basically be involved in what goes forward from there.
[00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:26.239]  How to spin the findings, how to make sure there's not a prosecution, how to let the Clintons know what's coming down the road.
[00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:31.760]  But all of this aside, think about it.
[00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:35.720]  Have you ever seen them in such a panic?
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.961]  Have you ever seen them in such damage control?
[00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:41.502]  Have you ever seen them running around scareder?
[00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:45.804]  Have you ever seen them out there pushing harder saying this is no big deal?
[00:18:45.804 --> 00:18:48.725]  They're not going to get away with this unless...
[00:18:50.083 --> 00:19:14.699]  The last time they were behind in an election, 1995, the last time they had a bunch of criminal investigations on them, the last time there were a bunch of states starting investigations on them, a federal building got bombed in Oklahoma City, the Alfred P. Murrah building, and within five minutes, Bill Clinton was on national television saying it was the fault of talk radio, conservatives, and libertarians.
[00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:18.062]  And of course, that was a false flag terror attack.
[00:19:18.062 --> 00:19:19.643]  The then Deputy Attorney General,
[00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:27.560]  Eric Holder was later implicated, bare minimum, in the cover-up of what really happened there.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.822]  And most of you, of course, know what that was.
[00:19:29.822 --> 00:19:31.924]  A bonafide false flag.
[00:19:31.924 --> 00:19:42.755]  We even know the names of the ATF, FBI, CIA, Army, and German intelligence operatives that were there carrying out the event.
[00:19:43.968 --> 00:19:56.640]  And we have all the different eyewitnesses who saw them there in the days before with their federal security badges doing telephone work in the stairwells with gray sticks of butter.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.183]  And the cop of the year exposed it and they tortured him to death and then killed him.
[00:20:01.537 --> 00:20:02.839]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:06.963]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.

[00:20:15.551 --> 00:20:19.214]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[00:20:19.214 --> 00:20:21.537]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:22.538]  A U.S.

[00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:28.379]  So here's the headline up on InfoWars.com at insult to injury.
[00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:34.447]  The press is out there on the tarmac begging to speak to the Attorney General who's already embroiled in the cover-up.
[00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:35.892]  Of course.
[00:24:55.632 --> 00:25:08.984]  With his Secret Service detail in front of the press and the FBI orders local ABC News reporters and others to turn your cameras off so they're involved in the criminal cover-up.
[00:25:08.984 --> 00:25:11.506]  You see how much worse the scandal gets by the moment?
[00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:21.244]  The FBI blocked journalists from taking videos and pictures outside the secret airport meeting between former President Bill Clinton Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
[00:25:21.244 --> 00:25:27.969]  The former president steps into her plane and they speak for 30 minutes privately about Bill Clinton's kids, I bet.
[00:25:27.969 --> 00:25:35.154]  ABC 15 reporter Christopher Syne said about the Phoenix meeting, the FBI, they're on the tarmac, infrastructure,
[00:25:36.115 --> 00:25:40.499]  Instructing everybody around, no photos, no pictures, no cell phones.
[00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:42.882]  And I love how the press just always follows orders.
[00:25:42.882 --> 00:25:58.858]  So governments so disconnected, the laugh dog media that's allowed in their press corps that gets near the Clintons and the Obamas and their camp followers like Lynch, are so controlled historically that they all went along with this for a couple days till it finally started breaking.
[00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:05.953]  Imagine being, I mean if I was on the tarmac, of course they would let me on the tarmac near them.
[00:26:05.953 --> 00:26:09.154]  Oh, I get such coverage, I get such accessibility.
[00:26:09.154 --> 00:26:10.995]  No I don't, I have to tow their line.
[00:26:10.995 --> 00:26:14.396]  I become nothing but a regurgitator of their baloney.
[00:26:14.396 --> 00:26:16.857]  That's a nice word for their BS.
[00:26:16.857 --> 00:26:19.897]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:26:19.897 --> 00:26:22.898]  ABC 15 reporter on Bill O'Reilly.
[00:26:22.898 --> 00:26:25.359]  I'm surprised old Bill's actually going after Hillary.
[00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:28.920]  He's been defending her, but you see, now even when this rat
[00:26:30.666 --> 00:26:32.567]  Leaves the sinking ship.
[00:26:32.567 --> 00:26:33.667]  You know they're in trouble.
[00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:34.888]  Here it is.
[00:26:34.888 --> 00:26:37.009]  They wait for her to land.
[00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:37.809]  She arrives.
[00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:39.670]  Some people step off of her plane.
[00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.371]  The former president steps into her plane.
[00:26:42.371 --> 00:26:44.432]  They then speak for 30 minutes privately.
[00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:48.753]  The FBI there on the tarmac instructing everybody around.
[00:26:48.753 --> 00:26:49.774]  No photos.
[00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:50.694]  No pictures.
[00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:51.695]  No cell phones.
[00:26:51.695 --> 00:26:52.915]  He then gets off the plane.
[00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:53.915]  Gets on his own plane.
[00:26:53.915 --> 00:26:54.756]  He departs.
[00:26:54.756 --> 00:26:56.437]  She continues on with her planned visit.
[00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.085]  Isn't that incredible?
[00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:04.089]  Talk about a mafia meeting, she's waiting, his plane lands.
[00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.711]  Turn the cameras off, all of you, shut up!
[00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:10.754]  Still so arrogant, they think they're going to have a secret meeting in front of the press corps.
[00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:13.657]  Probably 50 plus cameras there, they're reporting.
[00:27:13.657 --> 00:27:21.343]  Everyone dutifully, oh yes sir, we're feminists, we're going to do it because she's a woman, and Bill Clinton's so good to women.
[00:27:21.343 --> 00:27:24.245]  FBI at Clinton Lynch meeting, ordered press blackout.
[00:27:24.245 --> 00:27:25.666]  No photos, no video.
[00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:30.430]  The video is up on InfoWars.com of this valiant member of the press.
[00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.832]  Because notice, you don't see the others talking about this.
[00:27:32.832 --> 00:27:34.313]  They know how to keep their mouths shut.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.962]  Maybe one day they can be on a jet with Bill Clinton.
[00:27:39.962 --> 00:27:42.143]  Oh boy, doesn't that just sound horrible?
[00:27:42.143 --> 00:27:52.769]  Now, let's go back to the clip I played earlier of her at a press conference yesterday, and she says that they just discussed family.
[00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:59.832]  And now in another statement I saw her say this morning, she goes, oh, we pretty much just talked about that, so we gotta find that video.
[00:27:59.832 --> 00:28:01.293]  I promise there's just so much of this stuff.
[00:28:02.648 --> 00:28:04.208]  Oh, that's pretty much all we talked about.
[00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:05.689]  Oh, 30 minutes!
[00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:08.509]  Oh, let's talk about Chelsea.
[00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:11.290]  Let's talk about all this baloney.
[00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.731]  Oh, sure, you just had this meeting and said, turn the cameras off.
[00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:16.231]  Because, uh, no.
[00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:29.995]  Everybody knew this was an outrageous, horrible criminal meeting, that it was illegal, that she should recuse herself, that she's been covering up and obstructing justice the whole time, and they thought they could get away with it because all these sycophants sit there and follow their orders.
[00:28:30.515 --> 00:28:32.797]  But somebody didn't in the FBI.
[00:28:32.797 --> 00:28:34.978]  Somebody didn't in the press corps.
[00:28:34.978 --> 00:28:36.799]  Traitors to the tyranny.
[00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:39.141]  Traitors to the enemies that have taken the nation.
[00:28:39.141 --> 00:28:42.583]  Real patriots are starting to speak out and take action.
[00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.445]  And Donald Trump says he's flabbergasted.
[00:28:44.445 --> 00:28:45.625]  That clip's coming up after the break.
[00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:49.168]  But first, let's go ahead and go to that clip from her at the press conference.
[00:28:50.714 --> 00:28:59.197]  What's appropriate for you to meet with former President Clinton while your agency is in the middle of an investigation of his wife's email service?
[00:28:59.197 --> 00:29:02.878]  Well, I did see the president at the Phoenix airport the other night as I was landing.
[00:29:02.878 --> 00:29:04.278]  He was headed out.
[00:29:04.278 --> 00:29:11.840]  He did come over and say hello and speak to my husband and myself and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.121]  So that was the extent of that.
[00:29:13.121 --> 00:29:15.882]  And no discussions were held on any cases or anything of that.
[00:29:15.882 --> 00:29:16.542]  She's so guilty.
[00:29:18.783 --> 00:29:20.004]  Oh, she just saw him.
[00:29:20.004 --> 00:29:21.285]  She just ran into him.
[00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:22.845]  She's just there waiting on her plane.
[00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:24.426]  Here comes his plane.
[00:29:24.426 --> 00:29:26.808]  So that story's conflicting right there.
[00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:27.348]  It doesn't matter.
[00:29:27.348 --> 00:29:28.309]  It's illegal, period.
[00:29:29.505 --> 00:29:32.866]  The press will try to divert off into some little side issue of this.
[00:29:32.866 --> 00:29:39.248]  It's illegal, it's arrogant, and it's always hubris that is the downfall of these criminals.
[00:29:39.248 --> 00:29:41.348]  Will they now fall?
[00:29:41.348 --> 00:29:45.890]  Let's pray for it, because they need to be brought to justice, and all their criminal minions do as well.
[00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.131]  Because if she gets in, she's never gonna let America get back up.
[00:29:49.131 --> 00:29:50.831]  It's her job to bring us down.
[00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.231]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.231 --> 00:29:54.752]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.752 --> 00:29:57.453]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:10.439]  The article titled, Revolution, Flash Mobs and Brain Chips, A Grim Vision of the Future, is based on a 30-year future cast completed by the British Ministry of Defense team back in 2007.
[00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:19.325]  The goal of the report was to create a future strategic context of obstacles and events and to create an analysis of key risks and shocks that would face the British military.
[00:30:19.325 --> 00:30:27.190]  The fall of the mainstream media and the rise of the internet-enabled citizen journalists are predicted in the report, as well as neutron bombs and brain chip mobilized flash mobs.
[00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:36.620]  The report even predicted the politically correct invasion of triggerly puffed social justice warriors whose ranks would be filled by the socialist spewing spoiled children of a once prosperous middle class.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:47.952]  Finally, compact, increasingly cramped cities and booming third world populations would lead to increased migration, massive food riots, and spread of the radical political Islamic concept of Ummah, which is the global Islamic community.
[00:30:48.172 --> 00:30:52.438]  Food riots are now cropping up across the world in places like Venezuela and Greece.
[00:30:52.438 --> 00:30:54.521]  Are you prepared for widespread food riots?
[00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:58.808]  Go to InfoWars.com and stock up on InfoWars Select storable foods right now.

[00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.552]  Rob Dew reporting.
[00:31:01.552 --> 00:31:02.914]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.676]  You can't survive without it.
[00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:05.877]  But where do you get it?
[00:31:05.877 --> 00:31:11.862]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:31:11.862 --> 00:31:17.788]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:25.856]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[00:31:28.198 --> 00:31:28.819]  We're good to go!
[00:31:49.172 --> 00:31:49.552]  We're good.
[00:32:13.157 --> 00:32:24.643]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:32:24.643 --> 00:32:32.127]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:32:32.427 --> 00:32:42.093]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:46.535]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:32:46.535 --> 00:32:53.600]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.060]  That means it's clean.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.221]  That means it's pure.
[00:32:56.221 --> 00:32:59.143]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:00.804]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:33:04.213 --> 00:33:13.725]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.287]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:15.287 --> 00:33:18.972]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:38.971 --> 00:33:52.599]  I am so excited, so upset, so awake by how epic the events are that I'm actually sweating on air today and the air conditioner is not broken.
[00:33:52.599 --> 00:33:55.761]  A few days ago it was not working well and I was sweating.
[00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:58.062]  It's like 70 degrees in here and I'm actually sweating.
[00:33:59.473 --> 00:34:00.094]  Uh, on air.
[00:34:00.094 --> 00:34:06.378]  My heart is actually beating fast because I realize we've got all these powerful forces trying to control the United States.
[00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:11.562]  I realize that Hillary Clinton is an admitted communist Chinese agent that sold out our country.
[00:34:11.562 --> 00:34:15.064]  I know the Clintons have engaged in so many amazing crimes.
[00:34:15.064 --> 00:34:18.206]  And that if she gets into office, she's going for broke.
[00:34:18.206 --> 00:34:23.190]  Her attorney general has said she wants to restrict free speech in the Second Amendment.
[00:34:24.558 --> 00:34:30.961]  They are openly training the military to confiscate guns and to mass control and blockade cities.
[00:34:30.961 --> 00:34:39.265]  We've got Dr. Group coming in with mainstream news and also his sources and my sources documenting that a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:34:39.265 --> 00:34:41.346]  They are going for broke.
[00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:43.026]  Absolute broke.
[00:34:43.026 --> 00:34:47.108]  And this has captured the public's attention.
[00:34:47.108 --> 00:34:52.791]  Everyone sees how incredibly obvious this is that she's been controlling the investigations along with her predecessor.
[00:34:54.039 --> 00:35:10.356]  Holder and even Democrats are saying this is horrible, this is out of control, and it's like a James Bond movie where you get the villain, she lands, and then Clinton lands, and then he comes onto her plane, and they have this meeting, and the Secret Service says, turn your cameras off, because it's so guilty?
[00:35:10.356 --> 00:35:14.760]  The FBI orders them to turn their cameras off?
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.202]  Because it's so incredibly guilty?
[00:35:18.527 --> 00:35:20.669]  These people think they're gods.
[00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:28.575]  And I'll tell you, the desperateness of this, the word is there was going to be some partial recommendations for criminal prosecution coming out.
[00:35:28.575 --> 00:35:31.758]  I've been getting that from good sources for a year, but it hadn't happened yet.
[00:35:31.758 --> 00:35:34.781]  And the word is it was getting very, very close.
[00:35:34.781 --> 00:35:38.924]  There's a lot of pressure back and forth and internal battles going on.
[00:35:38.924 --> 00:35:44.649]  And so what would make Clinton desperately set up this meeting and desperately, basically board her plane?
[00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.719]  Turn the cameras off, shut everything down.
[00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:50.539]  He boards her plane.
[00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:53.580]  Ron Brown said he wasn't going to go along with their corruption.
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.282]  He ended up as Commerce Secretary with a .45 bullet hole in his head.
[00:35:57.282 --> 00:36:00.043]  That's what the coroner said.
[00:36:00.043 --> 00:36:01.504]  Remember the plane crashed into a mountain?
[00:36:01.504 --> 00:36:06.165]  A bunch of people on board have been shot.
[00:36:06.165 --> 00:36:10.487]  How you do that is you have commandos on board posing a secret service.
[00:36:10.487 --> 00:36:15.349]  They put on their oxygen mask, kill everybody, blow the hatch, and parachute out.
[00:36:16.786 --> 00:36:17.687]  That's a standard procedure.
[00:36:17.687 --> 00:36:24.091]  One of their favorite ways to execute people because the plane crash covers up a lot of the killing.
[00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:28.694]  One lady survived the plane crash though, was in good health and they took her off to an army hospital.
[00:36:28.694 --> 00:36:30.876]  She was dead a few minutes later.
[00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:31.876]  Was that Macedonia?
[00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:36.199]  Around the border with Serbia?
[00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:38.801]  So, she knows what happened.
[00:36:38.801 --> 00:36:41.143]  She understands what happened.
[00:36:42.142 --> 00:36:48.766]  When you don't do what your overlords, what the mafia dons, tell you to do.
[00:36:48.766 --> 00:36:52.068]  So this is an incredible, incredible time to be alive.
[00:36:52.068 --> 00:36:55.970]  Let's hear what Donald Trump had to say about this.
[00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:04.314]  Because look, the drumbeat is so strong on Crooked Hillary that I'm telling you, I know the optics, I can feel the energy, I can see it in the press.
[00:37:04.314 --> 00:37:10.738]  This is the biggest blow against the Clintons in their decades of crime wave.
[00:37:11.932 --> 00:37:39.621]  And if we push this and we don't let the holiday weekend derail us, and we keep this to be the number one story, and we take control of the meme with Hillary for prison, and we get this information out in the articles and videos at InfoWars.com that are going up as we speak right now, and if we take control of the narrative with the truth, there is a very good chance we're going to see the fall of the Clintons, because this has really captured the world's attention.
[00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:54.187]  And I've been told by so many high level people that they are so sick of the Clintons and everyone is so tired of them and the fact that they're basically communist Chinese operatives.
[00:37:54.187 --> 00:37:58.509]  So, let's go ahead and play this clip from Donald Trump.
[00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:01.590]  Here is Donald Trump responding.
[00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.531]  Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton.
[00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:08.409]  While she potentially is weighing an indictment against his wife.
[00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:11.112]  Now she claims that, you know, she boarded the plane.
[00:38:11.112 --> 00:38:13.314]  She was on the plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.
[00:38:13.314 --> 00:38:18.059]  They were talking about their grandchildren and sports.
[00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:23.885]  Is this an issue where you think the credibility, for example, of a criminal referral comes from the FBI?
[00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:26.268]  Do you think the Attorney General needs to now recuse herself?
[00:38:28.374 --> 00:38:32.537]  Well, when I first heard that yesterday afternoon, I actually thought they were joking.
[00:38:32.537 --> 00:38:35.699]  I thought the people that told me was, you know, I said, no way.
[00:38:35.699 --> 00:38:38.020]  It's just no way that's going to happen.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.162]  And it happened.
[00:38:40.162 --> 00:38:43.063]  And I am just I'm flabbergasted by it.
[00:38:43.063 --> 00:38:43.944]  I think it's amazing.
[00:38:43.944 --> 00:38:47.206]  I've never seen anything like that before.
[00:38:47.206 --> 00:38:53.430]  Hillary Clinton has thrown everything she's got against Donald Trump, the American people, the lies, the spin, the deception.
[00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:54.631]  And do you understand, folks,
[00:38:55.911 --> 00:39:05.498]  If Hillary Clinton gets into office, I will have a much bigger audience and my show will grow until she censors it or shuts it down or has me killed.
[00:39:05.498 --> 00:39:09.361]  And I was told, I was fired from radio jobs on directives of the Clintons.
[00:39:09.361 --> 00:39:12.523]  I was told, shut up and stop talking about the Clintons.
[00:39:12.523 --> 00:39:18.388]  People would call and threaten me and then they came and physically attacked me and said, we told you to shut up about the Clintons.
[00:39:18.388 --> 00:39:21.410]  So, I have personally experienced it.
[00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.331]  I've seen the emails.
[00:39:23.356 --> 00:39:24.877]  Where they're talking about going after the press.
[00:39:24.877 --> 00:39:30.241]  And before that, in the Clinton Foundation, at their library, Judicial Watch got the documents.
[00:39:30.241 --> 00:39:34.325]  So did World Net Daily about how they're going to persecute the press and go after people.
[00:39:34.325 --> 00:39:36.927]  And Lynch is running around talking about going after the press today!
[00:39:39.952 --> 00:39:43.333]  So this is really an evil, evil, evil, evil group of people.
[00:39:43.333 --> 00:40:00.837]  And then today, just about an hour ago, she finished up a little 30-minute talk with a softball question reporter from the Aspen Institute saying, I'll take his recommendation, but I want to know what's being done and then what's being planned after that recommendation.
[00:40:00.837 --> 00:40:03.858]  So I'm not going to recuse myself, but I'm not involved.
[00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:05.038]  But she's admitting she's involved.
[00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:08.315]  So, it really is an outrageous video.
[00:40:08.315 --> 00:40:16.241]  I want to play this clip for folks, and if we can, run a little bit longer than we did last time, because there's some real substance here.
[00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:21.165]  Again, this has Richard Nixon going, I'm not a crook!
[00:40:21.165 --> 00:40:22.326]  I'm not a crook!
[00:40:22.326 --> 00:40:25.848]  Or Clinton going, I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:40:25.848 --> 00:40:28.971]  But this isn't oral sex in the oral office.
[00:40:29.898 --> 00:40:32.741]  This isn't just lying to a grand jury.
[00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:41.068]  This is meeting with the Attorney General who's been covering your butt while you butcher this country's liberties up one side and down the other.
[00:40:41.068 --> 00:40:43.270]  Run false flags against the Second Amendment.
[00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.471]  Order stand downs.
[00:40:44.471 --> 00:40:45.773]  Create ISIS.
[00:40:45.773 --> 00:40:47.294]  Arm Al Qaeda.
[00:40:47.294 --> 00:40:49.856]  Open our borders up outside of law.
[00:40:49.856 --> 00:40:51.838]  Let people with diseases in.
[00:40:51.838 --> 00:40:54.441]  Set up all this domestic surveillance of patriots.
[00:40:56.102 --> 00:41:05.430]  Put Obamacare in to screw us over, her foundation getting 100 plus million from Saudi Arabia, and when they're executing homosexuals and women are slaves.
[00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.972]  I mean, she's just a giant fraud!
[00:41:07.972 --> 00:41:09.854]  What is wrong with so-called feminists?
[00:41:09.854 --> 00:41:14.218]  They just want the delusion that she's a woman and you just don't like her because she's a woman.
[00:41:14.218 --> 00:41:17.621]  I could care less that Loretta Lynch is a woman or that Hillary is.
[00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:19.703]  They're horrible, corrupt people!
[00:41:22.426 --> 00:41:25.608]  I can't stand Bill Clinton, he's a horrible person!
[00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.169]  Obama's horrible!
[00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:31.971]  It has nothing to do with the fact that he's part African.
[00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:36.734]  This identity politics is killing us.
[00:41:36.734 --> 00:41:41.456]  And you know, if Hillary was a man, she'd already be indicted.
[00:41:41.456 --> 00:41:50.181]  They just, they use this whole thing, again, that she's a woman, we're gonna hear that for eight years, oh, it's a woman, so you can't.
[00:41:55.663 --> 00:41:59.166]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip of her earlier today.
[00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:00.407]  Here it is.
[00:42:00.407 --> 00:42:05.411]  What's interesting here is you say you fully expect to accept the recommendations.
[00:42:05.411 --> 00:42:16.200]  One thing people were saying this morning when the news broke was that you were, quote, recusing yourself from having any kind of role in the final determination.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.701]  Is that the case?
[00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:18.402]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:42:18.422 --> 00:42:21.964]  Well, a recusal would mean that I wouldn't even be briefed on what the findings were.
[00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:25.267]  Or what the actions going forward would be.
[00:42:25.267 --> 00:42:36.835]  And while I don't have a role in those findings, in coming up with those findings, or making those recommendations as to how to go forward, I'll be briefed on it, and I will be accepting their recommendations.
[00:42:36.835 --> 00:42:38.436]  And when you say- Stop a minute.
[00:42:38.436 --> 00:42:41.358]  Janice must be the journalist in me, and the linguist in me.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:56.587]  She will take the findings, but she says she wants to still be involved with what's done with those findings, implying she's going to try to block any criminal prosecution, which she's already been doing.
[00:42:56.587 --> 00:42:59.208]  They love using this lawyer talk on everybody.
[00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:00.129]  So that's what they just did.
[00:43:00.129 --> 00:43:01.810]  Let's go back to the so-called journalist.
[00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:06.691]  Again, this must be the journalist in me and the linguist in me.
[00:43:06.691 --> 00:43:18.936]  Accepting to me means, here, Madam Attorney General, here are our findings, and you completely accept them wholeheartedly and then issue them to the public, or you accept them, look them over,
[00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:24.861]  And then make your own determination as to what the final determination will be.
[00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:30.925]  No, the final determination as to how to proceed will be contained within the recommendations in the report.
[00:43:30.925 --> 00:43:34.807]  In whatever format the team puts it together, that has not been resolved.
[00:43:34.807 --> 00:43:39.550]  Whatever report they provide to me, there will be a review of their investigation.
[00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:39.870]  There you go.
[00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.452]  There will be a review of what they have found and determined to have happened and occurred.
[00:43:43.452 --> 00:43:44.193]  Then they'll change it.
[00:43:44.653 --> 00:43:47.394]  Then they'll persecute them and get them to back off.
[00:43:47.394 --> 00:43:50.796]  We're going to finish the rest of this, but this is so sensational.
[00:43:50.796 --> 00:43:53.337]  Do you understand what you just saw?
[00:43:53.337 --> 00:43:55.338]  She's going to decide how to proceed.
[00:43:55.338 --> 00:43:55.898]  She just admitted it.
[00:43:55.898 --> 00:43:56.778]  So there's your headline.
[00:44:13.618 --> 00:44:20.866]  Lynch will take the FBI's quote recommendation and then I guess she's judge, jury and executioner and you know she's the judge hanging out with the Clintons.
[00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:32.618]  She will now basically decide because they're going to review and then persecute and claim it's wrong and let the press attack and leak this info on those FBI agents.
[00:44:32.618 --> 00:44:33.279]  Let's finish the clip.
[00:44:35.543 --> 00:44:39.846]  This case will be resolved by the team that's been working on it from the beginning.
[00:44:39.846 --> 00:44:42.768]  Supervisors always review matters.
[00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:47.191]  In this case, that review will be career people in the Department of Justice.
[00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:51.635]  And also, the FBI will review it up to and including the FBI director.
[00:44:51.635 --> 00:44:57.879]  And that will be the finalization of not just the factual findings, but the next steps in this matter.
[00:44:57.879 --> 00:44:58.239]  There you go.
[00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:01.782]  And I find it interesting several times now you've made... There's your headline right there, folks.
[00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:02.603]  Loretta Lynch.
[00:45:04.399 --> 00:45:07.994]  The Justice Department will decide how to act on the FBI report.
[00:45:07.994 --> 00:45:08.195]  Boom!
[00:45:09.824 --> 00:45:18.709]  She goes, I'm not going to recuse myself, you know, I'm going to accept their findings, but I'm not involved, but I'm going to make the final determination with senior career people, her minions.
[00:45:18.709 --> 00:45:36.418]  Like Shark Teeth, it's, you know, you get Jan and Reno, and then you get the next, oh, how wonderful, we now have Eric Holder, and then his minion, Loretta Lynch, and then the next minion, and the next minion, they will decide, not her, oh, my minion I brought in, they decide this isn't legitimate, and we're going to ignore it.
[00:45:37.759 --> 00:45:39.040]  That's how they plan to operate.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.064]  I want to get Larry Nichols on after the break here for just five minutes, maybe two seconds, maybe ten minutes.
[00:45:44.064 --> 00:45:48.709]  Appreciate him popping in, the Constable Clinton insider, to tell us where he thinks this is going.
[00:45:48.709 --> 00:45:54.934]  I personally smell blood, and I think this is one of the biggest blows ever to them.
[00:45:54.934 --> 00:45:59.538]  Just the way the press is responding, everything that's happening, the corruption is so naked.
[00:45:59.538 --> 00:46:00.439]  Before I go any further,
[00:46:02.799 --> 00:46:04.700]  They are setting up FEMA camps.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.020]  We're going to cover this in the next hour.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.480]  We have all the documents, all the news articles.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.121]  They're preparing for civil unrest.
[00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:13.022]  The globalists admit they want to make us independent.
[00:46:13.022 --> 00:46:13.882]  There's my 40th slip.
[00:46:13.882 --> 00:46:17.624]  The globalists admit they want to make us totally and completely dependent on them.
[00:46:17.624 --> 00:46:18.744]  I want to make everybody independent.
[00:46:19.727 --> 00:46:32.676]  And we've got everything you need from non-GMO heirloom seeds, lowest prices, the widest selection, the high-quality storable foods, to shortwave radios, to solar panel kits and control units that are the best out there, bar none.
[00:46:32.676 --> 00:46:35.578]  Everything at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:46:35.578 --> 00:46:37.620]  We're running one of the biggest sales ever.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.640]  I normally do this once a year.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.602]  I just did this two months ago, but didn't have as many items in it.
[00:46:41.602 --> 00:46:42.563]  It was just food.
[00:46:42.563 --> 00:46:43.644]  20 to 40% off everything.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.501]  That is survival related.
[00:46:48.501 --> 00:46:53.404]  It's our 4th of July Mega Specials are now live at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:53.404 --> 00:46:57.206]  Our Independence Day Mega Specials are now live again at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:03.270]  A total game changer.
[00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.272]  20 to 40% off all InfoWarsTore-able food.
[00:47:06.272 --> 00:47:07.032]  20% off
[00:47:08.621 --> 00:47:14.363]  Alexa Pure Water Filtration Systems, 20% off Alexa Pure Air Purifiers, and a lot more.
[00:47:14.363 --> 00:47:17.104]  These specials will run for a limited time, while supplies last.
[00:47:17.104 --> 00:47:22.526]  This Independence Day is a great time to support the real tip of the spear when it comes to the fight for liberty.
[00:47:22.526 --> 00:47:34.691]  Your support makes everything we do possible, from exposing Hillary Clinton to fighting for the Constitution, and trying to stop World War III, while we open Europe up to radical Islamists, but then start a fight with Russia that's trying to fight with us.
[00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:43.113]  Visit Infowarsstore.com right now and secure your independence with these mega-specials while supplies last.
[00:47:43.113 --> 00:47:47.174]  Again, the globalists have our borders open, Europe's borders open to people that want to kill us.
[00:47:47.174 --> 00:47:51.056]  Russia's battling the same people, so the globalists are trying to start a war with Russia.
[00:47:51.056 --> 00:47:55.777]  The globalists are trying to bring the West down and what's left of sovereign nations down.
[00:47:55.777 --> 00:47:57.197]  They want to bring you and your family down.
[00:47:57.197 --> 00:47:58.778]  They want to bring independence down.
[00:47:58.778 --> 00:48:02.719]  And this Independence Day, let's declare, like Trump said a few days ago,
[00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:13.315]  Economic independence, cultural independence, national independence, mental and spiritual independence from this Babylonian world government satanic system.
[00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:23.517]  You're not gonna find better, higher quality, clean, produced right here in America, storable foods, than you're gonna find with My Patron Supply.
[00:48:23.517 --> 00:48:27.760]  They only started like eight years ago, and they've become the number, what is it, number two now?
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.882]  Storable foods company in the world.
[00:48:29.882 --> 00:48:42.392]  Now there are a lot of old companies got together that were the best, with some folks in Utah, we're already doing it for decades, but it's a new company that's taken over, because it's high quality, clean, decent, delicious food, at the lowest price, even compared to crap food.
[00:48:43.032 --> 00:48:45.374]  This is the best out there by every metric.
[00:48:45.374 --> 00:48:46.895]  The price is incredibly low.
[00:48:46.895 --> 00:48:48.337]  The packaging is the best.
[00:48:48.337 --> 00:48:50.959]  It lasts 25 years, and that's 20 to 40 percent off.
[00:48:50.959 --> 00:48:52.560]  And most of the packages are 40 percent.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:59.026]  It's not like, oh, a few are 40 percent, but some are already so discounted we can't offer more than 20, because then there's like 10 percent profit in it.
[00:48:59.026 --> 00:49:00.447]  We got to make some money around here.
[00:49:00.447 --> 00:49:01.628]  I'm trying to launch aircraft.
[00:49:01.628 --> 00:49:02.349]  I signed a contract.
[00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.889]  I'm not trying.
[00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:03.270]  $30,000 for
[00:49:05.325 --> 00:49:15.400]  The RNC with the big Hillary for Prison plane and if we're able to sell enough of the t-shirts I'm gonna do 30,000 more to fly the plane two days with a giant banner saying Hillary for Prison.
[00:49:17.073 --> 00:49:20.215]  Over the Philadelphia DNC.
[00:49:20.215 --> 00:49:25.638]  And we have got more of the Hillary for Prison shirts back in stock of the third design.
[00:49:25.638 --> 00:49:26.779]  I think it's the best design yet.
[00:49:26.779 --> 00:49:28.740]  It's the classic design on navy blue.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.802]  Hillary for Prison 2016 on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com.
[00:49:32.802 --> 00:49:35.603]  On the back it says Legalize Freedom InfoWars.com.
[00:49:35.603 --> 00:49:40.506]  So it's the same as the last design except it has a right shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:49:40.506 --> 00:49:42.947]  And I think it's the very best design we've had so far.
[00:49:45.165 --> 00:49:48.887]  The last version had a 4.9 review star.
[00:49:48.887 --> 00:49:51.748]  This has no reviews yet because we started selling it three days ago.
[00:49:51.748 --> 00:49:56.630]  The 18-wheeler came in on Tuesday, produced right here in America.
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.711]  So please get these shirts at full price.
[00:49:58.711 --> 00:50:01.812]  I sold the others at like $5.95, $9.95.
[00:50:01.812 --> 00:50:05.774]  We need to sell a ton of these to pay for the aircraft.
[00:50:05.774 --> 00:50:07.514]  In fact, I need to sell thousands of these.
[00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:11.816]  You know, just to be able to print the banners.
[00:50:11.816 --> 00:50:13.976]  Because I want to fly some InfoWars banners as well.
[00:50:13.976 --> 00:50:14.656]  And they're gigantic.
[00:50:14.656 --> 00:50:16.337]  They're not your normal banners you see behind planes.
[00:50:16.337 --> 00:50:17.897]  They're the humongoid ones.
[00:50:17.897 --> 00:50:20.278]  You know, they're like super fat and super long.
[00:50:20.278 --> 00:50:22.478]  And they're like $5,000 a piece.
[00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:26.899]  The two days, four flights a day is $30,000.
[00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:28.580]  And that's how we do it.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.221]  I mean, we should be all in, folks, in the fight against the globalists.
[00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:33.041]  We need to commit.
[00:50:33.041 --> 00:50:35.622]  We need to spend our money, our energy, our time.
[00:50:35.622 --> 00:50:36.462]  I am all in.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.022]  So far this year I've paid myself nothing and I intend to pay myself nothing.
[00:50:41.022 --> 00:50:50.125]  I am going to try to put everything we've got this year, everything we've got, just totally into the fight because it's such an epic time to be alive.
[00:50:50.125 --> 00:50:55.348]  Do that with us, buy the nutraceuticals, buy the t-shirts, get ready, prepare yourselves.
[00:50:55.348 --> 00:50:59.489]  That's your defense while you're on the offense supporting us to be in the info war.
[00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:00.050]  It's a total 360 win.

[00:52:01.417 --> 00:52:09.584]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.

[00:52:14.528 --> 00:52:15.449]  So please listen.
[00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:19.132]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:52:19.132 --> 00:52:25.497]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:52:25.497 --> 00:52:29.561]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[00:52:29.821 --> 00:52:32.743]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:52:32.743 --> 00:52:35.085]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.

[00:54:04.707 --> 00:54:06.628]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:54:06.628 --> 00:54:11.631]  We are on the verge of the fall of the Clintons, in my view.
[00:54:11.631 --> 00:54:22.097]  Now, Larry Nichols helped get them into power, worked with them for many years, helped produce the major definitive works on them in their early criminal activities, the Clinton Chronicles.
[00:54:23.254 --> 00:54:25.576]  But now we chronicle her activities.
[00:54:25.576 --> 00:54:28.378]  It's even far worse than we can imagine.
[00:54:28.378 --> 00:54:31.700]  And she's far more vindictive and evil than ever.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.802]  So he predicted and said the email scandal wouldn't get her so far.
[00:54:34.802 --> 00:54:36.003]  It hasn't.
[00:54:36.003 --> 00:54:41.607]  But I tell you, the optics of Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton meeting and telling the press, turn off their cameras.
[00:54:41.607 --> 00:54:44.269]  I mean, this is a mob meeting in the forest.
[00:54:44.269 --> 00:54:47.271]  This is a James Bond crime boss meeting on the tarmac.
[00:54:47.691 --> 00:54:53.136]  The optics of this, the visuals on this, it seems like the whole press is freaking out.
[00:54:53.136 --> 00:54:56.099]  It seems like that the worm has turned.
[00:54:56.099 --> 00:55:00.303]  Now do you think I'm wrong, Larry Nichols, or what do you have to say?
[00:55:00.303 --> 00:55:12.014]  Hey Alex, well, number one, you know as well as I, Alex, that if Hillary was caught raping a woman downtown on camera in Washington DC,
[00:55:14.276 --> 00:55:24.763]  The 40% of the people that are behind her all the way, the feminists, the illegals, the Muslims, they're not going to change.
[00:55:24.763 --> 00:55:29.486]  This whole thing hinges on that 20% that they call, you know, undecided.
[00:55:29.486 --> 00:55:33.008]  And let me tell you, I can tell you what went on in that plane.
[00:55:33.008 --> 00:55:40.373]  There's one of two or three things, because that's what I used to do for them, so I know fairly well what happened.
[00:55:40.373 --> 00:55:41.714]  Bill Clinton met with Blanche.
[00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:50.814]  And he was there to assure her that when Hillary gets to be president, she'll be able to keep her job if she enjoys it.
[00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.334]  Number one.
[00:55:52.334 --> 00:55:57.396]  Number two, I would imagine he gave her a slip of paper.
[00:55:57.396 --> 00:56:07.099]  Slip of paper that had on it a couple of things about the career prosecutors that are working the case.
[00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:11.401]  And what was on that, Alex, were the things they have on them.
[00:56:11.949 --> 00:56:17.737]  You know, the drugs, women, men, whatever.
[00:56:17.737 --> 00:56:24.807]  And she is to show them what they've got, and if they indict or don't do what she says, that's what's coming out.
[00:56:24.807 --> 00:56:26.870]  So he gave her that slip of paper.
[00:56:27.631 --> 00:56:40.356]  So he gave her the blackmail information and you can see her licking her lips on TV in this interview today at the Aspen Institute saying she's going to decide what to do with the FBI report with her Justice Department people.
[00:56:40.356 --> 00:56:43.358]  That is just sensationally arrogant.
[00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:43.878]  Right.
[00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:50.661]  Now, the third thing is that they want Loretta Lynch
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.522]  To prosecute some of the protesters against Hillary.
[00:56:56.522 --> 00:57:02.184]  Those of us that are speaking out against immigration, against Muslims, etc.
[00:57:02.184 --> 00:57:03.245]  etc.
[00:57:03.245 --> 00:57:12.589]  Bill Clinton told her that he wanted her, they need her to step up and indict somebody for hate speech.
[00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:16.090]  Because that will clear the road for the rest of the way for Hillary.
[00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:20.812]  It'll back down the ultra-conservative people, the moral Christian conservative people.
[00:57:22.248 --> 00:57:32.251]  Sure, and that's what the persecution of tens of thousands of churches and conservative and libertarian groups, what the IRS was about.
[00:57:32.251 --> 00:57:33.951]  In fact, let's put it on screen.
[00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:40.032]  There's an article from last year where she said we're going to persecute people for their free speech when they criticize us.
[00:57:40.032 --> 00:57:41.833]  She's actually come out and said that before.
[00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:43.513]  I'm looking for the article.
[00:57:43.513 --> 00:57:49.215]  So you're saying from working with the Clintons and handling them for many years, that's what you believe happened on the airplane?
[00:57:49.215 --> 00:57:50.135]  That's what I know happened.
[00:57:50.925 --> 00:57:59.948]  Now, I wasn't there, of course, but I wrote the book that they used, and I did it so many times, Alex, that I know the M.O.
[00:57:59.948 --> 00:58:06.529]  The strange meeting, the quick meeting, the quote-unquote accidental on purpose meeting.
[00:58:06.529 --> 00:58:10.591]  You know, Bill Clinton wasn't in Atlanta or wherever this was supposedly playing golf.
[00:58:10.591 --> 00:58:13.311]  He wasn't more playing golf than a man in the moon.
[00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:16.452]  He was there to deliver a message.
[00:58:16.452 --> 00:58:18.933]  And he was the one that they chose to deliver it.
[00:58:19.682 --> 00:58:25.824]  You know for yourself, Loretta Lynch, for all that she is, she ain't stupid.
[00:58:25.824 --> 00:58:32.426]  She knew, she would have known, if she met with Bill Clinton, that this kind of fervor was going to happen.
[00:58:32.426 --> 00:58:36.027]  Well, that's why they had the FBI tell the press to turn the cameras off.
[00:58:36.027 --> 00:58:37.167]  This is arrogance.
[00:58:37.167 --> 00:58:39.008]  Stay right there, back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:39.008 --> 00:58:40.829]  Tell your friends and family to tune in now, folks.
[00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:42.089]  This is history happening.
[00:58:42.089 --> 00:58:43.029]  And this is the Insider.
[00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.769]  Thank you for listening.

[01:00:03.022 --> 01:00:05.266]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:08.611]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.202 --> 01:00:12.143]  About six months ago, we had the video clip.
[01:00:12.143 --> 01:00:14.884]  I just put the article up on screen for TV viewers last segment.
[01:00:14.884 --> 01:00:18.425]  Lynch said we're going to criminalize criticizing Islam.
[01:00:18.425 --> 01:00:21.566]  She tells the press don't call it radical Islam.
[01:00:21.566 --> 01:00:24.947]  They don't even mention Islam now in all these terror attacks.
[01:00:24.947 --> 01:00:28.649]  You got a gun from Fast and Furious at the Paris shooting.
[01:00:28.649 --> 01:00:31.810]  That's foreign mainstream news, not even the press here.
[01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.671]  It was our whistleblowers told us they're shipping guns through Mexico to ISIS.
[01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:41.229]  These are organized criminals, and Larry Nichols is our guest, the consummate Clinton insider.
[01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:44.715]  We've been blowing the whistle on him for two decades.
[01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:48.581]  Larry, what does it signify that on the tarmac, she meets him
[01:00:49.735 --> 01:00:51.336]  They meet for 30 minutes at least.
[01:00:51.336 --> 01:00:55.500]  The FBI and Secret Service tell ABC News and others, turn your cameras off.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.042]  They've testified to that now.
[01:00:57.042 --> 01:01:00.004]  This is clearly premeditated evil.
[01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:02.306]  It is an accident chance meeting.
[01:01:02.306 --> 01:01:04.368]  Why would they be so incredibly arrogant?
[01:01:04.368 --> 01:01:07.211]  I mean, is there a method for the madness rubbing our noses in it?
[01:01:08.487 --> 01:01:09.427]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:09.427 --> 01:01:18.729]  You know, Alex, I used to say, right on your program, years, years, years ago, if you'll recall, I used to say, the good news is, they're lying to us.
[01:01:18.729 --> 01:01:21.330]  When they stop lying, then we're gone.
[01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:23.911]  Alright, they're not lying anymore.
[01:01:23.911 --> 01:01:26.011]  They're doing stuff right in front of us.
[01:01:26.011 --> 01:01:36.254]  And what she's doing, what this meeting signifies, and don't believe they didn't know it, because I'm telling you, Lynch and Clinton both knew the reality of that meeting.
[01:01:36.254 --> 01:01:38.034]  You know, they're not, they're professionals.
[01:01:38.823 --> 01:01:40.567]  They know.
[01:01:40.567 --> 01:01:45.099]  This is to get everybody discouraged, Alex.
[01:01:45.099 --> 01:01:46.763]  This is to break the spirit.
[01:01:48.251 --> 01:01:54.354]  Of all of us that are out here trying to fight and get our country back, this is designed to break our spirit.
[01:01:54.354 --> 01:01:55.674]  Well, I don't think it's done that.
[01:01:55.674 --> 01:01:56.595]  I don't think it's done that.
[01:01:56.595 --> 01:01:57.955]  I think it's energized everybody.
[01:01:57.955 --> 01:02:00.056]  But, I mean, her going on the Aspen Institute.
[01:02:00.056 --> 01:02:00.896]  Have you seen the clip?
[01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:01.817]  It just happened an hour ago.
[01:02:01.817 --> 01:02:02.597]  We played it.
[01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:04.618]  Where she says, I'm going to decide.
[01:02:04.618 --> 01:02:09.680]  She goes, recusing myself, no, but I'm not involved, but I decide whether we prosecute.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.761]  I'm going to double speak.
[01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.722]  Listen, here's what they're doing.
[01:02:13.722 --> 01:02:16.643]  She's not going to be indicted.
[01:02:17.498 --> 01:02:19.039]  It's over.
[01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:20.000]  It's over.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.142]  She's not going to be indicted.
[01:02:22.142 --> 01:02:23.463]  So that's the decision.
[01:02:23.463 --> 01:02:28.167]  So they're rubbing our noses in it, squatting in our face, letting us know.
[01:02:28.167 --> 01:02:35.533]  And if anyone, what that meeting was about for those career prosecutors, she's not going to be indicted.
[01:02:35.533 --> 01:02:40.798]  But there's going to be all kind of searching and talking to these prosecutors that have worked on the case.
[01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:41.999]  And if any one of them
[01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:48.863]  There to open their mouth and to say that they were coerced into backing off an indictment.
[01:02:48.863 --> 01:02:51.644]  She now has something to hand them.
[01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:58.826]  Two of, I'm just giving two, just two, two of the federal prosecutors working on this case.
[01:02:58.826 --> 01:03:01.226]  One of them is a pedophile.
[01:03:01.226 --> 01:03:05.227]  One of them has a male lover and he's a male.
[01:03:06.127 --> 01:03:09.249]  Now that being a queer doesn't mean much anymore.
[01:03:09.249 --> 01:03:11.611]  And of course this is done on purpose.
[01:03:11.611 --> 01:03:16.154]  On purpose they have people put in that are compromised to do the investigation to blow it later.
[01:03:16.154 --> 01:03:17.154]  Absolutely.
[01:03:17.154 --> 01:03:18.155]  Absolutely.
[01:03:18.155 --> 01:03:21.157]  So they're going to make a point to prove.
[01:03:21.157 --> 01:03:27.661]  Now remember Alex, she's not going to be indicted.
[01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:31.443]  And there's going to be hell raised when she's not.
[01:03:31.443 --> 01:03:33.645]  Especially after this meeting, you know that.
[01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:42.446]  That's why he had to tell her, get your pen sharpened, ready to indict people for hate speech.
[01:03:42.446 --> 01:03:54.012]  We won't have to indict a lot, but we'll have to indict enough to get everybody... Sure, and could he pull another OKC to blend the Liberty Movement like last time he was hanging on by his fingernails?
[01:03:54.012 --> 01:03:55.013]  You bet!
[01:03:55.013 --> 01:03:57.394]  Now, I'm telling you, that's what went down.
[01:03:57.394 --> 01:03:58.855]  It was one of those three.
[01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:02.355]  Or, all of those three.
[01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:04.075]  Probably all.
[01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.976]  But I guarantee you... Alex, I pray that you're right.
[01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.997]  That as of yet, as of yet, I have not seen him.
[01:04:08.997 --> 01:04:12.178]  Now, I will tell you this, and your audience needs to write this down, please.
[01:04:12.178 --> 01:04:12.218]  40-40-20.
[01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:30.612]  It's the rule of law in life, in politics especially.
[01:04:30.612 --> 01:04:35.116]  40% are gonna love Hillary, 40% are gonna hate her.
[01:04:35.116 --> 01:04:40.361]  You can give gold bricks to the ones that hate her, they're still gonna hate her.
[01:04:40.361 --> 01:04:40.661]  40-40-20.
[01:04:40.661 --> 01:04:42.183]  20% they call undecided.
[01:04:42.183 --> 01:04:43.364]  I call them don't care.
[01:04:43.364 --> 01:04:47.167]  If you're undecided, that means you're studying it and trying to figure it out.
[01:04:47.167 --> 01:04:48.448]  That 20% don't care.
[01:04:48.448 --> 01:04:49.449]  They're playing ball.
[01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:51.091]  They're at the bar or whatever.
[01:04:51.917 --> 01:04:58.041]  Now, when you see these polls, Alex, showing Hillary up 6 or 7 points or 8 or 12.
[01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:58.961]  Yes, they're bold.
[01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:00.322]  That's to get Trump.
[01:05:00.322 --> 01:05:00.903]  Sure, feather.
[01:05:00.903 --> 01:05:01.623]  That's to get Trump.
[01:05:01.623 --> 01:05:09.408]  Barack Obama's propaganda tool clock boy, Ahmed Mohammed, talks about life and guitar and what he's learned about hate.
[01:05:09.408 --> 01:05:14.071]  Ahmed, the Muslim teenager who was suspended for bringing a homemade clock that looked like a ****.
[01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:22.096]  He's no longer surprised when people recognize him since his arrest at Irvine's MacArthur High School in September, when he brought a homemade cloth.
[01:05:22.096 --> 01:05:24.018]  No, it's not a homemade cloth.
[01:05:24.018 --> 01:05:27.960]  You took a cloth, then you gutted it, and you laid it in a suitcase to look like a f***ing bomb.
[01:05:44.452 --> 01:05:47.995]  Anybody in their right mind would have said that looks like a f***ing bomb.
[01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:54.681]  But because you're Arabic, we have to all sit around and bow down while you go eat at the White House with the Islam in chief.
[01:05:54.681 --> 01:05:57.324]  Hands across America for this clock, boy.
[01:05:57.324 --> 01:05:57.984]  Negative.
[01:05:57.984 --> 01:06:00.547]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:06:01.167 --> 01:06:01.707]  Not a group.
[01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:03.128]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:06:03.128 --> 01:06:04.449]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:06:04.449 --> 01:06:05.670]  Why is this so good?
[01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:10.953]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:06:10.953 --> 01:06:24.501]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:25.842]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:06:26.642 --> 01:06:28.285]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:30.849]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:32.150]  These are all parasites.
[01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:33.252]  Tell us about all the stuff you said.
[01:06:33.252 --> 01:06:34.274]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:06:34.605 --> 01:06:39.087]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[01:06:39.087 --> 01:06:42.369]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:45.451]  All right, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:46.491]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:48.412]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:48.412 --> 01:06:49.433]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:06:49.433 --> 01:06:52.134]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:06:52.134 --> 01:06:54.055]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:06:54.055 --> 01:06:55.416]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:57.657]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:06:57.657 --> 01:06:59.618]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:07:01.249 --> 01:07:09.433]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:07:09.433 --> 01:07:10.233]  Here's why.
[01:07:10.233 --> 01:07:14.395]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:07:14.395 --> 01:07:15.315]  So please listen.
[01:07:15.315 --> 01:07:19.017]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:07:19.017 --> 01:07:25.400]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.721]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:29.762]  Intensifying civil unrest.
[01:07:29.762 --> 01:07:32.703]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:07:32.703 --> 01:07:35.045]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:07:35.045 --> 01:07:39.867]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:46.610]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:48.371]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:07:48.371 --> 01:07:50.052]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:50.052 --> 01:07:51.793]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:07:51.793 --> 01:07:55.455]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:07:55.635 --> 01:07:57.196]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:57.196 --> 01:08:04.121]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:10.766]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.766 --> 01:08:13.749]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:30.791 --> 01:08:40.356]  I tell you, this is such an incredible news day, just to witness all the things that are happening around us in our world.
[01:08:40.356 --> 01:08:54.963]  We have the sitting Attorney General, who is a complete political operative of the Clintons, Loretta Lynch, meeting on the tarmac days ago secretly with Bill Clinton.
[01:08:55.854 --> 01:09:02.056]  They ordered, the FBI ordered, this is ABC News reporters have gone public and others.
[01:09:02.056 --> 01:09:03.716]  We played the clip last hour.
[01:09:03.716 --> 01:09:06.097]  We'll play it again this hour.
[01:09:06.097 --> 01:09:11.738]  And said we were told to turn our cameras off and to basically not talk about it.
[01:09:11.738 --> 01:09:15.759]  And see, they pre-vet the questions now at these press conferences.
[01:09:15.759 --> 01:09:22.701]  So if you don't go along with the pre-vetting and you ever basically ask a real question, you get kicked out of the so-called press corps.
[01:09:25.342 --> 01:09:34.749]  So they're so arrogant that they would meet, and it took days for this to even come out.
[01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:37.231]  And then she went and spoke today at the Aspen Institute.
[01:09:37.231 --> 01:09:38.392]  We played this clip last hour.
[01:09:38.392 --> 01:09:48.420]  We're going to play it for Dan Bongino, former senior Secret Service agent who's quit because things were so corrupt and valiantly been exposing what's happened.
[01:09:50.595 --> 01:09:55.056]  Not only in front of the press corps, there were reportedly more than 50 different people there.
[01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:58.317]  They were so confident, they said, you don't talk about this, turn your cameras off.
[01:09:58.317 --> 01:10:03.479]  They march on, when the press was there to try to talk to her about the Hillary investigation.
[01:10:03.479 --> 01:10:09.340]  Arrogantly in front of her, engaging in serious criminal activity.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.002]  Don't just recuse yourself, I mean, she's the person sitting over all this, and then she tells the Aspen Institute, today.
[01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:19.604]  Oh, I don't need to refuse myself because I'm not involved.
[01:10:19.604 --> 01:10:23.850]  I'm going to take his recommendation.
[01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:31.040]  But I'm going to have it reviewed by senior career Justice Department people under me and myself.
[01:10:32.321 --> 01:10:36.543]  She said, and the FBI Director can look at it too, but I'll make the determination.
[01:10:36.543 --> 01:10:38.224]  We will make the determination.
[01:10:38.224 --> 01:10:39.785]  Unbelievable.
[01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:45.088]  That means all the President's got to do is put his Attorney General in, or she can, and they're invincible.
[01:10:45.088 --> 01:10:48.650]  Well, Nixon tried that and you saw what happened, and his crimes were tiny.
[01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:50.351]  I think he should have been impeached.
[01:10:50.351 --> 01:10:53.773]  Because you can't set the precedent and let them do this, or they grow into these monstrous crimes.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:05.632]  This is the most naked, above-the-law, arrogant hubris I have ever seen, and even leftist pundits and people are freaking out.
[01:11:05.632 --> 01:11:08.074]  I mean, I think they've gone too far.
[01:11:08.074 --> 01:11:14.602]  I had Larry Nichols, who was the big Clinton insider, and he helped train Bill Clinton.
[01:11:14.602 --> 01:11:15.383]  And he said, look,
[01:11:16.809 --> 01:11:26.816]  I guarantee you he was on that plane saying, you'll be protected, you'll be kept in office, you'll be given a lot of great business deals, and here's a sheet of paper with the dirt on these prosecutors.
[01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:35.822]  And he listed two of the investigators, two of the people that are being part of the investigation, and Nichols has been pretty accurate in the past with his sources.
[01:11:35.822 --> 01:11:38.684]  He says that they're blackmailing him.
[01:11:38.684 --> 01:11:40.085]  Well, of course, that's what the Clintons do.
[01:11:40.085 --> 01:11:41.986]  These are horrible people.
[01:11:41.986 --> 01:11:45.248]  We had a former senior Secret Service agent on yesterday, Mr. Byrne.
[01:11:46.529 --> 01:11:50.911]  Uh, who said, quote, Hillary wants to establish a socialist dictatorship.
[01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:51.611]  She's scary.
[01:11:51.611 --> 01:11:52.872]  She's mean.
[01:11:52.872 --> 01:11:55.813]  I wouldn't go public and risk my life if they weren't so dangerous.
[01:11:55.813 --> 01:11:58.354]  That interview is up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:58.354 --> 01:12:03.696]  Mr. Bongino left and just ran for office and wrote a book exposing that America's in trouble.
[01:12:03.696 --> 01:12:05.197]  And he got harassed.
[01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:07.858]  So, uh, these are very serious thugs.
[01:12:07.858 --> 01:12:13.320]  I was told in 1998, you will stop talking about Clintons that are going to be fired.
[01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:15.512]  On my little radio station.
[01:12:15.512 --> 01:12:25.378]  And then I later learned the Clintons had gotten involved and had literally put pressure on the communications company.
[01:12:25.378 --> 01:12:27.319]  And then when I didn't shut up, I got fired.
[01:12:27.319 --> 01:12:29.360]  And then the harassment intensified.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.901]  And I had an unlisted number.
[01:12:30.901 --> 01:12:33.623]  These people would call up and say, listen, you want something else to happen?
[01:12:33.623 --> 01:12:34.284]  Stop it.
[01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:35.865]  And that's how arrogant they were back then.
[01:12:35.865 --> 01:12:37.726]  They were even worried about little regional talk show hosts.
[01:12:39.019 --> 01:12:44.610]  And the Clinton Foundation documents that have come out from lawsuits that WorldNetDaily did showed, even back in 1991, 1992, 1993, when they were governors.
[01:12:48.404 --> 01:12:52.146]  And then when they got into office, they were worried about the press and controlling press.
[01:12:52.146 --> 01:12:56.169]  And remember out in California, the Laugh Stop, one of the biggest laugh places?
[01:12:56.169 --> 01:12:59.431]  Hillary's people saw a guy making fun of her on YouTube from there.
[01:12:59.431 --> 01:13:01.492]  They called and threatened them and said, we can shut you down.
[01:13:01.492 --> 01:13:02.953]  Remember that last year?
[01:13:02.953 --> 01:13:08.336]  I mean, this is a very vindictive, crazy lady, because what about the Streisand effect?
[01:13:08.336 --> 01:13:14.120]  You know, when you criticize stuff on the internet or a news report, especially when you're guilty, it only gives it more attention.
[01:13:15.026 --> 01:13:17.687]  Goes back to Shakespeare, me thinks you protest too much.
[01:13:17.687 --> 01:13:26.789]  Now I'm not the criminologist like former senior New York cop and detective and then top Secret Service agent used to run the foreign details and just said things are so bad I have to leave.
[01:13:26.789 --> 01:13:28.789]  He joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:13:28.789 --> 01:13:31.250]  Dan Bongino, just so much to cover.
[01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.431]  A lot of stations just joined us so I gave people some more background.
[01:13:34.431 --> 01:13:34.911]  Bongino.com.
[01:13:36.431 --> 01:13:40.254]  I really appreciate him joining us today.
[01:13:40.254 --> 01:13:44.957]  Dan, I know you saw a lot of stuff you can't talk about that you told me, quote, was worse than I was saying.
[01:13:44.957 --> 01:13:47.519]  But I know you got calls claiming that you gave me info.
[01:13:47.519 --> 01:13:48.700]  You gave me nothing.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.740]  It was all live on air.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.202]  So I actually got threatened some more.
[01:13:52.202 --> 01:13:54.804]  But I mean, is this what you're talking about?
[01:13:54.804 --> 01:13:55.785]  Because this is just so...
[01:13:57.006 --> 01:13:59.389]  This is so The Godfather, but out in the open.
[01:13:59.389 --> 01:14:05.417]  You know, The Godfather meets James Bond villains meeting on a tarmac and telling the FBI to keep everybody quiet.
[01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:08.381]  I mean, this is just over the top.
[01:14:08.381 --> 01:14:10.804]  Dan, what's going on here?
[01:14:10.804 --> 01:14:12.025]  And Alex, you know what they do?
[01:14:12.025 --> 01:14:13.247]  They rely on
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:28.690]  Diminishing voices outside of the mainstream media apparatus, you know, like you and I do a podcast as well, they rely on diminishing those voices to make you believe that we're all the crazy ones, right?
[01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.471]  So let's just walk through.
[01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:35.955]  We have the IRS, which has already publicly acknowledged that they were targeting conservatives.
[01:14:36.635 --> 01:14:47.459]  We have the Secretary of State, the Democratic presumptive nominee for president, basically trading national security secrets with foreign government across an unsecured server.
[01:14:47.459 --> 01:14:48.399]  By the way, she knew.
[01:14:48.399 --> 01:14:50.400]  I said this the last time I was on your show.
[01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:55.512]  Their team, I should say, knew the server was hacked and did nothing about it.
[01:14:55.512 --> 01:15:04.016]  You know, we have a country right now where the Attorney General goes on a plane and meets with the husband of a potential, you know, federal criminal.
[01:15:04.016 --> 01:15:06.457]  And then, you know, no big deal to the White House.
[01:15:06.457 --> 01:15:09.079]  I mean, the list, Alex, goes on and on and on.
[01:15:09.079 --> 01:15:10.259]  And what do they do?
[01:15:10.259 --> 01:15:14.881]  They go after other voices that are kind of calling truth to this and say, oh, look at them.
[01:15:14.881 --> 01:15:17.222]  They must all be tinfoil cap guys.
[01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:18.403]  They're all crazy folks.
[01:15:18.403 --> 01:15:20.324]  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:25.683]  It's really disturbing where we are right now as a country and this is the way they get it done.
[01:15:25.683 --> 01:15:30.827]  They do it and they laugh at everybody else for calling attention to it and the lemmings just play along.
[01:15:33.035 --> 01:15:52.486]  Again, I'm not a criminologist like you or a guy with decades of experience, but I mean, for me, Dan, for me, the FBI, according to a bunch of members of the press, ordering them, don't videotape this, don't talk about this, that really, to me, shows the criminal intent of Lynch and Clinton, that officially, hey, don't talk about this.
[01:15:52.486 --> 01:15:56.689]  I mean, for me, I think that takes it over the edge, and we don't just need some special investigator.
[01:15:56.689 --> 01:16:00.371]  I mean, I really think we need grand juries to start looking at indicting Lynch.
[01:16:02.045 --> 01:16:15.469]  Well, I don't know if the elements are there, and, you know, listen, this was obviously a, uh, I don't know, I don't have enough adjectives to describe how disturbing her behavior in office has been.
[01:16:15.469 --> 01:16:16.510]  A bad call?
[01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:21.391]  I mean, it's understating this by a factor of a thousand.
[01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:28.073]  You had the sitting Attorney General of the United States responsible for the oversight of the, obviously, the entire Department of Justice.
[01:16:28.073 --> 01:16:30.394]  Who's being criticized for covering for the Clintons.
[01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:32.744]  Right, right!
[01:16:32.744 --> 01:16:34.265]  Meeting with the husband.
[01:16:34.265 --> 01:16:37.366]  It's irrelevant that he's a former president.
[01:16:37.366 --> 01:16:38.907]  He's an American citizen, too.
[01:16:38.907 --> 01:16:41.489]  He's subject to the same laws you and I are.
[01:16:41.489 --> 01:16:45.891]  On a private plane, and as you accurately stated, they don't want any publicity.
[01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:47.272]  They don't want anyone to know.
[01:16:47.272 --> 01:16:49.353]  They want like a cloak and dagger type thing.
[01:16:49.353 --> 01:16:53.795]  And nobody finds this even remotely disturbing on the left.
[01:16:53.795 --> 01:16:55.716]  You know, Alex, this is serious stuff.
[01:16:55.716 --> 01:16:56.697]  And the one thing I've always
[01:16:57.466 --> 01:17:03.011]  I'm deeply respected about the conservatarians out there, the good constitutional conservators and the libertarians.
[01:17:03.011 --> 01:17:05.292]  They have a set of rules and principles.
[01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:07.975]  And I'll tell you what, they don't care what you put in front of your name.
[01:17:07.975 --> 01:17:10.857]  An R, a D, an L, a G for green.
[01:17:10.857 --> 01:17:12.558]  They couldn't give a hoot.
[01:17:12.558 --> 01:17:15.821]  All they care about is you violate those principles, they're coming after you too.
[01:17:15.821 --> 01:17:18.083]  And they're going to make sure you get out of office.
[01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:25.129]  My problem with the far left, not all Democrats, because a lot of Democrats are fed up with this crap too, but with the far left is they don't care, Alex.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.300]  Come after us, go after the rioters!
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.701]  They're a cult!
[01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:47.545]  In fact, the more corruption... I'll never forget MSNBC, on a bunch of their shows, we did a compilation video of Carlos Watson and Matt Al, all of them going, yes of course we're going after Christian and veterans and groups, you're racist tea parties, you deserve it!
[01:17:47.545 --> 01:17:54.026]  I mean, it's totally illegal, it's totally criminal, they just dehumanize us and call us racist, so it's okay to have the IRS persecute everybody.
[01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:56.274]  I mean they're proud of that.
[01:17:56.274 --> 01:18:00.157]  It's very authoritarian, very brown shirt.
[01:18:00.157 --> 01:18:10.725]  I heard a clip yesterday with Christiane Amanpour, they used the accent they used on the show, arguing with a good conservative, Daniel Hannan.
[01:18:11.169 --> 01:18:12.911]  And it was from a CNN clip.
[01:18:12.911 --> 01:18:22.442]  And it's amazing, after the Brexit, this is to show you how the left works and how they just prosper on division politics and dividing up the country and causing animosity.
[01:18:22.442 --> 01:18:28.329]  And she's insisting that there was some anti-Muslim or whatever it is graffiti
[01:18:28.849 --> 01:18:41.978]  In Poland, it was like an isolated incident, and she's trying to blame people who don't want the EU, don't want these new foreign bureaucrats overseeing their local economy.
[01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:45.040]  She's trying to paint them as a bunch of racists, as if they caused it.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.542]  You saw the same thing at these Trump rallies.
[01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:50.664]  Listen, regardless of your take on Trump, pro, con, or whatever.
[01:18:51.264 --> 01:18:52.946]  Trump has the right to say what he wants.
[01:18:52.946 --> 01:18:53.927]  It's a free country.
[01:18:53.927 --> 01:18:55.169]  We have the right to free speech.
[01:18:55.169 --> 01:18:57.131]  I mean, you don't incite violence anywhere else.
[01:18:57.131 --> 01:18:58.372]  So what does the left do?
[01:18:58.372 --> 01:19:00.014]  They go attack people.
[01:19:00.014 --> 01:19:01.296]  They're stalking people.
[01:19:01.296 --> 01:19:03.058]  They're breaking people's noses.
[01:19:03.058 --> 01:19:05.140]  And what's the media take on the left?
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.822]  Oh yeah, Trump did it.
[01:19:06.822 --> 01:19:07.343]  Excuse me?
[01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:08.284]  So let me get this straight.
[01:19:08.772 --> 01:19:14.918]  People on the right are like, we get it, not all Muslims are responsible for the behavior of a few terrorists out there.
[01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:24.626]  But on the left, the left take is, Trump says something, every single conservative and libertarian is now responsible for some rhetoric from the Trump campaign.
[01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:32.653]  I know, even the LA Times and the mayor there in Sacramento, when it was men with Mexican flags beating up a white woman, bloodying her.
[01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:35.916]  For no reason, and the media is like, well, she deserves it.
[01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:38.057]  I mean, it's a new level.
[01:19:38.057 --> 01:19:42.159]  You imagine if it was a bunch of gringos beating up a Hispanic lady, there'd be riots nationwide.
[01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:43.020]  There should be.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.521]  I mean, it's out of control.
[01:19:44.521 --> 01:19:45.842]  But look at these headlines.
[01:19:45.842 --> 01:19:50.504]  Suspected Istanbul attack mastermind was a refugee protected by the EU.
[01:19:50.504 --> 01:19:51.765]  It's the same thing every time.
[01:19:51.765 --> 01:19:52.265]  Look at this one.
[01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:53.306]  Swedish woman.
[01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:57.929]  The police are giving him bracelets that tell Muslim men, don't rape me.
[01:19:57.929 --> 01:20:00.010]  I mean, it's just getting crazier and crazier.
[01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:01.091]  What is the sickening
[01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:06.957]  Love affair with the left with Orthodox radical Islam that seems to be taking over.
[01:20:06.957 --> 01:20:08.518]  I mean, what is their problem?
[01:20:08.518 --> 01:20:09.239]  I don't understand it.
[01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:10.100]  All right.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.081]  This is important.
[01:20:11.081 --> 01:20:14.664]  And you know, your audience is a pretty smart crowd over there.
[01:20:14.664 --> 01:20:16.506]  There's a twofold reason for this.
[01:20:16.506 --> 01:20:19.129]  If you don't understand the why, you know, the why matters folks.
[01:20:19.528 --> 01:20:22.209]  No, the whole thing, this is a useless conversation.
[01:20:22.209 --> 01:20:23.409]  You gotta understand the why.
[01:20:23.409 --> 01:20:26.610]  The Obama administration will not say radical Islam for two reasons.
[01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:33.352]  Number one, the terrorism issue does not work for him politically, and Barack Obama is a political person first.
[01:20:33.352 --> 01:20:36.453]  Everything else is a distant second, if there at all.
[01:20:36.453 --> 01:20:39.094]  He cares purely about politics and tactics.
[01:20:39.094 --> 01:20:45.056]  The terrorism issue does not work for him anymore, because the Democratic Party is not serious about it.
[01:20:45.535 --> 01:20:48.377]  Secondly, they practice division politics.
[01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:49.757]  It's all they have, Alex.
[01:20:49.757 --> 01:20:52.679]  They don't run campaign signs.
[01:20:52.679 --> 01:20:53.820]  Vote Barack Obama.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.180]  Vote for a tax hike.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.742]  Vote for the worst recovery from a recession in modern American history.
[01:20:58.742 --> 01:21:01.824]  Vote for Obamacare so your costs go up and you lose your docket.
[01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:02.804]  That's not their campaign sign.
[01:21:02.804 --> 01:21:05.346]  They can't say vote for four more years of the giant screwjob.
[01:21:06.539 --> 01:21:08.521]  No they can't, so what do they do?
[01:21:08.521 --> 01:21:11.384]  They get you to vote against the other guy.
[01:21:11.384 --> 01:21:13.647]  The exit polls are conclusive on this.
[01:21:13.647 --> 01:21:17.851]  Romney beat him in every single category except the one category that mattered.
[01:21:17.851 --> 01:21:20.034]  Who cares more about people like you?
[01:21:20.034 --> 01:21:21.836]  The left is not stupid.
[01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:22.957]  The way they get you to-
[01:21:23.097 --> 01:21:24.538]  How do we counter identity politics?
[01:21:24.538 --> 01:21:25.098]  How do we counter it?
[01:21:25.098 --> 01:21:26.959]  Because listen, I know the police aren't perfect.
[01:21:26.959 --> 01:21:29.181]  I criticize bad departments and bad people.
[01:21:29.181 --> 01:21:32.943]  But it's not, I mean, a thousand people get killed a year by the cops.
[01:21:32.943 --> 01:21:35.004]  They admit 90 plus percent of that's legitimate.
[01:21:35.004 --> 01:21:38.666]  Maybe it's 100 plus innocent people killed a year out of 330 million.
[01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:40.147]  That's not our biggest issue.
[01:21:40.147 --> 01:21:41.468]  George Soros finances.
[01:21:42.188 --> 01:21:46.051]  All over the place, overthrow of governments on an anti-police agenda.
[01:21:46.051 --> 01:21:50.433]  Ukraine, other countries they've actually done it.
[01:21:50.433 --> 01:21:51.654]  Egypt was done.
[01:21:51.654 --> 01:21:54.476]  Now they're doing that here with hundreds of millions being spent.
[01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.217]  I know you have your ear to the ground on this.
[01:21:56.217 --> 01:21:59.339]  On a true war on police, to blame police for everything.
[01:21:59.679 --> 01:22:04.143]  So they stand down, there's crime waves, then federal control comes in.
[01:22:04.143 --> 01:22:08.186]  But I really see it waking the police up, though, to this whole globalist agenda.
[01:22:08.186 --> 01:22:09.827]  But what's the inside baseball?
[01:22:09.827 --> 01:22:13.690]  Dan Bongino, former senior Secret Service agent, former New York cop.
[01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.171]  What's going on with the war on police?
[01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:18.134]  Because you talk about a whole divide-and-conquer strategy.
[01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:19.575]  What is that crazy strategy?
[01:22:20.819 --> 01:22:26.541]  Yeah, this is another... The left, they have this interesting issue with authority.
[01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:29.983]  They love authority everywhere else but when it actually matters.
[01:22:29.983 --> 01:22:34.945]  They'll regulate the stream in your backyard, literally, through the waters of the United States.
[01:22:34.945 --> 01:22:36.125]  I'm not making that up.
[01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:40.147]  They can arrest you if you dig a cow pond on your own property.
[01:22:41.418 --> 01:22:41.998]  Yes!
[01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:50.560]  I mean, look at the Gibson Guitar Factory for importing a form of wood that didn't meet with this ridiculous act nobody pays attention to.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.461]  But yet you impose a very basic regulation on a Texas abortion clinic.
[01:22:54.461 --> 01:23:02.423]  Like, hey, I got this idea that if you're going to do an abortion and the woman may die, the abortion doctor should at least be able to have admitting privileges to a hospital.
[01:23:02.423 --> 01:23:03.303]  No, no, no.
[01:23:03.303 --> 01:23:04.083]  We don't want that.
[01:23:04.683 --> 01:23:11.725]  The war against police is an issue that appeals to a far-left radical wing that motivates them to go out to the polls.
[01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:14.026]  Alex, it's no more complicated than that.
[01:23:14.026 --> 01:23:17.487]  I would love to give you a fancy explanation ideologically.
[01:23:17.487 --> 01:23:20.768]  But I mean, take Chicago.
[01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:22.168]  The Democrats run it.
[01:23:22.168 --> 01:23:23.068]  It's got problems.
[01:23:23.068 --> 01:23:28.590]  But since they have blamed the police for everything and done all this, now the crime rate's doubled and tripled.
[01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:29.730]  Everything's collapsing.
[01:23:29.730 --> 01:23:32.411]  I mean, don't they understand that that's what they're causing?
[01:23:33.752 --> 01:23:35.173]  Of course they understand!
[01:23:35.173 --> 01:23:37.773]  You know, what's the famous quote about liberalism?
[01:23:37.773 --> 01:23:39.854]  It cares about the world, in theory.
[01:23:39.854 --> 01:23:42.195]  It's the real world it has a problem with.
[01:23:42.195 --> 01:23:45.576]  Alex, these people don't give a hoot about results.
[01:23:45.576 --> 01:23:48.277]  Their agenda has always been control.
[01:23:50.437 --> 01:23:53.781]  Yes, when you get that through your head, all of this makes sense.
[01:23:53.781 --> 01:23:55.523]  It's not about economic growth.
[01:23:55.523 --> 01:24:02.551]  It's about economic control through heavy taxation and regulations that dictate the market for the left.
[01:24:02.551 --> 01:24:04.033]  The same thing about Obamacare.
[01:24:04.033 --> 01:24:05.414]  This isn't a failure.
[01:24:05.414 --> 01:24:07.016]  This is a resounding success story.
[01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:08.617]  Bongino.com.
[01:24:08.617 --> 01:24:09.938]  Dan, I want to talk to you about your book.
[01:24:09.938 --> 01:24:12.699]  I want to talk about Trump, the few minutes we have left, and everything else that's happening.
[01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:17.322]  But getting back to the whole destabilization program, I mean, I get it.
[01:24:17.322 --> 01:24:24.347]  They want to destabilize because they get funding out of the crisis, they get control, they get to pose as saviors and change the subject from all their other failure.
[01:24:24.347 --> 01:24:26.748]  But at a certain point, the chickens have to come home to roost.
[01:24:26.748 --> 01:24:29.090]  You worked for many years inside the Obama administration.
[01:24:30.225 --> 01:24:32.186]  Inside others as well.
[01:24:32.186 --> 01:24:39.531]  Know the dynamic between the Clintons and the Obamas and the different power structures in the Democratic Party.
[01:24:39.531 --> 01:24:42.052]  Your best understanding of it.
[01:24:42.052 --> 01:24:43.333]  Are they one big team?
[01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:44.914]  Is there two different sides?
[01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:46.895]  Do you think Hillary's invincible?
[01:24:46.895 --> 01:24:47.656]  What's the word?
[01:24:47.656 --> 01:24:48.816]  I mean, can she do anything?
[01:24:48.816 --> 01:24:49.817]  Will she ever get indicted?
[01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:53.193]  I think she will get indicted.
[01:24:53.193 --> 01:24:54.294]  I think that's going to happen.
[01:24:54.294 --> 01:24:56.779]  I got some pretty good contacts on this too.
[01:24:56.779 --> 01:25:00.124]  But no, they're not buddies in the traditional sense.
[01:25:00.124 --> 01:25:02.969]  The Obama team and the Clinton team are definitely
[01:25:05.676 --> 01:25:15.358]  Allies when they need to be, but Bill Clinton has a big ego and he doesn't like the fact that Barack Obama has taken the mantle of the far left and become their new hero.
[01:25:15.358 --> 01:25:21.500]  So they're definitely not friends in that sense, but they are allies when they need to be to advance an agenda.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:29.381]  That agenda right now is getting Hillary Clinton and the White House to continue these seven-plus disastrous years of Obama.
[01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:30.781]  Hey, one quick thing on this.
[01:25:30.781 --> 01:25:32.022]  I can show this to you pretty clearly.
[01:25:33.542 --> 01:25:38.986]  You know, Bill Clinton, when he spoke for Barack Obama at the convention on his re-election effort, he didn't want to do that.
[01:25:38.986 --> 01:25:40.387]  There was a deal cut for that.
[01:25:40.387 --> 01:25:42.349]  You know, they had a cut, some kind of a deal.
[01:25:42.349 --> 01:25:48.213]  And the deal, I think, I didn't hear it with my own ears, but it was reported in a couple different places.
[01:25:48.213 --> 01:25:51.796]  The deal was that, you know, Barack Obama would support Hillary Clinton later on.
[01:25:51.796 --> 01:25:53.958]  So, they're not friends in the traditional sense.
[01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:55.099]  They're allies when they need to be.
[01:25:56.596 --> 01:25:59.177]  Well, I hope you're right, because justice needs it.
[01:25:59.177 --> 01:26:04.539]  I know a lot of cynical conservatives that go, oh, let Hillary get in, you know, we'll make even more money and have bigger audiences.
[01:26:04.539 --> 01:26:06.060]  I could care less about that.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.941]  I mean, she might completely destroy the country.
[01:26:08.941 --> 01:26:13.242]  I don't care, you know, if Trump gets in and things get a little bit better and our audience isn't as big.
[01:26:13.242 --> 01:26:13.623]  Great!
[01:26:13.623 --> 01:26:15.943]  I mean, this isn't about... I'm not them.
[01:26:15.943 --> 01:26:18.044]  I don't want a big crisis so I can be the savior.
[01:26:18.044 --> 01:26:20.845]  I don't want to not, you know, have the whole society collapse.
[01:26:20.845 --> 01:26:24.727]  But I got to tell you, watching Lynch in this earlier
[01:26:25.467 --> 01:26:26.428]  Yeah, I mean, totally unsurprising.
[01:26:26.428 --> 01:26:28.428]  Again, when you're a far leftist and control is your agenda in the end,
[01:26:46.562 --> 01:26:51.944]  You don't really care about what the public perception is, but she has power, she's not gonna go anywhere.
[01:26:51.944 --> 01:26:53.244]  Totally unsurprising.
[01:26:53.244 --> 01:26:57.366]  Sure, but if Nixon's Attorney General said, I'm gonna decide, I mean, that'd have been the end right there.
[01:26:57.366 --> 01:26:59.326]  That is arrogant.
[01:26:59.326 --> 01:27:06.649]  Yeah, well, that's because, you know, conservatives, there were people like, you know, Larry Hogan in Congress at the time, who were Republicans, who stopped Nixon.
[01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:09.210]  But, you know, where are the liberals stopping Obama?
[01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:09.970]  The answer is nowhere.
[01:27:11.604 --> 01:27:14.286]  I tell you, it's so incredible.
[01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:21.351]  In closing then, talk about your, usually you don't give us stuff that's with sources and you get blamed for doing that, but you're saying you have pretty good sources.
[01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:29.817]  Please elaborate, Mr. Bongino, former Secret Service agent, high level, the good news that you think things are going towards indictment.
[01:27:29.817 --> 01:27:30.498]  Yeah, I do.
[01:27:30.498 --> 01:27:33.160]  I've got a couple of friends here that
[01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:39.497]  You know, that have some decent information on this, and I think the indictment is going to happen.
[01:27:39.497 --> 01:27:49.389]  What I'm hearing is the career investigators who are working on this have kind of set an ultimatum, a de facto ultimatum, that, hey, listen, here's the deal.
[01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:50.731]  This is an open and shut case.
[01:27:51.192 --> 01:27:53.913]  You know, you have to run with this.
[01:27:53.913 --> 01:27:54.734]  It's clear as day.
[01:27:54.734 --> 01:27:55.994]  It's black and white.
[01:27:55.994 --> 01:28:00.096]  The elements of the crime necessary for prosecution are there.
[01:28:00.096 --> 01:28:02.857]  So I'm hearing they're going to recommend indictment.
[01:28:02.857 --> 01:28:09.200]  And Lynch said today, I think, to take the heat off her, which I think you saw this morning, that she's going to go with whatever the recommendation is.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.322]  She's not going to be able to run from that.
[01:28:11.322 --> 01:28:13.404]  I think Hillary Clinton... Well, that's what the press said.
[01:28:13.404 --> 01:28:14.646]  Because I've played the clip.
[01:28:14.646 --> 01:28:16.628]  I'm going to play it when we come back from break, but you have to go.
[01:28:16.628 --> 01:28:18.550]  If you can stay, I'll play it for you.
[01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:29.222]  But the point is, she sits there and she says, I'm going to take the recommendation, but then I'm going to have senior Justice Department people review it and look at it and see if it's right and whether we're going to go forward.
[01:28:29.222 --> 01:28:30.784]  So that, to me, says she's not.
[01:28:32.148 --> 01:28:34.169]  Yeah, there's always a caveat with the left.
[01:28:34.169 --> 01:28:43.255]  I know we've got to stay on top of them, but I think there were... You know what the problem is, Alex, is there's people like me out there who aren't going to take it anymore, who are just going to go public and... Well, exactly.
[01:28:43.255 --> 01:28:48.599]  So isn't that the trump card, or the ace in the hole, is that senior FBI agents and others have said, we're just going to leak the case?
[01:28:49.977 --> 01:28:53.439]  Yeah, because, you know, the media doesn't own the information environment anymore, Alex.
[01:28:53.439 --> 01:28:58.222]  You've got your show, you've got social media, you've got podcasting, Twitter, Facebook.
[01:28:58.222 --> 01:29:01.965]  You know, it's not up to Walter Cronkite anymore to make the story go away.
[01:29:01.965 --> 01:29:03.726]  I mean, it's just not going to go any further.
[01:29:03.726 --> 01:29:09.490]  The FBI guys, they'll be on your show two weeks after that decision is made not to indict one of them.
[01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:12.811]  You know, I mean, that's the way it works now, which is good.
[01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:15.091]  Sure, I never kissed Sean Hannity's butt.
[01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:22.233]  He's actually done some bad stuff to me years ago, but I know for a fact from inside Fox, he's been threatening things with the stuff he's doing and hasn't rolled over.
[01:29:22.233 --> 01:29:24.834]  Even the guys like that are willing to buck stuff.
[01:29:24.834 --> 01:29:28.534]  I mean, the establishment's got to know that America's not putting up with this anymore.
[01:29:28.534 --> 01:29:30.655]  Bobgino.com, glad to hear you're doing a radio show.
[01:29:30.655 --> 01:29:32.455]  Folks can find your book there.
[01:29:32.455 --> 01:29:33.836]  Dan, thank you so much for the time.
[01:29:33.836 --> 01:29:34.856]  Look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[01:29:37.697 --> 01:29:38.718]  That's a great guy right there.
[01:29:38.718 --> 01:29:39.578]  That's a lot of courage.
[01:29:39.578 --> 01:29:43.239]  Believe me, they really keep a close hold on those folks.
[01:29:43.239 --> 01:29:45.400]  We got big news coming up after the break.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.782]  Big news dealing with COG, continuity of government, stuff like martial law.
[01:29:50.782 --> 01:29:52.203]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.203 --> 01:29:54.724]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.724 --> 01:29:57.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.522 --> 01:30:03.543]  Article up by Associated Press.
[01:30:03.543 --> 01:30:07.046]  Pentagon ends ban on transgender troops in the military.
[01:30:07.046 --> 01:30:07.446]  Why?
[01:30:07.446 --> 01:30:09.927]  Because we're a f***ing social experiment now.
[01:30:09.927 --> 01:30:12.269]  We're not the fighting force we should be.
[01:30:12.269 --> 01:30:16.492]  Instead, we are a social experiment.
[01:30:16.492 --> 01:30:17.192]  Negative.
[01:30:17.192 --> 01:30:21.175]  We are men and women committed to fighting for our country.
[01:30:21.175 --> 01:30:26.558]  We don't worry about whether someone wants to cut off their genitalia, and we sure as f*** aren't paying for it.
[01:30:26.598 --> 01:30:28.360]  That's a personal choice.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.663]  Transgender people will be allowed to serve openly in the U.S.
[01:30:31.663 --> 01:30:34.185]  military the Pentagon announced Thursday.
[01:30:34.185 --> 01:30:36.928]  First we had the guys walking around in red high heels.
[01:30:36.928 --> 01:30:43.174]  Then we allow women who've never been in combat to lead and train soldiers in combat situations.
[01:30:43.174 --> 01:30:44.956]  And now you want to bring in this bulls**t.
[01:30:45.436 --> 01:30:57.302]  Under this new policy by October 1st, transgender troops already serving should be able to receive medical care and begin formally changing their gender identifications in this Pentagon's personal system.
[01:30:57.302 --> 01:31:00.864]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and I'm pretty f***ing pissed off.
[01:31:01.384 --> 01:31:09.567]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:31:09.567 --> 01:31:10.388]  Here's why.
[01:31:10.388 --> 01:31:14.529]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:31:14.529 --> 01:31:15.450]  So please listen.
[01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:19.151]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:31:19.151 --> 01:31:25.534]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:31:25.534 --> 01:31:27.855]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:29.896]  Intensifying civil unrest.
[01:31:29.896 --> 01:31:32.818]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:31:32.818 --> 01:31:35.179]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:31:35.179 --> 01:31:40.022]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[01:31:40.022 --> 01:31:46.746]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:31:46.746 --> 01:31:48.507]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:31:48.507 --> 01:31:50.188]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:31:50.188 --> 01:31:51.929]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:31:51.929 --> 01:31:55.591]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:31:55.771 --> 01:31:57.338]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:31:57.338 --> 01:31:58.704]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:32:01.055 --> 01:32:01.876]  Hey, everyone!
[01:32:01.876 --> 01:32:04.157]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:04.157 --> 01:32:08.000]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.081]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:10.081 --> 01:32:20.368]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:26.352]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:26.812 --> 01:32:41.812]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:32:41.852 --> 01:32:42.252]  I think so.
[01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:15.285]  You fully expect to accept the recommendations.
[01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:26.079]  One thing people were saying this morning when the news broke was that you were, quote, recusing yourself from having any kind of role in the final determination.
[01:33:26.079 --> 01:33:27.581]  Is that the case?
[01:33:27.581 --> 01:33:28.302]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:35.144]  Well, a recusal would mean that I wouldn't even be briefed on what the findings were, or what the actions going forward would be.
[01:33:35.144 --> 01:33:46.708]  And while I don't have a role in those findings, in coming up with those findings, or making those recommendations as to how to go forward, I'll be briefed on it, and I will be accepting their recommendations.
[01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:55.471]  And when you say, again, this must be the journalist in me and the linguist in me, accepting to me means, here Madam Attorney General, here are our findings, and you
[01:33:57.331 --> 01:34:01.515]  Completely accept them wholeheartedly and then issue them to the public?
[01:34:01.515 --> 01:34:03.616]  Or you accept them, look them over...
[01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:09.571]  And then make your own determination as to what the final determination will be.
[01:34:09.571 --> 01:34:15.614]  No, the final determination as to how to proceed will be contained within the recommendations in the report.
[01:34:15.614 --> 01:34:19.515]  In whatever format the team puts it together, that has not been resolved.
[01:34:19.515 --> 01:34:21.857]  Whatever report they provide to me.
[01:34:21.857 --> 01:34:24.618]  There will be a review of their investigation.
[01:34:24.618 --> 01:34:28.580]  There will be a review of what they have found and determined to have happened and occurred.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:32.462]  And there will be their determinations as to how they feel that the case should proceed.
[01:34:32.642 --> 01:34:37.645]  And when you say there will be a review, you mean the review will be done by you?
[01:34:37.645 --> 01:34:42.268]  Once you accept the recommendations and determinations?
[01:34:42.268 --> 01:34:44.749]  Or you're talking about the process of the review getting to that point?
[01:34:44.749 --> 01:34:48.131]  I'm talking about the initial process of how this case will be resolved.
[01:34:48.131 --> 01:34:52.454]  This case will be resolved by the team that's been working on it from the beginning.
[01:34:52.454 --> 01:34:55.376]  Supervisors always review matters.
[01:34:55.376 --> 01:34:58.878]  In this case, that review will be career people in the Department of Justice.
[01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:10.706]  And also the FBI will review it, up to and including the FBI director, and that will be the finalization of not just the factual findings, but the next steps in this matter.
[01:35:10.706 --> 01:35:19.052]  And I find it interesting, several times now you've made a point of saying career prosecutors, career officials within the Justice Department.
[01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:23.295]  Why are you making that very hard distinction, that description?
[01:35:23.695 --> 01:35:42.445]  I think a lot of the questions that I've gotten over the past several months, frankly, about my role in this investigation and what it would likely be was a question or a concern about whether someone who was a political appointee would be involved in deciding how to investigate a matter.
[01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:43.286]  They're all political appointees.
[01:35:43.286 --> 01:35:44.527]  Or what something meant.
[01:35:44.527 --> 01:35:47.448]  Or how should the case proceed going forward.
[01:35:47.448 --> 01:35:48.289]  That's enough.
[01:35:48.289 --> 01:35:50.690]  Dr. Groob's riding shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:35:50.690 --> 01:35:52.111]  He wanted to come in because
[01:35:52.751 --> 01:35:58.321]  He's got a lot of really interesting military sources from the Global Healing Center over the years, helping veterans.
[01:35:58.321 --> 01:35:59.623]  He himself is an Army veteran.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:08.266]  And, you know, he was telling me on the phone a few days ago about some of the stuff he wanted to talk about, and I said, yeah, yeah, Doc, we've got, like, all these executive orders.
[01:36:08.266 --> 01:36:13.369]  We've got the admission of the preparing emergency camps for, quote, re-education.
[01:36:13.369 --> 01:36:14.630]  That is a Soviet term.
[01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:18.773]  That's in the Army manual for resettlement operations.
[01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:21.355]  That was in 2010, declassified 2013.
[01:36:21.355 --> 01:36:24.598]  I mean, this isn't us making this up.
[01:36:24.598 --> 01:36:25.498]  This is Army.mil.
[01:36:25.498 --> 01:36:27.660]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:29.842]  And so he was talking to his Fort Bragg folks.
[01:36:31.101 --> 01:36:33.364]  We're not going to even get into who.
[01:36:33.364 --> 01:36:36.970]  And they were saying, no, we are getting ready for EBT shutdowns.
[01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:37.811]  We're getting ready.
[01:36:37.811 --> 01:36:40.615]  It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but they've never really done this.
[01:36:40.615 --> 01:36:43.239]  If you want to look at that document, it's FM3-39.40.
[01:36:45.729 --> 01:36:48.390]  And they are gearing up for basically societal collapse.
[01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:49.930]  Well, look at what's already happening in Europe.
[01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.251]  Look at the FEMA report we covered on Monday.
[01:36:52.251 --> 01:36:55.412]  395% food price increases.
[01:36:55.412 --> 01:37:04.074]  By the way, it's in the middle of Rob Dew's report he did that we never aired that's so important, where it actually has the FEMA officials saying, we believe this scenario is going to happen.
[01:37:04.074 --> 01:37:10.396]  Because some people are saying, oh, well, the article out of Vice didn't say they thought it was going to happen.
[01:37:10.396 --> 01:37:11.516]  Yeah, I actually went to the report.
[01:37:12.256 --> 01:37:14.539]  Okay, when I shot a video, that's what we show there.
[01:37:14.539 --> 01:37:16.762]  Okay, I don't want this stuff to happen.
[01:37:16.762 --> 01:37:18.445]  I'm not even saying it's going to happen.
[01:37:18.445 --> 01:37:22.911]  They say they believe this is a real problem they face.
[01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:25.334]  So we have the clips in the report Rob Dew did on this.
[01:37:27.648 --> 01:37:34.430]  Then he got into the fact that he wanted to talk about how the military also said, yeah, we're training to basically take on zombies.
[01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:46.673]  And then every time we say that, I told people like two years before it was mainstream news, they don't get the army and the Marines to train to just mow down or say the security services of, there's the document, unclassified.
[01:37:46.673 --> 01:37:49.273]  We don't just sit there and just say this stuff, okay?
[01:37:49.273 --> 01:37:50.954]  We don't mean literal undead.
[01:37:52.045 --> 01:37:58.210]  But the way you dehumanize people who haven't eaten in 10 days, because they don't act like humans, is they call them zombies.
[01:37:58.210 --> 01:38:01.612]  There's Pentagon documents that lays out battle plan against zombies.
[01:38:01.612 --> 01:38:07.677]  And they make a joke, because see, it was freaking the troops out when people were wearing John Deere hats and begging for food, and dressed like Americans.
[01:38:07.677 --> 01:38:14.622]  So they said, okay, we're going to practice mowing people down now, you know, with the laser tag buzzers that have got green skin.
[01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:20.987]  That way it's not racial, that way it's all a big joke, but it's for mowing down crowds of people, okay?
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.501]  Business Insider, if you're a radio listener, I just put that on screen.
[01:38:24.501 --> 01:38:27.701]  Because I know, I come on air and I say, the Pentagon's trying to take on zombies.
[01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:31.502]  I said that two years before it was in the news, from our sources, and I said, what do you mean?
[01:38:31.502 --> 01:38:35.343]  To the army guys in this case, and they said, well, it's a PSYOP.
[01:38:35.343 --> 01:38:42.044]  Again, zombies aren't people, but we're trained to mow down crowds of people, so we just say it's zombies, and then the media's going to say it's a joke later.
[01:38:42.044 --> 01:38:43.665]  So this is the anatomy of a PSYOP.
[01:38:43.665 --> 01:38:44.785]  Now, the military's not our enemy.
[01:38:45.899 --> 01:38:47.661]  They're being trained to do this.
[01:38:47.661 --> 01:38:49.062]  This is very, very dangerous.
[01:38:49.062 --> 01:38:50.483]  This is very, very serious.
[01:38:50.483 --> 01:38:53.306]  It shows that they're getting closer to some big event.
[01:38:53.306 --> 01:38:55.008]  Is it massive jihad attacks?
[01:38:55.008 --> 01:38:55.988]  Is it breakdowns?
[01:38:55.988 --> 01:38:56.869]  Is it depression?
[01:38:56.869 --> 01:38:58.331]  Is it war with the Russians?
[01:38:58.331 --> 01:39:00.393]  All this stuff's on the front burner now.
[01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:02.795]  War with the Communist Chinese saying war is imminent.
[01:39:02.795 --> 01:39:04.456]  Japan getting on readiness alerts.
[01:39:05.137 --> 01:39:21.882]  The whole world is cascading towards crisis, and so all I'm saying is we should be aware of it, we should tell you why government's digging in, why elites are running to New Zealand, while billionaires are running to, you know, other areas like Australia, because the word is all hell's gonna break loose.
[01:39:21.882 --> 01:39:24.042]  Now, I'm not the one saying that.
[01:39:24.042 --> 01:39:26.723]  I'm the one that told you pretty much first when they were gearing up for it.
[01:39:27.563 --> 01:39:30.185]  All I'm saying is we've never seen such movement.
[01:39:30.185 --> 01:39:33.587]  Now the Liberty Movement globally has been trying to block this.
[01:39:33.587 --> 01:39:47.716]  We hope that we're able and you're able to somehow stop it and somehow this horrible plan that's bigger than what the Nazis planned can somehow be stopped and Hitler won't invade, you know, Austria and Czechoslovakia and Poland and France.
[01:39:48.456 --> 01:39:50.877]  But we're kind of the 1940 point now.
[01:39:50.877 --> 01:40:01.484]  So, all I'm saying is, the globalists are engaged in a new kind of war, they're training for martial law, and they've got to go operational, so they're mainlining it now, where it's not even classified.
[01:40:01.484 --> 01:40:06.887]  Dr. Group, spend some time on this, talking about it with all the rest of the backdrop we're facing.
[01:40:06.887 --> 01:40:13.711]  Go through your sources, but no document cams over there, because that's handwritten notes from his sources, and then we'll go over some of these news articles that actually show people.
[01:40:14.051 --> 01:40:17.092]  No, well, I got a phone call and it was kind of disturbing.
[01:40:17.092 --> 01:40:29.074]  I mean, the thing is, this has all been right in front of our faces for a long time and you've been talking about it, we've all been talking about it, but really what it comes down to is this zombie apocalypse.
[01:40:29.074 --> 01:40:31.534]  These are government unclassified documents.
[01:40:31.534 --> 01:40:34.935]  The media's been hyping it, the culture's been pre-programming it.
[01:40:34.935 --> 01:40:40.375]  It just seems like more and more it's coming out right now and it's something that we need to be aware of.
[01:40:40.375 --> 01:40:42.796]  Basically, what I was told was that
[01:40:43.456 --> 01:40:51.042]  They're gearing up for exercises associated with food shortages, and we know that that's coming, and rogue military units.
[01:40:51.042 --> 01:41:07.534]  So apparently they're thinking that there might be some military units that might go rogue, that they might have to... The plan's always been to blame the military breaking away from a globalist takeover by saying rogue elements are staging terror attacks to thus demonize any military that breaks away from a globalist takeover.
[01:41:08.474 --> 01:41:10.615]  They preemptively staged terror attacks to blame the Patriots.
[01:41:10.615 --> 01:41:11.055]  Go ahead.
[01:41:11.055 --> 01:41:18.938]  Yeah, you know, it's real easy to create what they term zombies is really us with the fluoride in the water.
[01:41:18.938 --> 01:41:20.198]  They're dumbing us down.
[01:41:20.198 --> 01:41:20.818]  It's a metaphor.
[01:41:20.818 --> 01:41:21.498]  It's a cover story.
[01:41:21.498 --> 01:41:22.359]  Exactly.
[01:41:22.359 --> 01:41:23.619]  They're not going to come out and say it.
[01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:24.199]  But it's beyond that.
[01:41:24.199 --> 01:41:29.521]  Just like the Kingsman movie where they put out a program through the cell phones to make people act violently.
[01:41:29.521 --> 01:41:32.942]  That's actually declassified, but they're just testing it at lower levels.
[01:41:32.942 --> 01:41:35.163]  That's why the mental illness, all the stuff's exploding.
[01:41:35.163 --> 01:41:35.383]  Go ahead.
[01:41:35.623 --> 01:41:47.133]  Right, and you see that the food shortages, which you were talking about earlier, that are happening, the easiest and fastest way to instill martial law... Oh, it's called ConPlan 888.
[01:41:47.133 --> 01:41:55.320]  ConPlan 888, it's the government's plan to fend off the zombie apocalypse, to basically fend off our resistance, or individual resistance.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.282]  Yeah, they're going to call collapse a zombie apocalypse.
[01:41:57.282 --> 01:42:03.227]  It's like what the head CFR guy just came out and said, that you lead her in war with the average people, and then we're basically scum.
[01:42:04.286 --> 01:42:05.607]  Right.
[01:42:05.607 --> 01:42:10.231]  And when you take away water and you take away food from people, you know what happens to them mentally.
[01:42:10.231 --> 01:42:11.292]  They become zombies.
[01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:12.413]  They start looking for food.
[01:42:12.413 --> 01:42:13.714]  They start looking for water.
[01:42:13.714 --> 01:42:16.976]  That's very... Within 10 days, 90% become cannibals.
[01:42:16.976 --> 01:42:18.037]  Within 15 days, it's like 98%.
[01:42:18.037 --> 01:42:18.517]  Right, right.
[01:42:18.517 --> 01:42:21.440]  So they are flesh-eating zombies.
[01:42:22.495 --> 01:42:29.439]  So the point of the matter is, make sure that you have food and make sure that you have the necessary supplies to protect yourself and protect your family.
[01:42:29.439 --> 01:42:33.261]  That's why I'm such a big promoter of the X2 iodine, the winter stuff.
[01:42:33.261 --> 01:42:34.721]  Sure, and we're going to do an open pitch here.
[01:42:34.721 --> 01:42:37.283]  We're the info where we fund ourselves with things we believe in.
[01:42:37.283 --> 01:42:41.045]  Non-GMO seeds, shortwave radios, the best solar panel units to be prepared.
[01:42:41.045 --> 01:42:44.927]  I personally am gearing up the very best storable foods, 20 to 40 percent off through
[01:42:45.927 --> 01:42:47.488]  The Independence Day holiday.
[01:42:47.488 --> 01:42:54.373]  We didn't actually have this planned last week when you were going to come in and cover all this, but just all the news kept breaking along the lines, so I decided to do this special.
[01:42:54.373 --> 01:42:57.756]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:57.756 --> 01:43:02.839]  And by the way, you were going to come in and talk about all these leaking reactors they don't even care now.
[01:43:02.839 --> 01:43:09.524]  That's why it's more important than ever to take iodine, so your glands are full of the good halogen, so the bad radioactive halogens can't get in.
[01:43:09.524 --> 01:43:11.966]  So that's why it's 20% off through July 4th as well.
[01:43:12.788 --> 01:43:21.150]  Right, and just the other day they had an earthquake off the coast of Fukushima, and they're just now starting to report even more damage from over there.
[01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:28.852]  So not only are we dealing with radioactivity everywhere, but we're dealing with the potential of financial collapse, zombie apocalypse.
[01:43:28.852 --> 01:43:29.892]  Society's already breaking down.
[01:43:29.892 --> 01:43:33.773]  They're already seeing UN vehicles now moving across the United States.
[01:43:33.773 --> 01:43:34.533]  These aren't old ones.
[01:43:34.533 --> 01:43:37.694]  These are the big Hunger Games, you know, big, big APCs.
[01:43:38.354 --> 01:43:44.097]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you have people sending you pictures too, so there is something going on.
[01:43:44.097 --> 01:43:47.939]  I mean, somebody sent me a picture... There's now Abrams painted up with you in.
[01:43:47.939 --> 01:43:59.385]  Right, and somebody sent me a picture of a pipe company that had hundreds of vehicles lined up in the back of this pipe company in the middle of nowhere, military vehicles.
[01:43:59.385 --> 01:44:05.228]  So, I mean, there's definitely with FEMA preparing... I mean, they admit, they are pre-deploying armored
[01:44:06.048 --> 01:44:08.472]  You know, heavy armor to deal with the people.
[01:44:08.472 --> 01:44:11.516]  And the question is, the patriots aren't going to run out and fight anybody.
[01:44:11.516 --> 01:44:13.078]  We'll just try to take care of our families.
[01:44:13.078 --> 01:44:18.025]  They're going to do something so horrible that they're going to somehow hype people into the belief that we've got to be persecuted.
[01:44:19.281 --> 01:44:23.343]  Yeah, I mean, they could easily just flip a switch and cut off the water supply to every single home.
[01:44:23.343 --> 01:44:25.844]  They could flip a switch and cut off the electricity to every home.
[01:44:25.844 --> 01:44:27.465]  And then say, we did it.
[01:44:27.465 --> 01:44:29.326]  They can, you know, regulate the food supply.
[01:44:29.326 --> 01:44:32.588]  Executive Order 13603 that Obama signed actually.
[01:44:32.588 --> 01:44:34.428]  Yeah, let's go over the actual documentation here.
[01:44:34.428 --> 01:44:34.969]  Go ahead.
[01:44:34.969 --> 01:44:38.691]  So yeah, that executive order which was signed actually
[01:44:39.691 --> 01:44:44.454]  States that the government right now can take over all food resources.
[01:44:44.454 --> 01:44:46.015]  Document that for TV viewers.
[01:44:46.015 --> 01:44:48.996]  Yeah, this is the executive order.
[01:44:48.996 --> 01:44:52.538]  Just cover your notes up and show those.
[01:44:52.538 --> 01:45:00.723]  So basically you have the executive order 13603 and that basically says that Obama put that into production.
[01:45:00.723 --> 01:45:04.345]  He can suspend the Constitution, Congress for any reason including economic.
[01:45:04.345 --> 01:45:06.366]  Take over all food resources.
[01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:07.927]  Form work brigades.
[01:45:08.747 --> 01:45:11.069]  All of that, all of that stuff.
[01:45:11.069 --> 01:45:12.310]  Yes.
[01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:21.957]  So not only that, then you also have the, what we were talking about earlier was the, the con, the con plan 888.
[01:45:21.957 --> 01:45:24.498]  That actually, if you look at that, is pretty scary.
[01:45:24.498 --> 01:45:27.180]  I mean, it's like 300 pages, but it's zombie threats.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.262]  This is from army.mil, by the way.
[01:45:29.262 --> 01:45:31.964]  You know, they're going to have like 100 newspapers say we just made this up tomorrow.
[01:45:32.524 --> 01:45:35.665]  They're going to say that we said zombies are attacking Texas next week.
[01:45:35.665 --> 01:45:36.826]  We never said that.
[01:45:36.826 --> 01:45:39.286]  We said it's a metaphor for war with the people.
[01:45:39.286 --> 01:45:42.087]  This plan was not actually designed as a joke.
[01:45:42.087 --> 01:45:44.488]  That's the first sentence that's on the plan.
[01:45:44.488 --> 01:45:54.992]  Members of the USSTrade.com component found out by accident that the hyperbolic involved in writing a zombie survival plan actually provided a very useful and effective
[01:45:56.033 --> 01:46:03.020]  I mean, there's been a lot of thought that's gone into this, and they, you know, define zombies.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.643]  How do you sell and get the troops ready to fight the American people?
[01:46:05.643 --> 01:46:07.665]  It's just, oh, we're going to train to fight zombies.
[01:46:07.665 --> 01:46:08.687]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:08.687 --> 01:46:11.029]  Because they're going to have hordes of people in populated areas.
[01:46:11.029 --> 01:46:16.936]  And by the way, the general public, I mean, you get a million starving prickly puffs in a town like Austin, Texas, it will be dangerous.
[01:46:18.564 --> 01:46:28.301]  It's gonna be dangerous in any highly populated, I mean most people just think they're sitting around, they're already zombies basically, they're just sitting around, they're not gonna know if the power goes off.
[01:46:28.301 --> 01:46:30.105]  You know, fat people could be a food supply though.
[01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:47.377]  There's actually modifications and scenarios on people eating other people in there, vegetarian zombies, chicken zombies, all kinds of other stuff in there as well.
[01:46:47.377 --> 01:46:48.238]  But let's go further.
[01:46:48.238 --> 01:46:58.486]  You admit, and they've declassified thousands of DARPA patents, where they're actually looking at wavelengths, chemicals and things, that Dr. Begichon, that actually turn us into piranha-like zombies.
[01:46:58.846 --> 01:46:59.126]  Right.
[01:46:59.126 --> 01:47:05.351]  Nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from monitors and cell phones.
[01:47:05.351 --> 01:47:14.659]  One of the things that we're noticing now, actually, is people that are looking at computers and cell phones all the time, those screens do not block the blue light.
[01:47:14.659 --> 01:47:18.882]  So what happens is, if you're constantly looking at that, it's going to cause myopia.
[01:47:18.882 --> 01:47:22.505]  Kids are starting to come down with myopia and other... Brain damage.
[01:47:22.505 --> 01:47:24.807]  They're in like a zombie-like, near dreamlike state.
[01:47:24.807 --> 01:47:25.627]  That's mainstream news.
[01:47:26.468 --> 01:47:44.251]  Why would they put it out in the Kingsman, where there's a group of billionaires that want to depopulate the earth, so they're beta testing through the cell phones, sending out a wavelength pattern that makes you go to lower brain, psychotic, crocodile brain response, and then you actually have, 15 years ago, you know, the Baltimore Sun admitting DARPA was testing that in Baltimore.
[01:47:44.251 --> 01:47:51.933]  I mean, they're actually through this, this is, they admit, and then they admit through the new light bulbs, they can send data flicker to control you.
[01:47:53.311 --> 01:47:55.653]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[01:47:55.653 --> 01:47:57.575]  You cannot make this up.
[01:47:57.575 --> 01:47:58.996]  I'm not saying this, folks.
[01:47:58.996 --> 01:48:01.038]  This is official.
[01:48:01.038 --> 01:48:02.279]  Everything is official.
[01:48:02.279 --> 01:48:05.462]  It just goes down to doing your research and pulling up the documents.
[01:48:05.462 --> 01:48:07.864]  Remember Pockemon 20 years ago in the U.S.
[01:48:07.864 --> 01:48:09.285]  and Japan, one episode aired.
[01:48:09.285 --> 01:48:10.106]  They admitted it was a test.
[01:48:11.511 --> 01:48:19.014]  The monster's eyes flash at a certain rate and thousands of convulsions, including some deaths, when folks fell and hit their heads.
[01:48:19.014 --> 01:48:21.915]  Now that's just with old-fashioned technology.
[01:48:21.915 --> 01:48:23.796]  They can make you have convulsions.
[01:48:23.796 --> 01:48:26.898]  Right now they're hiding the cell phone towers and everything.
[01:48:26.898 --> 01:48:28.818]  You don't even know where they are.
[01:48:28.818 --> 01:48:32.200]  There are so many cell phone towers with the HAARP technology.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.542]  Homeland Security Minister setting up all these quote secondary ones to spy on us.
[01:48:36.542 --> 01:48:37.262]  It's way beyond that.
[01:48:37.742 --> 01:48:47.132]  Right, yeah, and so all that can be used, you talk about zombies, you can easily manipulate the brain to where someone just walks around like they don't even know what they're doing.
[01:48:47.132 --> 01:48:50.836]  They've already turned the public into that with their smartphones because it's more than that.
[01:48:50.836 --> 01:48:55.481]  They are sending out wavelengths of light that they admit are mesmerizing people.
[01:48:55.481 --> 01:48:56.962]  They're hypnotizing you folks.
[01:48:58.271 --> 01:48:58.771]  It is.
[01:48:58.771 --> 01:49:02.837]  It's like a hypnotic zombie state that they can control you.
[01:49:02.837 --> 01:49:06.622]  And if they get you into it early enough, then that's how they make you more suggestible.
[01:49:06.622 --> 01:49:08.885]  That's why some people have no attention span.
[01:49:08.885 --> 01:49:09.746]  You can't talk to them.
[01:49:09.746 --> 01:49:14.853]  Even if they were people, you know, a few years ago that were smart are suddenly like gone because they've been put in a trance.
[01:49:15.848 --> 01:49:17.009]  We're under a spell!
[01:49:17.009 --> 01:49:18.150]  We're under a spell!
[01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:20.511]  Yeah, it's like we're in the Matrix.
[01:49:20.511 --> 01:49:22.573]  We're just under this control.
[01:49:22.573 --> 01:49:24.994]  But the good news is there's a solution to that.
[01:49:24.994 --> 01:49:27.716]  The good news is if you're consciously aware of it, it doesn't work.
[01:49:27.716 --> 01:49:28.337]  Exactly.
[01:49:28.337 --> 01:49:37.823]  You know, meditation, eating healthy, avoiding all the chemicals and toxins that we talk about on a regular basis in the water supply, the food supply, all of that.
[01:49:37.823 --> 01:49:43.107]  Taking the supplements that we developed specifically for a counter
[01:49:44.332 --> 01:49:45.433]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:08.505]  Uh, and I've got huge shoulders and it makes it look like, people see me in person and they go, Mike, you know, and I do have like big shoulders and stuff.
[01:50:08.505 --> 01:50:11.246]  And they go, wow, your shoulders don't look that big because your head's so big.
[01:50:11.246 --> 01:50:13.848]  But other than that, we got some new photos I took just last week.
[01:50:13.848 --> 01:50:15.509]  I've lost so much weight on this.
[01:50:15.509 --> 01:50:16.710]  Like, I'm just going to show these on my phone.
[01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:18.091]  I keep wanting to show them, but I haven't shown you.
[01:50:18.091 --> 01:50:19.792]  I'm going to just keep going, Dr. Grip.
[01:50:19.792 --> 01:50:21.033]  You're really breaking some key stuff down.
[01:50:21.033 --> 01:50:23.315]  I mean, all I know is your supplements changed my life.
[01:50:23.315 --> 01:50:24.876]  Others did a little bit of good, but not as much.
[01:50:25.296 --> 01:50:26.337]  Well, that's the whole thing.
[01:50:26.337 --> 01:50:31.899]  I mean, we're both here to try to just educate as many people as we can and help as many people as we can.
[01:50:31.899 --> 01:50:35.301]  And the solution is, it doesn't need to be that hard.
[01:50:35.301 --> 01:50:41.704]  You just need to be aware, be awake, and understand that you have the power to change.
[01:50:41.704 --> 01:50:44.326]  And the small little battles you've had, you can win.
[01:50:44.326 --> 01:50:45.647]  Bottom line, filter your water.
[01:50:45.647 --> 01:50:47.427]  Bottom line, don't eat GMO.
[01:50:47.427 --> 01:50:49.929]  Bottom line, if you're deficient in key elements,
[01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:52.952]  You need to get them in your body, and it's just a separate issue.
[01:50:52.952 --> 01:50:54.855]  You need to be prepared and self-sufficient.

[01:51:32.782 --> 01:51:35.324]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[01:51:35.324 --> 01:51:36.284]  Think again.
[01:51:36.284 --> 01:51:39.886]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.

[01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:14.875]  This is an important message for anyone who had an IVC filter implanted to prevent blood clots from traveling to their heart or lungs.
[01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:19.420]  The FDA warns that IVC filters may cause serious complications such as heart or lung damage.
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.481]  Internal bleeding and even death.
[01:52:21.481 --> 01:52:26.245]  If you or a loved one has had an IVC filter implanted, you may be entitled to substantial compensation.

[01:53:00.985 --> 01:53:09.128]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:53:09.128 --> 01:53:09.948]  Here's why.
[01:53:09.948 --> 01:53:14.090]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.990]  So please listen.
[01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:18.691]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:25.034]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:53:25.034 --> 01:53:29.135]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:53:29.395 --> 01:53:32.317]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:53:32.317 --> 01:53:34.659]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:53:34.659 --> 01:53:39.482]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[01:53:39.482 --> 01:53:46.207]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:53:46.207 --> 01:53:47.928]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:53:47.928 --> 01:53:49.630]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:49.630 --> 01:53:51.351]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:53:51.351 --> 01:53:55.214]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:53:55.214 --> 01:53:56.775]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:56.775 --> 01:53:57.876]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:54:01.513 --> 01:54:18.506]  Alright, if you're a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com
[01:54:30.157 --> 01:54:35.087]  I'll show you some of these photos from a fishing trip with my kids last week.
[01:54:35.087 --> 01:54:37.331]  And Buckley and Anthony all went with us too.
[01:54:37.331 --> 01:54:41.239]  But for TV viewers, go ahead and do a document cam shot if you guys can.
[01:54:41.239 --> 01:54:42.281]  In there in the control room for me.
[01:54:43.888 --> 01:54:52.912]  Now again, I mean, I've really lost weight compared to a few years ago, but I've gained a ton of muscle.
[01:54:52.912 --> 01:54:54.853]  Absolutely a ton.
[01:54:54.853 --> 01:54:56.594]  And I'm not even sucking my gut in.
[01:54:56.594 --> 01:54:57.214]  One of these I am.
[01:54:57.214 --> 01:54:58.095]  I'll show you the one where I am.
[01:54:58.095 --> 01:55:01.156]  I'm sucking my gut in a little bit there.
[01:55:01.156 --> 01:55:03.878]  That's more.
[01:55:03.878 --> 01:55:05.558]  That's the gut sucked in a little bit.
[01:55:05.558 --> 01:55:06.779]  That's the gut not sucked in.
[01:55:10.336 --> 01:55:12.597]  And that is, my head is really that big, folks.
[01:55:12.597 --> 01:55:14.018]  That is ridiculous.
[01:55:14.018 --> 01:55:15.659]  I mean, it's really clownish.
[01:55:15.659 --> 01:55:22.102]  And, uh, so that's, that's, and all of these trolls online go, look how fat his chest is!
[01:55:22.102 --> 01:55:25.104]  Yeah, that's, that's pure muscle, by the way, folks.
[01:55:25.104 --> 01:55:28.105]  Uh, but the point is, is that I never really lost the muscle.
[01:55:28.105 --> 01:55:29.426]  I just got fat all over me.
[01:55:30.186 --> 01:55:30.547]  I don't know.
[01:55:50.746 --> 01:55:52.786]  Super Mel Vitality and X2 has done.
[01:55:52.786 --> 01:56:07.030]  Remember when you said, when you developed X2, we had about six months before it came out, and I was taking it, you said, get ready to tan better, get ready for your skin to get better, get ready for you to have more libido energy, because it's the good halogen and it helps you produce your regular hormones.
[01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:09.510]  And we said, but about three weeks in, you might have a toxic event.
[01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:11.391]  I did feel bad for about a week.
[01:56:11.391 --> 01:56:14.391]  Felt, not too bad, but kind of, I got a hangover.
[01:56:14.391 --> 01:56:16.772]  And all of a sudden, all this stuff started coming out of my skin.
[01:56:17.978 --> 01:56:25.782]  It's kind of gross for a few weeks, and other things, and when I would sweat, stuff would pour out, and it's just gotten better and better and better.
[01:56:25.782 --> 01:56:28.284]  Just the X2 alone has changed my life.
[01:56:28.284 --> 01:56:29.384]  Why is that?
[01:56:29.384 --> 01:56:36.388]  There's so many studies that have been done on iodine over the years, and just recently now... 15 IQ point increases?
[01:56:36.388 --> 01:56:44.233]  Just recently, we talk about the phthalates, and we talk about the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, but now there's research out that states that iodine helps
[01:56:44.913 --> 01:56:53.778]  regulate the estrogen uptake cells, which means that it blocks estrogen.
[01:56:53.778 --> 01:57:02.062]  So probably what was happening with you is you were blocking some of that estrogen, your endocrine system was coming back into line.
[01:57:02.062 --> 01:57:08.026]  That's one of the main problems that we have right now is endocrine disruption everywhere in the endocrine system.
[01:57:08.906 --> 01:57:20.270]  Is the main system in your body that controls your fat, controls your metabolism, controls your bowels, besides the fact that we have everybody that's stressed out running around in a sympathetic state all the time.
[01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:22.611]  And by the way, I'm not in competition with other iodine folks.
[01:57:22.611 --> 01:57:23.872]  I knew iodine was great.
[01:57:23.872 --> 01:57:26.493]  You were recommending it with all these sources that weren't really true iodine.
[01:57:26.493 --> 01:57:27.753]  It would upset my stomach.
[01:57:27.753 --> 01:57:30.734]  What you developed, that's why it turns blue on paper, not red.
[01:57:30.734 --> 01:57:31.795]  That's what color iodine really is.
[01:57:32.855 --> 01:57:36.197]  It is absolutely, in the crystalline form, the strongest.
[01:57:36.197 --> 01:57:37.277]  You absorb it.
[01:57:37.277 --> 01:57:41.079]  So, folks, don't go out to the store and get iodine from, say, one of the big chains.
[01:57:41.079 --> 01:57:41.979]  It'll kill you.
[01:57:41.979 --> 01:57:44.040]  People are like, iodine, that's dangerous.
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:46.621]  No, this is real, approved, safe iodine.
[01:57:46.621 --> 01:57:48.341]  But still, consult your physician.
[01:57:48.341 --> 01:57:49.302]  This is the good halogen.
[01:57:50.509 --> 01:57:59.057]  I'm telling you, then I started Superman on top of it, and then the X, everything, it just all works in synergy, and now that I neurotically take it every day, it just gets better and better.
[01:57:59.057 --> 01:58:00.258]  What are you doing?
[01:58:00.258 --> 01:58:01.459]  What's your exercise program?
[01:58:01.459 --> 01:58:06.264]  Because I'm sure everybody wants to know how... I'm actually working out less than I was a year and a half ago.
[01:58:06.264 --> 01:58:07.305]  It's kind of spoiled me.
[01:58:07.305 --> 01:58:08.205]  I mean, I work out like...
[01:58:08.826 --> 01:58:10.728]  I was working out like an hour and a half some days.
[01:58:10.728 --> 01:58:13.290]  I mean, I used to swim across the lake and back when we lived out there.
[01:58:13.290 --> 01:58:17.654]  I was fat, but I could, you know, I could swim two miles.
[01:58:17.654 --> 01:58:20.736]  So what you're saying is you're not having to devote like four or five hours a day?
[01:58:20.736 --> 01:58:21.617]  No, no.
[01:58:21.617 --> 01:58:27.762]  I mean, all I would do is just go swim two miles or even try to go jog or whatever or lift weights, but I would just get bigger.
[01:58:27.762 --> 01:58:29.764]  I would just, my muscles would just get bigger and I wouldn't lose the fat.
[01:58:29.764 --> 01:58:29.944]  Now,
[01:58:31.005 --> 01:58:32.786]  Look, I've got more libido than when I was 18.
[01:58:32.786 --> 01:58:34.367]  Okay?
[01:58:34.367 --> 01:58:34.947]  I'm telling you.
[01:58:34.947 --> 01:58:36.227]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:58:36.227 --> 01:58:37.748]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:58:37.748 --> 01:58:38.808]  Huge specials running through.
[01:58:38.808 --> 01:58:41.670]  We're going to get back to the serious news when we come back, but this is the news.
[01:58:41.670 --> 01:58:43.250]  Support our local affiliates, folks.

[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:55.461]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:58:55.461 --> 01:59:01.784]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:59:01.784 --> 01:59:09.046]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:59:09.046 --> 01:59:17.849]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:59:18.169 --> 01:59:24.333]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:59:24.333 --> 01:59:29.176]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:59:29.176 --> 01:59:32.759]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:59:32.759 --> 01:59:34.660]  No needles, no injections.
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:36.301]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:59:36.301 --> 01:59:37.502]  Try it for yourself.
[01:59:37.502 --> 01:59:39.804]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:59:48.049 --> 01:59:50.070]  All right, on this Friday edition...
[02:00:17.108 --> 02:00:37.182]  Dr. Gruber, I had to shotgun this for another 30 minutes, but throughout this hour we're going to have open phones on Loretta Lynch and her corruption and her arrogance, on the Clintons, on Donald Trump, the economy, and on the Associated Press, the LA Times, MSNBC, military trains to take on zombies.
[02:00:37.182 --> 02:00:40.485]  I know I'll be attacked even covering this, but we're covering what they're covering.
[02:00:40.485 --> 02:00:42.867]  They'll misrepresent it and say I said zombies are real.
[02:00:42.867 --> 02:00:43.007]  No.
[02:00:44.793 --> 02:00:50.200]  But this is, again, a cover to train our military to take on the American people, and they're getting ready for collapse.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.722]  What do you think is behind all this?
[02:00:51.722 --> 02:00:53.905]  That's another topic I would throw out.
[02:00:53.905 --> 02:00:53.965]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:53.965 --> 02:00:54.566]  800-259-9231 on those topics.
[02:00:54.566 --> 02:00:56.649]  You can talk about anything else you want, but...
[02:01:04.147 --> 02:01:07.209]  I'm asking you to give us your view on those issues coming up.
[02:01:07.209 --> 02:01:10.712]  Dr. Group, you were very excited during the break when I was talking about all my weight loss and stuff.
[02:01:10.712 --> 02:01:16.776]  So let's finish up with that and come back with this Army Regulation 210-35 and all the news you've got and then calls.
[02:01:16.776 --> 02:01:19.678]  But you were talking about healthy weight loss happens over time.
[02:01:19.898 --> 02:01:29.823]  Yeah, so you know there's so many people out there that are on multiple diet plans and exercise plans and they're working so hard but they're just not losing the weight.
[02:01:29.823 --> 02:01:34.845]  And the reason why they're not losing the weight is because they're not repairing the endocrine system.
[02:01:35.405 --> 02:01:50.543]  You can exercise as much as you want, you can go to the gym, you can work out all day long, but unless you start cleansing the body and reactivating your body's self-healing mechanism and bringing in the things and the nutrients that your body needs,
[02:01:51.468 --> 02:01:59.676]  To be able to burn that fat and to be able to release that, see most of the toxins and chemicals are actually stored in your fat cells.
[02:01:59.676 --> 02:02:10.326]  So how it was so easy for you and so easy for thousands of people out there because we're on the phone and all you have to do is go to the InfoWars Live products and look at all the reviews and you'll see
[02:02:11.187 --> 02:02:14.009]  How easy it is when the body comes back into balance.
[02:02:14.009 --> 02:02:18.713]  It's one of the reasons why you really don't see a lot of obese kids around six to eight.
[02:02:18.713 --> 02:02:31.423]  I mean, you have some, and usually those are associated with mothers that had severe endocrine-disrupting chemicals during pregnancy, mothers that were exposing themselves to high estrogen contents during pregnancy.
[02:02:31.423 --> 02:02:38.089]  Well, I mean, I remember you writing 10 years ago, but also Dr. Blaylock and others, that diet drinks with aspartame make you fat.
[02:02:38.089 --> 02:02:39.770]  Well, that's all been confirmed in major studies.
[02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:40.431]  They admit that now.
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:41.400]  Yeah.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.122]  So why are they pushing something that makes you fat because it makes you want to eat more and messes up your endocrine system?
[02:02:46.122 --> 02:02:50.563]  Well, one of the reasons why is because if you're fat, you're going to have all kinds of other health conditions.
[02:02:50.563 --> 02:03:01.367]  And if you, including mental conditions, you're going to have depression, you're going to have ADD, ADHD or, or anxiety or bipolar or something else.
[02:03:01.367 --> 02:03:05.449]  So the deal is if they can, if from birth, the whole goal is to
[02:03:05.469 --> 02:03:06.090]  That's right.
[02:03:22.285 --> 02:03:32.435]  That medication is going to cause three or four side effects, then you're going to be on another medication which is going to cause three or four side effects, and you're going to be in control of the medical system.
[02:03:32.435 --> 02:03:35.758]  And why this stuff works so good and why cleansing has always been...
[02:03:36.943 --> 02:03:37.403]  Talk to you
[02:03:57.209 --> 02:04:05.157]  Uh, book, uh, the 10 Secrets to Weight Loss that I wrote a long time ago is that the number one thing you can do for weight loss is clean the liver.
[02:04:05.157 --> 02:04:13.706]  That's what processes all your fat and that's what keeps you... Sure, I mean, we get puffy because we're toxic and the liver's not pushing it out, so the water, the body holds water trying to, you know, do something.
[02:04:13.706 --> 02:04:18.551]  And the X2, believe it or not, the deep cleanse, the liver shield, all of those supplements
[02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:24.075]  That we have are all designed to reactivate the body's self-healing mechanism.
[02:04:24.075 --> 02:04:26.516]  Then you take living defense, that can top the parasites.
[02:04:26.516 --> 02:04:26.977]  Exactly.
[02:04:26.977 --> 02:04:29.779]  It's just all of it works together in synergy.
[02:04:29.779 --> 02:04:38.665]  And when you need to try one for a while, some of it you only do for, you know, periods of time, like the oxy powder or like the living defense, other things you take on a regular basis.
[02:04:38.665 --> 02:04:41.387]  But as always, consult with your health care practitioner.
[02:04:41.387 --> 02:04:42.268]  Do your research because
[02:04:42.848 --> 02:04:50.013]  These are really good, high quality products, but still, if you're already really screwed up and stuff, who knows what changing that whole system could do abruptly.
[02:04:50.013 --> 02:04:52.915]  So do your own research before you do that, because these aren't placebos.
[02:04:52.915 --> 02:04:53.596]  These aren't games.
[02:04:53.596 --> 02:04:54.316]  We've done the research.
[02:04:54.316 --> 02:04:55.277]  These are game changers.
[02:04:55.277 --> 02:04:58.319]  Let's get back into the preparations for martial law straight ahead.
[02:04:58.319 --> 02:05:00.521]  We're already into an element of martial law now.
[02:05:01.401 --> 02:05:05.024]  Does 2016 feel more like 1984 to you?
[02:05:05.024 --> 02:05:15.332]  Life is certainly imitating art with Uber's announcement that its fleet of more than 1 million drivers will now be tracked, traced, and henpecked throughout every ride they provide.
[02:05:15.332 --> 02:05:22.258]  This is the next step toward totalitarian control of transportation and the end of individual autonomy on our roads.
[02:05:22.258 --> 02:05:28.563]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the ride-sharing app has launched new and invasive technology called Telematics
[02:05:28.703 --> 02:05:31.547]  Which records drivers' behaviors behind the wheel.
[02:05:31.547 --> 02:05:40.738]  When a driver exceeds the speed limit, brakes abruptly, cuts corners, or sends a text while driving, Uber alerts the driver of their mistake in real time.
[02:05:40.738 --> 02:05:45.284]  In the future, drivers who receive low scores throughout their driving history may be penalized.
[02:05:45.484 --> 02:05:55.313]  In addition, negative driving data such as speeding could easily be sent to law enforcement to enhance the tactics they use to pilfer the public through draconian fines.
[02:05:55.313 --> 02:05:56.794]  This is Ashley Beckford.
[02:05:56.794 --> 02:06:00.498]  Stay tuned for more special reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:01.232 --> 02:06:02.853]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:06:02.853 --> 02:06:04.355]  You can't survive without it.
[02:06:04.355 --> 02:06:05.556]  But where do you get it?
[02:06:05.556 --> 02:06:11.541]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:06:11.541 --> 02:06:17.266]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[02:06:39.707 --> 02:06:40.607]  Low maintenance.
[02:06:40.607 --> 02:06:42.707]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:07:01.173 --> 02:07:09.440]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.662]  A 360 win.
[02:07:10.662 --> 02:07:17.227]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:07:17.227 --> 02:07:24.754]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:07:25.154 --> 02:07:30.219]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:30.219 --> 02:07:36.324]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:07:36.324 --> 02:07:44.131]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:07:44.131 --> 02:07:50.637]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:50.637 --> 02:07:52.138]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:07:52.298 --> 02:07:54.720]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.702]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:07:56.702 --> 02:08:00.565]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:08:18.195 --> 02:08:23.697]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:23.697 --> 02:08:34.241]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.241 --> 02:08:40.544]  I have a blind spot that a lot of establishment types have told me about.
[02:08:40.544 --> 02:08:42.625]  Kind of admin propaganda for the enemy.
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.401]  Listen, Alex, you don't get it.
[02:08:46.401 --> 02:08:51.823]  You see us being more evil, more corrupt, more dominant, and it makes you want to fight harder.
[02:08:51.823 --> 02:08:54.884]  But the general public has low self-esteem and is weak.
[02:08:54.884 --> 02:08:57.285]  It just makes them give up and stop paying attention.
[02:08:57.285 --> 02:08:58.965]  We're trying to instill learned helplessness.
[02:08:58.965 --> 02:09:00.506]  We're trying to break their will.
[02:09:00.506 --> 02:09:03.527]  You think, you know, you're evolving to resist tyranny.
[02:09:03.527 --> 02:09:06.548]  The public evolves and adapts to submit.
[02:09:08.126 --> 02:09:10.847]  And so people are evolving to be slaves.
[02:09:10.847 --> 02:09:12.968]  And so this is really their inside baseball.
[02:09:12.968 --> 02:09:13.748]  I don't really believe that.
[02:09:13.748 --> 02:09:14.808]  I think they've miscalculated.
[02:09:14.808 --> 02:09:16.069]  Look at the Brexit.
[02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:18.110]  Look at so many other good things that are happening.
[02:09:18.110 --> 02:09:22.951]  You don't have to get even the majority to stand up and say no, but I gotta tell you, you look at Sweden.
[02:09:22.951 --> 02:09:27.673]  They've ordered the police on record to not to cover up Islamic rapes of women because that's in the culture.
[02:09:27.673 --> 02:09:29.314]  An unintended woman can be raped.
[02:09:29.314 --> 02:09:34.656]  And in fact then she's executed or stoned or killed, bare minimum beaten,
[02:09:36.145 --> 02:09:40.810]  Until an issue for life with a big cane pole or a big whip.
[02:09:40.810 --> 02:09:42.532]  And so there's an article up on Infowars.com.
[02:09:42.532 --> 02:09:43.893]  We're not joking.
[02:09:43.893 --> 02:09:48.197]  Swedish women use bracelets to stop Muslim rapists.
[02:09:48.197 --> 02:09:52.041]  Sweden has come up with a brilliant idea to stop the surge of Muslim rapists.
[02:09:52.041 --> 02:09:55.925]  Wrist bands that say, don't touch me.
[02:09:55.925 --> 02:09:57.527]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not kidding.
[02:09:58.649 --> 02:10:00.571]  And this is on their news with a straight face.
[02:10:00.571 --> 02:10:01.351]  Same thing in Germany.
[02:10:01.351 --> 02:10:07.076]  The Green Party says, look, German women, you know, just don't wear short skirts.
[02:10:07.076 --> 02:10:07.697]  That's the left.
[02:10:07.697 --> 02:10:11.160]  These are very sick, sick, sick people.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.982]  And they're covering up rapes and abuse here in the U.S.
[02:10:13.982 --> 02:10:14.823]  already.
[02:10:14.823 --> 02:10:15.703]  We've been covering that.
[02:10:15.703 --> 02:10:18.646]  It's just unbelievable this is going on.
[02:10:18.646 --> 02:10:20.968]  But Joe Biggs did a piece that's not even comedy.
[02:10:22.162 --> 02:10:27.847]  Where we just show women around the office wearing the wristband, just like the ones they have, that says, don't rape me.
[02:10:27.847 --> 02:10:32.591]  And then he comes up in a jihadi outfit, and he just sees that, and he stops immediately.
[02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:35.173]  That actually might work, though, because they'll laugh so hard.
[02:10:35.173 --> 02:10:38.376]  Maybe that, or maybe it gives the women the confidence to say no.
[02:10:38.376 --> 02:10:40.677]  How about a gun?
[02:10:40.677 --> 02:10:45.702]  You know, I mean, only the jihadis seem to have the guns.
[02:10:45.702 --> 02:10:47.023]  But look, she's not wearing her.
[02:10:53.356 --> 02:10:54.457]  Not funny, I shouldn't laugh.
[02:10:54.457 --> 02:10:57.782]  Alright, I want to go to phone calls too, but 800-259-9231.
[02:10:57.782 --> 02:11:01.467]  Dr. Grip, you kind of got interrupted earlier.
[02:11:01.467 --> 02:11:07.835]  Go over these Army documents, give folks the names of them, just the different ways they're preparing for total collapse and what your sources were telling you.
[02:11:07.835 --> 02:11:10.598]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's just about being prepared, really.
[02:11:10.598 --> 02:11:11.239]  It's just about
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.941]  Being aware and making sure that you have a source of clean, fresh water.
[02:11:16.941 --> 02:11:20.522]  I mean, talk to somebody that you know outside of the city.
[02:11:20.522 --> 02:11:23.802]  Wouldn't a good source of millions of jihadis be a good value for us?
[02:11:23.802 --> 02:11:26.623]  We don't need water or freedom or our own land or salt.
[02:11:26.623 --> 02:11:28.223]  Just have some jihadis would help us, right?
[02:11:28.223 --> 02:11:29.403]  If you just want to die, yeah.
[02:11:29.403 --> 02:11:31.444]  Is that an asset?
[02:11:31.444 --> 02:11:34.504]  I guess you could maybe, like, kill them and eat them or something.
[02:11:34.504 --> 02:11:37.065]  But I mean, like, you know, they've imported five million of them into Europe.
[02:11:37.125 --> 02:11:37.825]  In the last three years.
[02:11:37.825 --> 02:11:39.046]  That's a good idea, right?
[02:11:39.046 --> 02:11:39.466]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:39.466 --> 02:11:40.607]  Yeah, really good idea.
[02:11:40.607 --> 02:11:45.529]  But while you're talking, let's just show some footage of people crawling over and robbing and raping, shooting guns in the air.
[02:11:45.529 --> 02:11:46.069]  But go ahead.
[02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.469]  Sorry.
[02:11:46.469 --> 02:12:04.378]  No, it's well, you know, it's amazing how one thing can lead to another thing, which can lead to another thing, which can lead to another thing and how everything is interconnected from the genetically modified mosquitoes as a vector for vaccinations or whatever they want to put in your body.
[02:12:04.978 --> 02:12:09.161]  But one of the other things I came upon, which you've covered in the past, is Army Regulation 210-35.
[02:12:09.161 --> 02:12:11.183]  No, but it's important to recap this.
[02:12:11.183 --> 02:12:12.784]  We're not just saying this.
[02:12:12.784 --> 02:12:16.767]  These are actual government unclassified documents.
[02:12:16.767 --> 02:12:18.409]  Show folks, unclassified.
[02:12:18.409 --> 02:12:23.293]  Unclassified, well, whenever we go... Oh no, there's just a resource they're importing into Europe.
[02:12:23.293 --> 02:12:24.514]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:24.514 --> 02:12:26.115]  Who needs running water, you know?
[02:12:26.115 --> 02:12:27.156]  Self-sufficiency.
[02:12:27.156 --> 02:12:27.916]  This is our resource.
[02:12:27.916 --> 02:12:28.617]  Sorry.
[02:12:28.617 --> 02:12:29.317]  Right.
[02:12:29.317 --> 02:12:30.558]  But here, we'll just go back to these documents.
[02:12:30.558 --> 02:12:30.839]  Go ahead.
[02:12:30.839 --> 02:12:30.979]  Sorry.
[02:12:31.932 --> 02:12:39.603]  Okay, so basically this document right here is the Civilian Inmate Labor Program, right there.
[02:12:39.603 --> 02:12:41.245]  Unclassified.
[02:12:41.245 --> 02:12:43.028]  Unclassified.
[02:12:43.028 --> 02:12:43.869]  So this is real.
[02:12:43.869 --> 02:12:46.893]  This is really what's going on, believe it or not.
[02:12:46.893 --> 02:12:48.255]  I was in the military myself.
[02:12:49.136 --> 02:12:58.724]  This regulation provides guidance for establishing and managing civilian inmate labor programs on Army installations.
[02:12:58.724 --> 02:13:14.436]  It provides guidance on establishing prison camps on Army installations, addresses record-keeping and reporting incidents related to the civilian inmate labor program and or prison camp administration, which ties into FEMA,
[02:13:15.393 --> 02:13:23.617]  Which ties into all the coffins that people are seeing, which ties into martial law, which ties into the depopulation agenda.
[02:13:23.617 --> 02:13:24.977]  As a matter of fact... Who started that?
[02:13:24.977 --> 02:13:26.138]  Bill Clinton?
[02:13:26.138 --> 02:13:29.819]  And it wasn't declassified until recently because they're upping, they're escalating it.
[02:13:29.819 --> 02:13:30.640]  There are people already...
[02:13:31.690 --> 02:13:37.832]  Convicted prisoners at military bases, but they're just priming the pump now and expanding it for the general public.
[02:13:37.832 --> 02:13:40.453]  I mean, they're just putting everything out there now.
[02:13:40.453 --> 02:13:51.236]  The Freedom of Information Act, I mean, you can get, this is just online, by the way, but even things that are becoming declassified with the Freedom of Information Act, some of it is still blacked out.
[02:13:51.236 --> 02:13:53.536]  But the thing is, I don't even think they care anymore.
[02:13:53.536 --> 02:13:55.137]  It's just like right in the open.
[02:13:55.737 --> 02:13:59.039]  Here's some quotes that I pulled regarding the depopulation.
[02:13:59.039 --> 02:14:02.081]  This one is from Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.
[02:14:02.081 --> 02:14:03.942]  Prince Philip, I'm very loving.
[02:14:03.942 --> 02:14:11.906]  If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
[02:14:11.906 --> 02:14:13.127]  Prince Philip.
[02:14:13.127 --> 02:14:15.868]  Depopulation should be the highest priority of U.S.
[02:14:15.868 --> 02:14:17.749]  foreign policy towards the third world.
[02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:18.370]  Henry Kissinger.
[02:14:18.370 --> 02:14:19.991]  Yeah, that's the cover sheet to Memorandum 200.
[02:14:20.931 --> 02:14:24.952]  Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.
[02:14:24.952 --> 02:14:26.892]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[02:14:26.892 --> 02:14:30.433]  A total world population of 250-300 million people.
[02:14:30.433 --> 02:14:33.754]  A 95% decline from present levels would be ideal.
[02:14:33.754 --> 02:14:34.734]  Ted Turner.
[02:14:34.734 --> 02:14:37.675]  And by the way, these are all out of Autobahn Magazine, Reuters.
[02:14:37.675 --> 02:14:39.115]  These are real quotes.
[02:14:39.115 --> 02:14:39.475]  Right.
[02:14:39.475 --> 02:14:42.556]  So I mean, the deal is, I'm positive too, Alex.
[02:14:42.556 --> 02:14:47.257]  I mean, I always like to think, hey, look at what's, look at the positive things that are happening in the world.
[02:14:47.257 --> 02:14:47.977]  Look at
[02:14:48.777 --> 02:14:51.479]  People switching to more organic foods.
[02:14:51.479 --> 02:14:52.820]  People taking more supplements.
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:55.022]  People not going to the doctor's office as much.
[02:14:55.022 --> 02:14:58.364]  People taking a proactive stance.
[02:14:58.364 --> 02:15:03.548]  I mean, that was a big blow, in my opinion, to the New World Order, is the Brexit, you know, coming out.
[02:15:03.548 --> 02:15:03.708]  Huge.
[02:15:03.708 --> 02:15:05.810]  People are standing up.
[02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:10.993]  Look, now you have, you know, individual states of the United States talking about secession.
[02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:22.557]  Who knows what's going to happen, but it's, as we always talk, it's always this multifaceted process that I think that there's just as much good as there's just as much bad.
[02:15:22.557 --> 02:15:23.718]  It's like the yin and the yang.
[02:15:23.718 --> 02:15:25.859]  The good, you're always going to have the negative and the positive.
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:28.721]  Education is first.
[02:15:28.721 --> 02:15:31.942]  You know, you have to understand and you have to know how to heal your body.
[02:15:31.942 --> 02:15:33.602]  You have to know what supplements to take.
[02:15:33.602 --> 02:15:35.323]  You have to know what the government... Absolutely.
[02:15:35.323 --> 02:15:37.123]  Let's run through some more of these articles for folks.
[02:15:37.123 --> 02:15:38.824]  You've got a big stack of them there.
[02:15:38.824 --> 02:15:38.964]  Right.
[02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:40.244]  So here's an article right here.
[02:15:40.244 --> 02:15:40.925]  Leaked U.S.
[02:15:40.925 --> 02:15:45.626]  Army document outlines plan for re-education camps.
[02:15:45.626 --> 02:15:48.347]  When you get deep into... And again, they actually call it re-education camps.
[02:15:48.427 --> 02:15:49.147]  Re-education.
[02:15:49.147 --> 02:15:50.387]  That's not our word.
[02:15:50.387 --> 02:15:52.488]  No, so what happens?
[02:15:52.488 --> 02:15:54.408]  The power grids go off.
[02:15:54.408 --> 02:15:55.649]  We have a lack of water.
[02:15:55.649 --> 02:15:56.789]  We have a lack of food.
[02:15:56.789 --> 02:15:59.389]  You have the zombies walking around the streets.
[02:15:59.389 --> 02:16:00.670]  You have rioting.
[02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:02.710]  They have to create martial law.
[02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:05.231]  You know, there's got to be detainment facilities.
[02:16:05.231 --> 02:16:07.331]  They want detainment facilities.
[02:16:07.331 --> 02:16:12.572]  And it actually talks about having civilians turned into labor.
[02:16:12.572 --> 02:16:14.893]  Like what you said, literal slaves.
[02:16:15.473 --> 02:16:20.296]  So that's why I say you get as far away as you possibly can when you start noticing these things.
[02:16:20.296 --> 02:16:30.383]  And by the way, the Pentagon describes people after a few days on having their EBT cards as zombie-like, disoriented, delusional, delirious.
[02:16:30.383 --> 02:16:34.466]  Guys, can you pull up the woman from like a month ago when the EBT cards weren't working?
[02:16:34.466 --> 02:16:36.167]  Throw in the fit, the video's woman.
[02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:39.491]  Throws tantrum when EBT card doesn't work.
[02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:45.374]  She looks like a 350-pound, two-year-old toddler throwing a fit.
[02:16:45.374 --> 02:16:49.156]  You've all seen toddlers throw fits in the grocery store and their trendy mothers let them do it.
[02:16:49.156 --> 02:16:53.338]  You know, you're supposed to take the kid out of the store, but whatever, they're raising little monsters.
[02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:55.539]  But imagine as all this breaks down.
[02:16:55.539 --> 02:16:57.400]  Let's show a video of this one for TV viewers.
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:16:59.280]  I mean, she looks like a zombie.
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:01.882]  If I was a Hollywood producer, I could actually hire her
[02:17:02.682 --> 02:17:06.143]  To show her as a zombie, uh, in a movie.
[02:17:06.143 --> 02:17:09.203]  I mean, she looks, that's why the Pentagon calls them zombies.
[02:17:09.203 --> 02:17:11.284]  I don't care if they're white, black, who they are.
[02:17:11.284 --> 02:17:14.584]  Once things break down, this is what the General Trigley Puff will act like.
[02:17:14.584 --> 02:17:17.425]  That's what happens when you take away their food supply.
[02:17:17.425 --> 02:17:20.045]  And see, Trigley Puff is angry.
[02:17:20.045 --> 02:17:23.686]  Can you imagine ten days in, what that woman will be like?
[02:17:23.686 --> 02:17:25.887]  Can you imagine a hundred thousand people?
[02:17:25.887 --> 02:17:27.567]  She'll be on a spit.
[02:17:27.567 --> 02:17:29.307]  She'll be getting roasted.
[02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:30.868]  You know, I forgot what the percentage of people is.
[02:17:30.868 --> 02:17:32.208]  Which part would you, what part would you eat first?
[02:17:33.356 --> 02:17:35.958]  You had to roast her.
[02:17:35.958 --> 02:17:38.120]  I wouldn't eat anything.
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.742]  I don't know.
[02:17:39.742 --> 02:17:41.023]  Put her back up there.
[02:17:41.023 --> 02:17:43.845]  Backstrap.
[02:17:43.845 --> 02:17:44.746]  I would stay vegetarian.
[02:17:44.746 --> 02:17:46.208]  I'd go eat some grass or something.
[02:17:46.208 --> 02:17:47.289]  I'd stay vegetarian.
[02:17:47.289 --> 02:17:48.229]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:17:48.229 --> 02:17:49.330]  That's for the media.
[02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:50.291]  You know it'll be headline.
[02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:54.895]  Jones in racist rant talks about what part of a black woman would he eat as a cannibal.
[02:17:54.895 --> 02:17:57.398]  We're talking about the Pentagon saying we're zombies killing everybody.
[02:17:58.211 --> 02:18:05.613]  Okay, let's put some white Walmart Martian up, and I'll ask which part will eat her.
[02:18:05.613 --> 02:18:11.674]  Here guys, let's look at some Walmart photos, and we'll discuss the delicatessen there, because this is how the government's talking about us, not the group.
[02:18:11.674 --> 02:18:12.935]  We've got to be serious about it.
[02:18:12.935 --> 02:18:16.735]  How many million people right now are on food stamps and EBT cards?
[02:18:16.735 --> 02:18:20.076]  Be honest though, you had no food, no nothing, and you knew help was coming.
[02:18:20.076 --> 02:18:22.177]  You were in a frozen plane crash, and it was dead people.
[02:18:22.177 --> 02:18:22.777]  Would you eat them?
[02:18:23.905 --> 02:18:24.385]  I would eat it.
[02:18:24.385 --> 02:18:24.926]  Yeah, I would eat it.
[02:18:24.926 --> 02:18:25.726]  Sure, so let's be honest.
[02:18:25.726 --> 02:18:26.726]  So you're on a plane.
[02:18:26.726 --> 02:18:27.787]  She's the only other passenger.
[02:18:27.787 --> 02:18:28.207]  Your kids are there.
[02:18:28.207 --> 02:18:28.567]  You're starving.
[02:18:28.567 --> 02:18:30.048]  Let's put her back on screen.
[02:18:30.048 --> 02:18:34.831]  I want to ask, which part looks the most selectable?
[02:18:34.831 --> 02:18:38.413]  Well, probably, you know, looking at it from a nutritional standpoint.
[02:18:38.413 --> 02:18:39.253]  Put her back on screen.
[02:18:39.253 --> 02:18:40.654]  This is just science, folks.
[02:18:40.654 --> 02:18:41.234]  Go ahead.
[02:18:41.234 --> 02:18:44.316]  I would probably, you know, to get my essential fatty acids.
[02:18:44.316 --> 02:18:44.776]  The brain.
[02:18:44.776 --> 02:18:45.857]  The brain.
[02:18:45.857 --> 02:18:46.477]  Yeah.
[02:18:46.477 --> 02:18:48.038]  That has a bioaccumulation problem.
[02:18:48.038 --> 02:18:50.599]  That's probably going to be the first thing that degrades.
[02:18:50.599 --> 02:18:52.120]  I would just, you know... But for flavor?
[02:18:54.191 --> 02:18:59.759]  I don't think that would be too flavorful, but definitely not the liver for flavor.
[02:18:59.759 --> 02:19:05.206]  I don't know what's going on with her limp right over there, but that's a good question, Alex.
[02:19:05.206 --> 02:19:06.688]  What part would you eat?
[02:19:06.688 --> 02:19:07.289]  The hind quarter.
[02:19:07.289 --> 02:19:08.731]  That's pretty damn juicy.
[02:19:17.146 --> 02:19:20.609]  I'm sorry, the Pentagon is openly saying we're all zombies.
[02:19:20.609 --> 02:19:22.650]  There's a total collapse being engineered.
[02:19:22.650 --> 02:19:24.752]  I'm just illustrating how absurd this has gotten.
[02:19:24.752 --> 02:19:26.353]  You know?
[02:19:26.353 --> 02:19:31.517]  Well, you eat or be eaten, because I guarantee you folks, I've got storable food and weapons.
[02:19:31.517 --> 02:19:33.999]  It's going to be folks like that woman, that white lady right there.
[02:19:34.879 --> 02:19:35.800]  That arm looks pretty good.
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:36.700]  That right arm looks pretty juicy.
[02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:39.302]  You would be basically eating all the fat, Alex.
[02:19:39.302 --> 02:19:41.003]  But that would probably give you some energy.
[02:19:41.003 --> 02:19:43.825]  Isn't fat one of the best, you know, high-energy things there is?
[02:19:43.825 --> 02:19:44.906]  Yeah, it is.
[02:19:44.906 --> 02:19:46.047]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:46.047 --> 02:19:48.148]  I'd roast her fat and use that for cooking.
[02:19:48.148 --> 02:19:48.608]  Vegetables.
[02:19:48.608 --> 02:19:50.129]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:19:50.129 --> 02:19:51.290]  I mean, I want to be connoisseur.
[02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:53.832]  Look, if I'm going to have to eat people, I'm going to enjoy it.
[02:19:53.832 --> 02:19:55.853]  And I'm not going to eat the brains.
[02:19:55.853 --> 02:19:57.174]  That bioaccumulates toxins, but you're right.
[02:19:57.174 --> 02:19:59.035]  It has a lot of the best.
[02:19:59.035 --> 02:19:59.556]  No, you're right.
[02:19:59.556 --> 02:20:00.116]  You're right.
[02:20:00.116 --> 02:20:00.697]  We'll be back.
[02:20:00.697 --> 02:20:01.117]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.684 --> 02:20:11.690]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist, author of 85 books, and founder of the national chain, Meyer Clinics, to tell you about two Your Health liquid vitamins.

[02:21:01.423 --> 02:21:09.573]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:21:09.573 --> 02:21:10.394]  Here's why.
[02:21:10.394 --> 02:21:14.519]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:21:14.519 --> 02:21:15.441]  So please listen.
[02:21:15.441 --> 02:21:18.865]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:21:19.125 --> 02:21:25.468]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:21:25.468 --> 02:21:32.751]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:35.091]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:21:35.091 --> 02:21:46.256]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:21:46.636 --> 02:21:48.359]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:21:48.359 --> 02:21:50.041]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:21:50.041 --> 02:21:51.784]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:21:51.784 --> 02:21:55.629]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:21:55.629 --> 02:21:57.192]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:21:57.192 --> 02:21:58.554]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:02.221]  My name is Jay.
[02:22:02.221 --> 02:22:07.165]  I'm 26 years of age, and I just want to thank the makers of the One World Way protein powder.
[02:22:07.165 --> 02:22:11.989]  After having chronic abdominal pain and pressure for months, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.
[02:22:11.989 --> 02:22:16.393]  The medical doctor told me there was nothing I could do to treat it, other than taking pain and nausea medication.
[02:22:16.693 --> 02:22:22.597]  Then, I came across an ad for One World Way on the radio and read the claims that it can help with all types of inflammation.
[02:22:22.597 --> 02:22:29.341]  I took the One World Way protein powder every day for a month and the chronic pain and pressure sensations went away completely.

[02:24:01.909 --> 02:24:04.670]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:08.872]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:08.872 --> 02:24:13.655]  I was discussing with Gallo's humor the Dr. Group riding shotgun with me earlier.
[02:24:15.117 --> 02:24:18.500]  You know, the Pentagon says if society collapses, there's going to be cannibalism and all this.
[02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:23.143]  I was saying, which wall Martian would you be forced to eat?
[02:24:23.143 --> 02:24:24.885]  That's a very, very sad topic.
[02:24:24.885 --> 02:24:25.665]  Let's get serious.
[02:24:25.665 --> 02:24:27.267]  I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:24:27.267 --> 02:24:28.828]  Infowars.com right now.
[02:24:28.828 --> 02:24:30.369]  This is so sensational.
[02:24:30.369 --> 02:24:32.311]  My interpretation is correct.
[02:24:32.311 --> 02:24:43.620]  When Lynch did that talk this morning at the Aspen Institute and said that, oh, I'll take what they say and I'll go with that, but then we'll make sure it's correct at the Justice Department and what we're going to do with it.
[02:24:44.827 --> 02:24:55.601]  Well, now that DOJ sources come out, even Bloomberg's reporting this, Lynch reserves right to overrule FBI on Clinton probe.
[02:24:55.601 --> 02:25:01.970]  She's be forced on this, despite reassurances Lynch, to ultimately decide Hillary's fate.
[02:25:03.584 --> 02:25:07.727]  And she had the meeting they tried to keep secret with Clinton showing the bad intent.
[02:25:07.727 --> 02:25:09.268]  This is unbelievable.
[02:25:09.268 --> 02:25:12.710]  That's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:24.739]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, sounds like a country music singer's name, is reserving the right to overrule the FBI's decisions on whether to prosecute Hillary Clinton according to senior Justice Department official.
[02:25:25.592 --> 02:25:35.554]  From a senior DOJ official, Attorney General Lynch reserves the right to overrule the recommendations of career prosecutors, and the FBI and the Hillary Clinton email probe, Bloomberg's Mark Halperin tweeted.
[02:25:35.554 --> 02:25:36.114]  See?
[02:25:36.114 --> 02:25:37.254]  Told you!
[02:25:37.254 --> 02:25:41.395]  Even when they say it, people can't, I mean, Dan Bongino's a smart guy, but you're like, really?
[02:25:41.395 --> 02:25:42.616]  I guess they don't, wow!
[02:25:42.616 --> 02:25:44.896]  See, because the media ran with it, she said she would.
[02:25:44.896 --> 02:25:50.417]  This official says the probability she would overrule is very, very low, but it is not zero.
[02:25:50.417 --> 02:25:53.878]  So the news is, she will not recuse, despite the firestorm.
[02:25:55.555 --> 02:25:56.976]  They're just getting you ready for her to do it.
[02:25:56.976 --> 02:26:02.501]  Oh, she probably won't, but, oh well, we have some serious misconduct of some of these agents.
[02:26:02.501 --> 02:26:03.982]  One of them, you know, is a pedophile.
[02:26:03.982 --> 02:26:05.303]  One of them is a son of such.
[02:26:05.303 --> 02:26:06.324]  That's the word.
[02:26:06.324 --> 02:26:10.287]  And of course, that's who they put in charge to do it, so they could burn them.
[02:26:10.287 --> 02:26:11.348]  So it's a serious issue.
[02:26:11.348 --> 02:26:12.489]  Dr. Griff, brief comment on that?
[02:26:12.489 --> 02:26:13.810]  I want you to ride shotgun the rest of the hour with us.
[02:26:13.810 --> 02:26:14.791]  We're going to go to phone calls.
[02:26:14.791 --> 02:26:16.413]  Yeah, I don't really have a brief comment on that.
[02:26:16.413 --> 02:26:17.093]  I mean, it's just...
[02:26:18.573 --> 02:26:20.937]  It's just, you know, you know how the government works.
[02:26:20.937 --> 02:26:22.300]  But it's getting worse!
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:25.004]  It's been getting worse and getting worse.
[02:26:25.004 --> 02:26:29.032]  The good thing is it's actually out in the open now so people can see it.
[02:26:29.032 --> 02:26:30.534]  I mean, it doesn't take...
[02:26:31.374 --> 02:26:33.456]  You know, all you have to do is just put two and two together.
[02:26:33.456 --> 02:26:38.843]  You know, you have her meeting on the tarmac with Bill Clinton.
[02:26:38.843 --> 02:26:41.606]  I mean, come on, that's easy.
[02:26:41.606 --> 02:26:49.575]  You know, they're now coming out where she's going to give the final word whether or not Hillary's going to be prosecuted.
[02:26:49.575 --> 02:26:51.378]  You know, same old stuff, different day.
[02:26:53.083 --> 02:27:03.568]  By the way, I didn't intend to get back into the supplements, back into preparedness and things, even though we're running a 20-40% special that ends after the 4th of July on storable foods, X2 is 20% off, you name it.
[02:27:03.568 --> 02:27:05.669]  A lot of these callers are for you, Dr. Group.
[02:27:05.669 --> 02:27:08.350]  I said the topic is collapse and lynch.
[02:27:08.350 --> 02:27:10.211]  They want to talk to Group, so that's fine.
[02:27:10.211 --> 02:27:14.133]  Steven Alabama wants to talk X2, Nick wants to talk Mexico, Wall, China, Trump.
[02:27:14.133 --> 02:27:17.315]  Liberty Monk wants to talk Clinton, Trump, and race relations.
[02:27:18.035 --> 02:27:19.996]  Frank wants to talk X2 and Prostate.
[02:27:19.996 --> 02:27:23.276]  Kevin wants to talk Dr. Group Products and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:27:23.276 --> 02:27:25.757]  So we'll do all that coming up after the break.
[02:27:25.757 --> 02:27:28.938]  But right now, as I just said, let's start taking your phone calls.
[02:27:28.938 --> 02:27:30.698]  Oh, I was just going to Liberty Monk.
[02:27:30.698 --> 02:27:31.379]  Did Liberty Monk hang up?
[02:27:31.379 --> 02:27:34.279]  Because I was about to go to him.
[02:27:34.279 --> 02:27:37.060]  Okay, right as I was going to him, he dropped off.
[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:40.121]  Okay, so let's go to Nick in Pennsylvania.
[02:27:40.121 --> 02:27:40.601]  You're on the air.
[02:27:40.601 --> 02:27:42.142]  Thanks for holding.
[02:27:42.142 --> 02:27:42.902]  Hi, hi.
[02:27:42.902 --> 02:27:43.442]  Welcome.
[02:27:43.442 --> 02:27:43.702]  Thank you.
[02:27:45.254 --> 02:27:46.074]  I love what you're doing.
[02:27:46.074 --> 02:27:47.175]  First time caller.
[02:27:47.175 --> 02:27:48.235]  Keep up the good work.
[02:27:48.235 --> 02:27:53.197]  I wanted to get your take on something Trump brought out today.
[02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:58.538]  He said he's going to use the Patriot Act to help Mexico pay for the wall.
[02:27:58.538 --> 02:28:03.520]  Are you at all concerned about him using a globalist tactic against him?
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:08.462]  Well, I mean, the Patriot Act, they claim it's for terrorist or foreign interest.
[02:28:09.443 --> 02:28:11.864]  engage in activities against the U.S.
[02:28:11.864 --> 02:28:15.466]  The problem is it's been written to be used against the American people and it already is.
[02:28:15.466 --> 02:28:18.608]  Thousands of times, I mean a month, I mean that's conservative.
[02:28:18.608 --> 02:28:22.070]  It's used ubiquitously now across the board.
[02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:31.595]  So I didn't get the specifics of what he was saying, but I don't care if he uses anti-terrorism legislation as long as there's transparency against multinationals.
[02:28:31.595 --> 02:28:33.215]  That's what it's supposed to be for.
[02:28:33.215 --> 02:28:35.957]  You're not supposed to apply stuff to citizens that violate our rights.
[02:28:37.093 --> 02:28:39.894]  But that's one problem I have, is he wants to sound tough.
[02:28:39.894 --> 02:28:43.276]  I don't like the waterboarding talk and stuff like that.
[02:28:43.276 --> 02:28:45.137]  Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[02:28:45.137 --> 02:28:53.301]  Basically, the specifics was he was going to use a thing where the Western Union had to know the customer and know the... Oh, well that makes... Oh, exactly!
[02:28:53.301 --> 02:28:54.362]  Oh, well I didn't know that.
[02:28:54.362 --> 02:28:54.782]  Wow.
[02:28:54.782 --> 02:28:55.303]  Yeah.
[02:28:55.303 --> 02:28:59.445]  Patriot Act is expanded to know your customer, to harass everything I do.
[02:28:59.445 --> 02:29:04.627]  Sometimes around Christmas, I'll go get like $3,000, $4,000 out of the bank to give to little cousins and kids and stuff, you know, $100, whatever.
[02:29:06.348 --> 02:29:09.811]  Uh, and they'll just be like, oh my, they're like, what is this for?
[02:29:09.811 --> 02:29:10.412]  What are you doing?
[02:29:10.412 --> 02:29:10.912]  What are you doing?
[02:29:10.912 --> 02:29:12.914]  I'm like, just fill out your suspicious thing.
[02:29:12.914 --> 02:29:13.774]  Okay.
[02:29:13.774 --> 02:29:14.415]  I know I'm evil.
[02:29:14.415 --> 02:29:18.158]  I got cash, but, but absolutely all this money being sent to Mexico.
[02:29:20.245 --> 02:29:22.587]  If it's being done to the American people, it should be done to everybody.
[02:29:22.587 --> 02:29:26.811]  It's like, let the illegals in, don't test them for disease, but then I gotta go through a TSA checkpoint.
[02:29:26.811 --> 02:29:29.453]  I'm not even against all these people that are coming in overall.
[02:29:29.453 --> 02:29:33.557]  It's just that, it's that there's no controls on them, but controls on me.
[02:29:33.557 --> 02:29:34.438]  Exactly.
[02:29:34.438 --> 02:29:35.499]  Exactly.
[02:29:35.499 --> 02:29:36.360]  We're the Americans.
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:37.481]  I mean, we're the citizens.
[02:29:37.481 --> 02:29:38.281]  It's our country.
[02:29:38.281 --> 02:29:39.943]  I mean, you know, I don't have a problem.
[02:29:39.943 --> 02:29:41.404]  There just needs to be some control.
[02:29:41.404 --> 02:29:42.385]  It's just out of control.
[02:29:42.385 --> 02:29:45.188]  Hey, Nick, I'm gonna come right back to you and let you get a comment back.
[02:29:45.188 --> 02:29:46.028]  We'll go to more calls.
[02:29:46.028 --> 02:29:46.389]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.734 --> 02:29:53.741]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.741 --> 02:29:57.350]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.508 --> 02:30:09.491]  Barack Obama's propaganda tool clock boy, Ahmed Mohammed, talks about life in Qatar and what he's learned about hate.
[02:30:09.491 --> 02:30:19.295]  Ahmed, the Muslim teenager who was suspended for bringing a homemade clock that looked like a f***ing bomb to school in Irvine, poses for a photograph at his home.
[02:30:19.295 --> 02:30:27.078]  If I'm not mistaken, isn't Qatar the same place that Barack Obama traded Bo Bergdahl for the freaking Taliban Five?
[02:30:27.078 --> 02:30:28.939]  But let's go back to this stupid article.
[02:30:29.059 --> 02:30:36.526]  He's no longer surprised when people recognize him since his arrest at Irvine's MacArthur High School in September, when he brought a homemade clock.
[02:30:36.526 --> 02:30:36.907]  No!
[02:30:36.907 --> 02:30:38.328]  It's not a homemade clock!
[02:30:38.328 --> 02:30:44.254]  You took a clock, then you gutted it, and you laid it in a suitcase to look like a f***ing bomb!
[02:30:44.554 --> 02:30:48.075]  Anybody in their right mind would have said that looks like a f***ing bomb.
[02:30:48.075 --> 02:30:54.776]  But because you're Arabic, we have to all sit around and bow down while you go eat at the White House with the Islam in chief.
[02:30:54.776 --> 02:30:57.397]  Hands across America for this clock, boy.
[02:30:57.397 --> 02:30:58.077]  Negative.
[02:30:58.077 --> 02:31:01.318]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:31:01.318 --> 02:31:09.580]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.

[02:32:01.144 --> 02:32:02.045]  Shower Filters.
[02:32:02.045 --> 02:32:03.786]  We're introducing the best yet.

[02:32:30.842 --> 02:32:34.343]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:34.343 --> 02:32:42.586]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:42.586 --> 02:32:48.007]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:48.007 --> 02:32:50.528]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:52.649]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:33:17.199 --> 02:33:19.324]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.324 --> 02:33:21.328]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:21.328 --> 02:33:22.130]  Are you mine?
[02:33:23.686 --> 02:33:26.127]  Alright, I want to take a bunch of your calls and cover a ton of news.
[02:33:26.127 --> 02:33:33.068]  The big news, DOJ source Lynch reserves right to overrule FBI on Clinton probe, despite reassurances.
[02:33:33.068 --> 02:33:35.609]  Lynch to ultimately decide Hillary's fate.
[02:33:35.609 --> 02:33:39.450]  FBI at Clinton-Lynch meeting ordered press to shut down.
[02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:41.370]  No photos, no video.
[02:33:41.370 --> 02:33:48.732]  Meanwhile, this is a two-minute video, and then I'm going to go right to your calls, Nick, Steve, Cindy, Frank, Kevin, and everybody here with Dr. Group, and he's got other news to hit.
[02:33:49.693 --> 02:33:56.836]  But suspected Istanbul attack mastermind was a refugee protected by the EU.
[02:33:56.836 --> 02:33:59.777]  And Swedish women used bracelets to stop Muslim rapists.
[02:33:59.777 --> 02:34:05.699]  Now, again, I'll describe this for radio listeners, but Joe Biggs reports on it, Leanne reports on it briefly.
[02:34:05.699 --> 02:34:09.681]  And then we just show how ridiculous it is with Joe dressed up like a jihadi.
[02:34:10.703 --> 02:34:14.949]  Or an orthodox Muslim, I guess, thinks any unattended woman is his.
[02:34:14.949 --> 02:34:21.939]  Coming up, about to jump on a woman like they do in Cologne and everywhere else, in Sweden, you name it, and then he just goes away because he sees the bracelet.
[02:34:21.939 --> 02:34:24.122]  Here is Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs' report.
[02:34:24.122 --> 02:34:24.883]  I'll narrate part of it.
[02:34:25.247 --> 02:34:29.350]  It looks like the Swedes have figured out how to stop migrant sexual attacks.
[02:34:29.350 --> 02:34:29.870]  That's right.
[02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:34.613]  Breitbart is reporting about a recent Swedish press release that's warning about groping.
[02:34:34.613 --> 02:34:35.513]  It's a crime.
[02:34:35.513 --> 02:34:44.219]  You can't hold women and touch their breasts or grab them between their legs at a concert just because their bodies are crushing against you in a crowd.
[02:34:44.219 --> 02:34:50.483]  So a press release announced that police intend to equip young women with wristbands with the slogan
[02:34:51.263 --> 02:34:52.303]  Don't touch me.
[02:34:52.303 --> 02:34:54.224]  So these are very powerful wristbands.
[02:34:54.224 --> 02:34:59.626]  They must be sort of like Wonder Woman's wristbands, of course, as she is repelling danger.
[02:34:59.626 --> 02:35:02.507]  And they say that these are going to be the things that are going to equip women.
[02:35:02.507 --> 02:35:06.829]  By wearing these wristbands, young women will be able to make a stand.
[02:35:06.829 --> 02:35:17.173]  Now, it's unclear how effective these wristbands are going to be because they're written in Swedish and most of the migrants who are doing the raping do not read these Swedish words.
[02:35:17.173 --> 02:35:20.094]  And now a recent police report released last month noted that the
[02:35:20.094 --> 02:35:24.897]  The country had the worst rates of sexual violence against women in Europe.
[02:35:24.897 --> 02:35:41.646]  Indeed, in 2013, it was reported that one in four Swedish women will be raped as sexual assaults there increase by 500% as they're importing all of these migrants who are, you know, not used to the ways of dealing with women who are, you know, asking for it.
[02:35:41.646 --> 02:35:45.508]  So these bracelets are nothing more than hashtag activism come to life.
[02:35:46.385 --> 02:35:49.568]  Joe starts sneaking up as a jihadi, but she shows him the wristband.
[02:35:49.568 --> 02:35:49.989]  Yeah.
[02:35:49.989 --> 02:35:51.910]  These are really going to be safe and effective.
[02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:53.092]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[02:35:53.092 --> 02:35:56.034]  It's just that ridiculous.
[02:35:56.034 --> 02:35:57.896]  And it works.
[02:35:57.896 --> 02:36:00.659]  Exactly, that's the other funny part.
[02:36:00.659 --> 02:36:06.044]  It's in Swedish, but it'd be like putting a wristband on a mosquito saying, don't suck my blood.
[02:36:06.044 --> 02:36:06.685]  But I'll look!
[02:36:11.556 --> 02:36:12.719]  She's not wearing hers.
[02:36:12.719 --> 02:36:13.060]  Ah, yes.
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:14.524]  Come to me.
[02:36:23.769 --> 02:36:33.512]  The fact that the Swedish police think that this is actually a reasonable way to stop rape from happening by giving someone a bracelet is completely and totally ridiculous.
[02:36:33.512 --> 02:36:38.594]  There's nothing funny about rape, but what is a serious matter is the second amendment.
[02:36:38.594 --> 02:36:45.897]  If he takes the ability away to protect themselves, then we have to resort to stupid ideas like this.
[02:36:45.897 --> 02:36:49.198]  Maybe he's a reincarnation of Mohammed back to behave himself.
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:54.823]  He's like the good Muhammad reincarnated, coming back to spend time in the military.
[02:36:54.823 --> 02:36:56.224]  That's right.
[02:36:56.224 --> 02:36:57.205]  Yeah.
[02:36:57.205 --> 02:36:59.646]  And now works for... Hey, I'm Bill Hicks!
[02:36:59.646 --> 02:37:00.387]  He's spreading the word.
[02:37:00.387 --> 02:37:02.008]  I'm Bill Hicks.
[02:37:02.008 --> 02:37:03.029]  Joe Biggs is Muhammad.
[02:37:04.639 --> 02:37:06.100]  Try that conspiracy on for size.
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:08.581]  Want to look at some more Wal-Martian photos?
[02:37:08.581 --> 02:37:16.966]  It's not like you go to a steakhouse, they got images of the cow there, and like what cut you're getting, and the big glass thing, all the meat cutlets.
[02:37:16.966 --> 02:37:17.066]  Yeah.
[02:37:17.066 --> 02:37:21.068]  Now they're talking about zombie collapse and stuff, you know, and pitting us as if we're going to be eating each other.
[02:37:21.068 --> 02:37:22.228]  We should start learning the cuts.
[02:37:22.228 --> 02:37:24.490]  Yeah, if I was Jed, I would just get rid of that.
[02:37:24.490 --> 02:37:26.471]  What's the equivalent on a human of like a filet mignon?
[02:37:27.369 --> 02:37:28.810]  Probably the back strap.
[02:37:28.810 --> 02:37:30.130]  Yeah, so that's... Right down the spine, yeah.
[02:37:30.130 --> 02:37:34.593]  So right down the spine, that's where you'd find what a smaller, uh, what, Chateaubriand?
[02:37:34.593 --> 02:37:35.053]  Probably.
[02:37:35.053 --> 02:37:38.695]  And then what's the ribeye?
[02:37:38.695 --> 02:37:41.416]  Probably around your ribs or something, I don't know.
[02:37:41.416 --> 02:37:46.139]  I mean, I don't know!
[02:37:46.139 --> 02:37:51.921]  I mean, I can tell you all the muscles and all the bones, but... Well, as Venezuela, they're basically eating each other now under love-loving liberalisms.
[02:37:51.921 --> 02:37:53.442]  We gotta get ready.
[02:37:53.442 --> 02:37:54.063]  Seriously, folks, 40...
[02:37:55.236 --> 02:37:58.881]  percent off on some of this horrible food, 20% on the lowest stuff.
[02:37:58.881 --> 02:38:01.164]  A really good deal running through next week.
[02:38:01.164 --> 02:38:02.726]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[02:38:02.726 --> 02:38:04.828]  I'm making jokes about this because it's so serious.
[02:38:04.828 --> 02:38:05.749]  The globals are digging in.
[02:38:05.749 --> 02:38:07.051]  There's a lot of signs.
[02:38:07.051 --> 02:38:12.818]  Now's the time to celebrate your Independence Day, not just with hot dogs and beer or family, which is great, but remembering what made America great.
[02:38:13.399 --> 02:38:19.540]  Recommitting to fight the globalists, taking action in the info war, supporting the broadcast, and more importantly getting yourselves self-sufficient.
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:24.581]  Infowarstore.com, Water Filtration, Survival Shield X2, and so many other great products.
[02:38:24.581 --> 02:38:25.722]  Nick, finish up your point.
[02:38:25.722 --> 02:38:27.982]  I mean, you heard our response.
[02:38:27.982 --> 02:38:35.984]  By the way, that's remittance is what Trump's talking about when he says, hey, you know, under the Patriot Act we can take money that we say is associated with crime
[02:38:36.944 --> 02:38:49.489]  And so I guess he can say if Mexico doesn't pay for the wall and some of its crime and its anchor babies up here, he'd start taking money out of general Mexican citizens' bank accounts when they send it back via Western Union.
[02:38:49.489 --> 02:38:54.772]  I mean, I understand Mexico is crapping all over us, but at the same time, I just don't like Big Brother stuff, period.
[02:38:55.632 --> 02:38:56.072]  I agree.
[02:38:56.072 --> 02:39:07.735]  You know, Barack Obama just came out in a speech to the FEMA National Response Coordination Center in Washington, and he explained that it was up to each citizen to be prepared for disasters.
[02:39:07.735 --> 02:39:09.015]  This is not too long ago.
[02:39:09.015 --> 02:39:10.295]  They didn't used to talk like that.
[02:39:10.295 --> 02:39:19.717]  The preparation should extend to having an evacuation plan and having a fully stocked disaster supply kit.
[02:39:19.717 --> 02:39:20.977]  And they never did that before.
[02:39:20.977 --> 02:39:24.298]  Now they're kind of putting billboards up and stuff, so they want to be able to tell us, hey, we warned you.
[02:39:24.838 --> 02:39:26.858]  Yeah, but they warn you like two seconds before they punch you.
[02:39:26.858 --> 02:39:27.279]  Watch out!
[02:39:27.279 --> 02:39:27.899]  Boom!
[02:39:27.899 --> 02:39:29.679]  Oh, see, I warned you.
[02:39:29.679 --> 02:39:30.959]  Look out!
[02:39:30.959 --> 02:39:38.921]  But you know, the FBI and Homeland Security have seen prepping as a sign of incipient terrorism as a matter of policy.
[02:39:38.921 --> 02:39:45.402]  In fact, you can get investigated if the federal government notices signs of unusual prepping in your house.
[02:39:45.402 --> 02:39:46.923]  Let's just let them investigate us all then.
[02:39:46.923 --> 02:39:47.423]  Nick, go ahead.
[02:39:49.388 --> 02:40:06.757]  Yeah, I'm equally concerned about Trump doing the big brother kind of thing, but I think I'm almost more concerned about the aftereffects, because in the memo he breaks down day by day what he believes Mexico will do, and I'm worried there could be riots from the illegal
[02:40:07.512 --> 02:40:10.594]  Illegals who can't send their money back and... No, I hear you, but I mean, here's the deal.
[02:40:10.594 --> 02:40:11.635]  Here's the deal.
[02:40:11.635 --> 02:40:14.037]  Citizens are being treated like crap.
[02:40:14.037 --> 02:40:16.459]  Big corporations on both sides are using people.
[02:40:16.459 --> 02:40:18.060]  It's hurting everybody on both sides.
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:18.920]  We've got to do something.
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:20.221]  We can't just advertise the world.
[02:40:20.221 --> 02:40:21.022]  Forget Mexicans.
[02:40:21.022 --> 02:40:24.184]  They always get the main thing because that was the biggest population coming here.
[02:40:24.184 --> 02:40:27.326]  Chinese women now are the biggest number to get everything free.
[02:40:27.326 --> 02:40:29.028]  They advertise that we're idiots.
[02:40:30.043 --> 02:40:31.384]  Well, you just don't like Asians.
[02:40:31.384 --> 02:40:32.645]  No, that's nothing to do with it.
[02:40:32.645 --> 02:40:34.527]  I'm not going to play race card on that.
[02:40:34.527 --> 02:40:36.429]  You know, it's absolute bull.
[02:40:36.429 --> 02:40:40.432]  I can't go to China and get stuff for free.
[02:40:40.432 --> 02:40:41.093]  I appreciate your call, Max.
[02:40:41.093 --> 02:40:44.896]  You can give anybody anything for free and it's going to cause a problem eventually.
[02:40:44.896 --> 02:40:45.216]  That's right.
[02:40:45.216 --> 02:40:47.318]  I want to talk to Kevin in Colorado.
[02:40:47.318 --> 02:40:51.361]  Then we're going to go in order to Frank, Cindy, and Bitter.
[02:40:51.361 --> 02:40:52.422]  Bitter Klinger.
[02:40:52.422 --> 02:40:53.443]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:40:53.443 --> 02:40:54.444]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:40:58.146 --> 02:41:08.973]  I just want to thank you for, I know you don't like being thanked, but I just have to thank you because I'm only like 21 years old and when I was out of high school I listened to your show and completely woke me up.
[02:41:28.652 --> 02:41:52.297]  Yeah, I just, I mean, like you're right though, you know, I had no idea what was going on, so you, you, you brought this whole another world on me, so, you know, which that's why I just gotta thank you, and especially Dr. Group, too, because I've tried the product, I'm a subscriber to Prison Planet, and I've tried X2, and, um, the, you know, I've tried Supermetal Vitality, and all of it works great, and right now I actually am doing the Living Defense, so,
[02:41:53.007 --> 02:41:56.611]  I just want to thank you for, you know, making these products.
[02:41:56.611 --> 02:42:07.664]  And I just got to say to all the other listeners that getting this knowledge and information from both of these, Alex and Dr. Group, you know, it's very important.
[02:42:07.664 --> 02:42:10.006]  It's a privilege to get this information.
[02:42:10.006 --> 02:42:13.009]  I mean, you know, Dr. Group, especially you.
[02:42:13.009 --> 02:42:14.171]  You're so wise and, you know,
[02:42:14.893 --> 02:42:19.761]  You know, you teach us a lot every time you come on, so I really gotta thank you for everything you do.
[02:42:19.761 --> 02:42:20.863]  Well, God bless you, Kevin.
[02:42:20.863 --> 02:42:21.484]  I appreciate that.
[02:42:21.484 --> 02:42:22.124]  Thanks, Kevin.
[02:42:22.124 --> 02:42:24.749]  You know, Limbaugh said at a certain point, you gotta say dittos, but listen...
[02:42:25.996 --> 02:42:30.499]  Other people being informed and involved makes a better society and a better future for my children.
[02:42:30.499 --> 02:42:33.381]  The globalists love dumbed down people so they can feed on them.
[02:42:33.381 --> 02:42:34.221]  I don't want that.
[02:42:34.221 --> 02:42:35.482]  That builds a hell.
[02:42:35.482 --> 02:42:37.983]  And plus it's just a genetic or spiritual level.
[02:42:37.983 --> 02:42:39.244]  It just sounds like bad mojo.
[02:42:39.244 --> 02:42:40.305]  It sounds like bad luck.
[02:42:40.305 --> 02:42:43.967]  Even thinking about screwing somebody over really upsets me.
[02:42:43.967 --> 02:42:45.408]  And it's not because I'm a wimp.
[02:42:45.408 --> 02:42:48.290]  It's because I'm wired the way you're supposed to be wired.
[02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:51.852]  And so those of us, it's not a privilege, brother.
[02:42:52.432 --> 02:42:53.833]  Listen, we're in this together.
[02:42:53.833 --> 02:42:55.313]  You are just as important as we are.
[02:42:55.313 --> 02:42:57.034]  You're just as informed as we are.
[02:42:57.034 --> 02:42:57.874]  Start your own blog.
[02:42:57.874 --> 02:42:58.774]  Start your own website.
[02:42:58.774 --> 02:43:00.175]  Start your own YouTube channel.
[02:43:00.175 --> 02:43:00.775]  Get out there.
[02:43:00.775 --> 02:43:03.256]  People need you to warn them in your area as well.
[02:43:03.256 --> 02:43:05.497]  We're not the only Paul Revere's here.
[02:43:05.497 --> 02:43:11.619]  I love how Matt Drudge used to always tell people in the press and blogs, hey, I learned he didn't just tell me this, he told some other people this.
[02:43:11.619 --> 02:43:13.380]  You're just as important as the New York Times.
[02:43:14.755 --> 02:43:18.999]  There's so many people I know that the alternative media will break some huge thing that could be kind of like, oh, here it is.
[02:43:18.999 --> 02:43:19.740]  No!
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:21.161]  I mean, we are the real media.
[02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:23.343]  We're the ones that aren't bought and paid for.
[02:43:23.343 --> 02:43:25.005]  We're the ones that just tell it like it is.
[02:43:25.005 --> 02:43:25.846]  Doesn't mean we're perfect.
[02:43:25.846 --> 02:43:27.127]  You keep us honest.
[02:43:27.127 --> 02:43:28.048]  I mean, I make mistakes.
[02:43:28.048 --> 02:43:31.651]  I say things sometimes that I, you know, later look back on weren't absolutely correct.
[02:43:31.651 --> 02:43:32.772]  But it's not done on purpose.
[02:43:32.772 --> 02:43:34.114]  It's a lot of times done through fatigue.
[02:43:35.185 --> 02:43:39.427]  It's just about getting the truth out there and devoting and having that passion for change.
[02:43:39.427 --> 02:43:42.329]  I mean, for the Constitution, the original Constitution.
[02:43:42.329 --> 02:43:47.692]  My great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was the original writer of the Constitution, Pelletiah Webster.
[02:43:47.692 --> 02:43:49.453]  It's like, I have a devotion.
[02:43:50.473 --> 02:43:52.234]  You have a devotion for spreading news.
[02:43:52.234 --> 02:43:56.676]  We both have the devotion for getting people better because we know the general plan.
[02:43:56.676 --> 02:43:57.737]  We know what's going on.
[02:43:57.737 --> 02:43:59.738]  I hate seeing people get screwed over.
[02:43:59.738 --> 02:44:00.198]  I do too.
[02:44:00.198 --> 02:44:02.259]  I mean, I believe in karma, you know.
[02:44:02.259 --> 02:44:05.121]  It's like Nigerian scams.
[02:44:05.121 --> 02:44:11.004]  I've now learned, I mean, I knew about it, but it's epidemic worse than Nigerian scams is it's so-called playboy gigolo guys.
[02:44:11.604 --> 02:44:22.353]  Who can be like 45, 50 and just 70 year old women that are like widows or they split families up and they know how to program and manipulate them to trigger a midlife crisis in women.
[02:44:22.353 --> 02:44:28.079]  And so there's this epidemic of like guys ripping women off and their families even go to them and go it's a scam.
[02:44:28.079 --> 02:44:32.943]  They even find out the guys are a scam and people expose them and they still the women get taken.
[02:44:34.124 --> 02:44:37.305]  Cause you know, oh baby, I'm going to come see you but I need $5,000.
[02:44:37.305 --> 02:44:38.965]  Oh, now it's $10,000.
[02:44:38.965 --> 02:44:45.726]  It's just like, you know, I'm just, I tell you, there are women that milk men as well, but it's almost genetically, that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:44:45.726 --> 02:44:52.727]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing, but when I see a man milking a woman, it really gets me pissed.
[02:44:52.727 --> 02:44:53.947]  I mean, I'm just chivalrous.
[02:44:53.947 --> 02:44:55.008]  I can't help it.
[02:44:55.008 --> 02:44:55.788]  I agree.
[02:44:55.788 --> 02:45:01.269]  I mean, or a child or somebody that's, you know, anybody for that matter.
[02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:03.469]  Bill Clinton flying around with pedophiles on airplanes.
[02:45:03.849 --> 02:45:04.610]  It's just sick.
[02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:10.035]  I mean, you know, that's the whole purpose and the whole reason that we're trying to do what we're doing.
[02:45:10.035 --> 02:45:12.898]  But women love, on average, Bill Clinton and Hillary.
[02:45:12.898 --> 02:45:13.859]  They love rapists.
[02:45:13.859 --> 02:45:14.880]  They love evil.
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:15.561]  They love being caught.
[02:45:15.561 --> 02:45:17.243]  Because they buy into the glitch.
[02:45:17.243 --> 02:45:18.604]  It must all be good.
[02:45:18.604 --> 02:45:19.805]  The mainstream told you.
[02:45:20.666 --> 02:45:22.127]  CNN said it was good.
[02:45:22.127 --> 02:45:26.690]  CNN said Hillary's up by six points just out of the blue yesterday.
[02:45:26.690 --> 02:45:29.652]  You know, mainstream media is saying all these things.
[02:45:29.652 --> 02:45:36.596]  I tell you though, people are... I talk to people... But the New York Times, when Trump was in between marriages, he asked attractive women out.
[02:45:36.596 --> 02:45:39.638]  And they went out with him, and he was really nice to them.
[02:45:39.638 --> 02:45:44.441]  But he was real confident, and he had girlfriends, and he was real confident.
[02:45:46.933 --> 02:45:51.139]  It's targeting women that don't think they're successful to be envious of his lifestyle.
[02:45:51.139 --> 02:45:55.064]  Oh my gosh, he didn't rape women like Bill?
[02:45:55.064 --> 02:45:58.689]  He said he treated them super glamorous and took care of them?
[02:45:58.689 --> 02:46:02.735]  Oh my... Women, what a horrible man, Dr. Gribb!
[02:46:04.904 --> 02:46:05.864]  What a horrible man.
[02:46:05.864 --> 02:46:07.885]  I mean, I don't even know what to say to that one.
[02:46:07.885 --> 02:46:10.446]  It's just the main, that's why.
[02:46:10.446 --> 02:46:23.230]  But the story is these modern women don't want to be told, just like the Nigerian scam, when you tell them, this guy's a con artist, he ripped off eight other women, here's his aliases, here he is, because the way you catch them is they do, I know this happened to one of my friends.
[02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:26.271]  They do an image search of the person.
[02:46:26.271 --> 02:46:28.592]  Because even if they change their alias, you can do an image search.
[02:46:28.592 --> 02:46:31.874]  People save the photos, and then sure enough, there's the con man.
[02:46:31.874 --> 02:46:34.516]  And even when it's there, they're like, you're mad, he loves me.
[02:46:34.516 --> 02:46:35.316]  Well, have you ever met him?
[02:46:35.316 --> 02:46:38.819]  No, but he's coming, and he's rich, and he needs the money to get the money out of the account.
[02:46:38.819 --> 02:46:44.402]  He's going to give me a million dollars, and we're going to, and I'm going to get free health care, and everything's going to be wonderful.
[02:46:44.402 --> 02:46:45.743]  We're going to live in a utopia!
[02:46:45.743 --> 02:46:47.104]  Obama loves me!
[02:46:47.104 --> 02:46:47.704]  You're right!
[02:46:51.943 --> 02:46:57.408]  I mean, it's like Kanye West admits he loves pimping his audience.
[02:46:57.408 --> 02:47:02.634]  He loves telling them he's broke and raising millions off of them and laughing at them.
[02:47:02.634 --> 02:47:07.999]  It's like YouTube admits they love Khan and their audience, and their audience loves it too.
[02:47:07.999 --> 02:47:09.721]  What is the deal with that, man?
[02:47:09.721 --> 02:47:11.543]  It's leftist though!
[02:47:11.543 --> 02:47:12.584]  They are the idiots!
[02:47:13.274 --> 02:47:22.981]  I'll tell you one of the deals with it is that the communication has gone away from face-to-face communication and it's gone to texting and it's gone to email and it's gone to online.
[02:47:22.981 --> 02:47:25.243]  So people are developing relationships.
[02:47:25.243 --> 02:47:30.747]  And the fact of the matter is, Alex, people are depressed, they're unhappy, they're not happy with their self.
[02:47:30.747 --> 02:47:35.110]  And their husband or wife's telling them how the real world works and, you know, it's real issues.
[02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:40.254]  But some fantasy guy texts, we're going to give you free health care, we're going to give you free everything, you know.
[02:47:40.894 --> 02:47:48.880]  It's like the, uh, Fifty Shades of Grey when that came out and what it, you know, with the perfect billionaire guy that was so good.
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:51.743]  Suddenly women wanted to be slapped around.
[02:47:51.743 --> 02:47:55.666]  And, uh, you know, it's just an altered reality, really.
[02:47:55.666 --> 02:47:56.586]  I mean, that's, that's...
[02:47:57.830 --> 02:48:00.311]  You know, it's a sad thing that's happening all over the place.
[02:48:00.311 --> 02:48:04.273]  I mean, it's the best that we can do is just try to help as many people as we can.
[02:48:04.273 --> 02:48:11.938]  Yeah, so they come up with a bondage movie, make it sexy and palatable, and then suddenly mainline shopping malls are selling bondage gear.
[02:48:11.938 --> 02:48:14.179]  And they don't tell you where all that stuff leads or where it goes.
[02:48:15.179 --> 02:48:18.040]  The little kids in cages, you know, they're just, it's all fun.
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:37.788]  Right, and the sad thing about it is women were actually, you know, there were predators, like what you're talking about, and women were actually meeting these guys because of the book, because they weren't getting, it was a fantasy, and it was something exciting, and something... Well, no, I mean, again, it's the left that's generally into that.
[02:48:37.788 --> 02:48:40.409]  They're not leftists, they're mentally ill scum.
[02:48:41.345 --> 02:48:44.872]  And they're six times more likely to rob, six times more likely not to give to charity.
[02:48:44.872 --> 02:48:49.121]  And I don't mean real liberals like yourself, you know, these fake, loyd, modern weirdos.
[02:48:50.421 --> 02:48:51.882]  That's the world we live in right now.
[02:48:51.882 --> 02:48:53.404]  I mean, that's unfortunate.
[02:48:53.404 --> 02:48:55.465]  But there are good people out there.
[02:48:55.465 --> 02:49:00.529]  You know, there are good people out there and there's more and more good people like the caller earlier.
[02:49:00.529 --> 02:49:02.871]  You know, exactly what you said.
[02:49:02.871 --> 02:49:12.419]  Everybody that gets every time that someone gets a little more educated, every time somebody gets a little more healthy or they have one of their symptoms go away or they
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:17.322]  They drink purified water, or they learn to start exercising, all of it.
[02:49:17.322 --> 02:49:18.482]  They start spreading the word!
[02:49:18.482 --> 02:49:18.963]  This is what it is.
[02:49:18.963 --> 02:49:20.884]  It starts getting out there.
[02:49:20.884 --> 02:49:27.907]  The social engineers wouldn't let parents spank, wouldn't let them discipline, wouldn't let them make the kid walk home from school when they're 10, you know, the government takes them away.
[02:49:27.907 --> 02:49:32.609]  Now all these people have grown up, they're like 25-year-old arrested development kids.
[02:49:32.609 --> 02:49:39.332]  They feel like they have no power, and they're taught, go do deviant things, cut your finger off, you know, be tortured.
[02:49:39.332 --> 02:49:41.033]  That's how you get power is being deviant.
[02:49:41.773 --> 02:49:44.236]  No, that's not how you get power being deviant.
[02:49:44.236 --> 02:49:46.959]  And let me just say, believe me, I know, okay?
[02:49:46.959 --> 02:49:50.623]  I'm not saying I've done a bunch of wild stuff, but I've done more than most, let me tell you.
[02:49:50.623 --> 02:49:56.650]  So, I mean, I grew up in Dallas, I was a wild child, you know, and I'm telling you, it's not fulfilling, it's not going to help you.
[02:49:57.190 --> 02:50:06.077]  And the type of folks, not so much Bond, I've never been involved in that, but the people into all that stuff are really empty or they're predator psychopaths that really want to hurt you.
[02:50:06.077 --> 02:50:18.147]  And they may not kill you the fifth or sixth time you go over to their house, but they're watching you, they're keeping track, they're finding out if you have family, they're monitoring you, they're thinking about putting you in their freezer.
[02:50:21.676 --> 02:50:24.638]  So, I'm just telling you, stay away from liberals.
[02:50:24.638 --> 02:50:26.839]  They will slit your throat.
[02:50:26.839 --> 02:50:28.560]  They tell you all day they want to help you.
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:30.181]  They tell you all day, I'm skipping this break.
[02:50:30.181 --> 02:50:31.482]  They tell you all day they love you.
[02:50:31.482 --> 02:50:33.043]  They tell you all day they're the ones that care.
[02:50:33.043 --> 02:50:34.504]  They're the ones that have the answers.
[02:50:34.504 --> 02:50:35.745]  Look at them!
[02:50:35.745 --> 02:50:36.905]  They don't have any answers.
[02:50:36.905 --> 02:50:38.126]  They don't produce anything.
[02:50:38.126 --> 02:50:41.208]  They're criminals claiming they're philanthropists.
[02:50:41.208 --> 02:50:43.669]  They're god-awful scum.
[02:50:43.669 --> 02:50:45.030]  They hate black people.
[02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:50.994]  Obama, massively increasing, basically forced abortion in Africa, where they make you have the abortions or whatever.
[02:50:51.909 --> 02:51:00.334]  Doubling black unemployment, not visiting black communities, doing nothing, cutting off a bunch of programs, because they want you even more dependent.
[02:51:00.334 --> 02:51:02.615]  They've got you right, and they want everybody in that position.
[02:51:02.615 --> 02:51:04.536]  Dr. Group, we're on a call, but go ahead.
[02:51:04.536 --> 02:51:11.740]  No, I mean, I don't have anything to add to that, except for the fact that, you know, I think that we've lost the happiness factor.
[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:15.722]  I mean, how many people do you know that are truly happy?
[02:51:15.722 --> 02:51:16.242]  I am!
[02:51:16.242 --> 02:51:17.203]  I'm so happy I can't handle it.
[02:51:18.905 --> 02:51:21.069]  Well, here's the deal, though.
[02:51:21.069 --> 02:51:26.277]  These are the normal thing for a male to be dynamic, crazed, energetic, full of ideas.
[02:51:26.277 --> 02:51:27.459]  They call this manic.
[02:51:27.459 --> 02:51:28.741]  They call this narcissistic.
[02:51:28.741 --> 02:51:30.404]  They call this overly optimistic.
[02:51:30.404 --> 02:51:31.947]  This is what built civilization!
[02:51:33.447 --> 02:51:37.149]  It is what built civilization, and for a long time that's the way it was.
[02:51:37.149 --> 02:51:40.690]  But then when you start introducing fluoride, you start introducing all these chemicals.
[02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:46.773]  You know, the reason I keep coming back to chemicals is because I've done so many studies, and I'm obsessed with research.
[02:51:46.773 --> 02:51:50.475]  The White House Science Czar wrote an 1100 page book admitting they put chemicals in stuff to make us dumb.
[02:51:51.155 --> 02:51:51.536]  Right.
[02:51:51.536 --> 02:51:53.778]  So it all comes back to, who are you?
[02:51:53.778 --> 02:51:57.422]  I mean, are you, are we really like chemical zombies walking around everywhere?
[02:51:57.422 --> 02:51:59.123]  I mean, most people don't even know who they are.
[02:51:59.123 --> 02:52:04.829]  I would have, I would ask people and patients when they came in, what makes you happy?
[02:52:04.829 --> 02:52:05.971]  What do you do for fun?
[02:52:05.971 --> 02:52:07.913]  And they would just break down and start crying.
[02:52:08.473 --> 02:52:09.735]  It's like, who are you?
[02:52:09.735 --> 02:52:11.356]  What's your purpose in life?
[02:52:11.356 --> 02:52:12.518]  Where do you think we came from?
[02:52:12.518 --> 02:52:14.380]  This is what you should be thinking about all the time.
[02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:22.829]  This is what empowers you is tying into the universe, transcending the fake earth and the globalist fake reality that is meant to keep you from knowing the greater reality.
[02:52:23.490 --> 02:52:24.651]  So I'm like, you can change.
[02:52:24.651 --> 02:52:25.852]  You know, there's always hope.
[02:52:25.852 --> 02:52:27.733]  All you have to do is just put a little bit of time.
[02:52:27.733 --> 02:52:32.116]  All you gotta do is walk out and look at the stars at night and ask God to show himself to you.
[02:52:32.116 --> 02:52:34.337]  It's just like the fear factor with sunlight.
[02:52:34.337 --> 02:52:36.739]  You know, sun, sun is actually good for you.
[02:52:36.739 --> 02:52:37.920]  It's healing for you.
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:53.150]  And this White House regulations are wants to pass a law that it's hate speech, criminal neglect to tell you that you need 15 minutes of sun and when he says no sun and they know that because without sun you die and your eyes need sun every day to activate the chemical processes in the brain.
[02:52:53.390 --> 02:52:54.851]  Fact.
[02:52:54.851 --> 02:52:56.253]  Absolute fact.
[02:52:56.253 --> 02:52:56.693]  Absolutely.
[02:52:56.693 --> 02:53:00.918]  I mean, I can be down, something really bad happens, I just go out, lay out in the sun, 20 minutes, boom.
[02:53:00.918 --> 02:53:02.559]  It brings you... It's a drug.
[02:53:02.559 --> 02:53:03.120]  It is.
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:04.361]  It's like a drug.
[02:53:04.361 --> 02:53:12.149]  Who, like, if I could take anybody and put them out in a nice area, relaxed setting... That's why they call it forest bathing now.
[02:53:12.449 --> 02:53:18.853]  Watch the sunrise or watch the sunset and it immediately calms you down.
[02:53:18.853 --> 02:53:21.095]  It energizes you because it's also spiritual.
[02:53:21.095 --> 02:53:22.616]  It's a shared experience.
[02:53:22.616 --> 02:53:24.277]  We have consciousness and free will.
[02:53:24.277 --> 02:53:29.640]  The fact that we can recognize beauty, recognize wholesomeness, is our connection to God.
[02:53:30.501 --> 02:53:38.209]  And the Godhead, and that's why the CIA funded ugly art and degeneracy, was to make you think that was beautiful, to cut you off from God.
[02:53:38.209 --> 02:53:48.799]  It is the experience of beauty, the exercise of will and courage, in the defense of innocence, that is the first step towards your connection, and it is electrical.
[02:53:48.799 --> 02:53:51.482]  It's physical, not just spiritual, to the Creator.
[02:53:52.603 --> 02:53:59.326]  I mean, ultimately we should be taught, our kids should be taught about this in school, you know, taught about their body, how to listen to their body.
[02:53:59.326 --> 02:54:00.927]  We've just been disconnected.
[02:54:00.927 --> 02:54:06.429]  Anytime my family's fighting or having problems, if there's a sunset or sunrise going on, I go, come out here and look at this.
[02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:07.390]  It's all over.
[02:54:07.390 --> 02:54:07.530]  Boom.
[02:54:07.918 --> 02:54:08.538]  Yep.
[02:54:08.538 --> 02:54:09.238]  Yep.
[02:54:09.238 --> 02:54:12.239]  It's amazing when you look at... And the ancients all knew that.
[02:54:12.239 --> 02:54:13.260]  The ancients all knew that.
[02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:14.780]  You got up to see the sun.
[02:54:14.780 --> 02:54:16.041]  You sun gazed.
[02:54:16.041 --> 02:54:22.963]  Sun gazed was a, it was almost a, you know, priority that you did if you were sick, even if you weren't sick.
[02:54:22.963 --> 02:54:26.644]  As a matter of fact, there's been documentary films talking about sun gazing.
[02:54:26.644 --> 02:54:31.706]  Just don't do it when it's, you gotta do it when it's going through, through the atmosphere at the edge, through all the dust, when it's bright red.
[02:54:31.706 --> 02:54:32.766]  Yeah, like right at the bottom.
[02:54:32.766 --> 02:54:33.866]  Gotta be at the bottom, yeah.
[02:54:33.866 --> 02:54:35.807]  Of the sunrise or sunset.
[02:54:35.987 --> 02:54:37.207]  Yeah, so it's amazing.
[02:54:37.207 --> 02:54:38.248]  We never talked about this.
[02:54:38.248 --> 02:54:40.828]  This is all just ancient knowledge that you don't even need to book, folks.
[02:54:40.828 --> 02:54:41.669]  It's genetic.
[02:54:41.669 --> 02:54:42.609]  Everyone knows it.
[02:54:42.609 --> 02:54:46.730]  You know it deep down inside, but it's just that you're so... And God gave us.
[02:54:46.730 --> 02:54:47.870]  We're not worshiping the sun.
[02:54:47.870 --> 02:54:48.811]  God gave us that.
[02:54:48.811 --> 02:54:50.171]  We grow out of that.
[02:54:50.171 --> 02:54:56.453]  So that is literally another symbol of God that God gave us that's bigger, thousands of times bigger than the New World Order.
[02:54:56.453 --> 02:54:57.013]  It's there.
[02:54:57.013 --> 02:54:59.034]  It just dwarfs them.
[02:54:59.034 --> 02:54:59.734]  Ha ha!
[02:54:59.734 --> 02:55:01.074]  It's like the U.N.
[02:55:01.074 --> 02:55:03.435]  voted six years ago to say the sun doesn't affect climate.
[02:55:04.755 --> 02:55:10.617]  They literally, think of their arrogance, they passed a law saying you can't have it in equations.
[02:55:10.617 --> 02:55:12.638]  Because they hate it.
[02:55:12.638 --> 02:55:14.279]  Well, their take away everything is helpful.
[02:55:14.279 --> 02:55:20.601]  I mean, generations and generations ago, we weren't confined in houses where there was no air circulating.
[02:55:20.601 --> 02:55:21.541]  They're competing with it.
[02:55:21.541 --> 02:55:24.342]  They can't stand that beautiful yellow giant.
[02:55:24.342 --> 02:55:26.923]  We have artificial lighting now.
[02:55:26.923 --> 02:55:32.145]  We have homes that have more toxic air inside the home than outside.
[02:55:32.145 --> 02:55:33.586]  We're being put in an alien environment.
[02:55:33.846 --> 02:55:35.166]  So it is.
[02:55:35.166 --> 02:55:36.707]  It's an artificial environment.
[02:55:36.707 --> 02:55:38.468]  It's an artificial culture.
[02:55:38.468 --> 02:55:39.828]  Artificial food.
[02:55:39.828 --> 02:55:41.469]  Artificial water.
[02:55:41.469 --> 02:55:42.929]  Artificial air.
[02:55:42.929 --> 02:55:44.770]  Artificial milk.
[02:55:44.770 --> 02:55:46.930]  Artificial skin.
[02:55:46.930 --> 02:55:47.731]  Robotics.
[02:55:47.731 --> 02:55:48.971]  Transhumanism.
[02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:50.192]  Artificial DNA.
[02:55:50.192 --> 02:55:51.732]  Half the births aren't vaginal.
[02:55:51.732 --> 02:55:54.753]  Most of the kids are drinking garbage, fake milk.
[02:55:54.753 --> 02:55:56.234]  Let's talk to Frank in New York.
[02:55:56.234 --> 02:55:57.294]  You're on the air with Dr. Grip.
[02:55:57.294 --> 02:55:57.594]  Go ahead.
[02:55:57.594 --> 02:56:01.455]  I just want to say God bless you and your crew, Alex.
[02:56:01.455 --> 02:56:02.816]  You guys do a great job.
[02:56:02.816 --> 02:56:03.256]  Thank you, brother.
[02:56:04.580 --> 02:56:09.924]  Okay, um, before I go to Dr. Group, I just want to say, Alex, I've been calling your show for about three years now.
[02:56:09.924 --> 02:56:12.746]  Um, every time I call your show, I forget to plug in your products.
[02:56:12.746 --> 02:56:17.269]  So I just want to say that your products are actually very, very, very good.
[02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:17.889]  Thank you.
[02:56:17.889 --> 02:56:20.891]  Um, and the, on the Oxy-Powder, it's great.
[02:56:20.891 --> 02:56:22.612]  And Nathan Ironside is fantastic.
[02:56:22.612 --> 02:56:23.533]  Group's a big deal.
[02:56:23.533 --> 02:56:25.094]  He's one of the top developers in the country.
[02:56:25.094 --> 02:56:26.495]  His stuff's used in Hollywood.
[02:56:26.495 --> 02:56:30.557]  I mean, I didn't just go out and get, I mean, he was already a listener and a guest and stuff.
[02:56:30.557 --> 02:56:32.018]  So I thought, well, I'm getting the nutraceuticals.
[02:56:32.018 --> 02:56:32.819]  I'll get the best guy.
[02:56:32.819 --> 02:56:34.220]  I mean, that's what I do, but thank you.
[02:56:35.922 --> 02:56:39.204]  Um, also on the prostate, I've been using it for a couple of months now.
[02:56:39.204 --> 02:56:40.825]  Um, let me tell you something.
[02:56:40.825 --> 02:56:42.145]  I'm 46 years old.
[02:56:42.145 --> 02:56:44.006]  I don't have any prostate problems.
[02:56:44.006 --> 02:56:44.827]  Thank God.
[02:56:44.827 --> 02:56:50.450]  But I did use, like, I'm using that product just for health, you know, for your prostate, for health purposes.
[02:56:50.450 --> 02:56:51.270]  Let me tell you something.
[02:56:51.270 --> 02:56:53.672]  I don't want to, this is a family show, but let me tell you something.
[02:56:53.672 --> 02:56:54.132]  It works.
[02:56:55.066 --> 02:56:58.130]  Yeah, again, we don't make really any claims, okay?
[02:56:58.130 --> 02:56:59.412]  Just try the product.
[02:56:59.412 --> 02:57:00.454]  You're supporting the broadcast.
[02:57:00.454 --> 02:57:02.837]  It's got all the known herbs God gave us.
[02:57:02.837 --> 02:57:06.062]  And again, it doesn't just deal with that exactly.
[02:57:06.062 --> 02:57:10.307]  Again, it advertises the ultimate formula of known stuff that's good for your prostate, but it does a lot more.
[02:57:10.854 --> 02:57:11.734]  Yeah, it does do a lot.
[02:57:11.734 --> 02:57:13.075]  And it's helping your prostate, folks.
[02:57:13.075 --> 02:57:14.196]  That isn't the only gland.
[02:57:14.196 --> 02:57:15.116]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:15.116 --> 02:57:17.897]  A prostate in male is an endocrine gland.
[02:57:17.897 --> 02:57:32.064]  And believe it or not, usually, one of the things with the prostate is you really don't feel it until it's gotten to a point where it's, I'm not going to say too late, but usually if you're waking up in the middle of the night to go urinate, that's a sign that your prostate... If it's burning.
[02:57:32.064 --> 02:57:34.545]  Burning, burning urination.
[02:57:35.265 --> 02:57:42.812]  So, it is a serious issue that I think, you know, any male over 45... It's the number one cancer in males, right?
[02:57:42.812 --> 02:57:43.633]  Yeah, it is.
[02:57:43.633 --> 02:57:50.019]  And again, if you look at the way the prostate functions, it needs iodine.
[02:57:50.019 --> 02:57:55.824]  The prostate is heavily in iodine, just like the ovaries and the reproductive organs in male and female.
[02:57:55.824 --> 02:57:56.324]  That's why X2 is 20%.
[02:57:57.085 --> 02:57:58.026]  We're good to go.
[02:58:15.479 --> 02:58:21.901]  And then a few other phone callers like Bitter Clinger and Ryan, and then we're gonna have, uh, who is it?
[02:58:21.901 --> 02:58:25.661]  It's David Knight coming in with the latest on Loretta Lynch and so much more.
[02:58:25.661 --> 02:58:27.782]  Well, it's almost like I made it happen.
[02:58:27.782 --> 02:58:29.522]  The air conditioner's been having some problems.
[02:58:29.522 --> 02:58:31.363]  It was cool this morning, and I was sweating.
[02:58:31.363 --> 02:58:38.564]  I was so angry about the Lynch thing, and then now it's kind of hot in here, so I look like a, it's like an old Baptist church or something where they had air conditioning in here under these lights.
[02:58:38.564 --> 02:58:39.445]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:58:39.445 --> 02:58:40.385]  Coming to you from Texas.
[02:58:44.002 --> 02:58:47.988]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.303 --> 02:58:56.125]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:59:53.712 --> 03:00:02.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:09.866]  From the front lines of the Information War!
[03:00:09.866 --> 03:00:15.772]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:20.484 --> 03:00:25.166]  It's crazy.
[03:00:25.166 --> 03:00:26.267]  We are the front lines.
[03:00:26.267 --> 03:00:27.488]  I don't say that with a power trip.
[03:00:27.488 --> 03:00:30.489]  I say that with a lot of responsibility.
[03:00:30.489 --> 03:00:32.170]  And I just pray I can be up to the challenge.
[03:00:32.170 --> 03:00:34.231]  I know you do as well, Dr. Group.
[03:00:34.231 --> 03:00:36.932]  But they can't keep them in the dark for life.
[03:00:36.932 --> 03:00:39.193]  They can't hide them from the waiting world.
[03:00:39.193 --> 03:00:40.654]  No, they can't.
[03:00:40.654 --> 03:00:44.495]  You see, I'm not here to get you to believe like I believe.
[03:00:44.495 --> 03:00:45.356]  I'm just here to get you to...
[03:00:47.130 --> 03:00:51.973]  Get outside the globalist paradigm and see it all for yourself.
[03:00:51.973 --> 03:00:54.615]  One can't be told about the Matrix.
[03:00:54.615 --> 03:00:58.297]  One can only see it for themselves.
[03:00:58.297 --> 03:01:00.659]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[03:01:00.659 --> 03:01:02.820]  Nothing more.
[03:01:02.820 --> 03:01:06.542]  Let's go to Better Clinger in Florida.
[03:01:06.542 --> 03:01:09.224]  Of course, that's so they know their enemy is the Better Clingers.
[03:01:09.224 --> 03:01:11.246]  They've taken our jobs, they've bankrupted everything.
[03:01:11.246 --> 03:01:14.788]  Now they want our guns and our Christianity so we can learn to worship them.
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:18.261]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Bitter Clinger.
[03:01:18.261 --> 03:01:19.741]  What happened?
[03:01:19.741 --> 03:01:19.941]  Hey guys.
[03:01:19.941 --> 03:01:21.461]  Go ahead, Bitter Clinger.
[03:01:21.461 --> 03:01:25.462]  I wanted to get your opinion on a person I recently discovered.
[03:01:25.462 --> 03:01:31.164]  He was a former radio announcer for NBC out of Chicago by the name of Wally Butterworth.
[03:01:31.164 --> 03:01:33.104]  Does that name ring a bell to you?
[03:01:33.104 --> 03:01:35.865]  No, it doesn't.
[03:01:35.865 --> 03:01:38.186]  Well, it was back in the early 60s.
[03:01:38.186 --> 03:01:39.746]  He was talking about that on the radio.
[03:01:40.405 --> 03:01:44.048]  The Federal Reserve, CFR, New World Order, John Birch Society.
[03:01:56.576 --> 03:02:00.961]  I mean it was like really bad when I first I was like it'd be like just intimidate you.
[03:02:00.961 --> 03:02:01.241]  Oh yeah.
[03:02:01.241 --> 03:02:01.942]  It's pretty scary.
[03:02:01.942 --> 03:02:03.664]  Same in the health field too.
[03:02:03.664 --> 03:02:08.530]  A lot of the same type of information has been put out since the 1920s 1930s.
[03:02:08.530 --> 03:02:09.991]  Those guys really took a beating.
[03:02:09.991 --> 03:02:11.613]  They were the ones that were killed.
[03:02:11.613 --> 03:02:13.275]  Something happened though when Clinton left office.
[03:02:13.275 --> 03:02:14.797]  I got to give this to Bush.
[03:02:14.797 --> 03:02:17.300]  That paramilitary harassment and stuff just stopped.
[03:02:18.993 --> 03:02:19.333]  I don't know.
[03:02:19.333 --> 03:02:20.134]  I might think about moving.
[03:02:20.134 --> 03:02:20.234]  No.
[03:02:20.234 --> 03:02:22.457]  I don't know what I'm gonna do at that point in time.
[03:02:37.219 --> 03:02:39.341]  There could be martial law in Obama's days in office?
[03:02:39.341 --> 03:02:40.822]  Yeah, they won't call it that though.
[03:02:40.822 --> 03:02:42.304]  I mean, civil emergency, I don't know.
[03:02:42.304 --> 03:02:44.545]  I've never seen such gearing up.
[03:02:44.545 --> 03:02:46.847]  I hope the gearing up is just contractors looting.
[03:02:46.847 --> 03:02:50.851]  I'm not saying that's good, but I hope it's just some looting going on.
[03:02:50.851 --> 03:02:55.055]  I hope it's just the normal scams, but it's so much more serious.
[03:02:55.055 --> 03:02:56.696]  It's on so many levels right now.
[03:02:56.696 --> 03:02:57.997]  They're just escalating stuff.
[03:02:57.997 --> 03:02:59.679]  I mean, the borders are open.
[03:02:59.679 --> 03:03:01.741]  I mean, it's just like escalation everywhere.
[03:03:02.506 --> 03:03:03.486]  Yeah, so I don't know.
[03:03:03.486 --> 03:03:06.387]  I mean, at this point, I'm just like, hitting my knees every night.
[03:03:06.387 --> 03:03:15.270]  I mean, after reading all of this stuff and then looking back at, like, RECS 84, the Readiness Act of 1984, all this stuff has been planned.
[03:03:15.270 --> 03:03:17.091]  And now you see it being implemented.
[03:03:17.091 --> 03:03:18.411]  Now you see it all around.
[03:03:18.411 --> 03:03:22.193]  You're wondering, why is all this happening right before the election?
[03:03:22.193 --> 03:03:29.115]  Are we going to have martial law instituted and Obama stays in office and, you know, you
[03:03:29.295 --> 03:03:31.956]  We can be so productive, they're holding everything back.
[03:03:31.956 --> 03:03:33.976]  I appreciate your call Better Clanger.
[03:03:33.976 --> 03:03:37.157]  Let's go to Ryan in Montana.
[03:03:37.157 --> 03:03:37.477]  Go ahead.
[03:03:37.477 --> 03:03:40.418]  How are you guys doing today?
[03:03:40.418 --> 03:03:42.299]  Good brother, go ahead.
[03:03:42.299 --> 03:03:42.839]  Good.
[03:03:42.839 --> 03:03:44.799]  Hey, I had one question.
[03:03:44.799 --> 03:03:51.701]  For a person wanting to do an at-home detox or an at-home cleanse, what are some things that at home the majority of people would have?
[03:03:51.701 --> 03:03:54.702]  Or what would you recommend for a person
[03:03:55.882 --> 03:03:57.444]  What, like drink a ton of water?
[03:03:57.444 --> 03:03:58.084]  Sweat a lot?
[03:03:58.084 --> 03:03:58.565]  Go outside?
[03:03:58.565 --> 03:04:00.046]  I mean, what's the most basic detox?
[03:04:00.046 --> 03:04:01.788]  Yeah, that's... Steam rooms?
[03:04:01.788 --> 03:04:02.749]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:02.749 --> 03:04:04.711]  I put a steam room in my shower.
[03:04:04.711 --> 03:04:05.252]  It was like 600 bucks.
[03:04:06.715 --> 03:04:08.496]  Not even if they're expensive, that's really good for you.
[03:04:08.496 --> 03:04:13.760]  Yeah, actually you can even get ozone steam saunas for fairly inexpensive online.
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:18.603]  I would recommend reading about those, but the basic thing that you can do, your body's made of water.
[03:04:18.603 --> 03:04:29.410]  I mean, every living substance is at least 80% water, so just drinking water and not eating good organic foods is one of the best basic ways that you can detoxify yourself.
[03:04:30.911 --> 03:04:32.392]  You can do coffee enemas.
[03:04:32.392 --> 03:04:34.273]  You can do apple cider vinegar in water.
[03:04:34.273 --> 03:04:35.714]  You can do baking soda.
[03:04:35.714 --> 03:04:38.396]  You know, there's different remedies out there.
[03:04:38.396 --> 03:04:39.577]  Charcoal is good.
[03:04:39.577 --> 03:04:41.598]  Activated charcoal is amazing.
[03:04:41.598 --> 03:04:42.919]  Bentonite clays.
[03:04:42.919 --> 03:04:44.180]  Those are different types of detox.
[03:04:44.180 --> 03:04:47.762]  I mean, the biggest thing for me is the X2 20% off.
[03:04:47.762 --> 03:04:49.203]  But I mean, it just does everything.
[03:04:49.543 --> 03:04:51.025]  And some people have that eye on deficiency.
[03:04:51.025 --> 03:04:52.266]  We're out of time.
[03:04:52.266 --> 03:04:55.049]  David Knight's coming up with all the latest news and analysis.
[03:04:55.049 --> 03:04:56.191]  Natalie News Tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:04:56.191 --> 03:04:58.413]  We'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:58.413 --> 03:04:59.675]  Central as well.
[03:04:59.675 --> 03:05:00.636]  Have a great Fourth coming up.
[03:05:01.315 --> 03:05:10.879]  The article titled, Revolution, Flash Mobs and Brain Chips, A Grim Vision of the Future, is based on a 30-year future cast completed by the British Ministry of Defense team back in 2007.
[03:05:10.879 --> 03:05:18.962]  The goal of the report was to create a future strategic context of obstacles and events and to create an analysis of key risks and shocks that would face the British military.
[03:05:18.962 --> 03:05:26.865]  The fall of the mainstream media and the rise of the internet-enabled citizen journalists are predicted in the report, as well as neutron bombs and brain chip mobilized flash mobs.
[03:05:27.065 --> 03:05:36.253]  The report even predicted the politically correct invasion of trickily puffed social justice warriors whose ranks would be filled by the socialist spewing spoiled children of a once prosperous middle class.
[03:05:36.253 --> 03:05:47.602]  Finally, compact, increasingly cramped cities and booming third world populations would lead to increased migration, massive food riots, and spread of the radical political Islamic concept of Ummah, which is the global Islamic community.
[03:05:47.822 --> 03:05:52.087]  Food riots are now cropping up across the world in places like Venezuela and Greece.
[03:05:52.087 --> 03:05:54.170]  Are you prepared for widespread food riots?
[03:05:54.170 --> 03:05:58.475]  Go to InfoWars.com and stock up on InfoWars Select storable foods right now.
[03:05:58.475 --> 03:06:00.017]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:00.017 --> 03:06:01.039]  Rob Dew reporting.
[03:06:01.039 --> 03:06:01.579]  Not a group.
[03:06:01.579 --> 03:06:03.001]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:06:03.001 --> 03:06:04.323]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:06:04.323 --> 03:06:05.204]  Why is this so good?
[03:06:05.504 --> 03:06:10.787]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:06:10.787 --> 03:06:24.334]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:06:24.334 --> 03:06:30.698]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:06:30.698 --> 03:06:31.999]  These are all parasites.
[03:06:31.999 --> 03:06:33.099]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[03:06:33.099 --> 03:06:34.140]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:38.944]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:06:38.944 --> 03:06:42.106]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:42.106 --> 03:06:45.289]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:06:45.289 --> 03:06:46.330]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:06:46.330 --> 03:06:48.272]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:48.272 --> 03:06:49.292]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:06:49.292 --> 03:06:51.975]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:06:51.975 --> 03:06:53.916]  And you support the broadcast.
[03:06:53.916 --> 03:06:55.257]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:55.257 --> 03:06:57.499]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:06:57.499 --> 03:06:59.461]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:07:00.928 --> 03:07:09.095]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:07:09.095 --> 03:07:09.916]  Here's why.
[03:07:09.916 --> 03:07:14.059]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:07:14.059 --> 03:07:14.980]  So please listen.
[03:07:14.980 --> 03:07:18.703]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:07:18.703 --> 03:07:25.068]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[03:07:25.068 --> 03:07:29.172]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[03:07:29.412 --> 03:07:32.355]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:07:32.355 --> 03:07:34.696]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:07:34.696 --> 03:07:39.540]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators.
[03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:46.286]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[03:07:46.286 --> 03:07:48.027]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:07:48.027 --> 03:07:49.729]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:07:49.729 --> 03:07:51.450]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:07:51.450 --> 03:07:55.333]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:07:55.333 --> 03:07:56.895]  Go to gridwars.com.
[03:07:56.895 --> 03:07:58.256]  That's gridwars.com.
[03:08:08.865 --> 03:08:12.861]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:08:12.861 --> 03:08:14.587]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:19.933 --> 03:08:21.154]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:21.154 --> 03:08:22.354]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:22.354 --> 03:08:24.815]  We're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour with Wayne Madsen.
[03:08:24.815 --> 03:08:29.056]  He's going to break down the in-depth article that he had up at InfoWars.com yesterday.
[03:08:29.056 --> 03:08:32.938]  The EU, a powerhouse pedophile hierarchy.
[03:08:32.938 --> 03:08:36.599]  It's very important for you understand where this is all leading.
[03:08:36.599 --> 03:08:42.081]  As we see our military and our president totally preoccupied with
[03:08:43.001 --> 03:08:44.302]  A tranny army.
[03:08:44.302 --> 03:08:46.484]  You have to understand where this is going next.
[03:08:46.484 --> 03:09:01.416]  And he lays it out in detail, especially in Britain, how the people at the upper echelons of power, and of course we've talked about the Jimmy Seville situation, how multiple times there were investigations at Scotland Yard that were shut down by the people at the top.
[03:09:01.416 --> 03:09:04.798]  The people at the mid-level and the bottom know what's going on.
[03:09:04.798 --> 03:09:10.263]  They try to bring this to justice, but then we have the compartmentalization at the top that shuts this down.
[03:09:11.050 --> 03:09:15.692]  And of course, there's been many, many others that he's going to break that down and talk to us about what's going on with that.
[03:09:15.692 --> 03:09:25.616]  But of course, I want to stick on this Loretta Lynch issue as well and look at what has happened with the stock market after Brexit.
[03:09:25.616 --> 03:09:27.597]  There was a headline came out two days ago.
[03:09:28.317 --> 03:09:30.738]  New York Stock Exchange trader says Brexit?
[03:09:30.738 --> 03:09:31.639]  What Brexit?
[03:09:31.639 --> 03:09:33.680]  Remember it was the end of the world last Friday.
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:45.346]  It was just one week ago that Britain voted to get out of the European Union and everybody was saying this is the end of the world, the stock market is never going to recover and we said at the time this is simply a bump in the road.
[03:09:45.346 --> 03:09:52.290]  This is an opportunity for the elites to manipulate the market for their profits and understand that is their short-term goal.
[03:09:53.010 --> 03:09:57.794]  Their long-term goal is to create fear and panic to manipulate public opinion.
[03:09:57.794 --> 03:10:01.436]  And of course, manipulating the markets is one way that they do that.
[03:10:01.436 --> 03:10:06.400]  As we point out, there was a big difference between the real economy and the markets.
[03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:18.228]  The markets have been repeatedly rigged by these same bankers who are in such opposition to anything that would stop their European consolidation of power.
[03:10:18.228 --> 03:10:19.930]  That's their project, the EU project.
[03:10:20.748 --> 03:10:24.570]  They're the ones who want this situation, and they will do anything they can.
[03:10:24.570 --> 03:10:36.295]  Of course, we've had HSBC, the company that has been caught multiple times by the Obama administration, given a hand slap when they were doing money laundering for drug cartels, for terrorist organizations.
[03:10:36.935 --> 03:10:39.357]  Caught multiple times doing it, never went to jail.
[03:10:39.357 --> 03:10:49.045]  Remember, very famously, Eric Holder's Justice Department essentially said, well, it wouldn't serve our interest to revoke their charter or to send any of their officers to jail.
[03:10:49.045 --> 03:10:51.227]  So he gave them a very, very small fine.
[03:10:51.227 --> 03:10:53.629]  That was a lot of money to you and I, okay?
[03:10:53.629 --> 03:10:58.313]  But it was only a couple of days profits from these money laundering things.
[03:10:58.313 --> 03:11:01.956]  So, you know, if you're going to go in and rob a bank, you know, what would you say if the bank robbers
[03:11:02.797 --> 03:11:10.458]  Where they get a million dollars and they get caught and the district attorney says to them, well, I'm going to fine you $10,000 and you can go on your way.
[03:11:12.108 --> 03:11:16.430]  And it's like, wait a minute, they got millions of dollars out of just that one bank robbery and they got a $10,000 fine?
[03:11:16.430 --> 03:11:18.611]  It's like, hey, that's a lot of money.
[03:11:18.611 --> 03:11:20.472]  $10,000 is a lot of money, he tells you.
[03:11:20.472 --> 03:11:22.933]  That's essentially what happened to HSBC.
[03:11:22.933 --> 03:11:32.977]  El Chapo, that everybody freaked out about when he got out of jail, he had his own, the Sinaloa cartel had their own private window where they could do money laundering.
[03:11:32.977 --> 03:11:34.378]  So we had this going on and on.
[03:11:34.378 --> 03:11:38.780]  We've had whistleblowers from HSBC talking about this and it's not just that.
[03:11:38.780 --> 03:11:40.621]  The LIBOR exchange was even bigger.
[03:11:41.351 --> 03:11:51.981]  The London Interbank Exchange Rate, where they can set the interest rates that your mortgages, your variable rate mortgages are based on, and the fixed rate mortgages for that matter, are based on the LIBOR exchange.
[03:11:51.981 --> 03:11:56.545]  These people are making billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions off of fraud.
[03:11:56.545 --> 03:11:58.127]  They've manipulated every market.
[03:11:58.127 --> 03:12:02.951]  Currency markets, commodity markets, stock and bond markets, the interest rate markets.
[03:12:03.832 --> 03:12:19.259]  They launder money, and then we have HSBC, one of the point institutions in this corrupt gang, this corrupt cartel, saying that they're going to immediately pull 1,000 jobs out of London, and eventually they will take 70,000 jobs out because of Brexit.
[03:12:19.719 --> 03:12:24.282]  No, we need to be able to do business and we need to be a European country, look, company.
[03:12:24.282 --> 03:12:25.563]  They don't need to pull people out.
[03:12:25.563 --> 03:12:28.224]  They have offices everywhere.
[03:12:28.224 --> 03:12:29.305]  All throughout Europe.
[03:12:29.305 --> 03:12:30.186]  Throughout London.
[03:12:30.186 --> 03:12:31.086]  In the United States.
[03:12:31.086 --> 03:12:32.327]  In other countries.
[03:12:32.327 --> 03:12:35.669]  Even with the Sinaloa drug cartel they have offices.
[03:12:35.669 --> 03:12:41.233]  Okay, so they don't need to pull anybody out of London in order to be able to do business in Europe.
[03:12:41.773 --> 03:12:45.556]  It is simply a way to try to manufacture pain.
[03:12:45.556 --> 03:12:47.737]  And so we look at this, and here's what they say in the first paragraph.
[03:12:47.737 --> 03:12:58.024]  If you fall asleep Thursday night, and you didn't wake up until two days ago, which is Wednesday when this was written, you would assume that the UK voters had elected to stay in the EU.
[03:12:58.024 --> 03:13:04.628]  And I say, as we look at this, and this was two days ago, it was only two to three percent below last Thursday's close.
[03:13:04.628 --> 03:13:05.289]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:13:05.289 --> 03:13:09.091]  Now it's come back, and we see this article from The Telegraph, the FTSE 100.
[03:13:10.543 --> 03:13:13.084]  That's the London Stock Exchange Index.
[03:13:13.084 --> 03:13:16.246]  Enjoys the best week since 2011.
[03:13:16.246 --> 03:13:20.167]  Bond yields hit record lows on post-Brexit stimulus hopes.
[03:13:20.167 --> 03:13:22.388]  I say the pound edges higher.
[03:13:22.388 --> 03:13:27.570]  The S&P 500 is now on track for its best week since October.
[03:13:27.570 --> 03:13:30.812]  But what is happening with the credit ratings?
[03:13:30.812 --> 03:13:35.934]  We see now that the European Union has had its credit rating cut by S&P.
[03:13:35.934 --> 03:13:37.175]  Understand Standard & Poor's
[03:13:38.211 --> 03:13:47.518]  Or the people that were at the heart, at the heart of the collateralized mortgage fraud that hit us all in 2008.
[03:13:47.518 --> 03:13:49.259]  They were at the very heart of this.
[03:13:49.259 --> 03:13:58.465]  Because there were people, and watch the movie, the big short, there were people that were screaming at the top of their lungs, trying to get the government to do something about this, trying to get Standard & Poor's to do something about it.
[03:13:58.465 --> 03:14:01.167]  They knew, the government knew, they didn't do anything about it.
[03:14:01.167 --> 03:14:02.268]  Why?
[03:14:02.268 --> 03:14:03.049]  Why?
[03:14:03.049 --> 03:14:05.911]  Well, you know, that question has been asked, but just look at what they did.
[03:14:06.940 --> 03:14:08.441]  This last week, okay?
[03:14:08.441 --> 03:14:15.545]  They immediately on Monday, after they had the Brexit vote, immediately on Monday, they cut the UK, the entire country, down by two notches.
[03:14:15.545 --> 03:14:19.868]  They went from triple A to double A. Remember there's like a triple A and then there's a double A plus.
[03:14:19.868 --> 03:14:24.591]  They skipped the double A plus and they went all the way to just two A's.
[03:14:24.591 --> 03:14:26.512]  So they took them down two notches.
[03:14:26.512 --> 03:14:27.193]  Immediately.
[03:14:27.893 --> 03:14:49.062]  Now, there was no basis for that, and there's no basis even for them to cut the European Union's credit rating by one level, except to create pain, to make people concerned about what's going to happen, and to try to walk back this decision that was made democratically in Britain.
[03:14:49.062 --> 03:14:51.723]  And I want to remind you, going back into August of 2011, Bloomberg said,
[03:14:53.745 --> 03:15:01.020]  That the subprime mortgage bonds get double AAA ratings while the S&P denied that to the United States government.
[03:15:02.136 --> 03:15:05.237]  Okay, this is the level of fraud that we're seeing here.
[03:15:05.237 --> 03:15:08.899]  They said they're giving a higher rating to securities that are backed, even in 2011.
[03:15:08.899 --> 03:15:14.041]  This is three years after it all hit the fan, after everything finally blew up.
[03:15:14.041 --> 03:15:24.785]  And again, as I point out, you watch the movie, the big short, you'll see how for years they had people trying to expose this massive fraud of these subprime home loans.
[03:15:24.785 --> 03:15:30.628]  And here we are, three years after it all blew up in everybody's faces, and Standard & Poor's was still giving higher ratings
[03:15:31.388 --> 03:15:36.591]  To the subprime home loans than they were to the United States government.
[03:15:36.591 --> 03:15:44.214]  They said S&P is poised to provide AAA grades to 59% of Springleaf Mortgage Loan Trust 2011.
[03:15:44.214 --> 03:15:46.375]  Again, this is in 2011, five years ago.
[03:15:46.375 --> 03:15:57.261]  They said this is a set of bonds that is tied to a half billion dollars that is being lent to homeowners with below average credit scores and no equity in their properties.
[03:15:58.021 --> 03:16:16.128]  S&P has awarded AAA status to more than $36 billion worth of securities in the United States this year, that was in 2011, that were created by bankers who continue to gather thousands of loans, bundle them into bonds of varying risk, and pay rating firms a fee to assign credit rankings.
[03:16:16.128 --> 03:16:18.689]  Ah, hear that last thing I said there?
[03:16:18.689 --> 03:16:23.471]  They pay S&P a fee to assign credit ratings.
[03:16:24.508 --> 03:16:34.276]  So, they're paying the people who are supposedly doing their oversight, and that's one of the key findings that you'll understand if you watch the movie or read the book, The Big Short.
[03:16:34.276 --> 03:16:45.746]  And then, two years later, it's still going on, and Forbes is saying, um, we're getting promised that the Attorney General's office here in the United States is going to expose the fraud of the S&P here.
[03:16:45.746 --> 03:16:45.926]  Look.
[03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:48.141]  It's all a fraud.
[03:16:48.141 --> 03:16:48.762]  It's all a fraud.
[03:16:48.762 --> 03:16:53.306]  These financial markets, the way that they're manipulating people, is just shameless.
[03:16:53.306 --> 03:17:03.677]  It's what's happening as we see Loretta Lynch openly meeting with Bill Clinton, who is being investigated for high crimes, not even misdemeanors, folks.
[03:17:03.677 --> 03:17:05.739]  Okay, this is impeachment-level stuff.
[03:17:05.739 --> 03:17:09.162]  And the person that ought to be impeached is Loretta Lynch.
[03:17:10.179 --> 03:17:13.385]  You understand, she is the one who needs to be impeached.
[03:17:13.385 --> 03:17:16.891]  Think about the fact, we reported, I guess it was two weeks ago.
[03:17:17.881 --> 03:17:22.644]  They've been 200 days since Hillary Clinton had had a press conference.
[03:17:22.644 --> 03:17:23.405]  200 days!
[03:17:23.405 --> 03:17:27.568]  Now it's been about 210 or 214 days, okay, since that's happened.
[03:17:27.568 --> 03:17:29.529]  She doesn't do press conferences.
[03:17:29.529 --> 03:17:31.571]  She does presentations.
[03:17:31.571 --> 03:17:33.732]  And the press backs her up on this.
[03:17:33.732 --> 03:17:37.755]  Now what we had today was the Clinton machine doing a presentation.
[03:17:37.755 --> 03:17:42.779]  If you pull that article back up there and look at that, that guy that's there, okay, that sycophant,
[03:17:43.499 --> 03:17:46.320]  From the Washington Post, I believe is where he's from.
[03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:49.201]  Nobody is talking about who he is for the most part.
[03:17:49.201 --> 03:17:57.523]  He should be ashamed of himself for the softball questions, for the psychological manipulation that he did to people, for the double think that he gave them, okay?
[03:17:57.523 --> 03:18:04.384]  It is not simply, he comes in and this is done as if it was some kind of a press conference.
[03:18:04.384 --> 03:18:05.705]  If she'd had a real press conference,
[03:18:06.730 --> 03:18:18.659]  I believe even the Washington Press Corps, who basically covered for them, who did not report the fact that the FBI said, don't take pictures, don't take photos, don't talk about the fact that she and Bill Clinton are meeting together privately in a plane.
[03:18:18.659 --> 03:18:26.705]  There are a lot of people that are in the Washington Press Corps, and when the cameras are on them, they would have cut her to shreds in a real press conference.
[03:18:26.705 --> 03:18:33.149]  So what they did was they go to this little Aspen conference, and they have this guy ask her softball questions.
[03:18:33.149 --> 03:18:35.151]  And think about the double think behind this, okay?
[03:18:35.811 --> 03:18:40.476]  First of all, he asks her a question, and he says, what were you thinking?
[03:18:40.476 --> 03:18:42.859]  Well, she just basically says, there's nothing to see here.
[03:18:42.859 --> 03:18:45.442]  We're just close and old friends.
[03:18:45.442 --> 03:18:49.987]  We got together, we talked about our grandchildren and about his golf game and other things like that, okay?
[03:18:50.874 --> 03:18:52.595]  And then she goes on for a very long time.
[03:18:52.595 --> 03:19:00.280]  Then he comes back and he goes, but why didn't you just tell the former president of the United States to just get off of your plane?
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:02.842]  Now you understand the double think that's going on here.
[03:19:02.842 --> 03:19:11.948]  First they want to throw this idea out there that, and this is her alibi, that they're just meeting and it's just all about personal, catching up on personal issues.
[03:19:13.068 --> 03:19:16.951]  Then they come back and say, but he's the former president of the United States.
[03:19:16.951 --> 03:19:18.752]  I mean, he wouldn't really throw him out.
[03:19:18.752 --> 03:19:28.578]  That's the message that is designed for the people who cannot bring themselves to distance away from the Clintons no matter the level of corruption.
[03:19:28.578 --> 03:19:33.501]  They look at that and go, hell yeah, if Bill Clinton was here, absolutely I would meet with him.
[03:19:33.501 --> 03:19:35.362]  I wouldn't tell Bill Clinton to go away.
[03:19:35.362 --> 03:19:40.506]  That's the message to those camp followers who cannot get this corruption
[03:19:41.306 --> 03:19:43.527]  Under their, into their consciousness.
[03:19:43.527 --> 03:19:51.409]  And understand too, that this is happening as we learned from the Daily Caller via Drudge, that they are going to meet with her this weekend.
[03:19:51.409 --> 03:19:54.990]  You think they were talking about what the FBI has on her?
[03:19:54.990 --> 03:19:56.411]  That's what she knows.
[03:19:56.411 --> 03:19:58.251]  That's why she won't recuse herself.
[03:19:58.251 --> 03:20:01.732]  Not only that, but she's going to be able to overrule the FBI.
[03:20:01.732 --> 03:20:02.412]  Stay with us.

[03:24:05.780 --> 03:24:13.506]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:13.506 --> 03:24:18.750]  I want to get back to what we know now about Loretta Lynch and some new developments that have come out.
[03:24:18.750 --> 03:24:22.754]  Before I do, real quickly, we have a new set of specials.
[03:24:22.754 --> 03:24:25.656]  Several big specials for the 4th of July weekend.
[03:24:25.656 --> 03:24:27.798]  Mega specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:27.798 --> 03:24:28.178]  Here they are.
[03:24:28.178 --> 03:24:30.580]  20% off Survival Shield X2.
[03:24:30.580 --> 03:24:30.880]  20 to 40%
[03:24:33.582 --> 03:24:35.244]  Off InfoWars Select Storable Food.
[03:24:35.244 --> 03:24:38.628]  That is a huge saving off of storable foods.
[03:24:38.628 --> 03:24:47.278]  And remember, our government is doing wargaming, and the program they called it was the Food Chain Reaction.
[03:24:47.278 --> 03:24:48.239]  Food Chain.
[03:24:48.239 --> 03:24:48.999]  Chain Reaction.
[03:24:49.660 --> 03:25:01.583]  What happens when they do certain inputs and stimuli as they have been doing, like bringing in massive numbers of migrants, or if there was some kind of a power disruption, something that disrupted our infrastructure?
[03:25:01.583 --> 03:25:07.764]  They gamed it out and they said, well, we could see about 400% increases in food prices, massive starvation.
[03:25:07.764 --> 03:25:10.024]  It's one of the reasons we brought this sale back.
[03:25:10.024 --> 03:25:12.185]  So 20 to 40% off InfoWars like storable food.
[03:25:13.546 --> 03:25:18.691]  20% off Alexa Pure water filters, 20% off Alexa Pure air filters.
[03:25:18.691 --> 03:25:22.194]  You'll find all those specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:22.194 --> 03:25:25.917]  We're going to have Wayne Madsen joining us in the next segment.
[03:25:25.917 --> 03:25:36.487]  For a half hour we're going to be talking about the EU and the powerful pedophile hierarchy that Wayne has exposed in an article yesterday that's on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:37.648 --> 03:25:41.769]  By the time we've got left in this segment, I want to go back to what's going on with Loretta Lynch, okay?
[03:25:41.769 --> 03:25:47.270]  And I think it's very key that you understand the sequence of events as they happened yesterday.
[03:25:47.270 --> 03:25:54.732]  First, we had Lynch and Clinton, and remember that this is not just an investigation of Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:54.732 --> 03:25:57.172]  It also concerns the Clinton Foundation.
[03:25:57.172 --> 03:26:00.453]  Bill Clinton is also a subject of this investigation.
[03:26:01.325 --> 03:26:09.971]  It would have been bad enough if she had met with the spouse of somebody who was being investigated, but she met with someone who himself is being investigated.
[03:26:09.971 --> 03:26:17.836]  So they meet, and they're told by the FBI, all the press there, are told that they're not supposed to take pictures of it.
[03:26:17.836 --> 03:26:19.297]  And yet we had a local reporter.
[03:26:20.086 --> 03:26:36.143]  Thank goodness we had a local reporter who refused to abide by the censorship, who refused to go along with the Washington establishment and cover for them as we see from the big news sources, the big mainstream news sources who do this so they can get access to these people.
[03:26:36.143 --> 03:26:37.985]  That's their stock and trade is access.
[03:26:38.959 --> 03:26:41.541]  And for that access, they will cover for them.
[03:26:41.541 --> 03:26:42.822]  They will lie for them.
[03:26:42.822 --> 03:26:51.207]  As I was on my way to work this morning, at the top of the hour, I heard CBS News opining, and it really was a hit piece.
[03:26:51.207 --> 03:26:52.268]  This is supposed to be a news piece.
[03:26:52.268 --> 03:26:55.890]  They're talking to Mitch McConnell about Donald Trump's negatives.
[03:26:55.890 --> 03:26:58.312]  Mitch McConnell says, well, he's doing better.
[03:26:58.312 --> 03:27:04.216]  He's doing some teleprompter speeches that are prepared as opposed to just honestly speaking off the cuff.
[03:27:04.216 --> 03:27:06.097]  We like that, but he's not doing that enough.
[03:27:06.097 --> 03:27:08.659]  Then they immediately go to a spokesperson about Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:09.059 --> 03:27:12.280]  And they said, well, she needs to play to her strengths.
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:18.223]  The fact that she is so intelligent, such a great communicator, that she has all this experience as a Secretary of State.
[03:27:18.223 --> 03:27:20.004]  And I'm like, you're kidding me!
[03:27:20.004 --> 03:27:20.864]  You're kidding me!
[03:27:20.864 --> 03:27:23.285]  Nothing about the crime and the corruption?
[03:27:23.285 --> 03:27:25.366]  Nothing about Benghazi?
[03:27:25.366 --> 03:27:32.629]  And the way they juxtapose these two things was set up to manipulate public opinion.
[03:27:32.629 --> 03:27:37.311]  But we got this reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, Christopher Sine of ABC15.
[03:27:38.872 --> 03:27:51.479]  And as he says in his story, he says the former president steps into her plane, they then speak for 30 minutes privately, the FBI there on the tarmac instructing everybody around, no photos, no pictures, no cell phones.
[03:27:51.479 --> 03:27:56.142]  Are they going to cover for her for the rest of the crimes that she's committed as well?
[03:27:56.142 --> 03:27:57.863]  The rest of the crimes that Hillary's committed?
[03:27:57.863 --> 03:28:00.024]  Cover for Loretta Lynch?
[03:28:00.024 --> 03:28:01.345]  And they point out in this article,
[03:28:02.392 --> 03:28:05.435]  Here, this is hot air, this is the one that's up on Drudge.
[03:28:05.435 --> 03:28:09.820]  They say, well, first of all, it isn't the FBI's job to tell journalists what they can shoot and what they can report, right?
[03:28:09.820 --> 03:28:15.126]  That's one of the reasons why they typically don't have local reporters, why it's so difficult for us to get there.
[03:28:15.126 --> 03:28:21.332]  If they were to tell me, or A, the rest of the staff here at InfoWars, don't take pictures of them, they're meeting privately.
[03:28:22.512 --> 03:28:23.693]  We wouldn't stop.
[03:28:23.693 --> 03:28:26.355]  You know, they'd have to arrest us in order to get us to do that.
[03:28:26.355 --> 03:28:30.458]  Fortunately, we had a local reporter who was honest, who did the same thing as well.
[03:28:30.458 --> 03:28:36.142]  And they're saying if there's nothing wrong with the meeting, then why would the FBI tell people not to take a picture of it, okay?
[03:28:36.142 --> 03:28:37.783]  So, that's really the issue.
[03:28:37.783 --> 03:28:39.905]  And then I want to break down the chronology of what's going on.
[03:28:39.905 --> 03:28:43.868]  Seven hours ago, we had a report from Time Magazine, and here's the headline.
[03:28:43.868 --> 03:28:48.251]  Loretta Lynch won't overrule the FBI on Hillary Clinton email probe.
[03:28:48.251 --> 03:28:49.952]  That was seven hours ago from time.com.
[03:28:51.073 --> 03:28:55.219]  Now, I want you to understand, Loretta Lynch has already overruled.
[03:28:55.219 --> 03:29:02.289]  She likes to talk about, we've got these career investigators and prosecutors are going to present their information and I'm not, I'm going to go with their recommendation because they're the professionals.
[03:29:03.123 --> 03:29:08.368]  Well, she didn't go with a recommendation of the FBI Director on watchlist gun control, did she?
[03:29:08.368 --> 03:29:11.551]  He said, this is a list of people that we're investigating.
[03:29:11.551 --> 03:29:13.213]  We do not want to tip our hand.
[03:29:13.213 --> 03:29:15.435]  We want to finish our investigation.
[03:29:15.435 --> 03:29:21.080]  If you block them from buying guns, if they attempt to buy a gun, that will shut down our investigation.
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:22.742]  And basically she said, you know what?
[03:29:22.742 --> 03:29:23.283]  I don't care.
[03:29:23.863 --> 03:29:26.445]  I don't care about an investigation of real terrorists.
[03:29:26.445 --> 03:29:28.286]  I want gun control for everybody.
[03:29:28.286 --> 03:29:33.689]  Then two hours ago, we had the New York Times saying, well, she says she'll accept recommendations from the FBI.
[03:29:33.689 --> 03:29:37.092]  Then the honest story comes out at Infowars.com.
[03:29:37.092 --> 03:29:41.034]  Lynch reserves the right to overrule the FBI in a Clinton probe.
[03:29:41.034 --> 03:29:46.798]  This is an honest assessment, quoting senior Justice Department officials saying, yeah.
[03:29:46.798 --> 03:29:50.720]  And the other part about it is, and this is what it was about, she was passing the information to Bill Clinton.
[03:29:50.720 --> 03:29:51.441]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.982 --> 03:29:53.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.586 --> 03:29:57.196]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.400 --> 03:30:03.421]  Article up by Associated Press.
[03:30:03.421 --> 03:30:06.943]  Pentagon ends ban on transgender troops in the military.
[03:30:06.943 --> 03:30:07.323]  Why?
[03:30:07.323 --> 03:30:09.804]  Because we're a f***ing social experiment now.
[03:30:09.804 --> 03:30:12.166]  We're not the fighting force we should be.
[03:30:12.166 --> 03:30:16.368]  Instead, we are a social experiment.
[03:30:16.368 --> 03:30:17.068]  Negative.
[03:30:17.068 --> 03:30:21.050]  We are men and women committed to fighting for our country.
[03:30:21.050 --> 03:30:26.493]  We don't worry about whether someone wants to cut off their genitalia, and we sure as f*** aren't paying for it.
[03:30:26.493 --> 03:30:27.914]  That's a personal choice.
[03:30:28.234 --> 03:30:31.539]  Transgender people will be allowed to serve openly in the U.S.
[03:30:31.539 --> 03:30:34.062]  military the Pentagon announced Thursday.
[03:30:34.062 --> 03:30:36.806]  First we had the guys walking around in red high heels.
[03:30:36.806 --> 03:30:43.034]  Then we allow women who've never been in combat to lead and train soldiers in combat situations.
[03:30:43.034 --> 03:30:44.877]  And now you want to bring in this bulls**t.
[03:30:45.317 --> 03:30:57.185]  Under this new policy by October 1st, transgender troops already serving should be able to receive medical care and begin formally changing their gender identifications in this Pentagon's personal system.
[03:30:57.185 --> 03:31:00.687]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and I'm pretty f***ing pissed off.
[03:31:01.267 --> 03:31:07.190]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[03:32:07.887 --> 03:32:09.969]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:09.969 --> 03:32:20.256]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:20.256 --> 03:32:26.241]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[03:33:15.310 --> 03:33:32.253]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.253 --> 03:33:35.954]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen in this segment.
[03:33:35.954 --> 03:33:40.114]  He's going to be talking about the EU hierarchy of pedophiles.
[03:33:40.114 --> 03:33:41.795]  That's the next thing they're going to normalize, folks.
[03:33:41.795 --> 03:33:42.715]  You need to understand that.
[03:33:43.611 --> 03:33:46.122]  over and over again we see this and it is a it is a a
[03:33:49.108 --> 03:33:53.472]  A pet thing, I guess we could say, of the elites.
[03:33:53.472 --> 03:33:56.754]  People who are in power, it seems to just go hand-in-hand with them.
[03:33:56.754 --> 03:34:04.641]  We've been talking about the Department of Justice non-probe of Hillary Clinton and what Loretta Lynch will do.
[03:34:04.641 --> 03:34:11.487]  And of course, as I mentioned just before we went to break, we had seven hours ago, the New York Times says, no, no, no, she's going to not overrule anything.
[03:34:11.487 --> 03:34:16.591]  And then we hear two hours ago from the New York Times, she's going to accept the FBI's recommendations.
[03:34:16.591 --> 03:34:17.652]  But here's the truth, folks.
[03:34:18.152 --> 03:34:19.674]  Went to this just as we were going to break.
[03:34:19.674 --> 03:34:21.557]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:34:21.557 --> 03:34:25.282]  Lynch reserves the right to overrule the FBI in a Clinton probe.
[03:34:25.282 --> 03:34:28.526]  This is according to a senior Justice Department official.
[03:34:28.526 --> 03:34:30.689]  And this is being quoted out by Mark Halpern.
[03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:42.535]  He says, from a senior Department of Justice official, Attorney General Lynch reserves the right to overrule the recommendation of career prosecutors and the FBI in the Hillary Clinton email probe.
[03:34:42.535 --> 03:34:47.437]  This official says the probability she would overrule is very, very low, but it is not zero.
[03:34:47.437 --> 03:34:52.459]  So the news is that she will not recuse despite the firestorm.
[03:34:52.459 --> 03:34:59.182]  Saying that she will treat this case like other cases, showing deference, but reserving the right to overrule is not new.
[03:35:00.051 --> 03:35:03.916]  Alright, you understand there's a couple of different things going on here.
[03:35:03.916 --> 03:35:11.504]  First of all, this meeting that she did that is in clear violation of all the laws and ethics that have governed our judiciary.
[03:35:12.893 --> 03:35:27.897]  An attorney general or a judge meeting with somebody who is a defendant and talking to them in private for 30 minutes, and the FBI, who is supposedly investigating Hillary Clinton, covering for her, telling the media not to report it.
[03:35:27.897 --> 03:35:32.798]  Let me read you something from 2007, nine years ago.
[03:35:32.798 --> 03:35:36.719]  This was the New York Times saying, the attorney general is impeachable, you know.
[03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:40.432]  They weren't talking about Obama's Attorney General.
[03:35:40.432 --> 03:35:50.320]  No, this is the New York Times talking about Alberto Gonzalez, the Attorney General of George W. Bush.
[03:35:50.320 --> 03:35:53.702]  Because it's all about partisanship, isn't it?
[03:35:53.702 --> 03:35:58.826]  They're not going to talk about how Loretta Lynch ought to be impeached.
[03:35:58.826 --> 03:36:02.889]  They say impeachment is a bad odor in these post-Clinton days, but it needn't be.
[03:36:02.889 --> 03:36:03.830]  This is New York Times, 2007.
[03:36:05.438 --> 03:36:13.745]  Though provoked by individual misconduct, the power to impeach is at the bottom, a tool that is granted by Congress to defend the constitutional order.
[03:36:14.997 --> 03:36:17.178]  But we're not going to do that for Hillary, are we?
[03:36:17.178 --> 03:36:17.719]  Okay?
[03:36:17.719 --> 03:36:21.121]  Understand what it takes to do an impeachment here, okay?
[03:36:21.121 --> 03:36:26.524]  An impeachment proceeding may be commenced by a member of the House of Representatives on their own initiative.
[03:36:26.524 --> 03:36:31.568]  Any one of those guys, any one of our congressmen, could impeach this woman.
[03:36:31.568 --> 03:36:33.729]  And she needs to be impeached for this alone.
[03:36:33.729 --> 03:36:37.932]  There's many other things they could impeach her for, but this is enough, okay?
[03:36:37.932 --> 03:36:41.554]  The impeachment process, however, may also be initiated by non-members.
[03:36:42.557 --> 03:37:01.837]  They say, and I'm reading from Wikipedia, for example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a federal judge be impeached, a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment could come from a special prosecutor, or from the president, or from state or territorial legislatures, grand juries, or by petition.
[03:37:01.837 --> 03:37:02.958]  Let's start a petition.
[03:37:02.958 --> 03:37:03.779]  Let's impeach
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:05.280]  Loretta Lynch.
[03:37:22.406 --> 03:37:22.767]  That was
[03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.669]  I don't know.
[03:37:57.648 --> 03:37:59.551]  That's been shown over and over again.
[03:37:59.551 --> 03:38:08.682]  And so, they want to do it again now with gun control, and even though the FBI says, no, no, no, we're investigating those people, you'll kill that, she's already overruled him, so she will overrule him if she wants to on this impeachment thing.
[03:38:08.682 --> 03:38:10.184]  But here's the other issue.
[03:38:10.184 --> 03:38:15.691]  She said, if I recuse myself, then I wouldn't even be able to see what they were going to do.
[03:38:17.116 --> 03:38:20.738]  Because she needs to be able to pass that information to Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:38:20.738 --> 03:38:21.979]  And we see it now.
[03:38:21.979 --> 03:38:23.980]  This is an exclusive from The Daily Caller.
[03:38:23.980 --> 03:38:25.261]  It's up on Drudge.
[03:38:25.261 --> 03:38:28.363]  Hillary Clinton is scheduled to meet with the FBI this Saturday.
[03:38:28.363 --> 03:38:38.230]  The Bureau's interview with a presumptive Democrat nominee is believed to be the final step in the investigation of potential mishandling of classified information on her private email server.
[03:38:38.230 --> 03:38:42.512]  Was this what Loretta Lynch was passing on to Bill Clinton?
[03:38:42.512 --> 03:38:42.833]  Hey, Bill.
[03:38:43.573 --> 03:38:45.114]  Here's what they know.
[03:38:45.114 --> 03:38:46.754]  Here's how they're going to come after you.
[03:38:46.754 --> 03:38:50.096]  Here's how you need to have her answer these questions.
[03:38:50.096 --> 03:38:52.797]  Giving him the information so they can prepare Hillary.
[03:38:52.797 --> 03:38:55.618]  This is a woman who doesn't do press conferences.
[03:38:55.618 --> 03:39:00.421]  Everything, every word that she says is focus group tested.
[03:39:00.421 --> 03:39:06.703]  They are preparing two days in advance for her testimony, for her questioning by the FBI on Saturday.
[03:39:06.703 --> 03:39:07.364]  And this is what
[03:39:08.143 --> 03:39:13.584]  This Attorney General, so-called Attorney General, is going to do because she will not recuse herself.
[03:39:13.584 --> 03:39:19.505]  Even if she doesn't overrule this, even if she allows it to go forward, she will pass all of that information.
[03:39:19.505 --> 03:39:24.407]  She will be a mole for the Clinton crime machine as far as this investigation goes.
[03:39:24.407 --> 03:39:26.727]  That's why she won't recuse herself.
[03:39:26.727 --> 03:39:27.867]  That at the very least.
[03:39:27.867 --> 03:39:30.568]  Alright, let's go to, I've got Wayne Madsen on the phone now.
[03:39:30.568 --> 03:39:33.088]  Thank you for joining us, Wayne Madsen.
[03:39:33.088 --> 03:39:34.009]  Hi, how are you doing?
[03:39:34.009 --> 03:39:34.589]  Doing good.
[03:39:34.589 --> 03:39:35.549]  What do you think about this?
[03:39:38.183 --> 03:39:57.171]  When I first heard about the meeting on the tarmac involving Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch, my mind went back to the infamous Bill Clinton haircut where he delayed all the air traffic at LAX because he had to get a special haircut.
[03:39:57.751 --> 03:39:58.851]  That's right.
[03:39:58.851 --> 03:40:02.972]  I wonder if they shut down all the air traffic while they had their 30-minute private meeting in the airplane.
[03:40:02.972 --> 03:40:08.313]  And I understand, too, that... You ought to stay away from these tarmac meetings.
[03:40:08.313 --> 03:40:11.974]  But anyway, the optics on this are incredibly bad.
[03:40:11.974 --> 03:40:20.116]  I would note that Charlie Rose, who I think really represents his favorite organization, and he's a member of the
[03:40:21.076 --> 03:40:24.098]  He laughed this off.
[03:40:24.098 --> 03:40:27.539]  He said, oh, come on, it's just a meeting between two politicians.
[03:40:27.539 --> 03:40:29.780]  What's so unusual?
[03:40:29.780 --> 03:40:42.166]  Well, news to this veteran CBS correspondent, Charlie Rose, and he should know from Watergate days, the Attorney General is not a politician when they're serving in the role as Attorney General.
[03:40:42.466 --> 03:40:43.087]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:41:02.868 --> 03:41:07.592]  Yeah, she acts as if, well, you know, on second thought and looking back on this, this probably wasn't a good idea.
[03:41:07.592 --> 03:41:07.772]  Come on.
[03:41:21.182 --> 03:41:24.365]  She is, as you just pointed out, she's a career lawyer.
[03:41:24.365 --> 03:41:26.167]  And so is Bill Clinton, okay?
[03:41:26.167 --> 03:41:27.148]  He's a lawyer as well.
[03:41:27.148 --> 03:41:28.189]  They know what the rules are.
[03:41:28.189 --> 03:41:29.570]  They know what is going on here.
[03:41:29.570 --> 03:41:38.379]  And I think, honestly, Wayne, I think she was passing information to him so that Hillary could prepare for her deposition with the FBI this Saturday.
[03:41:38.559 --> 03:41:44.283]  I do too, and it's definitely interfering with an investigation.
[03:41:44.283 --> 03:41:51.047]  It's called obstruction of justice in federal legal parlance.
[03:41:51.047 --> 03:41:56.170]  But of course, the Clintons will skip out of everything.
[03:41:56.170 --> 03:42:01.013]  This is the same president who managed to parse a one-syllable word is.
[03:42:01.013 --> 03:42:03.315]  We have to remember that.
[03:42:03.635 --> 03:42:23.684]  Yeah, and of course we also need to remember that it was just about four or five days ago that we had this guy who was part of a corruption probe in the UN, Ash, who had a barbell dropped on his neck and it was very convenient for the Clintons because it was just a couple of days before he was going to be testifying.
[03:42:23.684 --> 03:42:32.148]  They've been arresting people from China as part of this corruption purchasing stuff and these are people that were involved with the Clintons
[03:42:32.788 --> 03:42:52.595]  Twenty years ago, when Bill was running for president, in 1996, when he was running for president, they were laundering money from Chinese businesses, from the Chinese government, Charlie Tree and other people, in order to fund his presidential race, and all of that got swept under the carpet, and this guy looked like he was going to try to turn state's evidence
[03:42:53.275 --> 03:43:01.620]  Uh, just like some of the other Chinese businessmen that they picked up, uh, saying that, well, we're going to, uh, we're going to testify and, and, uh, try to get ourselves off.
[03:43:01.620 --> 03:43:02.901]  That's the way they always roll this.
[03:43:02.901 --> 03:43:04.221]  They started out at the bottom.
[03:43:04.221 --> 03:43:05.782]  They were rolling their way up the top.
[03:43:05.782 --> 03:43:12.006]  This guy was desperate, and it looked like he was going to do a deal, uh, bring this all up again, and then he dies.
[03:43:12.512 --> 03:43:27.155]  I would also remind people that Mr. Ashe, who was the president of the UN General Assembly, had been the ambassador to the UN from the Caribbean island state of Antigua and Barbuda.
[03:43:27.155 --> 03:43:33.177]  And let us not forget that Antigua was once the home of the Stanford International Bank.
[03:43:33.177 --> 03:43:39.518]  Now, quote-unquote, Sir Alan Stanford, he basically had himself knighted by the Antiguan government
[03:43:40.158 --> 03:43:46.620]  He was a big donor to Democratic Party coffers.
[03:43:46.620 --> 03:43:49.782]  He donated to Republicans, too.
[03:43:49.782 --> 03:43:54.743]  Stanford's in jail now, but his bank, which was headquartered in Antigua, collapsed.
[03:43:54.743 --> 03:44:06.488]  Now, my question is, what does the FBI potentially have on financial transactions between this bank that was too big and did fail?
[03:44:07.328 --> 03:44:13.209]  Because it was fraudulent, it was tied up with the CIA, and the Clinton Foundation.
[03:44:13.209 --> 03:44:31.232]  Because we know, in both cases, Stanford Bank out of Antigua had clients in probably 80 to 85 countries, and you match that against the donors to the Clinton Foundation, you come up to around 80, 85 countries.
[03:44:31.232 --> 03:44:32.152]  Wow, wow.
[03:44:32.152 --> 03:44:35.753]  Yeah, it might have been more than just a little bit embarrassing for the Clintons, don't you think?
[03:44:36.373 --> 03:44:45.038]  Yeah, and people like Vince Foster who are in a position to embarrass the Clintons normally turn up dead.
[03:44:45.038 --> 03:44:50.521]  And that was an interesting thing, too, because Ash's lawyer said, oh, there's nothing suspicious about this.
[03:44:50.521 --> 03:44:51.561]  I wouldn't suspect murder at all.
[03:44:51.561 --> 03:44:53.903]  This is absolutely nothing like Vince Foster.
[03:44:53.903 --> 03:44:55.263]  It's like, what?
[03:44:55.263 --> 03:44:59.766]  His attorney is saying, yeah, I think it's not like the murder of Vince Foster, yeah.
[03:45:00.006 --> 03:45:02.188]  He said it without saying it, didn't he?
[03:45:02.188 --> 03:45:03.349]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:06.932]  Alright, let's talk about your article that was on InfoWars yesterday.
[03:45:06.932 --> 03:45:08.093]  I think it's still up.
[03:45:08.093 --> 03:45:10.055]  The EU, a powerhouse pedophile hierarchy.
[03:45:10.055 --> 03:45:18.162]  You're talking about the EU bureaucracy protecting these sex rings that are involving people at the highest level of European government.
[03:45:19.153 --> 03:45:33.881]  Yeah, you know, I mean, it's always been pretty well-known that higher-ups in Europe and in this country, too, are involved in assorted business, but until I was contacted just after the Brexit vote in the UK by
[03:45:36.683 --> 03:45:40.347]  Middle-level people in British intelligence.
[03:45:40.347 --> 03:45:45.912]  Did I have any idea how endemic the problem was?
[03:45:45.912 --> 03:45:54.239]  One of the reasons there was this revulsion against the EU in the United Kingdom, especially England and Wales,
[03:45:55.140 --> 03:46:00.563]  Was the fact that the people in these countries, they know what's going on with the EU.
[03:46:00.563 --> 03:46:19.255]  That the EU, far beyond being able to allow people and goods and services to go between national borders unfettered, it has been an awfully great thing for pedophiles trafficking in child pornography and children.
[03:46:20.035 --> 03:46:25.937]  And it was brought to my attention, and I remembered the Madeleine McCann case.
[03:46:25.937 --> 03:46:44.062]  This was the little three-year-old girl, people may remember, that was kidnapped, supposedly kidnapped from her parents' apartment, resort apartment, in 2007 in Praia da Luz, which is on the southern coast of Portugal.
[03:46:44.062 --> 03:46:46.423]  And what's odd about the case
[03:46:47.083 --> 03:46:54.971]  And it really wasn't reported, like, over in this country, is that immediately Tony Blair got involved, who was the then Prime Minister.
[03:46:54.971 --> 03:47:04.079]  He resigned not long afterwards, and his successor, Gordon Brown, who had been the Chancellor of the Exchequer, living next door to him at Number 11,
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:06.021]  Yeah, that's really strange.
[03:47:28.214 --> 03:47:29.655]  Gordon Brown doing.
[03:47:29.655 --> 03:47:35.259]  And then they sent their personal spinmeister down, the media watchdog man.
[03:47:35.259 --> 03:47:44.945]  This man was sent down to handle the case and later he turns up as the spinmeister for David Cameron.
[03:47:44.945 --> 03:47:46.906]  Different political party.
[03:47:46.906 --> 03:47:49.948]  Same guy, Labour and then Conservative.
[03:47:49.948 --> 03:47:56.653]  And when you peel back this nasty layer of the EU you find out
[03:47:57.173 --> 03:48:14.760]  That it does provide not only sanctuary like these pedophile resorts that exist in Portugal and Spain and France, but also it protects the trafficking in children and high-level cover-ups of the crimes of these pedophiles.
[03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:15.861]  Yeah.
[03:48:15.861 --> 03:48:17.041]  Yeah, it was very interesting.
[03:48:17.041 --> 03:48:19.223]  You have this question in your article.
[03:48:19.223 --> 03:48:27.208]  Why would the staff of a British Prime Minister become involved in media spin about a missing little girl on holiday with her parents and siblings in Portugal?
[03:48:27.208 --> 03:48:30.330]  I mean, that right there is so incredibly strange.
[03:48:30.330 --> 03:48:36.554]  And you're going to talk about how a descendant of Sigmund Freud was involved in this, tangentially.
[03:48:37.461 --> 03:48:57.001]  Yeah, it turns out that Clement Freud, who was the grandson of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, he was a member of the British Parliament at one time, a member of the Liberal Democrats, and was a so-called humorist.
[03:48:58.322 --> 03:49:01.244]  Uh, a television personality and whatnot, radio guy.
[03:49:01.244 --> 03:49:13.309]  Uh, it turns out that, uh, he lived, uh, not too far from the vacation home where Madeline McCann, this little three-year-old, uh, girl disappeared.
[03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:21.073]  And it also turns out now that, uh, Clement, um, Freud, uh, was known to be a pedophile.
[03:49:22.145 --> 03:49:23.446]  So you put two and two together.
[03:49:23.446 --> 03:49:48.645]  Now, he's not the only one who is implicated in the disappearance of this three-year-old little girl, but you look at the connections between this guy, Freud, and then one of the people brought in to handle the aftermath of the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann was this guy Clement Freud's son, Matthew Freud.
[03:49:49.466 --> 03:49:53.450]  Headed up a PR company that was retained in this case.
[03:49:53.450 --> 03:49:57.394]  So they bring in a PR flack as part of the investigation.
[03:49:57.394 --> 03:50:04.422]  Whose father is obviously one of the suspects since he lived next door to where the little girl was kidnapped in Portugal.
[03:50:04.682 --> 03:50:06.063]  Wow, that's just amazing.
[03:50:06.063 --> 03:50:11.568]  I was amazed to see in your article this list of people at the top of the British elite.
[03:50:11.568 --> 03:50:15.271]  Of course, we all know about Jimmy Savile, the entertainer.
[03:50:15.271 --> 03:50:16.532]  That was shut down multiple times.
[03:50:16.532 --> 03:50:19.634]  There was an investigation by Scotland Yard several times.
[03:50:19.634 --> 03:50:21.336]  Higher-ups shut it down.
[03:50:21.336 --> 03:50:25.939]  They had people at the BBC, after he died, did a documentary talking about his pedophile crimes.
[03:50:25.939 --> 03:50:28.762]  That was shut down by the BBC.
[03:50:28.762 --> 03:50:30.303]  Savile worked for the BBC.
[03:50:30.303 --> 03:50:31.204]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:50:31.944 --> 03:50:38.268]  But then you also pointed out the former British Home Secretary, overseer of MI5, Lord Britton.
[03:50:38.268 --> 03:50:44.812]  Also former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, former MI6 Secret Intelligence Service official, Sir Peter Heyman.
[03:50:44.812 --> 03:50:45.672]  All of these different people.
[03:50:45.672 --> 03:50:48.033]  That's just a part of the list that you've got there.
[03:50:48.033 --> 03:50:52.656]  All of these people have been involved in high-profile pedophile cases.
[03:50:52.656 --> 03:50:54.797]  We're going to be right back with Wayne Madsen.
[03:50:54.797 --> 03:50:55.718]  Stay with us.
[03:50:55.718 --> 03:50:56.818]  This is really...
[03:50:58.039 --> 03:51:00.781]  A lot of these elites want to stay in the European Union.
[03:51:00.781 --> 03:51:01.361]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.361 --> 03:51:06.784]  Have you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price?
[03:51:06.784 --> 03:51:09.385]  You are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:51:09.385 --> 03:51:10.206]  Here's why.
[03:51:10.206 --> 03:51:14.328]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:51:14.328 --> 03:51:15.269]  So please listen.
[03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:18.951]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:51:18.951 --> 03:51:23.393]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases,
[03:51:23.553 --> 03:51:25.274]  and produce electricity from the sun.
[03:51:25.274 --> 03:51:32.578]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:51:32.578 --> 03:51:34.899]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:51:34.899 --> 03:51:46.145]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[03:51:46.445 --> 03:51:48.168]  So it's a good time to check it out.

[03:54:02.265 --> 03:54:08.080]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:08.080 --> 03:54:10.326]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:54:16.047 --> 03:54:17.288]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:17.288 --> 03:54:19.169]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Wayne Madsen.
[03:54:19.169 --> 03:54:24.453]  We'll get right back to Wayne to talk about the pedophile industrial complex.
[03:54:24.453 --> 03:54:40.404]  It's one of the key motivations, he believes, behind the elite trying to stay as part of the European Union and also part of the rebellion about the people who are middle level in law enforcement as well as the masses, the middle class, who are fed up with the
[03:54:41.184 --> 03:54:42.785]  The political consolidation.
[03:54:42.785 --> 03:54:44.146]  Understand what is going on.
[03:54:44.146 --> 03:54:46.067]  There's multiple levels to this, okay?
[03:54:46.067 --> 03:54:47.347]  We've got corrupt bankers.
[03:54:47.347 --> 03:54:49.488]  We've got the military-industrial complex.
[03:54:49.488 --> 03:54:55.472]  And the bankers who run that, they want this kind of economic and political consolidation.
[03:54:55.472 --> 03:54:59.994]  But then there's also other things that are very powerful motivators, like this pedophile-industrial complex.
[03:54:59.994 --> 03:55:02.715]  That gives them a great deal of control over these people.
[03:55:02.715 --> 03:55:03.776]  It makes them blackmailable.
[03:55:04.256 --> 03:55:07.178]  And it makes them controllable from a number of other aspects.
[03:55:07.178 --> 03:55:14.141]  Before I get back to Wayne, real quickly, we have our July 4th Mega Specials are now live at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:14.141 --> 03:55:16.402]  Huge specials for this Independence Day weekend.

[03:55:30.050 --> 03:55:33.072]  Also 20% off Alexa Pure air filters.
[03:55:33.072 --> 03:55:34.693]  So filter your air, filter your water.
[03:55:34.693 --> 03:55:38.496]  20% off of both of those systems as well as Survival Shield X2.
[03:55:38.496 --> 03:55:40.437]  And then the biggest sale that we have is 20 to 40%
[03:55:42.438 --> 03:55:44.819]  Off Infowars select storable foods.
[03:55:44.819 --> 03:55:46.060]  These are all made in the USA.
[03:55:46.060 --> 03:55:49.182]  The best packaging you'll find in any storable foods.
[03:55:49.182 --> 03:55:51.243]  It lasts for 25 years.
[03:55:51.243 --> 03:55:53.964]  This is the way to prepare for food security.
[03:55:53.964 --> 03:55:55.245]  Take care of your health.
[03:55:55.245 --> 03:55:55.725]  Take care.
[03:55:55.725 --> 03:56:06.671]  Make sure you've got clean water, clean air, and storable food that is going to be available to you at a consistent price and 20 to 40 percent even off of our regular price.
[03:56:06.671 --> 03:56:08.512]  Let's go back to Wayne Madsen now.
[03:56:08.512 --> 03:56:08.732]  Wayne,
[03:56:09.875 --> 03:56:12.322]  Tell us, give us the big picture here.
[03:56:12.322 --> 03:56:14.869]  Tell us about the pedophile industrial complex.
[03:56:15.612 --> 03:56:40.886]  Well, I would mention that one of the things the EU allowed, for example, in the McCann case, is that these British officials, including law enforcement, were allowed to immediately go to Portugal and interfere in the Portuguese police, the judicial police, investigation of the disappearance of this three-year-old girl, Madeleine McCann.
[03:56:41.286 --> 03:56:45.447]  Now, that itself is egregious.
[03:56:45.447 --> 03:56:53.309]  Not only did they interfere, though, they also prevented the police from actually doing their job.
[03:56:53.309 --> 03:57:00.630]  So, basically, the police that were doing the investigation, the Portuguese police, had to throw their hands up.
[03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:07.392]  They issued the report and basically stated that they thought there was high-level
[03:57:08.312 --> 03:57:09.553]  Which there was.
[03:57:09.553 --> 03:57:11.535]  Interference in the case.
[03:57:11.535 --> 03:57:30.049]  And then, when all was said and done, the EU got involved, and through the Portuguese government, when Portugal's a member of the EU, and many of these police officers in Portugal found themselves being sanctioned criminally and were otherwise leaned on.
[03:57:34.713 --> 03:57:38.800]  Very analogous to what we're going to see happen, I think, with the Hillary Clinton investigation.
[03:57:38.800 --> 03:57:47.854]  People at the upper levels shutting down the work of the honest people at the mid-level and lower level, and then sanctioning them if they go ahead and do their work.
[03:57:49.452 --> 03:57:54.960]  And the other thing about this industrial complex is we even saw U.S.
[03:57:54.960 --> 03:58:04.754]  firms, including some dodgy firms, one of which was co-located with the big Washington lobbying group and law firm, Patton Boggs.
[03:58:05.234 --> 03:58:12.622]  Which is on M Street in Washington, D.C., which, you know, is the go-to place for lobbying.
[03:58:12.622 --> 03:58:23.935]  And one firm involved with them was also involved in suppressing or at least providing services, investigative services, on
[03:58:24.575 --> 03:58:25.757]  It's amazing.
[03:58:25.757 --> 03:58:26.979]  It's a very detailed article.
[03:58:26.979 --> 03:58:28.341]  You can find it at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:28.341 --> 03:58:31.806]  You can find Wayne Madsen at WayneMadsenReports.com.
[03:58:31.806 --> 03:58:35.811]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:35.811 --> 03:58:36.092]  Eastern.
[03:58:36.092 --> 03:58:37.454]  You really should read this article.
[03:58:37.454 --> 03:58:38.675]  It's very well documented.
