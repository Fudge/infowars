[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:19.000 --> 00:39.000]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  I tell you ladies and gentlemen, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:46.000 --> 01:03.000]  I just screeched in to my studio desk like a runner coming into home plate sliding in
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  because it is so incredible what we're witnessing.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  I talked about this yesterday being completely over the top and one of the biggest illustrations of arrogance.
[01:14.000 --> 01:25.000]  The most hubris filled, disconnected corruption I've ever seen out of some of the most hubris filled people in history.
[01:25.000 --> 01:43.000]  And that of course is the Clintons and their crime machine that has held this country under their iron fist and under their fog of false flags for 20 plus years.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  The Attorney General, who we have a whole stack of articles in the past who says she wants to restrict free speech.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  She wants to restrict the Second Amendment.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  She wants to have the UN run our local police departments.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:56.000 --> 02:06.000]  She stands by while Obama orders the border patrol to stand down, which is an act of sedition and treason against basic national security and the Constitution.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  She has continued to cover up Fast and Furious and Benghazi and everything else you can imagine.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  The IRS persecution of Christians and conservatives just continues on.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  It is truly insane.
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.000]  Richard Nixon would be about a one on a Richter scale corruption wise and one is too much.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  Rutter Lynch is about a 580.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  I'm not joking when I use numbers like that.
[02:33.000 --> 02:44.000]  The open naked magnitude of persecution that's been going on is so over the top it's intended to just set the precedent that we're going into a dictatorship.
[02:44.000 --> 02:57.000]  I had former senior Secret Service agent on Mr. Byrne yesterday who was with the Clintons for years and he said, look, she wants to create a socialist dictatorship.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  And that's exactly what these people are trying to establish, at least at the governmental level and the citizen level.
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  Above that, the most nationals will control it from offshore.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  But we have them now.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  This can bring down the Clintons like nothing we've ever seen before.
[03:18.000 --> 03:27.000]  And I do want to get a few of our regular guests just to pop in for like five minutes today to give us a quick statement.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  I want five minutes with Larry Nichols.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  I want five minutes with Roger Stone.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  I want five minutes with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  Just five minutes and others to talk about how big a deal this is and to get their perspectives.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  We have a transcript of it.
[03:48.000 --> 03:56.000]  We're getting it clipped out of the softball interview she just did for about 40 minutes with the Aspen Institute, a globalist organization.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Loretta Lynch's non-recusal recusal.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  She said, well, I'm not been involved.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  We're going to be involved and I'll take, you know, probably the FBI director says she leaves a proviso in there.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  But she goes on to say, but I can't recuse myself because then I won't know what's going on and won't be involved.
[04:11.000 --> 04:20.000]  Total oxymoronic bizarroland two plus two equals 15 type statements.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  So we've got that we're going to be going over.
[04:23.000 --> 04:31.000]  And then here's the really big one up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and drudgerport.com is linked to a hot air story on it.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  We have an info wars.com story.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  FBI at Clinton Lynch meeting ordered press blackout, no photos, no video. So this was totally a powwow.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  And you notice when I was in there watching her backing it up on the DVR in this talk she just gave that is like 30 minutes ago.
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  She says to the man quote interviewing her with softballs that, oh, well, she mainly talked about grandkids and, you know, golf and stuff like that.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  Mainly. You talk about guilty.
[05:01.000 --> 05:15.000]  Does 2016 feel more like 1980 40 year life is certainly imitating art with Uber's announcement that its fleet of more than one million drivers will now be tracked, traced and hand packed throughout every ride they provide.
[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  This is the next step toward totalitarian control of transportation and the end of individual autonomy on our roads.
[05:22.000 --> 05:31.000]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the ride sharing app has launched new and invasive technology called telematics, which records drivers behaviors behind the wheel.
[05:31.000 --> 05:40.000]  When a driver exceeds the speed limit, breaks abruptly, cuts corners or sends a text while driving, Uber alerts the driver of their mistake in real time.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  In the future, drivers who receive low scores throughout their driving history may be penalized.
[05:45.000 --> 05:55.000]  In addition, negative driving data such as speeding could easily be sent to law enforcement to enhance the tactics they use to pilfer the public through draconian fines.

[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[07:11.000 --> 07:20.000]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[07:20.000 --> 07:28.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, info wars life dot com.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  And you support the broadcast, info wars life dot com. Thank you doctor group from the Global Healing Center.
[07:57.000 --> 08:12.000]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[08:12.000 --> 08:21.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[08:21.000 --> 08:31.000]  Everyone knows that I was a massive critic of George W. Bush and called for his impeachment for launching the illegal war in Iraq,
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  framing Iraq for what the Saudi Arabian government and elements of our government really did on 9-11.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  I'm not a Republican hack. I'm a libertarian constitutional patriot.
[08:42.000 --> 08:53.000]  So when I should appear and tell you from my historical research that Loretta Lynch is undoubtedly the most corrupt U.S. Attorney General in history,
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.000]  and there's been quite a few that were corrupt, that is by thousands and thousands and thousands of percentage points.
[09:01.000 --> 09:13.000]  I mean, the nakedness, the open, unbelievable arrogance. I've got a stack of articles here.
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  Mainstream news where she said that she's going to restrict and criminalize speech,
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  where she's going to outside of law go after our guns, where she's going to put the U.N. in charge of our local police departments.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  That's why they're in a war against the police to break the police so that they accept that takeover and control.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  I'm not saying the police are perfect. I'm just saying there are police. This is our country, our government.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  We're not going to sit by and watch this multinational takeover.
[09:43.000 --> 09:52.000]  I have the articles right here in front of me, the smart cities initiatives of the U.N., the strong cities initiatives.
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.000]  Look at these. Look at this. Obama administration, U.N. announced global police force to fight extremism in U.S.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  Obama's Attorney General promises a criminalized speech.
[10:07.000 --> 10:17.000]  This is just some of the background, and there she is protecting the government, criminal elements of it, carrying out fast and furious.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  We have the CBS News reports where they got the documents, what was meant to blame the Second Amendment, a false flag.
[10:22.000 --> 10:30.000]  We now know, confirmed, that one of the shooters in Paris had a gun from fast and furious.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  We told you that a year ago, that they were shipping guns into Mexico and then out to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.000]  Now it's confirmed. She's covered up the IRS persecution. She's covered up Benghazi.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  She's allowed Hillary to just engage in all sorts of criminal activity.
[10:47.000 --> 10:56.000]  The Justice Department has blocked things at every front, not just with her, but her predecessor, Eric Holder.
[10:56.000 --> 11:14.000]  And now, she meets earlier in the week, in Arizona, in front of the press corps.
[11:14.000 --> 11:29.000]  She goes on to a plane, her private plane, with the former President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton.
[11:29.000 --> 11:42.000]  And meets in secret and then has the nerve to tell us it's no big deal when by every federal and state statute it is totally illegal.
[11:42.000 --> 11:57.000]  She met with a man who is under admitted criminal investigation by the FBI, supposedly by her Justice Department.
[11:57.000 --> 12:11.000]  All of this unfolding in our face, the email scandals, the IRS criminal investigations, the Benghazi investigations, all of it.
[12:11.000 --> 12:22.000]  This is like, if you're in a bankruptcy trial and you met for 10 minutes at a restaurant with a judge presiding over it,
[12:22.000 --> 12:32.000]  you and the judge would get indicted, even if you weren't doing anything wrong, quote, trying to fix it, it's illegal to meet.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  Bare minimum, she has to recuse herself.
[12:36.000 --> 12:45.000]  If she was caught at the grocery store bumping in to Bill Clinton and talking to him in front of witnesses for two minutes, she'd have to recuse herself.
[12:45.000 --> 12:56.000]  I've been involved in court cases before and you see the judge walking down the hall from the bathroom or their office and they won't even talk to you.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  And that's just in civil court.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  And they think we're ignorant. This is that moment, though, when the whole facade starts to collapse.
[13:08.000 --> 13:16.000]  This is that moment when the big lie starts to go in on top of itself because everybody knows the Clintons are above the law.
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  Everybody knows they've gotten away with bloody murder for years and years and years and years and Vince Foster and cattle futures and the carbon tax scams
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  Her getting off the airplane in Bosnia, Herzegovina and claiming she's being shot at by snipers and there's there's NBC and CBS and ABC news footage of a beautiful sunny day with kids giving her flowers
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  her Brian Williams moment.
[13:36.000 --> 13:47.000]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of just incredible scandals, missile secrets of the Chinese nuclear reactors that can make fissile material to North Korea on and on and on.
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.000]  Listing their crimes, it makes your head spin and the insider deals and screwing us on the trade deals and all of it.
[13:57.000 --> 14:06.000]  And then for some reason when she's been caught lying to Congress about I never was in my emails or I didn't know I had any emails or I didn't have any secret emails.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  I mean the head of the EPA had to resign because she had secret emails.
[14:12.000 --> 14:25.000]  All of this is illegal. All of this is to get around the four year law, the open records law. All of this is to abscond justice and our loss.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  That's what this is. Period. Period. No debate.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  And so they do this out of the open in front of everybody.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  And she's so arrogant. Here's the bigger niche.
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  It is confirmed in local newspapers and reporters are on record saying, oh yes.
[14:49.000 --> 15:03.000]  The FBI ordered all of us to turn our cameras off and to not record anything as Bill Clinton went by us as we were waiting to try to interview her on the whole Clinton investigation and they just met in front of everyone.
[15:03.000 --> 15:11.000]  That is the secret meeting commenced in front of them. They went in, the press saw the secret meeting commenced.
[15:11.000 --> 15:21.000]  They saw the jet door close to the fuselage and they did it in front of everybody.
[15:21.000 --> 15:29.000]  And then she has the nerve yesterday in a press conference to say, yeah, you know, I met with him, talked about some family stuff, mainly, mainly.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  And she leaves a proviso in there. That's pretty much what they talked about.
[15:33.000 --> 15:42.000]  Looks so incredibly guilty. But the question is that shows how they're mega maniacal. They're so delusional. They do this stuff out in the open.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  And then Charlie Rose comes out and says, oh, just two politicians getting together. Yeah, from the same party.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  She's not supposed to be a politician. She's sworn to uphold the law.
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  She's really a political hack of the Clintons brought into power by the Clintons.
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  And Charlie Rose is a Bilderberg attendee and CFR globalist, an open enemy of the country.
[16:01.000 --> 16:07.000]  Now, let's go ahead and go to the first clip of her in the press conference yesterday. Then we'll go to the new clip. Here it is.
[16:07.000 --> 16:16.000]  What's it appropriate for you to meet with him just for President Clinton while your agency is in the middle of an investigation of his wife's email servers?
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.000]  Well, I did see the president at the Phoenix airport the other night as I was landing. He was headed out.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  He did come over and say hello and speak to my husband and myself and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  So that was the extent of that. And no discussions were held in any cases or anything of that.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  And he didn't raise anything about that either.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  And there's another clip I saw on Fox where she's doing a press conference. There's a blue background, not a California flag background.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  And I saw her this morning say, oh, we mainly just talked about that.
[16:47.000 --> 16:54.000]  Now, let's go to the other clip. This is her speaking to the Aspen Institute just about 45 minutes ago.
[16:54.000 --> 17:05.000]  And this is one of the most Orwellian statements I've ever seen where she's talking to the reporter and she says, well, I can't really recuse myself because then I wouldn't know what's going on.
[17:05.000 --> 17:12.000]  But I'm not involved in the case, though. Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  Now, what's interesting here is you say you fully expect to accept the recommendations.
[17:18.000 --> 17:28.000]  One thing people were saying this morning when the news broke was that you were, quote, recusing yourself from having any kind of role in the final determination.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  Is that the case? Is that what you're saying?
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.000]  Well, a recusal would mean that I wouldn't even be brief on what the findings were or what the actions going forward would be.
[17:37.000 --> 17:46.000]  And while I don't have a role in those findings, in coming up with those findings or making those recommendations as to how to go forward, I'll be briefed on it.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  And I will be accepting their recommendations.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  And when you say, again, this must be the journalist in me and the link.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  All right.
[17:55.000 --> 18:08.000]  Well, that will problem that clip. I guess we'll go back to it in a moment. But that's mainly the extent of it right there.
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  She's saying, oh, I'm going to accept the findings.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  But she wants to then basically be involved in what goes forward from there.
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  How to spend the findings, how to make sure there's not a prosecution.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  How to let the Clintons know what's coming down the road.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  But all of this aside.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Think about it.
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  Have you ever seen them in such a panic? Have you ever seen them in such damage control?
[18:39.000 --> 18:46.000]  Have you ever seen them running around scared or have you ever seen them out there pushing harder saying this is no big deal?
[18:46.000 --> 18:54.000]  They're not going to get away with this unless the last time they were behind in an election, 1995.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  The last time they had a bunch of criminal investigations on them.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  The last time there were a bunch of state starting investigations on them.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  A federal building got bombed in Oklahoma City, the Alfred P. Murrow building.
[19:05.000 --> 19:14.000]  And within five minutes, Bill Clinton was on national television saying it was the fault of talk radio conservatives and libertarians.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  And of course, that was a false flag terror attack.
[19:17.000 --> 19:27.000]  The then deputy attorney general Eric Holder was later implicated bare minimum in the cover up of what really happened there.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  And most of you, of course, know what that was a bonafide false flag.
[19:31.000 --> 19:43.000]  We even know the names of the ATF, FBI, CIA, Army and German intelligence operatives that were there carrying out the event.
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  And we have all the different eyewitnesses who saw them there in the days before with their federal security badges,
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  doing telephone work in the stairwells with gray sticks of butter.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  And the cop of the year exposed it and they tortured him to death and then killed him.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I'm a former 22 year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.000]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.000]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious drought.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.

[24:23.000 --> 24:28.000]  So here's the headline up on infowars.com to add insult to injury.
[24:28.000 --> 24:37.000]  The press is out there on the tarmac begging to speak to the attorney general who's already embroiled in the cover-up of the Clinton crimes
[24:37.000 --> 24:47.000]  and for years blocking any type of real criminal investigations of e-mail, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the persecution of Christians, her foundation.
[24:47.000 --> 24:54.000]  I mean, they've got their fingers in all of it. And then, oh, here comes the president, the former president, Bill Clinton,
[24:54.000 --> 25:05.000]  Slick Willie, with his Secret Service detail, in front of the press and the FBI orders local ABC News reporters and others to turn your cameras off.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  So they're involved in the criminal cover-up.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  You see how much worse the scandal gets by the moment?
[25:12.000 --> 25:21.000]  The FBI blocked journalists from taking videos and pictures outside the secret airport meeting between former President Bill Clinton attorney general Loretta Lynch.
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  The former president steps into her plane and they speak for 30 minutes privately about Bill Clinton's kids, I bet.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  ABC 15 reporter Christopher Sein said about the Phoenix meeting.
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  The FBI, they're on the tarmac infrastructure, instructing everybody around, no photos, no pictures, no cell phones.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  And I love how the press just always follows orders.
[25:42.000 --> 25:49.000]  So governments so disconnected, the last dog media that's allowed in their press corps that gets near the Clintons and the Obamas,
[25:49.000 --> 26:00.000]  and their camp followers like Lynch, are so controlled historically that they all went along with this for a couple days till it finally started breaking.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Imagine being, I mean, if I was on the tarmac, of course, they would let me on the tarmac near them.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  Oh, I get such coverage, I get such accessibility. No, I don't. I have to tow their line.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  I become nothing but a regurgitator of their baloney. That's a nice word for their BS.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  So let's go ahead and play that clip. ABC 15 reporter on Bill O'Reilly.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  I'm surprised old Bill's actually going after Hillary. He's been defending her.
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  But you see, now even when this rat leaves the sinking ship, you know they're in trouble. Here it is.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  They wait for her to land. She arrives. Some people step off of her plane.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  The former president steps into her plane. They then speak for 30 minutes privately.
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  The FBI there on the tarmac instructing everybody around, no photos, no pictures, no cell phones.
[26:51.000 --> 26:58.000]  He then gets off the plane, gets on his own plane. He departs. She continues on with her planned visit.
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  Isn't that incredible? Talk about a mafia meeting. She's waiting. His plane lands.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  Turn the cameras off. All of you shut up. Still so arrogant.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  They think they're going to have a secret meeting in front of the press corps.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  Probably 50 plus cameras there. They're reporting. Everyone dutifully.
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000]  Yes, sir. We're feminists. We're going to do it because she's a woman.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  And Bill Clinton is so good to women. FBI at Clinton Lynch meeting ordered press blackout.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  No photos. No video. The video is up on info wars.com of this valiant member of the press.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  Because notice, you don't see the others talking about this. They know how to keep their mouths shut.
[27:35.000 --> 27:42.000]  Maybe one day they can be on a jet with Bill Clinton. Oh boy, doesn't that just sound horrible?
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  Now let's go back to the clip I played earlier of her at a press conference yesterday.
[27:47.000 --> 27:55.000]  And she says that they just discussed family. And now another statement I saw her say this morning.
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  She goes, oh, we pretty much just talked about that. So we got to find that video.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  I promise there's just so much of this stuff. Oh, that's pretty much all we talked about.
[28:04.000 --> 28:11.000]  Oh, 30 minutes. Oh, let's talk about Chelsea. Let's talk about all this baloney.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  Oh, sure. You just had this meeting and said turn the cameras off because no, everybody knew this was an outrageous,
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  horrible criminal meeting, that it was illegal, that she should recuse herself,
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  that she's been covering up and obstructing justice the whole time.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  And they thought they could get away with it because all these sycophants sit there and follow their orders.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  But somebody didn't in the FBI. Somebody didn't in the press corps.
[28:34.000 --> 28:42.000]  Traders to the tyranny. Traders to the enemies that have taken the nation. Real patriots are starting to speak out and take action.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  And Donald Trump says he's flabbergasted. That clip's coming up after the break.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  But first, let's go ahead and go to that clip from her at the press conference.
[28:50.000 --> 28:59.000]  What's it appropriate for you to meet with me for President Clinton while your agency is in the middle of an investigation of his wife's email service?
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  Well, I did see the president at the Phoenix airport the other night as I was landing. He was headed out.
[29:04.000 --> 29:12.000]  He did come over and say hello and speak to my husband and myself and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that.
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  So that was the extent of that. And no discussions were held in any cases or anything of that.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  She is so guilty.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  I didn't raise anything about that either.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  Oh, she just saw him. She just ran into him. She's just there waiting on her plane. Here comes his plane.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  So that story is conflicting right there. It doesn't matter. It's illegal, period.
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.000]  The press will try to divert off into some little side issue of this. It's illegal. It's arrogant.
[29:35.000 --> 29:41.000]  And it's always hubris that is the downfall of these criminals. Will they now fall?
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  Let's pray for it because they need to be brought to justice and all their criminal minions do as well.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  Because if she gets in, she's never going to let America get back up. It's her job to bring us down.
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 30:20.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  As well as neutron bombs and brain chip mobilized flashmob.
[30:27.000 --> 30:32.000]  The report even predicted the politically correct invasion of trickily puffed social justice warriors
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  whose ranks will be filled by the socialist spewing spoiled children of a once prosperous middle class.
[30:36.000 --> 30:42.000]  Finally, compact, increasingly cramped cities and booming third world populations would lead to increased migration,
[30:42.000 --> 30:48.000]  massive food riots, and spread of the radical political Islamic concept of UMA, which is the global Islamic community.
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  Food riots are now cropping up across the world in places like Venezuela and Greece.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  Are you prepared for widespread food riots?

[32:01.000 --> 32:05.000]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[32:05.000 --> 32:13.000]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[32:13.000 --> 32:24.000]  The all new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix at InfowarsLife.com is loaded with a full month supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[32:24.000 --> 32:32.000]  In the history of InfowarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[32:32.000 --> 32:42.000]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[32:46.000 --> 32:53.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  And that means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[32:56.000 --> 32:59.000]  That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[32:59.000 --> 33:28.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[33:29.000 --> 33:52.000]  I am so excited, so upset, so awake by how epic the events are that I'm actually sweating on air today and the air conditioner is not broken.
[33:52.000 --> 34:00.000]  A few days ago it was not working well and I was sweating. It's like 70 degrees in here and I'm actually sweating on air.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  My heart is actually beating fast because I realize we've got all these powerful forces trying to control the United States.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  I realize that Hillary Clinton is an admitted communist Chinese agent that's sold out our country.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  I know the Clintons of Engage and so many amazing crimes.
[34:14.000 --> 34:23.000]  And that if she gets into office, she's going for broke. Her attorney general has said she wants to restrict free speech in the Second Amendment.
[34:23.000 --> 34:31.000]  They are openly training the military to confiscate guns and to mask control and blockade cities.
[34:31.000 --> 34:38.000]  We've got Dr. Group coming in with mainstream news and also his sources and my sources documenting that a little bit later in the broadcast.
[34:38.000 --> 34:46.000]  They are going for broke. Absolute broke and this has captured the public's attention.
[34:46.000 --> 34:53.000]  Everyone sees how incredibly obvious this is that she's been controlling the investigations along with her predecessor.
[34:53.000 --> 35:02.000]  Holder and even Democrats are saying this is horrible. This is out of control and it's like a James Bond movie where you get the villains.
[35:02.000 --> 35:11.000]  She lands and then Clinton lands and then he comes onto her plane and they have this meeting and the Secret Service says turn your cameras off because it's so guilty.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  The FBI orders them to turn their cameras off because it's so incredibly guilty.
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  These people think they're gods and I'll tell you the desperateness of this.
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  The word is there was going to be some partial recommendations for criminal prosecution coming out.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  I didn't get that from these sources for a year but it hadn't happened yet.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  And the word is it was getting very, very close.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  There's a lot of pressure back and forth in internal battles going on.
[35:39.000 --> 35:47.000]  And so what would make Clinton desperately set up this meeting and desperately basically board her plane?
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  Turn the cameras off. Shut everything down. He boards her plane.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  Ron Brown said he wasn't going to go along with their corruption.
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  He brought up his commerce secretary with a 45 bullet hole in his head. That's what the coroner said.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  Remember the plane crashed into a mountain?
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  Most people on board have been shot.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  Now you do that as you have commandos on board posing a Secret Service.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  They put on their oxygen mask, kill everybody, blow the hatch or shoot out.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  It's a standard procedure.
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  One of their favorite ways to execute people because the plane crash covers up a lot of the killing.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  One lady survived the plane crash, though, was in good health and they took her off to an army hospital.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  She was dead a few minutes later.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  Was that Macedonia?
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  Right on the border with Serbia?
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  So she knows what happened.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  She understands what happens when you don't do what your overlords,
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  what the mafia dons tell you to do.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  So this is an incredible, incredible time to be alive.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  Let's hear what Donald Trump had to say about this.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  Because look, the drum beat is so strong on crooked Hillary that I'm telling you.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  I know the optics. I can feel the energy. I can see it in the press.
[37:04.000 --> 37:11.000]  This is the biggest blow against the Clintons in their decades of crime wave.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  And if we push this and we don't let the holiday weekend derail us,
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  and we keep this to be the number one story, and we take control of the meme with Hillary for prison,
[37:22.000 --> 37:29.000]  and we get this information out in the articles and videos at infowars.com that are going up as we speak right now.
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  And if we take control of the narrative with the truth, there is a very good chance we're going to see the fall of the Clintons
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  because this has really captured the world's attention.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  And I've been told by so many high-level people that they are so sick of the Clintons,
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  and everyone is so tired of them, and the fact that they're basically communist, Chinese operatives.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  So let's go ahead and play this clip from Donald Trump. Here is Donald Trump responding.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton while she potentially is weighing an indictment against his wife.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  Now, she claims that, you know, she boarded the plane. She was on the plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  They were talking about their grandchildren and sports.
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.000]  Is this an issue where you think the credibility, for example, of a criminal referral comes from the FBI?
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  Do you think the Attorney General needs to now recuse herself?
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  Well, when I first heard that yesterday afternoon, I actually thought they were joking.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  I thought the people that told me was, you know, I said, no way. It's just no way that's going to happen.
[38:37.000 --> 38:46.000]  And it happened. And I am just, I'm flabbergasted by it. I think it's amazing. I've never seen anything like that before.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  Hillary Clinton has thrown everything she's got against Donald Trump, the American people, the lies, the spin, the deception.
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.000]  And do you understand, folks? If Hillary Clinton gets into office, I will have a much bigger audience.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  And my show will grow until she censors it or shuts it down or has me killed.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  And I was told I was fired from radio jobs on directives of the Clintons.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  I was told shut up and stop talking about the Clintons by people that would call and threaten me.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  And then they came and physically attacked me and said, we told you shut up about the Clintons.
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.000]  So I have personally experienced it. I've seen the emails where they're talking about going after the press.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.000]  And before that, in the Clinton Foundation, at their library, Judicial Watch got the documents, so the World Net Daily,
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  about how they're going to persecute the press and go after people.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  And Lynch is running around talking about going after the press today.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  So this is really an evil, evil, evil, evil group of people.
[39:43.000 --> 39:50.000]  And then today, just about an hour ago, she finished up a little 30-minute talk with a softball question reporter
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  from the Aspen Institute saying, I'll take his recommendation, but I want to know what's being done
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  and then what's being planned after that recommendation.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  So I'm not going to recuse myself, but I'm not involved.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  But she's admitting she's involved.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  So it really is an outrageous video.
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  I want to play this clip for folks, and if we can run a little bit longer than we did last time,
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  because there's some real substance here.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Again, this has Richard Nixon going, I'm not a crook.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  I'm not a crook.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  Or Clinton going, I didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  But this isn't oral sex in the oral office.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  This isn't just lying to a grand jury.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  This is meeting with the attorney general who's been covering your butt
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  while you butcher this country's liberties up one side and down the other run.
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  False flags against the Second Amendment, order stand downs, create ISIS, arm Al Qaeda,
[40:47.000 --> 40:55.000]  open our borders up outside of law, let people with diseases in, set up all this domestic surveillance of patriots,
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  put Obamacare in to screw us over.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  Her foundation getting 100 plus million from Saudi Arabia,
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  and when they're executing homosexuals and women or slaves.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  I mean, she's just a giant fraud.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  What is wrong with so-called feminists?
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  They just want the delusion that she's a woman and you just don't like her because she's a woman.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  I could care less that Loretta Lynch is a woman or that Hillary is.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  They're horrible corrupt people.
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  I can't stand Bill Clinton.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  He's a horrible person.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Obama's horrible.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  It has nothing to do with the fact that he's part African.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  This identity politics is killing us.
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  And you know, if Hillary was a man, she'd already be indicted.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  They just, they use this whole thing, again, that she's a woman.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  We're going to hear that for eight years.
[41:48.000 --> 41:55.000]  Oh, it's a woman, so you can't.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip of her earlier today.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  Now, what's interesting here is you fully expect to accept the recommendations.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  One thing people were saying this morning when the news broke was that you were, quote,
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  recusing yourself from having any kind of role in the final determination.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  Is that the case?
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  Is that what you're saying?
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  Well, a recusing would mean that I wouldn't even be brief on what the findings were
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  or what the actions going forward would be.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  And while I don't have a role in those findings, in coming up with those findings
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  or making those recommendations as to how to go forward, I'll be briefed on it.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  And I will be accepting their recommendations.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  And when you say you...
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  I guess it must be the journalist in the language.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  I'm going to back up a little bit.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  She will accept, she will take the findings,
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  but she says she wants to still be involved with what's done with those findings,
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  implying she's going to try to block any criminal prosecution,
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  which she's already been doing.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  They love using this lawyer talk on everybody.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  So that's what they just did.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  Let's go back to the so-called journalist.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Again, this must be the journalist in me and the linguist in me.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  Accepting to me means here, Madam Attorney General, here are our findings.
[43:10.000 --> 43:16.000]  And you completely accept them wholeheartedly and then issue them to the public,
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  or you accept them, look them over,
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.000]  and then make your own determination as to what the final determination will be.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  No, the final determination as to how to proceed will be contained within the recommendations
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  and the report in whatever format the team puts it together.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  That has not been resolved, whatever report they provide to me.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  There will be a review of their investigation.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  There you go.
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  There will be a review of what they have found and determined to have happened and occurred.
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  Then they'll change it.
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  Then they'll change it.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  Then they'll persecute them and give them a back off.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  They should proceed.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  And when you say there will be a review, you mean the review will be done by you?
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  Once you accept the recommendations and determinations,
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  or if you're talking about the process of the review getting to that point.
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  I'm talking about the initial process of how this case will be resolved.
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  We're going to finish the rest of this, but this is so sensational.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  Do you understand what you just saw?
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  She's going to decide how to proceed.
[44:11.000 --> 44:12.000]  She's just admitted it.
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  So there's your headline.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  Lynch will take the FBI's quote recommendation,
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  and then I guess she's judge, jury and executioner.
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  And you know, she's the judge hanging out with the Clintons.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  She will now basically decide because they're going to review and then persecute
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  and claim it's wrong and let the press attack and link this info on those FBI agents.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  Let's finish the clip.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  This case will be resolved by the team that's been working on it from the beginning.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  Supervisors always review matters.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  In this case, that review will be career people in the Department of Justice.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  And also the FBI will review it up to and including the FBI director.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  And that will be the finalization of not just the factual findings,
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  but the next steps in this matter.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  There you go.
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  There's your headline right there, folks.
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.000]  Loretta Lynch, the Justice Department will decide how to act on the FBI report.
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  Boom.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  She goes, I'm not going to recuse myself.
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  You know, I'm going to accept their findings, but I'm not involved,
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  but I'm going to make the final determination with senior career people, her minions,
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  like shark teeth.
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  It's going to get Jan and Reno and then you get the next.
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  Oh, how wonderful.
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.000]  We now have Eric Holder and then his minion Loretta Lynch and then the next minion
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  and the next minion.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  They will decide, not her.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  Oh, my minion I brought in.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  They decide this isn't legitimate and we're going to ignore it.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  That's how they plan to operate.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  Larry Nichols on after the break here for just five minutes, maybe two sevens,
[45:43.000 --> 45:44.000]  maybe 10 minutes.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  Appreciate him popping in the constant Clinton and cider to tell us where he thinks this
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  is going.
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  I personally smell blood and I think this is one of the biggest blows ever to them.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  But just the way the press is responding, everything is happening.
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  The corruption is so naked.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  Before I go any further, they are setting up FEMA camps.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  We're going to cover this the next hour.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  We have all the documents, all the news articles.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  They're preparing for civil unrest.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  The globalists admit they want to make us independent.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  There's my foot in slip.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  The globalists admit they want to make us totally and completely dependent on them.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  I want to make everybody independent.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  And we've got everything you need from non GMO heirloom seeds, the lowest prices,
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.000]  the widest selection, the high quality, storable foods to shortwave radios to solar
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  panel kits and control units that are the best out there bar none.
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  Everything at infowarstore.com.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  We're running one of the biggest sales ever.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  I normally do this once a year.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  I just did this two months ago, but didn't have as many items in it.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  It was just food.
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  20 to 40% off everything that is survival related.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  It's our fourth of July.
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  Megaspecials are now live at infowarstore.com.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  Our Independence Day Megaspecials are now live again at infowarstore.com.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  Secure independence from the establishment with 20% off survival shield,

[47:14.000 --> 47:17.000]  These specials will run for a limited time while supplies last.
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.000]  This Independence Day is a great time to support the real tip of the spear when it
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  comes to the fight for liberty.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  Your support makes everything we do possible from exposing Hillary Clinton to fighting
[47:25.000 --> 47:31.000]  with the Constitution and trying to stop World War III while we open Europe up to
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  radical Islamists, but then start a fight with Russia that's trying to fight with us.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  Visit infowarstore.com right now and secure your independence with these
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  Megaspecials while supplies last.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  Again, the globalists have our borders open.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  Europe's borders open to people that want to kill us.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  Russia's battling the same people, so the globalists are trying to start a war with Russia.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  The globalists are trying to bring the West down and what's left of sovereign nations
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  down.
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  They want to bring you and your family down.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  They want to bring independence down.
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  And this Independence Day lets declare, like Trump said a few days ago, economic independence,
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  cultural independence, national independence, mental and spiritual independence from this
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  Babylonian world government satanic system.
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.000]  You're not going to find better, higher quality, clean, produced right here in America,
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  storeable foods, then you're going to find with my patron supply.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  They only started like eight years ago and they've become the number, what is it?
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  Number two now, storeable foods company in the world.
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  Now, there are a lot of old companies got together that were the best with some folks in Utah.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  We're already doing it for decades, but it's a new company that's taken over because it's high quality,
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  clean, decent, delicious food at the lowest price that even compared to crap food.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  This is the best out there.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  By every metric, the price is incredibly low.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  The packaging is the best.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  It lasts 25 years and that's 20 to 40% off.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  And most of the packages are 40%.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  It's not like, oh, a few are 40%, but some are already so discounted.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  We can't offer more than 20 because then there's like 10% profit.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  We got to make some money around here.
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  I'm trying to launch aircraft.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  I signed a contract.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  I'm not trying.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  $30,000 for the RNC with the big Hillary for prison plane.
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  And if we're able to sell enough of the t-shirts, I'm going to do 30,000 more to fly the plane.
[49:13.000 --> 49:20.000]  It's been two days with a giant banner saying Hillary for prison over the Philadelphia DNC.
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  And we have got more of the Hillary for prison shirts back in stock of the third design.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  I think it's the best design yet.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  It's the classic design on Navy blue.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  Hillary for prison 2016 on the right shoulder says info wars.com.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  On the back, it says legalized freedom info wars.com.
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  So it's the same as the last design except it has a right shoulder info wars.com.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  It's the very best design we've had so far.
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  And the last version had a 4.9 review star.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  This has no reviews yet because we started selling it three days ago.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  The 18 Wheeler came in on Tuesday produced right here in America.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  So please get these shirts at full price.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  I sold the others like $5.95, $9.95.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  We need to sell a ton of these to pay for the aircraft.
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.000]  I need to sell thousands of these just to be able to print the banners.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Because I want to fly some info wars banners as well.
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  And they're gigantic.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  They're not your normal banners you see behind planes.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  They're the humongous ones.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  They're like super fat and super long.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  They're like $5,000 a piece.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  The two days, four flights a day is $30,000.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  And that's how we do it.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  We should be all in folks in the fight against the globalist.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  We need to commit.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  We need to spend our money, our energy, our time.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  I am all in.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  So far this year I've paid myself nothing,
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  and I intend to pay myself nothing.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  I am going to try to put everything we've got this year.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  Everything we've got just totally into the fight
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  because it's such an epic time to be alive.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  Do that with us.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  Buy the nutraceuticals.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  Buy the t-shirts.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  Get ready.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  Prepare yourselves.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  That's your defense while you're on the offense supporting us
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  to be in the info war.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  It's a total 360 win.
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  The fest kept secret in the firearms business is CDNNsports.com.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  CDNNsports is the largest firearms liquidator in the U.S.

[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  but were waiting for an outrageously low price,
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  Here's why.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems,
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  and it's getting worse.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  So please listen.
[52:15.000 --> 52:19.000]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[52:22.000 --> 52:25.000]  emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators,
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  in addition to the low price for M4W's listeners.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  Go to gridwars.com.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  That's gridwars.com.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  Go to gridwars.com.
[52:56.000 --> 53:22.000]  Go to gridwars.com.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  Feel the thrill, only at slingbow.com.
[53:56.000 --> 54:06.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones.
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.000]  We are on the verge of the fall of the Clintons, in my view.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  Now Larry Nichols helped get them into power, worked with them for many years,
[54:15.000 --> 54:21.000]  helped produce the major definitive works on them in their early criminal activities.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  The Clinton Chronicles.
[54:23.000 --> 54:28.000]  But now we chronicle their activities. It's even far worse than we can imagine.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  And she's far more vindictive and evil than ever.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  So he predicted and said the email scandal wouldn't get her so far. It hasn't.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  But I tell you, the optics of Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton meeting and telling the press,
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  turn off their cameras.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  I mean, this is a mob meeting in the forest.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  This is a James Bond crime boss meeting on the tarmac.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  The optics of this, the visuals on this.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  It seems like the whole press is freaking out. It seems like that the worm has turned.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Now, do you think I'm wrong, Larry Nichols? Or what do you have to say?
[55:00.000 --> 55:09.000]  Hey, Alex. Well, number one, you know as well as I, Alex, that if Hillary was called
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  raping a woman downtown on camera in Washington, D.C.,
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.000]  the 40% of the people that are behind her all the way, the feminists, the eagles, the
[55:21.000 --> 55:28.000]  mausoleums, then I'm going to change this whole thing hinges on that 20% that they called,
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  you know, undecided.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  And let me tell you, I can tell you what went on in that place.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  There's one of two or three things because that's what I used to do for them.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  So I know fairly well what happened.
[55:40.000 --> 55:47.000]  Bill Clinton met the Blanche and he was there to assure her that when Hillary gets to be
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  president, she'll be able to keep her job if she enjoys it.
[55:51.000 --> 55:58.000]  Number one, number two, I would imagine he gave her a slip of paper, a slip of paper
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  that had it on it.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  A couple of things about the career prosecutors that are working the case.
[56:07.000 --> 56:15.000]  And what was on that, Alex, were the things they had on them, you know, the drugs, women,
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  men, whatever.
[56:17.000 --> 56:23.000]  And she is to show them what they've got and if they, you know, die or don't do what
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  she says, that's what's coming out.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  So he gave her that slip of paper.
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.000]  So he gave her the blackmail information and you can see her licking her lips on TV in
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  this interview today at the Aspen Institute saying she's going to decide what to do with
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  the FBI report with her Justice Department people.
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  That is just sensationally arrogant.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  Right.
[56:44.000 --> 56:55.000]  Now, the third thing is that they want Loretta Lynch to prosecute some of the protesters
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  against Hillary.
[56:56.000 --> 57:03.000]  Those of us that are speaking out against immigration, against Muslims, et cetera, et cetera.
[57:03.000 --> 57:11.000]  Mill Clinton told her that he wanted her, they need her to step up and indict somebody
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  for hate speech because that will clear the road for the rest of the way for Hillary.
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  You'll back down the offer of conservative people, the moral Christian conservative people
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  that they figure are going to raise their voices.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  You're going to put that down.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  Sure, and that's what the persecution of tens of thousands of churches and conservative
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  and libertarian groups where the IRS was about.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  In fact, let's put it on screen.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  There's an article from last year where she said we're going to persecute people for their
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  free speech when they criticize us.
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  She's actually come out and said that before I'm looking for the article.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  So you're saying from working with the Clintons and handling them for many years, that's what
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  you believe happened on the airplane.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  That's what I know happened.
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.000]  Now, I wasn't there, of course, that I wrote the book that they used, and I did it so many
[57:56.000 --> 58:03.000]  times, Alex, that I know the M.O., that the strange meeting, the quick meeting, the quote
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  and quote, accidental on purpose meeting.
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.000]  You know, Mill Clinton wasn't in Atlanta or wherever this was, supposedly playing golf.
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.000]  He wasn't more playing golf than a man in the moon.
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.000]  He was there to deliver a message, and he was the one that they chose to deliver it.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.000]  You know for yourself, the red linch for all that she is, she ain't stupid.
[58:25.000 --> 58:32.000]  She knew she would have known if she met with Bill Clinton that this kind of fervor was going to happen.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  Well, that's why they had the FBI told the press to turn the cameras off.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  This is arrogance.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  Stay right there.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  Back in 70 seconds.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  Tell your prison family, go ahead now, folks.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  This is history happening, and this is the insider.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  Thank you for listening.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  Or with him.
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  Straight ahead.
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  Visit GCN Live.com today.
[59:16.000 --> 59:21.000]  5-3-3-1-3-9 to order your Pro Max shower filter from Pro Pure today.
[59:46.000 --> 59:53.000]  5-3-3-3-1-3-9 to order your Pro Max shower filter from Pro Pure today.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  5-3-3-3-3-9 to order your Pro Max shower filter from Pro Pure today.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  On the tarmac, she meets him.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  They meet for 30 minutes at least.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  The FBI and Secret Service tell ABC News and others to turn your cameras off.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  They've testified to that now.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  This is clearly premeditated evil.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  It isn't an accident, chance meeting.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Why would they be so incredibly arrogant?
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  I mean, is there a method for the madness?
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Rubber Nose is in it?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  No, absolutely.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  You know, Alex, I used to say right on your program.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Years, years, years ago, if you don't recall.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  I used to say the good news is they're lying to us.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  When they stopped lying, then we're gone.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  All right, they're not lying anymore.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  They're doing stuff right in front of us and what she's doing, what this meeting signifies.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  And they believe they didn't know it because I'm telling you, Lynch and Clinton both knew the reality of them meeting.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  You know, they're not professionals.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  They know.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  This is to get everybody discouraged.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  This is to break the spirit of all of us that are out here trying to fight and get our country back.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  This is designed to break our spirit.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  I don't think it's done that.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  I don't think it's done that.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  I think it's energized everybody.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  But I mean, her going on the Crispin Institute.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Have you seen the clip?
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  It just happened an hour ago.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  We played it where she says, I'm going to decide.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  She goes, recusing myself.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  No, but I'm not involved.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  I decide whether we prosecute.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Clinton double state.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Listen, here's what they're doing.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  She's not going to be in that.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  It's over.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  It's over.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  She's not going to be in that.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  So that's the decision there.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  So they're rubbing our noses in it, squatting in our face, letting us know.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  And if anyone, what that meeting was about for those career prosecutors, she's not going to be in that.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  I'm not going to deny it, but there's going to be all kind of searching and talking to these prosecutors that have worked on the case.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  And if any one of them dare to open their mouth and to say that they were coerced into backing off an indictment, she now has something to hand them to.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  I'm just giving two, just two, two of the federal prosecutors working on this case.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  One of them is a pedophile.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  One of them has a male lover and he's a male.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Now that's being a queer, don't mean much anymore.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  But of course, and of course, this is done on purpose, on purpose.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  They have people put in their compromise to do the investigation to blow it later.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Absolutely.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Absolutely.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  So they're going to make the point to prove.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Now remember, Alex, she's not going to be in that.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  And there's going to be hell raised when she's not, especially after this meeting.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  You know that.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  That's why he had to tell her, get your pen sharpened, ready to indict people for hate speech.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  We won't have to indict a lot, but we'll have to indict enough to get everybody.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Sure.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And could he pull another OKC to blame the Liberty Movement like last time he was hanging on by a fingernail?
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Yes.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Now, I'm telling you, that's what went down.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  It was one of those three, or all of those three, probably all that I guarantee you.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Wow.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Well, I'm telling you, folks are mad.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Folks are mad.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And I think their old playbook, a 20 years ago, isn't going to work as well, Larry.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Alex, I pray that you're right.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  That as of yet, as of yet, I have not seen it.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  Now, I will tell you this, and your audience needs to write this down, please, 40, 40, 20.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  It's the rule of law in life, in politics especially.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  40% are going to love Hillary.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  40% are going to hate her.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  You could give go bricks to the ones that hate her.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  They're still going to hate her.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  40, 40, 20.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  20% they call undecided.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  I call them don't care.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  If you're undecided, that means you're studying it and trying to figure it out.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  That 20% don't care.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  They're playing ball.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  They're at the mall or whatever.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Now, when you see these polls, Alex, showing Hillary up six or seven points or eight or
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  twelve, they're bold.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  That's to get Trump.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Sure, stay there.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  That's to get Trump.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Barack Obama's propaganda tool, clock boy Ahmed Mohammed, talks about life and guitar
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  and what he's learned about hate.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Ahmed, the Muslim teenager who was suspended from bringing a homemade clock that looked
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  like a bomb to school in Irvine poses for photograph at his home.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  If I'm not mistaken, is a guitar the same place that Barack Obama traded Bo Burdell
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  for the freaking Taliban five?
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  But let's go back to this stupid article.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  He's no longer surprised when people recognize him since his arrest at Irvine's MacArthur
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  High School in September when he brought a homemade clock.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  No, it's not a homemade clock.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  You took a clock, then you gutted it and you laid it in a suitcase to look like a bomb.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Anybody in their right mind would have said that looks like a bomb.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  But because you're Arabic, we have to all sit around and bow down while you go eat at
