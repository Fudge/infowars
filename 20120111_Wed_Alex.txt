[00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:06.613]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.374]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.135]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.736]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.277]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:17.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.582]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:46.092]  Well, my friends, it's another global transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:47.632]  Every day is a blessing.
[00:00:47.632 --> 00:00:50.534]  We live on a beautiful planet full of wonderful people.
[00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:55.636]  There are so many just dynamic and invigorating things going on.
[00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:59.878]  We live on a world full of good and opportunity.
[00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:02.799]  And evil and corrupt individuals understand that.
[00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.322]  And they seek to dominate and control societies.
[00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:28.138]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be joining us in the third hour today, constitutional lawyer, to break down the NDAA and the transference constitutionally into this modern despotic state and the fact that this is all illegitimate and illegal.
[00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:29.640]  You can't legalize tyranny.
[00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:33.459]  I've explained this many times, but he'll be joining us.
[00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.540]  We'll also look at the phenomenal situation.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.321]  I mean, Ron Paul, they gave him like 8% in New Hampshire last time, four years ago.
[00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.902]  They engaged in massive fraud on every front.
[00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:46.002]  And there's some evidence of that.
[00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:48.243]  We're working on getting Bev Harris on today or tomorrow.
[00:01:49.528 --> 00:02:01.296]  But still, a very strong second with the controlled corporate zombie signal media, the zombie control, trance control, enemy control media, and that's what it is.
[00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:15.325]  I mean, it's not media, it's not, they're biased, they're globalist fronts to create a false spectrum, a projection of false reality that they then trick you to debate within the controlled spectrum.
[00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:33.214]  of false information and lying by omission and twisting and spinning and outright obfuscation of the truth and lying and a lecherous, larcenous, luciferian jibber.
[00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:36.376]  Now, we're going, again, to be here for the next three hours.
[00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.197]  We're going to go over all of this.
[00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:43.340]  And every day I see footage like this, and I most of the time mention it but never get to it.
[00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:48.419]  And if you're a radio listener, you go up to Infowars.com, you can watch the footage.
[00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.340]  It's also at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:00.742]  But a bus confrontation caught on video in Bellflower, and the LA County Sheriff's deputies get on board.
[00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:08.624]  There is a polite woman, who the passengers say got on, who has apparently special needs.
[00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.525]  And the woman says, oh, aren't you a big shot?
[00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:22.256]  To the cops that he cold-cocks the old, what appears to be mentally retarded woman, knocking her to the ground and then goes after the guy videotaping.
[00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:28.864]  You are here to pay taxes and take cancer-filled shots and drink fluoride water and watch television to be programmed.
[00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:32.715]  The guy's like, well, give me your ID.
[00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:35.197]  I'm going to run your background, because he's black.
[00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.721]  He's like, well, I'm a veteran of six tours.
[00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:40.602]  I'm just back.
[00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:44.185]  I promise I will see about that, slave.
[00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:46.327]  And of course, it turned out the guy's who he said he was.
[00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:48.109]  But what if you weren't a veteran?
[00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.192]  Like, do I have my First Amendment if I'm not a veteran?
[00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:53.114]  By the way, they have a big study out with high schoolers.
[00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:54.535]  Most of them believe there's no First Amendment.
[00:03:55.496 --> 00:04:14.030]  And I guess they just love the idea of arresting everyone for their speech, so just giant masses of dumbed-down idiots, with police who were drawn from that very same pool, just ready to roundhouse, full power punch a woman, because she's like, aren't you a big shot?
[00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.632]  And you're like, you're not going to put my ego down, lady.
[00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:18.833]  I'm going to show you I got the power.
[00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:19.634]  I mean, if some
[00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:24.740]  Poor homeless person says, oh, aren't you a big shot?
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:36.368]  Even if I was tired, had a headache, whatever it was, I have too much pride in myself to full power punch somebody in the face and then run around and try to take somebody's camera away.
[00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:40.751]  But again, you gotta ask what type of people like, oh, this is a really proud of yourself.
[00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:45.734]  You punched a bag lady.
[00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:48.516]  Man, let me tell you, you're ready for the UFC now, aren't you?
[00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:53.836]  I tell ya, I always grew up thinking someday I'll be a real man.
[00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:57.860]  I can full power punch a bag lady in the face and knock her down.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.122]  I'll show her!
[00:05:01.122 --> 00:05:06.587]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:06.587 --> 00:05:12.933]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:14.394]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:27.821]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:34.717]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:38.559]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:39.800]  Others don't.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.942]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.723]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:46.625]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:53.249]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.951]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:58.312]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:05:58.312 --> 00:05:59.173]  Others don't.
[00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.851]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:09.274]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.274 --> 00:06:10.134]  Number 2.
[00:06:10.134 --> 00:06:15.018]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:15.778]  It's true.
[00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:20.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.642 --> 00:06:21.463]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:25.045]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:25.045 --> 00:06:28.748]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:29.749]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:32.511]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.194]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.194 --> 00:06:36.974]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:41.137]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.137 --> 00:06:45.881]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:50.345]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.127]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.127 --> 00:06:54.389]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.731]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.314 --> 00:07:03.015]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:08.318]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:09.859]  Saving means to make money.
[00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:18.644]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:07:19.384 --> 00:07:26.909]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:34.934]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:42.319]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.540]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.221]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:31.085]  Alright, we've got some really big breaking news, obviously, here today.
[00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:43.353]  You know, I told you back in October and then in November that war was already taking place in Iran.
[00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:53.940]  And now, if you just type in, war is already taking place in Iran, you will see hundreds of newspapers and publications just now telling the population this.
[00:08:54.966 --> 00:09:08.870]  Kind of like the New York Times two weeks ago and again yesterday came out and reported, oh, the government in Fast and Furious is also laundering millions in drug money.
[00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.931]  No, it's not millions.
[00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.371]  It's hundreds of billions.
[00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:14.232]  Now, again, I'm not tooting our horn.
[00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:16.272]  This is all in federal court.
[00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:20.094]  The government admits to this, the so-called government.
[00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:24.415]  But Stuart Rhodes, constitutional law scholar, former top Ron Paul staffer,
[00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:35.745]  We'll be joining us in the third hour today because he can break down the NDAA in a full-spectrum tyranny and the fact that it's illegitimate.
[00:09:35.745 --> 00:09:39.369]  I shot a video last week that's still the featured video on our YouTube channel.
[00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:41.932]  Unfortunately, it only has 250,000 views or something.
[00:09:41.932 --> 00:09:43.734]  It should have about 5 million, but whatever.
[00:09:44.557 --> 00:09:48.619]  I can make a joke video and it gets 3 million views, but serious stuff doesn't.
[00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:49.360]  I shouldn't complain.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.003]  The point is, is that we break down the fact you can't legalize tyranny.
[00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:56.304]  And the NDAA is a hoax.
[00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.065]  And I'm going to explain this again.
[00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:02.548]  They had laws that black people weren't humans in this country.
[00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:10.873]  And it took people, mainly white Christians, saying, you know what, I don't care if you say that's the law, and I don't care if you hang me for it.
[00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:22.262]  I'm going to go help break people off of the property that you say is property, but break them off of the plantation property, and I'm going to try to get them to safe places.
[00:10:23.291 --> 00:10:27.634]  And then after a while, a lot of folks said, you know what, you're going to try to kill me?
[00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:29.855]  I'll just start carrying guns and shooting back.
[00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:30.475]  You know what?
[00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:32.156]  You can't legalize tyranny.
[00:10:32.156 --> 00:10:33.177]  And it's real simple.
[00:10:33.177 --> 00:10:35.638]  I mean, Hitler was the law.
[00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:44.023]  And so did you just have to, you know, when they came to get you and your wife and kids and take you away because of what race you were or what political persuasion, you know, did you just go with them?
[00:10:44.023 --> 00:10:46.485]  Yeah, most people said you're the law.
[00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:49.767]  And the German soldiers and others at Nuremberg said, well, we were following orders.
[00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:54.085]  And some of the prosecutors at Nuremberg said, well, let's let him go.
[00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:56.066]  And they said, no, we can't do that.
[00:10:56.066 --> 00:11:07.793]  But nowadays, nowadays, every time I see Amish being arrested for producing their own milk, or people selling eggs or whatever on the side of the street, or they say, I'm just doing my job.
[00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:10.835]  No, what you're doing is helping destroy this country.
[00:11:10.835 --> 00:11:14.097]  And now you see the wages of the New World Order.
[00:11:15.956 --> 00:11:18.137]  You see that globalism is a curse.
[00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:20.478]  You see that it's like the plague.
[00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:26.481]  It's not rosy and cute and trendy and what the intellectuals are for.
[00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:29.563]  One world is not one world of peace and liberty.
[00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:41.789]  It's one world under despotic corporate rule with technocratic autocrats that sit back in their oligarchy and punch buttons and never even look at what they're doing to people and
[00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:53.792]  Who have a cosmology and a philosophy of hating their fellow humans and seeing us as a disease to be eradicated, modern transhumanist eugenics.
[00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.873]  And mark my words, it's all written on the wall.
[00:11:56.873 --> 00:11:58.253]  It's all public.
[00:11:58.253 --> 00:12:02.814]  The only question is, do you have the will to admit the truth?
[00:12:02.814 --> 00:12:05.255]  Because if you look at the facts and admit the truth,
[00:12:07.598 --> 00:12:08.698]  There is no choice.
[00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:10.179]  You will join Liberty.
[00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:14.400]  There is no choice because the New World Order isn't inviting you to join them.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.681]  Mid-term.
[00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:16.561]  Not long-term.
[00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:18.862]  You don't have to wait long-term now for the stuff to come down.
[00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:20.662]  Mid-term and short-term.
[00:12:20.662 --> 00:12:22.143]  You're going to be squeezed.
[00:12:22.143 --> 00:12:23.423]  You're going to be run over.
[00:12:23.423 --> 00:12:24.504]  You're going to be enslaved.
[00:12:24.504 --> 00:12:25.784]  You're going to be humiliated.
[00:12:25.784 --> 00:12:35.207]  You're going to die an early death from all the binary weapons and other systems they've put into us.
[00:12:35.207 --> 00:12:36.668]  If you don't know what that is, you better look it up.
[00:12:37.608 --> 00:12:44.552]  Because this isn't about entertainment, it's not about jokes, it's not about games, it's not about being a big radio host, it's not all about that garbage.
[00:12:44.552 --> 00:12:48.575]  This is about the real world, ladies and gentlemen, and facing it head on.
[00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:52.297]  It's the only way to stop it!
[00:12:52.297 --> 00:12:52.417]  Now...
[00:12:57.725 --> 00:13:06.549]  What's amazing is that in the last five years there have been hundreds of assassinations and thousands of killings.
[00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:09.610]  Because in some cases they blow up whole buildings full of people.
[00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.771]  Blow up whole military bases.
[00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:14.365]  And Iran doesn't like to look weak.
[00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:18.266]  So they're always saying, oh, that bridge just blew up when Ahmed Energy drove across there.
[00:13:18.266 --> 00:13:23.047]  Oh, this command military base or this internal police base headquarters just blew up.
[00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:25.828]  There's a crater at a 15-story building.
[00:13:25.828 --> 00:13:26.528]  Nothing's there.
[00:13:26.528 --> 00:13:29.629]  The building's blown all over the city.
[00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:32.349]  The gas main.
[00:13:32.349 --> 00:13:34.770]  So Iran won't say it's the U.S.
[00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.430]  and Israel and England.
[00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.310]  And our own government won't.
[00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.811]  You remember last year, Stuxnet was launched.
[00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:47.589]  And I said, you watch the NORTHCOM and the Cyber Command that's already in place, even though they haven't passed the law.
[00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:48.752]  They don't care.
[00:13:48.752 --> 00:13:50.195]  Laws.
[00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:51.317]  They've occupied this country.
[00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:58.253]  See, our military people are Americans and love America, but they're under mind control just like everybody else.
[00:13:58.253 --> 00:14:03.658]  They don't understand the commanders, the leadership, the system above them, they work for the New World Order.
[00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:09.644]  But because they're wearing an American flag on their arm, notice you see more and more American flags everywhere.
[00:14:09.644 --> 00:14:12.427]  Like people trying to say, I'm in with the police state.
[00:14:12.427 --> 00:14:14.429]  I'm in with the system.
[00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:15.510]  I go along with the war.
[00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.671]  That's what it symbolizes now.
[00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:21.868]  But most of the people I've talked to have American flags all over their cars.
[00:14:21.868 --> 00:14:23.809]  It's like, why do you gotta stick it everywhere?
[00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:28.050]  Because you know deep down, it's gone.
[00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.812]  It's gone like the year 1957, and it ain't coming back.
[00:14:32.812 --> 00:14:36.533]  America is gone.
[00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:40.034]  You know, Mancow this morning, I was on a show, he said, Alex, is the U.S.
[00:14:40.034 --> 00:14:43.555]  government, is America giving Latin American leaders cancer?
[00:14:43.555 --> 00:14:46.036]  And I said, buddy, America doesn't exist anymore.
[00:14:46.897 --> 00:14:49.499]  It can always be resurrected, like the Phoenix.
[00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:52.261]  You can always bring it back, because it's an idea.
[00:14:52.261 --> 00:14:55.244]  Liberty, freedom, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:55.244 --> 00:14:57.546]  But it's basically gone.
[00:14:57.546 --> 00:15:03.711]  And so of course you can't ever get it back, because people won't admit how far gone it is.
[00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:11.076]  Like children, the corporate whore media talk to the public like lobotomized sheep.
[00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:15.360]  That's how they see us, with their little Fox News Christmas cards to each other, is us as sheep pulling them.
[00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:23.593]  I don't want to analyze that more later today in detail, because I didn't even properly analyze it.
[00:15:23.593 --> 00:15:32.335]  I've looked at those Christmas cards more carefully now, and Fox News put this out publicly, they sent it to their competitors, and they published it.
[00:15:32.335 --> 00:15:42.037]  And it's sheep in a sled race, and Fox News is ahead of CBS News, ABC News, and NBC News, saying they're now competing with the networks.
[00:15:43.188 --> 00:15:52.233]  And they're sheep pulling them, and then looking over the hilltop as spectators, or MSNBC and CNN, saying, you're not even in the sleigh race.
[00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:52.734]  You know why?
[00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:59.658]  Because in the image, they have no sheep.
[00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:01.719]  And you notice, there aren't really foxes in the image.
[00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:07.060]  They're like big foxes, they're more like wolves, giant wolves.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.061]  Now there's the image.
[00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:12.763]  They're telling you everything in that image.
[00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:20.047]  This is because, again, criminals and scum and chicken-neck control freaks revel in lying to people.
[00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:26.908]  Like you see someone being conned or mistreated, you instinctively don't like it because you feel a brotherhood of humanity.
[00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:35.419]  Sociopaths and their psycho controllers, the psychos sit atop them, they revel in seeing goodness pulled down.
[00:16:35.419 --> 00:16:37.061]  It's a very secure feeling.
[00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:38.663]  You like cookies and milk by the fire.
[00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:43.205]  They like little kids chained down with electric drills going in them, you know?
[00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:46.406]  I mean, you know, they're a different breed of people we face!
[00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:56.870]  And until you realize that, and they're trying to turn our psychic atmosphere into their atmosphere, with all the shows about how torture's cool, and go ahead and torture people's kids, it's cool, this is pure evil!
[00:16:59.232 --> 00:17:19.820]  And they, I said, you watch, they're gonna launch, Stuxnet's been launched, this industrial hacking system that has to be injected directly into the computer systems that aren't networked, but they'll still use that, even though it's a different type of attack, to say we should censor the internet and shut things down, and that somehow a foreign government put out Stuxnet, like Russia, China.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:26.102]  And sure enough, a month later, they came out and said, yeah, Stuxnet's a foreign power, we need to take your rights away on the internet because of it.
[00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:35.760]  And it's admitted the United States and Israel cooked the thing up.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:47.533]  Now, Iran in the last month has had top generals shot, top scientists car bombed, military bases blown up, and their giant, the whole base is a crater.
[00:17:48.615 --> 00:17:51.337]  And the news says, oh, an ammo dump blew up.
[00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:52.378]  Yeah.
[00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:55.501]  Right when Ahmadinejad was supposed to arrive, he arrived late.
[00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:57.322]  He knows how to move his schedule around.
[00:17:57.322 --> 00:17:59.484]  But the top missile general, he did die.
[00:17:59.484 --> 00:18:01.086]  Well, now there's another one.
[00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:05.830]  And the New York Times is making fun of people that say Israel is involved.
[00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:13.616]  I mean, folks, do people read these mainstream newspapers to feel like morons and to know you're being laughed at and talked down to?
[00:18:13.616 --> 00:18:14.717]  It's like that Dana
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.320]  I think?
[00:18:39.215 --> 00:18:41.737]  Fair objectivism because they're scared to death.
[00:18:41.737 --> 00:18:42.959]  They're running scared.
[00:18:42.959 --> 00:18:46.782]  Oh my gosh, the sheep aren't acting like sheep anymore.
[00:18:46.782 --> 00:18:50.126]  So I told you!
[00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:55.010]  In the last four or five months, they've escalated blowing stuff up almost every day.
[00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.512]  Now, if that isn't a war, I don't know what is.
[00:18:59.502 --> 00:19:02.044]  And here's an article by Paul Joseph Watson that just came out.
[00:19:02.044 --> 00:19:06.709]  U.S.-backed terror group responsible for assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist.
[00:19:06.709 --> 00:19:12.014]  Support for terrorist organization part of covert war to topple Iran regime.
[00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:14.577]  And if you look at the four groups they got in there, there's five total.
[00:19:14.577 --> 00:19:18.200]  One's Kurdish, the others are all real Wahhabist Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.005]  Just like in Libya, the stinking criminals that run our government run Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:27.565]  They use them against us to take our liberty.
[00:19:27.565 --> 00:19:29.887]  They use them against the Serbs to take their liberty.
[00:19:29.887 --> 00:19:31.568]  They use them against the Russians.
[00:19:31.568 --> 00:19:33.229]  They use them against everybody.
[00:19:33.229 --> 00:19:36.491]  Al-Qaeda, the skeleton key, the arm of the New World Order.
[00:19:36.491 --> 00:19:43.555]  The sword Valkyrie held at the side of the Black War Chief, Lucifer.
[00:19:43.555 --> 00:19:46.356]  The key that opens any door.
[00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:50.419]  And now, report Tehran car bomb kills Iranian nuclear scientist.
[00:19:51.854 --> 00:19:56.415]  But don't say the West is involved or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:56.415 --> 00:20:00.916]  In fact, if you can think you're a conspiracy theorist, then it's a thought crime!
[00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:06.758]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.

[00:21:30.578 --> 00:21:31.819]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:36.382]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.382 --> 00:21:42.186]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:45.828]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.828 --> 00:21:48.550]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.613]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:21:53.613 --> 00:21:53.854]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:22:00.738 --> 00:22:03.721]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid?
[00:22:03.721 --> 00:22:09.307]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off of your teeth both as a vapor and as particles into your body?
[00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:12.971]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:16.975]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[00:22:16.975 --> 00:22:21.600]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.524]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[00:22:26.524 --> 00:22:34.711]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:47.422]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[00:22:47.422 --> 00:22:48.523]  It is One World Whey.

[00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:53.695]  That's 800-477-9256.
[00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:33.748]  I see articles all the time in the news about conspiracy theorists say Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons.
[00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:34.529]  No.
[00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:41.071]  Jane's Weapons Quarterly, since the late 1960s, says Israel has nuclear weapons.
[00:24:41.071 --> 00:24:46.853]  Every major government out there that has analysis says they've got at least 300.
[00:24:46.853 --> 00:24:49.174]  And ICBMs to deliver them.
[00:24:49.174 --> 00:24:50.194]  Anywhere in the world.
[00:24:50.194 --> 00:24:52.715]  And medium range missiles.
[00:24:52.715 --> 00:24:56.016]  But again, only Americans are talked to like we're children.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:02.561]  And I've actually had people call into the show before and say, you shouldn't talk about Israel and its nukes.
[00:25:02.561 --> 00:25:05.142]  Number one, you're wrong, but number two, you shouldn't talk about it.
[00:25:05.142 --> 00:25:09.523]  And say, okay, okay, Russia launched the Stuxnet against Iran.
[00:25:09.523 --> 00:25:15.685]  Okay, some type of mythical creature is blowing up all these military bases.
[00:25:15.685 --> 00:25:23.227]  Okay, doesn't matter you've had all these Israeli scientists come out and break down that they've got, of course they've got it.
[00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:27.071]  And then it becomes the hypocritical discussion, why can they have it?
[00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:31.334]  Or why does Pakistan have over 100 nuclear weapons?
[00:25:31.334 --> 00:25:38.120]  I don't know, if the so-called mainstream media said they didn't now, would I have to go, oh, well, you say so.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:44.125]  I mean, if Barbara Walters or somebody said, walk off a cliff, you can fly.
[00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:47.468]  I'm like, oh, well, I'll just jump off the Grand Canyon, because you said so.
[00:25:49.608 --> 00:25:56.511]  They just would straight faces spew the most ridiculous bull at people.
[00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:59.193]  We're a laughing stock around the world.
[00:25:59.193 --> 00:26:10.018]  Americans, because of the brainwashing, compared to any other nation, cannot mention continents, systems of government, famous events.
[00:26:10.018 --> 00:26:13.259]  I mean, just don't have passports on average.
[00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:13.880]  Know nothing.
[00:26:15.262 --> 00:26:20.867]  And think having pot-bellied known criminals stick their hands down your pants and grab your genitals.
[00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:24.630]  They think that's freedom.
[00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.913]  And then, I get up here and say, you know, there's a covert war going on in Iran.
[00:26:27.913 --> 00:26:28.974]  That's ridiculous!
[00:26:28.974 --> 00:26:30.094]  None of that's going on.
[00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:38.501]  And Bush, five years ago, signed the order to launch this stuff, and Obama has expanded it.
[00:26:38.501 --> 00:26:42.125]  And a known al-Qaeda group has been taken off the terrorist list now.
[00:26:43.118 --> 00:26:44.538]  And is hanging out in D.C.
[00:26:44.538 --> 00:26:47.720]  and Anwar al-Awlaki was hanging out secretly with the head of the Pentagon.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.841]  And I talk to these guys that just love to get rid of our rights because, you know, the Arabs have got to die.
[00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:56.522]  And I tell them, you know, most of the homeland security is focused on conservatives and libertarians.
[00:26:56.522 --> 00:27:00.083]  Now, you know that I can give you all these examples of al-Qaeda working for the U.S.
[00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:00.764]  government.
[00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:07.506]  People like Tucker Carlson, when he was talking to Adam versus the man, Adam Gokesh, he said, your parasites, Alex Jones is a bleeper.
[00:27:08.246 --> 00:27:09.327]  And you have no proof.
[00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:11.609]  How dare you say this with no proof?
[00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:14.332]  And it's like, the proof's everywhere, but they just say you have no proof.
[00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:17.915]  I mean, it's like this trick of just... I say so!
[00:27:17.915 --> 00:27:23.441]  It's like, oh my gosh, you're an establishment person, and your hair has come so nice, and you're acting condescending.
[00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:25.523]  I better bow down to you right away.
[00:27:25.523 --> 00:27:28.005]  I mean, it's like a game.
[00:27:28.005 --> 00:27:28.986]  It's a trance.
[00:27:28.986 --> 00:27:29.887]  It's a joke.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:42.950]  I mean, every form of classical tyranny is rearing up in our face, and we're here ringing the alarm bells and are saying, anybody that says that we should follow the Constitution is crazy!
[00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:48.775]  Anybody that says if you don't follow the Constitution, you'll get into tyranny is crazy!
[00:27:48.775 --> 00:27:53.258]  It's all happening!
[00:27:53.258 --> 00:27:54.840]  I mean, look at this out of Heratz.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.223]  Report, Tehran car bomb kills Iranian nuclear scientist
[00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:11.524]  It goes on to say the government news agency reports that Amadi Roshan 32 supervises development of the Natasin uranium enrichment facility.
[00:28:11.524 --> 00:28:13.785]  The Tehran official blames Israel for the bombing.
[00:28:13.785 --> 00:28:22.169]  So Iran's actually coming out and pointing out who's behind it, which before they wouldn't do because it made them look weak, but now it's too obvious with bombs going off constantly.
[00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:24.503]  But what does the New York Times say?
[00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:25.904]  They condescend.
[00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:30.929]  I'm sure that he did it to himself.
[00:28:30.929 --> 00:28:31.950]  Blaming U.S.
[00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.751]  and Israel.
[00:28:32.751 --> 00:28:34.893]  Oh, those nasty Iranians.
[00:28:34.893 --> 00:28:35.633]  They did it again.
[00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:37.255]  They said the sky was blue.
[00:28:37.255 --> 00:28:38.736]  Is there no shame?
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:49.105]  To believe Israel and the people that run the US, the globalists, would carry out covert operations that they admit they're doing?
[00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:50.666]  See, that's what's funny.
[00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:52.528]  Shepardly, because they have to authorize it.
[00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:55.290]  It's all authorized and admitted they're doing it.
[00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.652]  But then for the public, they say, oh, how silly.
[00:28:58.652 --> 00:29:03.356]  I heard a funny one today, Martha.
[00:29:03.356 --> 00:29:06.338]  They said Israel was the one blowing up all those military bases.
[00:29:08.044 --> 00:29:10.247]  I've seen some of the satellite photos of these bases.
[00:29:10.247 --> 00:29:12.830]  It's gotta be 2,000 pound bombs they're dropping.
[00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.792]  I mean, some of these are aircraft up there doing this.
[00:29:14.792 --> 00:29:16.594]  This isn't just saboteurs.
[00:29:16.594 --> 00:29:23.823]  But it doesn't matter, because a good old boy who thinks he's a good old boy, he doesn't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line, but he knows how to wear a John Deere hat.
[00:29:23.823 --> 00:29:25.084]  He'll go, Martha, listen to this.
[00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:28.542]  The Iranians are saying, our government would do that.
[00:29:28.542 --> 00:29:29.523]  Our government wouldn't do that.
[00:29:29.523 --> 00:29:34.025]  Everybody knows it's Iraners that blow stuff up, them Arabs.
[00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:35.286]  Hey, buddy, they're not Arabs.
[00:29:35.286 --> 00:29:36.266]  They're Persians.
[00:29:36.266 --> 00:29:36.866]  Shut up.
[00:29:36.866 --> 00:29:38.227]  I want to get my rights up.
[00:29:38.227 --> 00:29:42.129]  I hope the foreign banks take everything I got, because it's patriotic.
[00:29:42.129 --> 00:29:44.170]  All right, tons of news straight ahead.
[00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.271]  You don't want to miss what's coming up.
[00:29:45.271 --> 00:29:50.073]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.073 --> 00:29:51.474]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.474 --> 00:29:52.975]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.991 --> 00:30:01.933]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:05.953]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.953 --> 00:30:09.194]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:13.995]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:20.376]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.376 --> 00:30:22.617]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.177 --> 00:30:23.477]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.477 --> 00:30:23.977]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.977 --> 00:30:24.778]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.778 --> 00:30:25.938]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.938 --> 00:30:28.179]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:42.065 --> 00:30:46.451]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:49.354]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:31:00.686 --> 00:31:04.831]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:31:04.831 --> 00:31:07.113]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:31:07.113 --> 00:31:08.975]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:31:08.975 --> 00:31:11.938]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[00:31:11.938 --> 00:31:18.426]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:31:18.926 --> 00:31:22.167]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:31:22.167 --> 00:31:27.369]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:31:27.369 --> 00:31:28.890]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.310]  Your food supply.
[00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.512]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:31:34.512 --> 00:31:38.794]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[00:32:01.465 --> 00:32:03.187]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:08.493]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:10.035]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:10.035 --> 00:32:18.825]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:19.546 --> 00:32:27.071]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:35.076]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:35.076 --> 00:32:42.480]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:32:48.464 --> 00:32:50.826]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:52.907]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:32:52.907 --> 00:32:56.149]  I'm into changing my mind control.
[00:32:56.149 --> 00:33:08.098]  Commit the revolution and take it to toll.
[00:33:08.098 --> 00:33:14.342]  If you could, I think I'd switch and open your third eye.
[00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.653]  So here's the headlines.
[00:33:19.653 --> 00:33:22.520]  Tehran car bomb kills Iranian nuclear scientist.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.461]  Of course, they've got that Iranian former U.S.
[00:33:27.461 --> 00:33:32.862]  Marine Corps guy who said he was visiting his grandma over there.
[00:33:32.862 --> 00:33:36.183]  People could say, well, why do they always assassinate people with bombs?
[00:33:36.183 --> 00:33:41.024]  Because that way you make sure you get them.
[00:33:41.024 --> 00:33:46.685]  You can't insert somebody like Chris Kyle, a sniper, into the middle of a major Iranian city.
[00:33:46.685 --> 00:33:52.167]  A guy who can barely speak English from Texas, much less speak Farsi.
[00:33:53.767 --> 00:33:58.029]  And again, I've seen the satellite photos of some of these bases that have been blown up.
[00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:00.871]  It's not even saboteurs on the ground doing this.
[00:34:00.871 --> 00:34:02.892]  Very serious situation.
[00:34:02.892 --> 00:34:03.612]  Here's another one.
[00:34:03.612 --> 00:34:08.294]  Assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist is a familiar story.
[00:34:08.294 --> 00:34:11.116]  London Telegraph, the script by now is familiar enough.
[00:34:13.123 --> 00:34:21.972]  An assassin riding a motorcycle, that's the Mossad's signature, weaves through Tehran, mourning traffic towards his target.
[00:34:21.972 --> 00:34:30.942]  Almost invariably, a car, the vehicle of choice for officials of Iran's nuclear program.
[00:34:30.942 --> 00:34:33.665]  I guess it's a Peugeot, you pronounce it?
[00:34:33.665 --> 00:34:34.265]  Continuing...
[00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:46.735]  Leaning out a hand, the motorist attaches a magnetic explosive device, sometimes called a sticky bomb, to the door nearest the man he's trying to kill and then speeds off.
[00:34:46.735 --> 00:34:50.796]  Seconds later, the bomb is detonated by remote control.
[00:34:50.796 --> 00:34:55.757]  It is so sophisticated that only the target is killed.
[00:34:55.757 --> 00:35:00.378]  Those sitting next to him or in front or behind him escape with just cuts and bruises.
[00:35:00.378 --> 00:35:02.399]  Yeah, it's a shape charge.
[00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:05.780]  Wednesday's target was Mustafa.
[00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:15.306]  Ahmadiyya Roshan killed in his vehicle in front of a university campus in East Tehran.
[00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:21.551]  A chemist by training, he was a deputy director of Iran's main uranium enrichment plant.
[00:35:21.551 --> 00:35:27.596]  A role given to him because of his expertise in gas separation technology, a technique vital to the enrichment process.
[00:35:28.297 --> 00:35:34.799]  He was the fifth Iranian nuclear scientist to be targeted in the past two years, and the fourth to die.
[00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:38.680]  The only survivor was the biggest prize of all.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:46.883]  In 2010, I'm not going to even try to pronounce the name, now the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization,
[00:35:48.137 --> 00:35:56.283]  was well-trained enough to recognize that the clicking sound on the door of his car meant he and his wife leapt clear just in time.
[00:35:56.283 --> 00:36:04.789]  The same day on the other side of Iran's capital, one of his colleagues was less fortunate and fell victim to another motorcycle assassin.
[00:36:04.789 --> 00:36:16.898]  Iran's officials were quick to apportion blame Wednesday, the latest attack directing angry accusations at both Israel and their intelligence service, the Mossad, and at the Americans.
[00:36:17.518 --> 00:36:23.924]  A lot of Western security experts will say that the Iranians have some justification in their suspicion, at least as far as Israel is concerned.
[00:36:23.924 --> 00:36:31.912]  Mossad is expert at carrying out assassinations abroad, and Israel has most to lose from Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.
[00:36:32.927 --> 00:36:36.649]  Boy, you better believe the folks carrying these out are risking their lives.
[00:36:36.649 --> 00:36:37.870]  Trying to get into Iran and do that.
[00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:43.213]  The latest assassination comes at a particularly tense time in Iran's relations with the West.
[00:36:43.213 --> 00:36:52.398]  In the past fortnight, the United States and Europe have begun the process of implementing sanctions that could, for the first time, seriously threaten the Iranian regime's survival.
[00:36:53.723 --> 00:37:01.548]  Iran has responded by threatening to seal off the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of the world's oil supplies passes, sentencing a U.S.
[00:37:01.548 --> 00:37:09.193]  former Marine of Iranian descent to death on spying charges and holding war games in the Persian Gulf.
[00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:20.161]  This week it announced that the uranium enrichment began at a second facility, Fordow, buried deep underground, making it much harder to use military force to destroy Iran's nuclear program.
[00:37:21.618 --> 00:37:30.765]  And the word I've got from multiple military sources, high and low, including Colonel Schaeffer, is that they do actually have atomic weapons.
[00:37:30.765 --> 00:37:32.346]  They probably do.
[00:37:32.346 --> 00:37:35.668]  They could have easily gotten them from Pakistan.
[00:37:35.668 --> 00:37:37.770]  I mean, South Africa had a bunch of nukes.
[00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.932]  Most countries have race-specific bioweapons.
[00:37:40.984 --> 00:37:45.146]  Can you imagine what happens when these accidentally get out or are released?
[00:37:45.146 --> 00:37:50.908]  Or somebody gets mad because their husband or wife gets killed and so they release a race-specific bioweapon?
[00:37:50.908 --> 00:37:54.730]  And you've got all these eugenicists at the major universities here in the West.
[00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:03.433]  Writing public papers about how great it's going to be when the airborne bird flu or Ebola gets released and how they're ready to die with their family and how beautiful it is.
[00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:06.174]  I mean, whoa!
[00:38:06.174 --> 00:38:07.595]  I'm not worried about Iran.
[00:38:07.595 --> 00:38:15.778]  The West wants to attack Iran for political diversions while they implode the world economy.
[00:38:15.778 --> 00:38:20.880]  Israel is into six months of rioting and demonstrations across the board.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.560]  Across their political spectrum.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.001]  Europe, the United States,
[00:38:25.237 --> 00:38:36.329]  Everybody is angry, but if they get us into a big war, Americans will rally around the flag that's plastered on the war, the Israelis will do it, the Brits will do it, and this is going to be a big war.
[00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:55.691]  Most military sources I've talked to in my own analysis is that Iran is going to concentrate its attacks on Western targets, the Strait of Hormuz and Israel and other areas of the Middle East, Central Asia, that they probably won't attack the West.
[00:38:55.691 --> 00:39:02.893]  But the head of their intelligence unit for their parliament said they are going to target Tel Aviv and
[00:39:06.863 --> 00:39:11.987]  New York and other cities, which is a terrible idea to talk about it, especially.
[00:39:11.987 --> 00:39:24.979]  But if they do do it, that will... I mean, if a scratch is laid on an American, there will be news cameras weeping, wailing, freaking out, how dare them when we're bombing them, do something, nuke them.
[00:39:26.092 --> 00:39:29.693]  I mean, people will be trying to strap their children on missile cones.
[00:39:29.693 --> 00:39:31.454]  You know, kill brown people.
[00:39:31.454 --> 00:39:33.215]  You know, I want to breathe radiation.
[00:39:33.215 --> 00:39:35.875]  I mean, it's tribal.
[00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:38.236]  It's fun to get into.
[00:39:38.236 --> 00:39:45.759]  It's fun to freak out and watch a car bomb go off and ninny and bow to men in black uniforms standing around on street corners with machine guns.
[00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:51.301]  It's fun to have your wife and children groped and humiliated for the average mind-controlled sheeple.
[00:39:53.328 --> 00:39:59.552]  Who wants to vote for Mitt Romney, who supports open borders, abortion, carbon taxes, and wrote Obamacare.
[00:39:59.552 --> 00:40:09.219]  So, I mean, you know, there is a large contingent of sheeple who are hopelessly confused from birth and just are ready to do whatever they're told.
[00:40:09.219 --> 00:40:16.665]  And I see a bunch of Christian groups, mainly Christian Zionist groups, going, praise God, the end of the world's about to begin, nuclear Armageddon.
[00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:20.327]  And then I hear them accuse some of the Muslims for wanting that as well.
[00:40:20.327 --> 00:40:22.389]  And there are some groups over there that are just as crazy.
[00:40:23.536 --> 00:40:30.980]  And it's like, you're saying they're bad because they think the end of the world's coming, but you're saying, Newcome start, make Jesus come back?
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.822]  I mean, wow!
[00:40:34.822 --> 00:40:46.509]  And most of these people are incredibly soft, they've got their little office job, you know, they go to the cafeteria after church on Sundays, they sit around, they have no idea what a real depression is going to be like.
[00:40:46.509 --> 00:40:47.670]  They have no idea what
[00:40:48.905 --> 00:40:54.549]  Potentially, hundreds of thousands of body bags are going to be like, instead of just a few thousand.
[00:40:54.549 --> 00:40:58.071]  They have no idea what $10 a gallon gas is going to be like.
[00:40:58.071 --> 00:41:04.355]  And they're all going to be waiting, going, Jesus, come get me, come get me, where's the golden ladder leading down?
[00:41:04.355 --> 00:41:05.796]  Where's Jacob's ladder?
[00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:12.641]  Where's the, you know, where's Captain Kirk up there saying, you know, beam them up?
[00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:13.602]  And it isn't going to happen.
[00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:19.493]  And you're just going to be there going, beam me up, beam me up, beam me up.
[00:41:19.493 --> 00:41:22.694]  Christians have done it in the last hundred years in every country when they're being killed.
[00:41:22.694 --> 00:41:28.136]  They just roll over because the last 150 years they've taught this pre-tribulation rapture business.
[00:41:28.136 --> 00:41:31.517]  And whether that was true or not, the point is you've got to fight evil.
[00:41:31.517 --> 00:41:38.160]  If you're a good person, you're going to stand up against corruption, Christian or not, and these cop-outs and this stuff for the secular world.
[00:41:38.905 --> 00:42:02.506]  They'll make fun of Christians, or Muslims, or Jews all day, or Hindus, or Buddhists, but I see all these secular atheists and kind of New Ager people, they're like, well, it is a new energy force, the Mayans who couldn't invent the wheel, they say it's the end of the world, which they really didn't say that, but whatever, so there's something to it, and look at all the craziness, because the New World Order has a timetable to start World War III in 2012!
[00:42:04.187 --> 00:42:07.389]  And they want you to sit back and go, there's nothing we can do.
[00:42:07.389 --> 00:42:08.809]  It is the end of the world.
[00:42:08.809 --> 00:42:10.590]  We must pray to the Lord.
[00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.992]  Yeah, you better pray to God to get you in gear.
[00:42:13.992 --> 00:42:28.580]  I mean, you think you're on this planet, so if everything starts going crazy and haywire, you're just supposed to salute the so-called Christian leaders like Santorum and Obama?
[00:42:29.577 --> 00:42:35.142]  And just say, you keep us safe from the Muslim scourge as they sell it.
[00:42:35.142 --> 00:42:40.687]  I mean, Santorum's back out saying, eradicate Muslims, basically.
[00:42:40.687 --> 00:42:43.809]  Oh yeah, I'm sure that they're going to lay down for that.
[00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:45.551]  There's only a billion, 300 million of them.
[00:42:49.426 --> 00:42:52.447]  And most of them just want to live in a free market system.
[00:42:52.447 --> 00:42:53.927]  They're anti-communist.
[00:42:53.927 --> 00:43:01.730]  But let's turn them into anti-America, and then let's play us off against each other while the bankers sit there and come in and pick up the pieces.
[00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:03.310]  Divide and conquer.
[00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.551]  See, I'm not a pit bull to be thrown in another ring with another pit bull.
[00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:16.294]  I'm not a rooster that you throw me in the ring, everybody's betting money, the bankers are betting money, and I sit there with little razor blades on my feet, and I sit there and try to slice the other guy to death.
[00:43:16.294 --> 00:43:16.654]  You know what?
[00:43:18.277 --> 00:43:19.898]  I'm not a rooster, I'm not a pit bull.
[00:43:19.898 --> 00:43:22.459]  Yeah, I'm not getting in the ring for you, okay?
[00:43:22.459 --> 00:43:23.919]  I know who the real enemy is.
[00:43:23.919 --> 00:43:28.441]  I know who the ringmaster is.
[00:43:28.441 --> 00:43:36.624]  Oh yeah, you can... There's all sorts of aggressive forms of fish.
[00:43:36.624 --> 00:43:40.365]  And you can go buy them.
[00:43:40.365 --> 00:43:42.746]  And you can stick them in a fish tank together and watch them kill each other.
[00:43:43.752 --> 00:43:44.893]  That's just not my cup of tea.
[00:43:44.893 --> 00:43:47.294]  I'm not like the NFL guys or whatever.
[00:43:47.294 --> 00:43:52.198]  When the dog doesn't win the fight, I electrocute him or whatever, because I'm tough.
[00:43:52.198 --> 00:43:56.861]  Real men, you know, walk around with big pit bulls and everything.
[00:43:56.861 --> 00:43:57.922]  I'm not a real American.
[00:43:57.922 --> 00:43:58.922]  You've got to get down to that.
[00:43:58.922 --> 00:43:59.663]  You've got to understand that.
[00:43:59.663 --> 00:44:01.204]  I'm not for torturing kids.
[00:44:01.204 --> 00:44:02.085]  I'm not for endless war.
[00:44:02.085 --> 00:44:07.368]  I'm not for having the troops use depleted uranium and just beat their chest and go, we're tough, we can use it.
[00:44:07.368 --> 00:44:09.330]  Blood right out their nose.
[00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.671]  One room of the kids deformed.
[00:44:11.931 --> 00:44:13.711]  I'm not here to be a chump.
[00:44:13.711 --> 00:44:14.912]  I'm not here to be an idiot.
[00:44:14.912 --> 00:44:16.452]  I'm not here to be a moron.
[00:44:16.452 --> 00:44:19.712]  I'm not here to buy every new fraud that's crammed down my throat.
[00:44:19.712 --> 00:44:20.132]  I'm done.
[00:44:20.132 --> 00:44:22.773]  And I'm angry.
[00:44:22.773 --> 00:44:25.213]  And I break with this whole matrix system.
[00:44:25.213 --> 00:44:27.654]  This whole fake lie.
[00:44:27.654 --> 00:44:28.874]  And I break with the fear.
[00:44:28.874 --> 00:44:32.655]  I break with all of it.
[00:44:32.655 --> 00:44:38.216]  Because giving in to fear is like a prison.
[00:44:38.216 --> 00:44:38.936]  It's horrible.
[00:44:38.936 --> 00:44:40.616]  I can't imagine what it's like to live in it.
[00:44:42.253 --> 00:45:01.502]  I can't imagine what it's like to turn myself over to it so a bunch of perverts and scammer politicians can sit up there and lick their lips and threaten me with terrorists if I don't bare my loins to some pervert at the airport.
[00:45:01.502 --> 00:45:04.604]  I've watched these TSA people and they're rubbing people down and they're getting off on it.
[00:45:09.315 --> 00:45:11.197]  It is a hallucination.
[00:45:11.197 --> 00:45:12.077]  It is.
[00:45:12.077 --> 00:45:13.298]  It is insanity.
[00:45:13.298 --> 00:45:22.665]  It is crazy how by successful approximation, by increments, the system has trained us to accept basically anything.
[00:45:22.665 --> 00:45:24.806]  And now Fast and Furious comes out.
[00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:28.329]  Monsanto, knowing that their crops are destroying the biosphere, comes out.
[00:45:28.329 --> 00:45:29.930]  I've got news on that.
[00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:34.333]  Just hundreds and hundreds of huge facts of total corruption come out.
[00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:35.714]  And it almost has the opposite effect.
[00:45:35.714 --> 00:45:36.975]  Well, that's just the way it is.
[00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:39.637]  You don't know what you can do about it?
[00:45:39.637 --> 00:45:57.151]  Yeah, nothing you can do about it because you've just decided to sit there on your butt because you think you're winning by not caring and, you know, getting your MSG chips and your giant liter, you know, big gulp of aspartame and curling up on your couch and not caring.
[00:45:59.778 --> 00:46:12.617]  So you can be shot up with a bunch of vaccines, so 10 years from now you can be shriveled, you know, down to 85 pounds, vomiting your guts out, begging for mommy as you die of cancer with 30 years cut off your life.
[00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:17.459]  And the New World Order says, well, they're animals, so they deserve to die.
[00:46:17.459 --> 00:46:24.305]  And then you let them set up a system and you buy into being an animal so that they can play their little game with you.
[00:46:24.305 --> 00:46:27.888]  Because the New World Order has all these sick little rules I figured out.
[00:46:27.888 --> 00:46:29.049]  You have to let them in.
[00:46:29.049 --> 00:46:30.209]  You have to opt in.
[00:46:30.209 --> 00:46:32.171]  You have to decide to be an animal.
[00:46:32.171 --> 00:46:33.692]  You have to decide to go along with this.
[00:46:33.692 --> 00:46:35.073]  Well, not me!
[00:46:35.073 --> 00:46:35.934]  Not me!
[00:46:35.934 --> 00:46:38.156]  I'll tell you, New World Order people are the animals.
[00:46:42.469 --> 00:46:44.270]  You think you're so tough because you're so hard?
[00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.951]  You're not hard.
[00:46:44.951 --> 00:46:46.012]  You enjoy this stuff.
[00:46:46.012 --> 00:46:47.793]  You're worms.
[00:46:47.793 --> 00:46:49.315]  You're like cancer.
[00:46:49.315 --> 00:46:51.236]  Is cancer winning when it races to the body?
[00:46:51.236 --> 00:46:53.178]  No, it's killing its own host.
[00:46:53.178 --> 00:46:54.159]  You're aberrant.
[00:46:54.159 --> 00:46:55.500]  You're malfunctioning.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.801]  You're diseased.
[00:46:56.801 --> 00:46:58.122]  You're pathetic.
[00:46:58.122 --> 00:46:59.383]  You're weak.
[00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:03.026]  And you will fail of your own weight.
[00:47:03.026 --> 00:47:06.449]  This whole plastic fake system is going down.
[00:47:09.133 --> 00:47:10.815]  And it's not going to be pretty.
[00:47:10.815 --> 00:47:14.097]  The globals think they're going to ride this, ride this tiger?
[00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:20.483]  Yeah, you're going to ride it just like the guy Slim Pickens at the end of Dr. Strangelove riding that hydrogen bomb down.
[00:47:20.483 --> 00:47:21.884]  You're not coming out of this.
[00:47:21.884 --> 00:47:23.946]  Just get that through your little pea brain.
[00:47:23.946 --> 00:47:28.089]  You think the dark force that energizes you is planning to actually give you all this power?
[00:47:28.089 --> 00:47:30.612]  Why don't you read the old parables of the genie?
[00:47:31.803 --> 00:47:38.830]  You asked for 5,000 pounds of gold, you better tell them where to put it, because they're going to give it to you and drop it right on your head.
[00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.212]  In those parables, there's a lot of truth.
[00:47:41.212 --> 00:47:43.014]  Be careful what you ask for.
[00:47:43.014 --> 00:47:45.136]  Be careful what you want.
[00:47:45.136 --> 00:47:48.479]  You're attracted to death and power?
[00:47:48.479 --> 00:47:50.441]  Wait till you've actually stuck your arm in there.
[00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:52.723]  You're going to find out what you were looking for.
[00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:59.652]  So all of this is going on.
[00:47:59.652 --> 00:48:02.294]  Now, shifting gears into some positive news.
[00:48:02.294 --> 00:48:06.617]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:08.659]  Newtonian physics.
[00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:09.840]  Proven accurate.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.763]  Basic laws of this dimension.
[00:48:14.763 --> 00:48:19.867]  Basic primitive laws.
[00:48:19.867 --> 00:48:21.288]  Ron Paul.
[00:48:21.288 --> 00:48:24.711]  A powerful second in New Hampshire with the entire
[00:48:27.108 --> 00:48:51.500]  Global mouthpiece, zombie control signal, telling people, with the endless group of narcissistic ghouls, telling you, in their little skexy outfits, their fine gowns to impress you at the king's court and make you feel small, with the big architecture behind them to make you feel little, there they are, perched on high,
[00:48:52.506 --> 00:48:54.567]  Telling you Ron Paul can't win.
[00:48:54.567 --> 00:48:56.808]  First he couldn't win, first he couldn't get two points.
[00:48:56.808 --> 00:49:02.151]  Now, okay, he is in second place nationwide in almost every major state, but he still can't win.
[00:49:02.151 --> 00:49:06.194]  The nominee is Mitt Romney!
[00:49:06.194 --> 00:49:07.274]  Is Mitt Romney!
[00:49:07.274 --> 00:49:11.737]  And they just are going to say that and say that like a group of parrots.
[00:49:11.737 --> 00:49:12.197]  Forever.
[00:49:13.732 --> 00:49:22.138]  But it doesn't matter, even if they steal elections, even if Ron Paul loses, he wins by engaging and developing a movement and developing an idea.
[00:49:22.138 --> 00:49:24.079]  Think of where we've come in four years.
[00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:26.140]  Think of where we're going in four.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.021]  And people say, well, they could kill Ron Paul.
[00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:30.263]  What, and make him an icon even bigger?
[00:49:30.263 --> 00:49:30.883]  Kill me?
[00:49:30.883 --> 00:49:32.804]  Turn me into an icon?
[00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:34.205]  Strike me down?
[00:49:34.205 --> 00:49:36.347]  Become more powerful than you can possibly imagine?
[00:49:39.738 --> 00:49:40.839]  They can't strike you down.
[00:49:40.839 --> 00:49:42.300]  They can't strike... This is it.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.241]  We are unlocking people's minds.
[00:49:44.241 --> 00:49:45.902]  Most people are not bad.
[00:49:45.902 --> 00:49:47.583]  Most people are not evil.
[00:49:47.583 --> 00:49:48.844]  Most people are not corrupt.
[00:49:48.844 --> 00:49:50.666]  They believe this false system.
[00:49:50.666 --> 00:49:57.811]  We've got to fight with the truth and our ideology of liberty against the ideology of globalism and bondage and despotism.
[00:49:57.811 --> 00:49:59.472]  It's not a hard sell.
[00:49:59.472 --> 00:50:01.033]  You want what made America great?
[00:50:01.033 --> 00:50:01.753]  Liberty?
[00:50:01.753 --> 00:50:03.314]  And pointing your ship that direction?
[00:50:03.314 --> 00:50:06.377]  Never meant we actually got there, but we were going in the right direction.
[00:50:07.017 --> 00:50:32.432]  Going towards the sunshine, towards the fertile fields, towards the goodness, towards transparency, towards honor, towards small government, towards family and everything that's good, instead of our ship in these dark waters where the sea stinks and the crew's dying and our teeth are falling out and there's big waves and there's a big tempest, giant storm on the horizon and we're going full blast into that.
[00:50:32.432 --> 00:50:34.414]  And Ron Paul and others are trying to turn the ship
[00:50:35.154 --> 00:50:47.739]  And there's all these little scared minions up there, bought off by the bankers, fiat money, by their Ponzi scheme, stabbing at us and saying, no, we're fighting over the wheel, fighting over the wheel.
[00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:52.961]  But more and more people who are on the sidelines are going, why are those zombies fighting with them over the wheel?
[00:50:52.961 --> 00:50:55.362]  We obviously want to go back towards the sun.
[00:50:55.362 --> 00:50:57.083]  We want to go back towards the calm.
[00:50:57.083 --> 00:50:58.664]  We want to go back to where it's good.
[00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:02.483]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.483 --> 00:51:13.157]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.

[00:51:17.603 --> 00:51:20.347]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:51:20.347 --> 00:51:31.622]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:51:31.622 --> 00:51:34.786]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:51:35.106 --> 00:51:41.251]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:51:41.251 --> 00:51:51.138]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:51:51.138 --> 00:51:52.639]  The war is here.
[00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:54.540]  It's an info war.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.302]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:06.129]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:03.871 --> 00:53:09.034]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:53:09.034 --> 00:53:10.915]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:53:10.915 --> 00:53:14.437]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:53:14.437 --> 00:53:21.921]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:53:21.921 --> 00:53:26.423]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:53:26.423 --> 00:53:32.146]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:53:32.486 --> 00:53:34.287]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:53:34.287 --> 00:53:40.391]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.582]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:22.724 --> 00:54:35.928]  Because if you don't... I'll be sorry for you if you don't join us on the love train.
[00:54:35.928 --> 00:54:37.249]  Well, that's not manly, though.
[00:54:37.249 --> 00:54:39.869]  Manly is to kill a bunch of brown people in brief D.U.
[00:54:39.869 --> 00:54:41.270]  and come back and have deformed children.
[00:54:42.932 --> 00:54:50.380]  You know, last night we aired a little promo video for a group that brings Iraqi and Afghan children to the U.S.
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.945]  who have their arms and legs blown off, their eyeballs blown out, and who never got medical treatment.
[00:54:54.945 --> 00:54:56.427]  Some of them have shrapnel in their spines.
[00:54:56.427 --> 00:54:57.368]  They get a medical treatment.
[00:54:58.047 --> 00:55:02.894]  I saw comments on the YouTube that we posted this morning on the Nightly News saying, how dare you?
[00:55:02.894 --> 00:55:04.978]  They want to kill us.
[00:55:04.978 --> 00:55:06.119]  They're animals.
[00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:07.421]  You're a traitor.
[00:55:07.421 --> 00:55:09.604]  We're going to get the Hajjis.
[00:55:09.604 --> 00:55:12.188]  And I tracked back some of the people's, you know, their...
[00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:17.433]  Tracked them back to their pages, and it was all just pro-war, pro-death.
[00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:20.395]  Because, see, they have to say they're savages.
[00:55:20.395 --> 00:55:31.283]  When they see children they've maimed, and blown the tops of their heads off, or blown their little mandibles off, and their tongues are flopping all around in pain, they've got to say, good, they're animals, they deserve to die.
[00:55:31.283 --> 00:55:37.947]  A couple days ago I was on the radio with Opie and Anthony, and it was early in the morning, I was half-awake.
[00:55:37.947 --> 00:55:41.050]  I did an okay job, but I probably should have been a lot meaner to them.
[00:55:42.012 --> 00:55:48.754]  In hindsight, and then they go, here's Chris Kyle, the sniper, who claims all this about Jesse Ventura.
[00:55:48.754 --> 00:55:54.796]  And I should have brought up, you know, you say these are all savages, including the women you shot.
[00:55:54.796 --> 00:55:58.697]  But I didn't even, you know, bring that up because it's so over the top.
[00:55:58.697 --> 00:56:00.057]  But see, you've got to do that.
[00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:05.199]  I mean, if you're killing soldiers in a uniform who are trying to kill you, it's just a foreign enemy.
[00:56:06.158 --> 00:56:07.680]  You're part of this country, they're part of that.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.743]  You don't have to call them savages.
[00:56:09.743 --> 00:56:16.193]  But no, see, when you're mainly killing men, women, and children that are tired of being occupied, or just little kids that you bombed...
[00:56:17.657 --> 00:56:25.459]  Most of the people in there celebrating this, they actually would freak out if they saw a child with their lower mandible blown off.
[00:56:25.459 --> 00:56:26.459]  These are cowardly people.
[00:56:26.459 --> 00:56:30.199]  These aren't actually soldiers that were part of it who were saying it's okay.
[00:56:30.199 --> 00:56:42.722]  No, it's just these soft people who think it's real tough, and they get very upset by seeing these little kids that... I played the video on the news, so many of our listeners wanted to financially check it out and maybe support.
[00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:46.431]  Because I've also supported, you know, when the VA won't take care of U.S.
[00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:58.297]  troops that get hurt, I've supported some of those groups too, whether it's our troops, which aren't really our troops anymore, they're globalist troops, they're still Americans who've been used, or whether it's little, little brown kids.
[00:56:58.297 --> 00:57:01.859]  I mean, I... Do I have a soft heart?
[00:57:01.859 --> 00:57:02.599]  You know, I don't think so.
[00:57:02.599 --> 00:57:07.202]  I think I have a heart.
[00:57:07.202 --> 00:57:11.324]  And I also am God-fearing, and, you know, God's just God.
[00:57:12.472 --> 00:57:15.034]  Let me tell you, we're going to pay for all that in spades.
[00:57:15.034 --> 00:57:21.178]  Even though America was hijacked and was finagled into it, we will still be punished for all of that.
[00:57:21.178 --> 00:57:23.560]  Man, that's a scary thing.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.820]  I can feel God.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.642]  I can feel justice.
[00:57:27.642 --> 00:57:28.823]  I'm really worried about America.
[00:57:28.823 --> 00:57:33.526]  I'm worried about all of us.
[00:57:33.526 --> 00:57:36.208]  Because it's bad.
[00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:38.830]  And you know, if we just said what we did was wrong and repented,
[00:57:41.368 --> 00:57:45.192]  Then that would offer us a great deal of protection, but we won't.
[00:57:45.192 --> 00:57:49.116]  Instead, many people dance in the blood of the innocents.
[00:57:49.116 --> 00:57:50.478]  They rub it all over themselves.
[00:57:50.478 --> 00:57:59.348]  They spiritually fornicate with unclean ideas, spirits.
[00:57:59.348 --> 00:58:00.649]  They buy into it.
[00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:10.692]  And I didn't get into the positive news with Ron Paul yet, because I got off into that.
[00:58:10.692 --> 00:58:16.717]  But Ron Paul does say he's nipping at the white Obama's heels.
[00:58:16.717 --> 00:58:18.179]  Mitt Romney, the white Obama.
[00:58:18.179 --> 00:58:21.262]  Ooh, that'd be a good video to make.
[00:58:21.262 --> 00:58:22.543]  Meet the white Obama.
[00:58:28.029 --> 00:58:35.417]  Uh, we've got to destroy Mitt Romney because it's been a long time since we actually had a presidential candidate that wasn't a globalist puppet.
[00:58:35.417 --> 00:58:37.279]  His name's Ron Paul, we gotta get behind him.
[00:58:37.279 --> 00:58:43.526]  Stay with me.
[00:58:43.526 --> 00:58:47.491]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.967 --> 00:58:52.267]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.267 --> 00:58:57.849]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.849 --> 00:59:02.871]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.871 --> 00:59:07.913]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:08.453 --> 00:59:13.677]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.677 --> 00:59:15.978]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:15.978 --> 00:59:20.781]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.781 --> 00:59:21.902]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.902 --> 00:59:24.964]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.964 --> 00:59:28.586]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.586 --> 00:59:31.789]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:34.010]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.931]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:38.573 --> 00:59:42.795]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:42.795 --> 00:59:47.637]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:47.637 --> 00:59:53.780]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.181]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:58.942]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:10.405]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.405 --> 01:00:11.986]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.986 --> 01:00:13.528]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:17.732]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.732 --> 01:00:23.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:24.619]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:27.182]  We've got a lot of other world news, and I'm going to cover it.
[01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:38.429]  We're going to go over this now, but I also want to take your calls on the Iran situation, on Ron Paul's turbocharging, a strong second in New Hampshire.
[01:00:38.429 --> 01:00:42.751]  He's in first or second in Nevada and other juicy states.
[01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:48.194]  Santorum and his bloodlust for World War III is probably the leader down in Florida.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:55.224]  Paul is not going to be contesting that state, obviously, and wasting people's money.
[01:00:55.224 --> 01:01:04.931]  But, again, now is the time to be supporting our omnibudsman, our elder statesman, Ron Paul.
[01:01:04.931 --> 01:01:07.313]  Now is the time to get behind him like never before.
[01:01:07.313 --> 01:01:10.975]  I won't open the phones up on any of the issues I've mentioned or any issues you want to get into.
[01:01:10.975 --> 01:01:17.760]  We've also got the footage and audio coming up of the police officer just absolutely Mike Tyson-punching
[01:01:18.923 --> 01:01:26.148]  A special needs, mentally challenged woman.
[01:01:26.148 --> 01:01:27.989]  It's very manly though.
[01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:38.135]  I get upset by this video because it's so manly to beat up a retarded person.
[01:01:38.135 --> 01:01:40.957]  It's so manly that I'm feeling weak right now.
[01:01:40.957 --> 01:01:43.619]  I'm feeling pathetic right now.
[01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:46.360]  I wish I was man enough to do this.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.241]  And I'm intimidated by it.
[01:01:49.059 --> 01:01:56.385]  I, uh, makes you feel small to see this type of manhood in action.
[01:01:56.385 --> 01:01:57.266]  This is what it's all about.
[01:01:57.266 --> 01:01:58.727]  This is what America's all about.
[01:01:58.727 --> 01:02:05.652]  In fact, maybe the American flag shouldn't be a sheep sticking its head in the ground, the ostrich sheep, the ostrich sheeple.
[01:02:05.652 --> 01:02:10.216]  Maybe it should be like an old lady or like a mentally retarded child with a cop beating their head in.
[01:02:10.216 --> 01:02:11.657]  That, that, because that's freedom.
[01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:17.473]  After all, she angered his ego.
[01:02:17.473 --> 01:02:22.335]  She called him the big man.
[01:02:22.335 --> 01:02:24.957]  And, well, they show her.
[01:02:24.957 --> 01:02:26.878]  You can call me big man, huh?
[01:02:26.878 --> 01:02:27.998]  Call me big shot?
[01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:31.560]  Show you big shot.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.622]  And then the cop, he's not done there.
[01:02:33.622 --> 01:02:38.244]  I know he... There's somebody on the bus, you know, back 15 feet away videotaping it.
[01:02:38.244 --> 01:02:41.766]  Ooh, you don't do that in America.
[01:02:41.766 --> 01:02:43.327]  You don't do that in America, buddy boy.
[01:02:45.985 --> 01:02:52.831]  So they are trying to convert the police over into a bunch of really shameful people.
[01:02:52.831 --> 01:03:01.840]  I know most police still aren't like this, but a lot of them are.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.144]  To me, it's shameful.
[01:03:06.144 --> 01:03:11.529]  I just don't feel tough hitting a woman.
[01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:25.911]  And I really don't feel tough with a badge and a gun and quote-unquote authority, cold cocking somebody because they said something to me I didn't like.
[01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:28.352]  It's like something a ten-year-old would do.
[01:03:28.352 --> 01:03:29.713]  You know, I had quite a few girlfriends.
[01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:33.875]  And I've got a theory about women.
[01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:35.935]  One of the crew members actually has this theory, I think it's true.
[01:03:38.542 --> 01:03:43.263]  Half of the women out there are 50% crazy and the other half are completely crazy.
[01:03:43.263 --> 01:03:46.184]  But you know, men are crazy as well.
[01:03:46.184 --> 01:03:48.004]  I have a theory about men.
[01:03:48.004 --> 01:03:55.606]  Half the men out there are 50% crazy and the other half are 100% crazy.
[01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:59.887]  Women can't live with them, can't live without them, but I have had many girlfriends over the years
[01:04:00.848 --> 01:04:06.092]  We get in an argument with you and if you wouldn't argue with them, they'd start hitting you or clawing you or whatever.
[01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:12.496]  And I never really even had like, like if a man did it, it's like an automatic challenge and you, you, you beat the daylights out of them.
[01:04:12.496 --> 01:04:20.562]  But a woman does it, it's more like a flailing, like you've got like a, it's, it's almost laughable.
[01:04:20.562 --> 01:04:22.283]  It'll make you really get mad when you start laughing at them.
[01:04:22.283 --> 01:04:26.506]  But I have, you know, held down girlfriends and stuff like that when they're clawing at you and stuff.
[01:04:28.444 --> 01:04:29.905]  And then they always get real mad.
[01:04:29.905 --> 01:04:30.745]  Oh, now you're attacking me.
[01:04:30.745 --> 01:04:33.106]  I'm like, no, I'm keeping you from doing something to me.
[01:04:33.106 --> 01:04:35.027]  The point is, this woman didn't do any of that.
[01:04:35.027 --> 01:04:41.530]  She just simply got in his face, saying stuff to him, and so he punches her.
[01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:42.090]  Full power.
[01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.672]  And then goes after somebody's First Amendment to videotape him.
[01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:46.492]  So that's coming up.
[01:04:46.492 --> 01:04:47.772]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:04:47.772 --> 01:04:47.872]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:47.872 --> 01:04:48.493]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.803 --> 01:05:17.273]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:17.273 --> 01:05:20.956]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:21.966 --> 01:05:34.736]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.

[01:08:01.215 --> 01:08:06.482]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.785]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.388 --> 01:08:15.328]  Alright, we're eight minutes into hour number two.
[01:08:15.328 --> 01:08:20.890]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and if you're just tuning in for the first time, you found it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:24.210]  This is a talk radio like no other.
[01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:30.852]  We simulcast the entire three-hour radio show every day in live streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv for subscribers.
[01:08:30.852 --> 01:08:36.053]  We're also offering a system right now where you can watch portions of the show live at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:36.053 --> 01:08:37.733]  There's a big icon saying watch now.
[01:08:38.433 --> 01:08:47.605]  We're attempting to secure more server farms and bandwidth to offer the entire daytime radio slash TV show for free for everybody video wise.
[01:08:47.605 --> 01:08:51.270]  The audio is obviously free, but we're looking at budgetary issues and things.
[01:08:52.742 --> 01:08:53.102]  No, I don't.
[01:09:10.484 --> 01:09:16.427]  The distractions and diversions that are put out there to blind us from the real world.
[01:09:16.427 --> 01:09:22.271]  Our planet has been captured by six mega banks that control the central banks of almost every nation in the world.
[01:09:22.271 --> 01:09:24.972]  The ultra-rich actually control the money.
[01:09:24.972 --> 01:09:29.715]  They're not trying to make money, they literally make the money.
[01:09:29.715 --> 01:09:34.398]  And so they always want to get your country, your individual, your company, your town in debt.
[01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:43.154]  And because the engine of free market is so powerful, they've never been able to do that, even with wars, to a true servitude level.
[01:09:43.154 --> 01:09:50.940]  So now they've just put all their politicians in place and had them sign on to the 1,500 conservative trillion.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:59.446]  That's 1,500 trillion with a capital T. And now have signed the world onto it.
[01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:04.910]  The world's waking up, so they want to start a big war as another distraction for that.
[01:10:06.556 --> 01:10:09.217]  As they say, war is the health of the state.
[01:10:09.217 --> 01:10:11.499]  Grows the state throughout history.
[01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:23.324]  And so the state itself, piloted and hijacked by miscreant New World Order acolytes, is taking us into a very, very dark waters indeed.
[01:10:23.324 --> 01:10:25.125]  I want to take your phone calls in this hour.
[01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:27.687]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:10:27.687 --> 01:10:34.450]  And I do see Rocco, Ronnie, Don, Gary, Rob, and many others that are holding.
[01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:35.991]  We'll be getting to all of you today.
[01:10:38.097 --> 01:10:41.858]  But first off, I want to hit some more Ron Paul news.
[01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:52.601]  Again, obviously, he came in a strong second in New Hampshire, despite the fact that many zombies, it appears, did vote for Lord Romney.
[01:10:52.601 --> 01:10:57.983]  Because the media told him this is the only one that can win the Republican nomination.
[01:10:57.983 --> 01:11:03.645]  And they had all these talking parrots, regurgitating and repeating ad nauseum,
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:18.196]  Not that Paulie wanted to crack her, but that Ron Paul couldn't win, would never win, it's impossible, he's pathetic, he's dangerous, he's this, he's that, he wants you to die in a nuclear war, same thing they used against one of his...
[01:11:19.406 --> 01:11:25.991]  One of his idols, Barry Goldwater, who fought the globalists and exposed the Trilateral Commission and CFR.
[01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:31.076]  In fact, guys, will you print me Barry Goldwater quote on Trilateral Commission?
[01:11:31.076 --> 01:11:33.938]  It's the longer one about how they're taking over the country.
[01:11:33.938 --> 01:11:37.301]  And when I read this quote, you'll know how accurate it is.
[01:11:37.301 --> 01:11:38.362]  And here we are 40 years later.
[01:11:39.783 --> 01:11:55.992]  When he was running against LBJ, on an anti-war candidacy by the way, but from a conservative, true conservative position, and nationalist position, they ran ads showing a little girl standing there with a flower, and then a hydrogen bomb goes off and kills her.
[01:11:55.992 --> 01:11:59.314]  It's like, don't vote for Goldwater.
[01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:01.095]  He wants to kill your baby!
[01:12:06.314 --> 01:12:14.539]  But despite them throwing everything they've got against Ron Paul, he is in first or second in almost every state.
[01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.620]  And he's gaining momentum.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:22.884]  And if the world, if so-called conservatives, if people just snap their fingers and go, hey, wake up, wake up.
[01:12:22.884 --> 01:12:28.987]  Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare, the Massachusetts law that he wrote it.
[01:12:28.987 --> 01:12:35.511]  Mitt Romney's for abortion, open borders, gun control, and a bunch of other, carbon taxes.
[01:12:37.346 --> 01:12:39.547]  I mean, he is the white Obama.
[01:12:39.547 --> 01:12:41.468]  Meet the white Obama.
[01:12:41.468 --> 01:12:43.088]  Meet the white Obama.
[01:12:43.088 --> 01:12:48.851]  I mean, look, that's just like I told people, why are you bashing Obama in the 2008 election?
[01:12:48.851 --> 01:12:52.212]  You Republicans, you love George Bush, you should love Obama.
[01:12:52.212 --> 01:12:56.134]  Banker bailouts, takeovers, everything.
[01:12:56.134 --> 01:12:58.035]  Just different rhetoric.
[01:12:58.035 --> 01:12:59.856]  Hiring lobbyists, all of it.
[01:12:59.856 --> 01:13:02.357]  What they do is the same, the rhetoric's different.
[01:13:04.144 --> 01:13:07.986]  Mitt Romney with a little Ken doll face goes, I'll overturn Roe v. Wade.
[01:13:07.986 --> 01:13:11.528]  I mean, he's a liar!
[01:13:11.528 --> 01:13:16.671]  At least Obama tells you the truth.
[01:13:16.671 --> 01:13:18.432]  Yeah, this is the shorter version of the quote.
[01:13:18.432 --> 01:13:19.453]  This is from his, um...
[01:13:21.624 --> 01:13:22.725]  Book with no apologies.
[01:13:22.725 --> 01:13:27.408]  In fact, will you guys get me the, thank you for this one, the larger one, from no apologies.
[01:13:27.408 --> 01:13:27.768]  Add that.
[01:13:27.768 --> 01:13:30.350]  I actually have that book around here somewhere.
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:38.175]  The Trilateral Commission is intended and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest
[01:13:38.655 --> 01:13:42.698]  By seizing control of the political governments of the United States.
[01:13:42.698 --> 01:13:49.424]  The Toronto Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power.
[01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:56.049]  Political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[01:13:56.049 --> 01:13:58.632]  Clergy response teams, anyone?
[01:13:58.632 --> 01:14:02.114]  It's a global standardized system.
[01:14:02.114 --> 01:14:06.618]  And it doesn't give this Liberty Tree quotes where this was said, but this is an excise piece.
[01:14:06.618 --> 01:14:06.938]  Yeah, it is.
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:10.111]  The book, no apologies.
[01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:12.432]  Barry Goldwater.
[01:14:12.432 --> 01:14:20.495]  You know, that Jewish guy Ron Paul supported for president because Ron Paul's so anti-Semitic.
[01:14:20.495 --> 01:14:23.456]  Makes my head spin sometimes.
[01:14:23.456 --> 01:14:26.278]  Let's get into some of the other Ron Paul news.
[01:14:26.278 --> 01:14:32.940]  He has said that it's time for the other candidates to drop out.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.621]  I mean, some of them got three or four or five points.
[01:14:35.621 --> 01:14:36.742]  It is time for them to drop out.
[01:14:37.847 --> 01:14:46.152]  Because all those other groups that are going to stay in there, that's mainly folks that will not vote for a Mormon.
[01:14:46.152 --> 01:14:51.595]  No matter how you slice it, I'm not getting into Baptist or Mormon or Catholic bashing, okay?
[01:14:51.595 --> 01:14:56.017]  If you love God, you love life, you don't like corruption, I like you.
[01:14:56.017 --> 01:14:59.679]  You know, it's all this sectarianism that causes all the fighting.
[01:14:59.679 --> 01:15:04.862]  I'm not going to get into judgments here and turn this into, you know, beat my chest religiously and, you know, follow what I believe.
[01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:09.351]  I have a personal relationship with my Creator.
[01:15:09.351 --> 01:15:10.311]  I can feel it.
[01:15:10.311 --> 01:15:11.692]  I know it.
[01:15:11.692 --> 01:15:13.093]  I've experienced it.
[01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:14.394]  And you know what?
[01:15:14.394 --> 01:15:15.854]  I don't really find that in these churches.
[01:15:15.854 --> 01:15:19.156]  I don't get a good vibe in them, so that's why I'm not in them.
[01:15:19.156 --> 01:15:22.318]  Pharisees came to Christ and they said, why don't you come to temple?
[01:15:22.318 --> 01:15:24.079]  Why don't you get up there on the hill with us and pray?
[01:15:24.079 --> 01:15:28.062]  And He said, I do that in private in my closet.
[01:15:28.062 --> 01:15:31.624]  You guys get up there and tell everybody how good you are all day up there.
[01:15:31.624 --> 01:15:33.005]  But the issue here
[01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:44.891]  is that Mitt Romney, depending on how you slice it, will probably lose to Obama.
[01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:48.212]  He's a former big globalist, hedge fund person, all of it.
[01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:56.755]  And in a way, it doesn't even matter because you get him in there, now they'll get three or four more years before people figure out, hey, this guy's the same as Obama was.
[01:15:56.755 --> 01:16:00.196]  Remember all those poor Obama bots?
[01:16:00.196 --> 01:16:01.456]  Obama!
[01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.737]  Obama!
[01:16:03.737 --> 01:16:05.698]  Obama!
[01:16:08.624 --> 01:16:10.746]  Braying little Obama-bot sheep.
[01:16:10.746 --> 01:16:13.289]  Little Obama-sheeple.
[01:16:13.289 --> 01:16:14.270]  Oh, thank you, President.
[01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.613]  I'm going to get a free car and a free house and all my problems are solved.
[01:16:17.613 --> 01:16:21.357]  You're going to take the money from the rich people.
[01:16:21.357 --> 01:16:24.460]  There's only $2 trillion in domestic wealth that's left here.
[01:16:25.111 --> 01:16:28.312]  I mean, there's globalists that control tens of trillions apiece on record.
[01:16:28.312 --> 01:16:30.953]  They're all offshore and exempt from taxes on record.
[01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.854]  But let's say you took the $2 trillion.
[01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:36.696]  Oh, what's that going to do for the $15 trillion deficit?
[01:16:36.696 --> 01:16:39.897]  Or the GDP that's $15 trillion?
[01:16:39.897 --> 01:16:42.718]  Now the debt's greater than the entire GDP yearly.
[01:16:44.489 --> 01:16:51.490]  But you can't explain that to someone who is poor, who is into the entitlement society.
[01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:57.571]  Somebody who's poor, trying to put themselves through night school while working two jobs, they understand it.
[01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:00.352]  And if we keep a free market, they're going to expand the middle class.
[01:17:00.352 --> 01:17:01.352]  We can all be middle class.
[01:17:01.352 --> 01:17:02.632]  We can all be wealthy.
[01:17:02.632 --> 01:17:07.213]  Our poorest people are wealthy compared to people 2,000, 3,000 years ago.
[01:17:07.213 --> 01:17:11.194]  There's unlimited potential, but through an incredible free market driven,
[01:17:12.856 --> 01:17:24.264]  Liberty-based market, there's so much wealth that it's a disruptive technology, is what the globalists call it, and it will unseat their monopolies.
[01:17:24.264 --> 01:17:34.610]  And technology will accelerate so fast, and humans will get life extension, and then our population will become so giant that they'll build cities up and down instead of out.
[01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:36.752]  We will colonize space and it's over.
[01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:38.133]  And the globalists just don't like that.
[01:17:38.956 --> 01:17:41.319]  They romanticize a post-industrial.
[01:17:41.319 --> 01:17:45.584]  They're going to have high-tech reservations they go to for new bodies and new tech.
[01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:58.354]  And the rest of us will be in loincloths, very small numbers, basically like aborigines that they keep in certain greenbelt sectors to study primitive humans.
[01:17:58.354 --> 01:18:00.656]  And then they will split off into their new species.
[01:18:00.656 --> 01:18:05.379]  Now, again, when the New York Times and CBS News attacked me for this and say, I believe this.
[01:18:05.379 --> 01:18:07.221]  No, I don't believe this.
[01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:10.143]  I give the quotes in my films and here on air.
[01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:11.424]  This is what they're setting up.
[01:18:14.517 --> 01:18:16.058]  This is a future without us.
[01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.860]  This is a future that doesn't need us.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:24.505]  The elites have decided we've got robots, we've got drones, we don't want you anymore.
[01:18:24.505 --> 01:18:38.915]  And the ultimate exercise of power, the big gleaming switch that ensures that they get what they want, at least to one level, is to release the super bio-weapons and kill the majority of the people.
[01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:41.978]  And they'll go into their armored redoubts and the military will all be happy to be there.
[01:18:44.073 --> 01:18:54.716]  You know, select military and COG and then emerge after it and be given the cure and the antidote and then be integrated into the new future.
[01:18:54.716 --> 01:18:57.357]  And I'm telling you, they're planning this.
[01:18:57.357 --> 01:19:00.698]  So, you talk about doomsday, folks, this is going to be bad.
[01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:04.852]  I don't know.
[01:19:20.287 --> 01:19:23.909]  Playing with us like a cat plays with a mouse for 20 minutes before it eats it.
[01:19:23.909 --> 01:19:25.250]  We got blood coming out of our eye.
[01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.331]  We're scratched.
[01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:27.471]  Our back legs are broken.
[01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.372]  The cat's playing with us.
[01:19:29.372 --> 01:19:33.475]  It's dumping heavy metals into the food and water.
[01:19:33.475 --> 01:19:34.435]  All these other poisons.
[01:19:34.435 --> 01:19:35.536]  Deadly vaccines.
[01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:37.877]  All the degenerative diseases exploding.
[01:19:37.877 --> 01:19:38.998]  Cancer.
[01:19:38.998 --> 01:19:41.860]  And I'm like... I don't know.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.901]  They've sure done a lot of other horrible stuff though.
[01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:48.056]  I mean, here's CBS News where they're shooting kids up with live polio.
[01:19:48.056 --> 01:19:50.779]  Here's another one killing newborn babies with these shots.
[01:19:50.779 --> 01:19:52.060]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.381]  They say they're going to do it.
[01:19:53.381 --> 01:19:56.224]  They've always done everything they say they're going to do.
[01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:59.648]  The cops are like, eh, we want to beat some old ladies up right now.
[01:20:01.274 --> 01:20:02.575]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:02.575 --> 01:20:08.180]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:13.185]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:20:13.185 --> 01:20:18.230]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:23.974]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:20:23.974 --> 01:20:26.295]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:20:26.295 --> 01:20:31.098]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:20:31.098 --> 01:20:32.219]  And here's the best part.
[01:20:32.219 --> 01:20:35.281]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:20:35.281 --> 01:20:38.904]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:20:38.904 --> 01:20:42.106]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:20:42.106 --> 01:20:44.327]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:50.312]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:57.942]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:20:57.942 --> 01:21:00.346]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:21:00.748 --> 01:21:04.671]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:21:04.671 --> 01:21:05.772]  Are you gaining fat?

[01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:29.231]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[01:22:29.981 --> 01:22:31.222]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.222 --> 01:22:35.785]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:41.589]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:45.231]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.231 --> 01:22:47.953]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.953 --> 01:22:53.016]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.016 --> 01:22:53.257]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.257 --> 01:22:54.658]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.702 --> 01:23:01.983]  Have you ever seen a U.S.
[01:23:01.983 --> 01:23:05.826]  postage stamp featuring Abraham Lincoln, Ben Franklin, or George Washington?
[01:23:05.826 --> 01:23:09.629]  If you're into stamp collecting, you know it's a fun, affordable hobby.
[01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:16.555]  America's leading stamp dealer is the Mystic Stamp Company, and they want you to have their free 140-page color catalog.
[01:23:16.555 --> 01:23:20.298]  Go to mysticstampad.com, the website of the Mystic Stamp Company.

[01:23:43.525 --> 01:23:44.625]  Call 800-433-7811 or go to mysticstampad.com.
[01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:44.865]  That's 800-433-7811.
[01:23:50.367 --> 01:23:50.907]  We're good to go.
[01:24:12.888 --> 01:24:19.412]  So, it's time for the other candidates to step down like Michelle Bachman did.
[01:24:19.412 --> 01:24:20.673]  They're not going to win.
[01:24:20.673 --> 01:24:23.175]  It's between Ron Paul and Mitt Romney.
[01:24:23.175 --> 01:24:26.857]  The only person challenging Mitt Romney is Ron Paul.
[01:24:26.857 --> 01:24:35.663]  Now, the prostitute media is doing something that's illogical, if you think logically, but may work on some sheeple.
[01:24:35.663 --> 01:24:36.684]  They're doing a couple things.
[01:24:37.762 --> 01:24:48.822]  They're saying everybody should stay in, because it's still an open race, but Ron Paul can't win and should drop out, because there's no way he'll ever be the nominee.
[01:24:49.861 --> 01:24:53.022]  No, he's in second place, undisputed across the country.
[01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:54.903]  Came in second place in New Hampshire.
[01:24:54.903 --> 01:24:57.144]  Third place, and there was a lot of chicanery.
[01:24:57.144 --> 01:24:59.044]  Probably won in Iowa.
[01:24:59.044 --> 01:25:05.066]  That's even come out in the local papers that, oh yeah, Karl Rove reported, you know, the people didn't show up with the votes.
[01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:09.408]  We just decided Santorum, you know, went up six points or whatever.
[01:25:09.408 --> 01:25:12.549]  And so Ron Paul's out there saying, no, it's time for all of you to drop out.
[01:25:12.549 --> 01:25:14.350]  And all those other folks are anti-Romney.
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:17.831]  They're going to go to Paul, and he's going to have more points than Romney.
[01:25:19.522 --> 01:25:20.983]  If you break down the numbers.
[01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:32.133]  And in different polls, he beats Obama by more points than Mitt Romney does.
[01:25:32.133 --> 01:25:35.296]  And I don't trust Mitt Romney as far as I could throw him.
[01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:40.480]  I mean, he is a globalist, who is for the socialist healthcare, for all the rest of the garbage.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.502]  Now he'll tell you what you want to hear.
[01:25:42.502 --> 01:25:45.104]  But, I mean, haven't you been conned before?
[01:25:45.104 --> 01:25:46.906]  I mean, the idiots.
[01:25:47.967 --> 01:25:52.252]  That said that Obama was like Jesus, remember that?
[01:25:52.252 --> 01:25:55.435]  And he was going to save us, and he was the one.
[01:25:55.435 --> 01:25:58.159]  And Pepsi got behind it.
[01:25:58.159 --> 01:26:01.903]  I mean, haven't you learned, people, that all this hype is just that hype?
[01:26:01.903 --> 01:26:03.344]  It's hot air.
[01:26:03.344 --> 01:26:07.589]  Here's Ron Paul talking about nipping on Mitty's heels.
[01:26:07.589 --> 01:26:07.970]  Here it is.
[01:26:08.456 --> 01:26:26.091]  I called Governor Romney a short while ago, before he gave his talk, and congratulate him, because he certainly had a clear-cut victory, but we're nibbling at his heels!
[01:26:26.091 --> 01:26:27.972]  But there was another victory tonight.
[01:26:27.972 --> 01:26:32.656]  He had a victory, but we have had a victory for the cause of liberty tonight!
[01:26:32.656 --> 01:26:32.956]  Yes!
[01:26:32.956 --> 01:26:37.240]  That's right.
[01:26:38.482 --> 01:26:46.485]  There is no doubt, there is no doubt that this whole effort that we are involved in will not go unnoticed.
[01:26:46.485 --> 01:26:51.848]  Let me tell you.
[01:26:51.848 --> 01:26:54.429]  You only lose when you don't get in the game.
[01:26:54.429 --> 01:26:56.190]  You only lose when you give up.
[01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:56.770]  Don't you get it?
[01:26:58.601 --> 01:27:03.405]  Everybody's learning about the New World Order and torture and wars in the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:03.405 --> 01:27:20.417]  This is... I mean, if the Bilderberg Group in 2006 was pulling their hair out about the Liberty Movement growing, the Militia Movement, the Patriot Movement, Ron Paul was just mentioned in there as one of the main constellation points.
[01:27:20.417 --> 01:27:20.718]  Now,
[01:27:22.651 --> 01:27:25.893]  It's just, it's surging, it's growing.
[01:27:25.893 --> 01:27:30.816]  If you look at the exponential growth curve, it's just stratospheric.
[01:27:30.816 --> 01:27:38.640]  And we've all got a responsibility, those of us that represent liberty and freedom and dignity in the Republic.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:44.444]  We really carry with us the remnant of what made America great.
[01:27:44.444 --> 01:27:51.708]  We carry with us really the Republic's family jewels.
[01:27:55.307 --> 01:28:00.270]  We were the example to live by for freedom worldwide.
[01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:02.111]  America was admired.
[01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:03.912]  We were the good guys.
[01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:06.533]  We weren't perfect, but compared to everybody else, we were the good guys.
[01:28:06.533 --> 01:28:07.674]  We were the excellers.
[01:28:07.674 --> 01:28:09.255]  We had the highest test scores.
[01:28:09.255 --> 01:28:10.696]  We had the toughest men.
[01:28:10.696 --> 01:28:12.277]  We had the most inventors.
[01:28:12.277 --> 01:28:14.038]  We were the people that never gave up.
[01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:19.421]  We were the ornery folks that didn't put up with government tyranny and didn't get bossed around by bureaucracy.
[01:28:19.421 --> 01:28:24.464]  Everywhere else where humanity was bent over under the whip of bureaucrats and paramilitary police.
[01:28:27.099 --> 01:28:34.020]  We were the people that were willing to go to the end, willing to die.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.981]  That iconic image worldwide.
[01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:37.761]  And now look at us.
[01:28:37.761 --> 01:28:38.941]  We were taken over.
[01:28:38.941 --> 01:28:42.302]  We were fed poison, cultural and physical poison.
[01:28:42.302 --> 01:28:44.462]  We were beguiled.
[01:28:44.462 --> 01:28:50.104]  But now the giant is poisoned and sick, but still incredibly powerful.
[01:28:50.104 --> 01:28:54.364]  And anytime it wants to, it can break the trance and stand.
[01:28:54.364 --> 01:28:56.285]  And the giant's now awake at the edge of the bed.
[01:28:57.355 --> 01:29:00.256]  In an incredible hangover.
[01:29:00.256 --> 01:29:04.017]  Little globalist demons crawling all over it, trying to suck the blood out of it.
[01:29:04.017 --> 01:29:08.219]  But just the fact that it's woken up, the heart's beating, the strength is reviving it.
[01:29:08.219 --> 01:29:11.280]  And we are there breathing life into it.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.541]  And worldwide, people see Ron Paul.
[01:29:13.541 --> 01:29:14.881]  They see the Liberty Movement.
[01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:16.042]  They see the common sense.
[01:29:16.042 --> 01:29:17.342]  They see the goodness.
[01:29:17.342 --> 01:29:23.764]  And there's Ron Paul-type movements all over the world.
[01:29:23.764 --> 01:29:25.065]  To rediscover true freedom.
[01:29:27.418 --> 01:29:32.942]  This is a revolution of ideas, and ideas are bulletproof.
[01:29:32.942 --> 01:29:35.884]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:29:35.884 --> 01:29:39.767]  The New World Order asks us to kneel and be their slaves.
[01:29:39.767 --> 01:29:44.710]  All Ron Paul is asking, and all I'm asking, is that you stand.
[01:29:44.710 --> 01:29:46.552]  Is that cruel?
[01:29:46.552 --> 01:29:48.033]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[01:29:50.475 --> 01:29:54.406]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.406 --> 01:29:57.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.205 --> 01:30:06.786]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:35.365 --> 01:30:39.666]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:45.607]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:49.168]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.168 --> 01:30:51.148]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:51.148 --> 01:30:52.268]  It's here.

[01:31:03.767 --> 01:31:09.074]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:09.074 --> 01:31:10.617]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.617 --> 01:31:19.388]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:27.650]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:35.652]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.652 --> 01:31:40.893]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:31:49.039 --> 01:31:51.423]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:53.546]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:32:00.771 --> 01:32:04.915]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:32:04.915 --> 01:32:07.197]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[01:32:07.197 --> 01:32:09.059]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:32:09.059 --> 01:32:12.022]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[01:32:12.022 --> 01:32:18.508]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:32:19.008 --> 01:32:19.369]  We're good to go.
[01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:38.770]  We're good.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.461]  Alright, well there's pure Americana Elvis.
[01:33:18.461 --> 01:33:25.424]  Nowadays Americana is evil, so I guess Elvis is with Al-Qaeda.
[01:33:25.424 --> 01:33:26.845]  I guess all of us are.
[01:33:26.845 --> 01:33:30.906]  Except for the folks that actually run Al-Qaeda up there at the Pentagon.
[01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:50.200]  Here are some of the quotes out of Barry Goldwater's book, and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:55.183]  Here's page 284 of No Apologies.
[01:33:55.183 --> 01:33:58.606]  The Trilateral Commission, I already read this earlier, but I'll get to the new ones.
[01:33:58.606 --> 01:34:08.133]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[01:34:09.528 --> 01:34:15.270]  All this is to be done in the interest of creating a more peaceful, more productive world community.
[01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:20.131]  Throughout my public life and in these pages, I have refrained from judging other men's motives.
[01:34:20.131 --> 01:34:25.533]  I have no hesitancy about judging their wisdom and the results of the actions taken.
[01:34:26.874 --> 01:34:29.196]  And he goes on to talk about how it's really evil.
[01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:30.797]  Page 285.
[01:34:30.797 --> 01:34:39.903]  What the Trilateralists truly intend is the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation-states involved.
[01:34:39.903 --> 01:34:52.391]  They believe the abundant materialism they propose to create will overwhelmingly... existing differences, and managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.640]  Here's another one, page 286.
[01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.871]  CFR Interlateral Commission.
[01:35:25.871 --> 01:35:40.174]  Continuing, page 299, we have arrived at our present position of peril in a world and at home because our leaders have refused to tell us the truth unless we, who profess to believe in freedom, wake up.
[01:35:40.174 --> 01:35:44.735]  The world is headed for a period of slavery.
[01:35:44.735 --> 01:35:45.675]  He wrote this back in the 1970s, 1979.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:57.266]  That's excerpts of the No Apologies, The Personal and Political Memoirs of the United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater, 1979.
[01:35:57.266 --> 01:36:06.572]  And a lot of people think, well, if the TV says that that's establishment, I'll go with that and I'll be establishment.
[01:36:06.572 --> 01:36:15.499]  No, you're following the edicts and the ideas of radical globalists who are anti-human and who see you as dog meat.
[01:36:17.614 --> 01:36:21.236]  And they've been very good at making it all look very reasonable what they're doing.
[01:36:21.236 --> 01:36:24.999]  Alright, I'm going to your calls and a bunch of other news.
[01:36:24.999 --> 01:36:29.021]  The head of Stuart Rhodes joining us to break down what's happening.
[01:36:29.021 --> 01:36:37.066]  Constitutional law scholar, Yale graduate, top of his class, Army paratrooper, Ranger, the whole nine yards.
[01:36:37.066 --> 01:36:38.246]  Worked for Ron Paul for many years.
[01:36:38.246 --> 01:36:40.388]  We'll get his take on Ron Paul up front.
[01:36:40.388 --> 01:36:43.390]  Then we'll get into his thesis paper.
[01:36:45.589 --> 01:36:46.949]  I don't know.
[01:37:11.394 --> 01:37:12.935]  A, everything I promote and plug.
[01:37:12.935 --> 01:37:17.977]  When you hear me intro something, you hear me promoting something with my voice, it means I believe in it.
[01:37:17.977 --> 01:37:23.299]  Now, you can take that for what it's worth, but whatever I promote, I'm into.
[01:37:23.299 --> 01:37:33.004]  And you heard a caller a few days ago, I meant to elaborate on it, and I didn't say, Alex, I have your bumper sticker, InfoWars.com, on my car.
[01:37:34.304 --> 01:37:49.698]  And everywhere I go, the police are fans, because there's a lot of good police out there, and people at the university are listeners, and he said, you know, every four or five people I talk to, at least one of them's a listener now, you're really starting to reach critical mass.
[01:37:49.698 --> 01:37:58.485]  Yeah, not only do you support us when you buy an InfoWars.com t-shirt, you're going to meet like-minded people.
[01:37:58.485 --> 01:37:59.947]  You want to meet people that are into liberty?
[01:38:01.516 --> 01:38:03.557]  Wear an InfoWars.com shirt.
[01:38:03.557 --> 01:38:07.539]  Have an InfoWars.com bumper sticker.
[01:38:07.539 --> 01:38:08.939]  Have an In The Fed sticker.
[01:38:08.939 --> 01:38:13.221]  And we sell a whole bunch of bumper stickers at cost, by the way.
[01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:16.323]  We've just gotten some new bumper stickers in, some new designs, by the way.
[01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:19.885]  So, they're at cost, what it cost us.
[01:38:19.885 --> 01:38:24.867]  In fact, they tried to get me to raise the prices a little bit back in the warehouse, because they're like, you're actually losing money on this.
[01:38:26.169 --> 01:38:30.710]  But the point is, I want to get this information out, and that's how we reach new people.
[01:38:30.710 --> 01:38:33.631]  That's why when I say, when you buy my films, get them, make copies.
[01:38:33.631 --> 01:38:40.133]  Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, the film I produced, Invisible Empire, which is excellent.
[01:38:40.133 --> 01:38:41.633]  Give them to people.
[01:38:41.633 --> 01:38:43.994]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:38:43.994 --> 01:38:48.275]  Again, we have this idea that we all have to beat the New World Order by ourselves overnight.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:57.422]  When there's not some dragon we can't corner in some cave and stab it in the heart, well, then I'm not going to do it.
[01:38:57.422 --> 01:39:05.664]  Civilizations are built and tyrannies are defeated inch by inch, centimeter by centimeter, millimeter by millimeter.
[01:39:05.664 --> 01:39:11.786]  And right now, we're gaining thousands of miles on the New World Order.
[01:39:11.786 --> 01:39:17.208]  I mean, we are... The New World Order is stalling and trying to get everything done right now because it's...
[01:39:18.635 --> 01:39:19.636]  Running out of grease.
[01:39:19.636 --> 01:39:24.439]  It's like a big metal machine that's errrrrr... seizing up.
[01:39:24.439 --> 01:39:26.721]  Meanwhile, oil's pumping through us.
[01:39:26.721 --> 01:39:31.084]  I mean, we're getting more and more powerful.
[01:39:31.084 --> 01:39:32.625]  Stronger and stronger.
[01:39:32.625 --> 01:39:37.709]  That's why the cornered rat, that still has a lot of power, is going to pull out all the stops.
[01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:40.411]  I mean, we are at an amazing threshold.
[01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:46.115]  Flashpoint, jump point, crossroads, tectonic shift, quickening, climax.
[01:39:48.168 --> 01:39:50.210]  Acceleration.
[01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:53.772]  Great time of change.
[01:39:53.772 --> 01:39:54.713]  Did I say quickening?
[01:39:54.713 --> 01:39:56.274]  I mean, it's here.
[01:39:56.274 --> 01:40:00.417]  And it's just going to get wilder, as I keep telling you.
[01:40:00.417 --> 01:40:05.241]  We're going to look back on 2012 as a cakewalk.
[01:40:05.241 --> 01:40:10.684]  But in all that adversity comes great opportunity.
[01:40:10.684 --> 01:40:15.508]  I mean, we were dying because we were living in slow death, slow New World Order.
[01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:17.203]  Hidden.
[01:40:17.203 --> 01:40:19.404]  Now it's coming out in the open.
[01:40:19.404 --> 01:40:26.926]  Now it's saying, okay, we tried to be cloaked to sell our agenda, but that didn't work, so now we're uncloaking.
[01:40:26.926 --> 01:40:28.866]  Look at how scary we are.
[01:40:28.866 --> 01:40:30.787]  Look at all the murders and death and evil.
[01:40:30.787 --> 01:40:31.927]  Aren't you intimidated?
[01:40:31.927 --> 01:40:38.689]  And people are going, no, I'm not intimidated.
[01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:45.091]  I mean, really at the moment that they uncloak themselves as the vampire-like, psychic vampire globalists they are?
[01:40:46.007 --> 01:40:48.168]  Has they unclogged themselves?
[01:40:48.168 --> 01:40:53.012]  Are we supposed to now all just run under the table?
[01:40:53.012 --> 01:40:54.192]  Or get mad at the messenger?
[01:40:54.192 --> 01:40:54.453]  No!
[01:40:54.453 --> 01:40:57.575]  This is what you were born to do.
[01:40:57.575 --> 01:40:59.696]  You were born to be here now.
[01:40:59.696 --> 01:41:09.443]  You're part of a generation that's seeing shifts in technology and culture and computing power that is going to just exponentially get wilder.
[01:41:09.443 --> 01:41:10.263]  We are in
[01:41:12.742 --> 01:41:22.646]  Evolved in an amazing time and it's just going to get wilder and crazier and stranger and more fantastical by the minute.
[01:41:22.646 --> 01:41:26.888]  And you notice some people are waking up to that and going, wow, others are getting more complacent.
[01:41:26.888 --> 01:41:28.809]  Things are boring.
[01:41:28.809 --> 01:41:30.069]  Nothing's going on.
[01:41:30.069 --> 01:41:32.110]  I'm sick of my iPad.
[01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:33.470]  Those are zombies, folks.
[01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:34.691]  Totally in the matrix.
[01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:50.068]  I mean this morning I walked out on the back porch and it was a frosty morning, giant moon in the sky, champagne sunrise, cup of coffee, 6 a.m.
[01:41:50.068 --> 01:41:55.130]  and I was just like, wow!
[01:41:55.130 --> 01:42:07.755]  The leafless black woods, the hill, watched a horse and a donkey in the ranch across from me, nibbling at the
[01:42:09.133 --> 01:42:16.517]  Grass, heard coyotes howling, turkeys gobbling.
[01:42:16.517 --> 01:42:20.540]  It's unbelievable.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.641]  And you can walk out anywhere you want and see beauty.
[01:42:22.641 --> 01:42:35.869]  But one place you really see it is in the electric inquisitiveness and goodness of a child's eyes.
[01:42:39.713 --> 01:42:42.755]  And it is for the children that we do what we do.
[01:42:42.755 --> 01:42:45.137]  So don't let this train pass you by.
[01:42:45.137 --> 01:42:52.242]  Don't sit on the sidelines while the greatest events in human history are just beginning to unfold.
[01:42:52.242 --> 01:42:55.504]  It's like the concert, and you've heard them warming up.
[01:42:55.504 --> 01:43:05.852]  And it's an interesting sound, but suddenly the music is coming alive with the opening ballad.
[01:43:08.345 --> 01:43:28.345]  And this whole thing is about to begin, the good, the bad, the ugly, all of it in this huge passion play with real people on the stage, a planet, hurtling through space at tens of thousands of miles an hour, circling a giant ball of flame.
[01:43:29.446 --> 01:43:44.337]  With the nebulas in the universe all around us, and our wives and our husbands and our grandparents and our ancestors before, and streaming out our progeny to come.
[01:43:44.337 --> 01:43:45.578]  It's unbelievable!
[01:43:45.578 --> 01:43:53.144]  I mean, and these idiots don't know that there isn't a creator of all this.
[01:43:53.144 --> 01:43:55.926]  They can't resonate with it and feel it.
[01:43:58.775 --> 01:44:00.737]  You know what's good?
[01:44:00.737 --> 01:44:02.198]  You know what's bad?
[01:44:02.198 --> 01:44:09.043]  You know the law of the universe?
[01:44:09.043 --> 01:44:11.685]  You know ugly from beauty?
[01:44:11.685 --> 01:44:14.487]  You know innocence from corruption?
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.700]  Alright, I'm going to stop preaching.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:26.982]  The point is that I was going to do a short plug for waking people up, books, videos, and you support us, InfoWars.com, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:44:26.982 --> 01:44:32.483]  And we're running that special for a few more weeks where you can get all of my films for 70 plus percent off the Everything Special.
[01:44:32.483 --> 01:44:34.404]  Great weapon in the Info War.
[01:44:34.404 --> 01:44:39.825]  We've also got a bunch of new films we're carrying, like A Noble Lie, the Oklahoma City Inside Job movie.
[01:44:39.825 --> 01:44:42.946]  Excellent to expose the vampires.
[01:44:42.946 --> 01:44:43.806]  And, uh, yeah.
[01:44:44.898 --> 01:44:45.258]  There it is.
[01:44:45.258 --> 01:44:46.159]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[01:44:46.159 --> 01:44:48.860]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:52.242]  Rocco, thank you for holding from North Carolina.
[01:44:52.242 --> 01:45:00.666]  Instead of how about them bears or how about them cowboys, how about that Ron Paul?
[01:45:00.666 --> 01:45:02.607]  They keep saying he can't win.
[01:45:02.607 --> 01:45:04.587]  The underdog is rising, rising.
[01:45:04.587 --> 01:45:05.328]  What do you say about that?
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.321]  Oh, we know.
[01:45:08.321 --> 01:45:12.883]  We know some people are talking the truth, but we're not going to hear that in corporate media.
[01:45:12.883 --> 01:45:17.506]  It may be a coincidence, Alex, but I don't know if you visited WorldNetDaily's website.
[01:45:17.506 --> 01:45:19.627]  It really looks like InfoWars now.
[01:45:19.627 --> 01:45:22.568]  They redid the whole website, but the content doesn't.
[01:45:22.568 --> 01:45:26.290]  They ran a hit piece yesterday called Ron Paul Solinsky.
[01:45:27.094 --> 01:45:28.194]  It was terrible.
[01:45:28.194 --> 01:45:30.936]  The good thing is, though, they did put up comments.
[01:45:30.936 --> 01:45:32.776]  They didn't take them down, you know, people.
[01:45:32.776 --> 01:45:34.597]  I was putting up links and stuff.
[01:45:34.597 --> 01:45:39.519]  But again, it looks like InfoWars, but the content's not quite there yet.
[01:45:39.519 --> 01:45:53.404]  Well, I mean, Joseph Farah overall walks a line between being kind of neocon, you know, pro-war, because he is Lebanese, and I know the Lebanese Christians have been persecuted, and that does happen.
[01:45:53.404 --> 01:45:55.105]  And so, you know, he is
[01:45:56.331 --> 01:45:57.952]  Kind of a lacudenic.
[01:45:57.952 --> 01:46:02.815]  He's super pro what you call right-wing Israel.
[01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:04.636]  But it's left-wing, right-wing.
[01:46:04.636 --> 01:46:06.697]  It's all made up.
[01:46:06.697 --> 01:46:10.500]  And then separately, they do a lot of anti-globalist stuff over the years.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:14.082]  I think overall, WorldNetDaily has done a good job.
[01:46:14.082 --> 01:46:15.303]  They've done more harm than good.
[01:46:17.678 --> 01:46:23.420]  Obviously, people are too weak-minded, a lot of them, to really face the truth.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.160]  I mean, the truth is horrific.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:30.762]  I mean, I was on more radio stations 12 years ago or 11 years ago than I am now.
[01:46:30.762 --> 01:46:34.343]  Now I'm on a lot bigger ones and stuff, so we have exponentially more listeners.
[01:46:35.063 --> 01:46:38.485]  We're on XM and a lot of other stuff, and number one on the internet.
[01:46:38.485 --> 01:46:41.948]  But, you know, stations were calling when I was saying 9-11's an inside job.
[01:46:41.948 --> 01:46:43.389]  I mean, I saw Building 7 blow up.
[01:46:43.389 --> 01:46:44.569]  I had all the evidence.
[01:46:44.569 --> 01:46:47.211]  They were calling saying, and they all thought I was going to stop.
[01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:50.913]  They said, tell Mr. Jones that, you know, he's going to stop that or he won't be on next week.
[01:46:50.913 --> 01:46:52.735]  And I said, well, just tell him sorry.
[01:46:52.735 --> 01:46:54.296]  I'm not going to stop.
[01:46:54.296 --> 01:46:56.057]  And I said, if you've got a problem with that, Ted,
[01:46:58.325 --> 01:46:59.106]  I'll just leave.
[01:46:59.106 --> 01:47:01.188]  And he said, no, no, I'm going to back your First Amendment.
[01:47:01.188 --> 01:47:02.610]  I'm not saying you should stop.
[01:47:02.610 --> 01:47:04.172]  We're just getting all these calls.
[01:47:04.172 --> 01:47:06.494]  And I called a few of the stations and I said, look, here's the evidence.
[01:47:06.494 --> 01:47:07.836]  They said, I don't want to hear it.
[01:47:07.836 --> 01:47:08.697]  I don't want to hear the evidence.
[01:47:08.697 --> 01:47:09.438]  I just can't have this.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:10.901]  I understand.
[01:47:10.901 --> 01:47:13.864]  I'm not trying to get in your face.
[01:47:13.864 --> 01:47:18.248]  I'm not trying to say I'm going to do what I want just to be naughty.
[01:47:18.248 --> 01:47:21.011]  I cannot sell out what I believe to be true.
[01:47:21.011 --> 01:47:22.272]  I cannot compromise that.
[01:47:22.272 --> 01:47:25.015]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:47:25.015 --> 01:47:28.278]  About 70% of the stations I was on dumped my show.
[01:47:28.278 --> 01:47:30.540]  Everybody was like, aha, look at Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.782 --> 01:47:33.683]  I didn't even think about it.
[01:47:33.683 --> 01:47:36.606]  I mean, it's not even, it's not debatable.
[01:47:36.606 --> 01:47:39.829]  Why even be on the air if you're not telling the truth?
[01:47:39.829 --> 01:47:44.593]  Why even be on the air if you're not going the hard places?
[01:47:44.593 --> 01:47:46.334]  But I'm sorry, go ahead sir.
[01:47:46.334 --> 01:47:50.698]  Hey, Alex, can I plug a website, Local Payshoots in North Carolina?
[01:47:50.698 --> 01:47:51.179]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:47:52.262 --> 01:47:54.724]  It's FoundersTruth.org.
[01:47:54.724 --> 01:47:56.865]  FoundersTruth.org.
[01:47:56.865 --> 01:48:06.411]  We're educating voters, trying to get voters to think in terms of the Constitution, and we're looking for candidates we can support that will support the Constitution locally.
[01:48:06.411 --> 01:48:09.573]  All right, buddy, I appreciate that.
[01:48:09.573 --> 01:48:10.754]  I've been really ranting here.
[01:48:10.754 --> 01:48:15.657]  Don in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:48:15.657 --> 01:48:16.418]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:16.418 --> 01:48:17.859]  Hey, buddy.
[01:48:17.859 --> 01:48:21.041]  Hey, just a couple quick points and then a question for you, explaining to the listeners.
[01:48:22.623 --> 01:48:23.664]  One thing is listen at work.
[01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:24.665]  I mean, this is so simple.
[01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:26.967]  I take my iPhone, I have a little speaker I plug into it.
[01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:30.150]  I'm only allowed to listen to break and lunch, but I take advantage of that.
[01:48:30.150 --> 01:48:33.073]  And I can't even tell you how many people that have woken up there.
[01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:35.235]  I'd have to sit there and try to tally it out.
[01:48:35.235 --> 01:48:36.316]  But at first they kind of laugh.
[01:48:36.316 --> 01:48:37.477]  They go, what are you listening to?
[01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:40.239]  And then pretty soon they're intrigued and they listen.
[01:48:40.239 --> 01:48:41.841]  So that's my point there.
[01:48:41.841 --> 01:48:46.305]  Work is a good advantage on your break time, freedom of speech.
[01:48:46.305 --> 01:48:47.146]  The second point is,
[01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:50.291]  With, uh, saying America is gone.
[01:48:50.291 --> 01:48:53.413]  Um, both my parents are gone, bless their souls.
[01:48:53.413 --> 01:48:59.115]  Um, and I can plaster their picture in every room all over every wall, and that doesn't bring them back.
[01:48:59.115 --> 01:49:02.857]  But I can believe in their idea, and I can revive that and make that relevant.
[01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:10.013]  Well, that's how you honor your ancestors, is by being a person that stands up against evil.
[01:49:10.013 --> 01:49:14.235]  I mean, and that's why they say, honor your forbearers, honor your family name.
[01:49:14.235 --> 01:49:15.236]  I mean, it's so simple.
[01:49:15.236 --> 01:49:17.177]  That's all we've got.
[01:49:17.177 --> 01:49:18.697]  And it's so valuable.
[01:49:18.697 --> 01:49:23.079]  And sell all that out for some plastic Hollywood crud?
[01:49:23.079 --> 01:49:25.861]  This fake culture?
[01:49:25.861 --> 01:49:26.761]  Exactly.
[01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:30.343]  You know, I miss them dearly, just like I do miss America.
[01:49:30.993 --> 01:49:32.695]  But I can keep them around.
[01:49:32.695 --> 01:49:33.536]  I can revive them.
[01:49:33.536 --> 01:49:35.739]  I can revive the idea, just like you said.
[01:49:35.739 --> 01:49:37.220]  It is that easy.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:44.849]  And my question is, explain to people, the delegates and the whole voting process, because I think everybody gets nervous and scared.
[01:49:44.849 --> 01:49:46.892]  Oh, no, Romney won New Hampshire.
[01:49:46.892 --> 01:49:47.232]  It's over.
[01:49:47.702 --> 01:49:55.430]  No, Ron Paul, especially if he has such a big ground force, can actually get even more delegates than even what his percentage showed.
[01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:57.091]  And he did that in Iowa, too.
[01:49:57.091 --> 01:50:01.275]  And people have got to go, they've got to be involved, and they've got to be delegates.
[01:50:01.275 --> 01:50:07.581]  That way, when they try to steal it from Ron Paul or whatever, coming up at the convention,
[01:50:08.862 --> 01:50:13.126]  Ron Paul people can basically do a lot of things.
[01:50:13.126 --> 01:50:15.487]  They could force Ron Paul into the VP.
[01:50:15.487 --> 01:50:19.090]  He probably wouldn't do that though with somebody like Romney and Romney wouldn't do that.
[01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:21.472]  And I mean who knows what could happen.
[01:50:21.472 --> 01:50:27.276]  They keep telling us he can't win so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:50:27.276 --> 01:50:29.798]  So that well we just expect he can't.
[01:50:29.798 --> 01:50:33.121]  But we see that we're on the verge of breaking that hoax right now.
[01:50:34.967 --> 01:50:37.369]  And we can make the hoax fully fall.
[01:50:37.369 --> 01:50:39.731]  We've blown big holes in it, but it hasn't fallen completely.
[01:50:39.731 --> 01:50:48.197]  It will then boomerang and backfire like judo on the globalist and will send Ron Paul over the top.
[01:50:48.197 --> 01:50:52.641]  Alright, we'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[01:50:52.641 --> 01:50:54.442]  And we've got a guest coming up in about 15 minutes.
[01:50:54.442 --> 01:50:54.862]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:02.812]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.812 --> 01:51:13.499]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:51:13.499 --> 01:51:20.704]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[01:51:20.704 --> 01:51:31.231]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:35.454]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:51:35.454 --> 01:51:41.618]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:51:41.618 --> 01:51:51.504]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:52.985]  The war is here.
[01:51:52.985 --> 01:51:54.887]  It's an info war.
[01:51:54.887 --> 01:51:56.648]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:52:01.711 --> 01:52:05.252]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:52:05.252 --> 01:52:11.274]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:52:11.274 --> 01:52:11.914]  Why?
[01:52:11.914 --> 01:52:16.256]  When you can be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[01:53:51.348 --> 01:53:52.288]  That's bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:53:55.931 --> 01:54:16.234]  Ron Paul, for 35 years or so, has been trying to wake people up about liberty.
[01:54:16.234 --> 01:54:18.835]  Then he got challenged to run for Congress.
[01:54:18.835 --> 01:54:23.016]  And look now where he is and what he's done.
[01:54:23.016 --> 01:54:25.516]  Think of what you're going to do by being involved.
[01:54:27.639 --> 01:54:31.983]  You gotta think big, but long term.
[01:54:31.983 --> 01:54:41.311]  And as long as you wake just a few people up, like the caller said earlier, and know that others are doing that, it's just exponential.
[01:54:41.311 --> 01:54:48.858]  And I talk to people in grocery stores, I talk to people at restaurants, I talk to people at the park.
[01:54:48.858 --> 01:54:53.482]  I mean, people come up to me, hey, who are already awake, I take time to talk to them.
[01:54:55.097 --> 01:54:58.778]  Because I appreciate the fact that they care about reality.
[01:54:58.778 --> 01:55:03.159]  I appreciate the fact that we're growing our numbers to face down this evil.
[01:55:03.159 --> 01:55:07.159]  Yeah, the government's passing laws saying it can arrest us and throw away the key.
[01:55:07.159 --> 01:55:11.180]  That just proves they're a bunch of crooks!
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:14.481]  It shouldn't scare us, because we already knew they were crooks.
[01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:18.902]  They're just making sure and confessing.
[01:55:18.902 --> 01:55:20.002]  Publicly confessing.
[01:55:21.636 --> 01:55:28.600]  You should be afraid of not facing them down and getting people ready to defeat these people.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.703]  You don't protect yourself from tyrants by running and hiding.
[01:55:32.703 --> 01:55:36.325]  They always run wild in countries where people roll over.
[01:55:36.325 --> 01:55:38.226]  We're not gonna roll over.
[01:55:38.226 --> 01:55:40.568]  You're like, yeah, but the public's a bunch of sheep.
[01:55:40.568 --> 01:55:44.770]  If 30, 40, 50% doesn't know how to brush their teeth, it's not our fault.
[01:55:44.770 --> 01:55:47.212]  They're not in the game.
[01:55:47.212 --> 01:55:50.334]  You go to a basketball game, there's 10,000 people in the stands.
[01:55:51.903 --> 01:55:59.025]  But there's a fraction of that on the floor.
[01:55:59.025 --> 01:56:01.965]  Okay?
[01:56:01.965 --> 01:56:03.606]  So I'm going to say it again, folks.
[01:56:03.606 --> 01:56:04.346]  Engage.
[01:56:04.346 --> 01:56:06.586]  Get involved.
[01:56:06.586 --> 01:56:07.707]  That's what it's going to take.
[01:56:07.707 --> 01:56:10.107]  Let's go to Gary in Ohio.
[01:56:10.107 --> 01:56:10.847]  Gary, you're on the air.
[01:56:10.847 --> 01:56:12.928]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:12.928 --> 01:56:13.508]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:13.508 --> 01:56:14.328]  What are you talking about?
[01:56:14.328 --> 01:56:15.248]  Let's get engaged.
[01:56:15.248 --> 01:56:17.529]  Let's do it right now.
[01:56:17.529 --> 01:56:21.470]  People who study the New World Order understand there's different factions within the New World Order.
[01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:28.216]  And if you study them very deeply, you understand there's one thing they can't lie about, and that's dates.
[01:56:28.216 --> 01:56:32.459]  You talked about Al-Qaeda being a Pentagon puppet before.
[01:56:32.459 --> 01:56:39.384]  Well, if you look at the date Al-Qaeda was established, August 11th, 1988, remember that number 11?
[01:56:39.384 --> 01:56:48.291]  Because the two biggest attacks in Al-Qaeda's history, what they're known for is the attack on 9-11, which around the world is known as 9-11, and the attack 911 days later in Madrid on 3-11.
[01:56:53.288 --> 01:57:00.554]  When you go around and you look at the New World Order, you notice they start planning attacks on certain days, Alex.
[01:57:00.554 --> 01:57:04.356]  And since you were born on the 11th, I'm sure you understand a little bit.
[01:57:04.356 --> 01:57:11.622]  You know, I know that the global controllers are totally obsessed with numerology and they really believe in it.
[01:57:11.622 --> 01:57:15.385]  I don't spend my time in things like that one way or the other.
[01:57:15.385 --> 01:57:17.807]  I mean, I know they believe in it, I know they think it's
[01:57:19.162 --> 01:57:26.904]  Sacred geometry and all this stuff, but there's also a lot of big dates where people think things are going to happen and they don't, but I know Madrid.
[01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:32.495]  Even came out in the Spanish papers, was a government operation.
[01:57:32.495 --> 01:57:34.155]  They were running an anti-terror drill.
[01:57:34.155 --> 01:57:36.036]  It turned out it was the cops that did it.
[01:57:36.036 --> 01:57:39.316]  And then they blew up some Patsy's in a building to blame it on them.
[01:57:39.316 --> 01:57:44.578]  I know 7-7, the head guy was MI6, who was running the Patsy's.
[01:57:44.578 --> 01:57:46.458]  It appears they were part of a drill.
[01:57:46.458 --> 01:57:47.358]  Some of them escaped.
[01:57:47.358 --> 01:57:48.719]  They were shot at Canary Wharf.
[01:57:48.719 --> 01:57:50.359]  That all came out in the news, but was buried.
[01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:55.713]  The British government actually arrested the guy that made a video about it, exposing it.
[01:57:55.713 --> 01:57:57.355]  Incredible.
[01:57:57.355 --> 01:57:59.697]  But it actually went over to London right after it happened to cover it.
[01:57:59.697 --> 01:58:02.239]  We cover it in my film Terror Storm.
[01:58:02.239 --> 01:58:03.780]  But that's basically it.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:11.166]  I mean, on the issue of dates, I just look at the facts of the case versus what dates they do it.
[01:58:11.166 --> 01:58:11.746]  I mean, look at 7-7, 3-11, 9-11.
[01:58:11.746 --> 01:58:12.187]  You're right.
[01:58:12.187 --> 01:58:13.388]  Anything else?
[01:58:18.564 --> 01:58:21.305]  Well, there's different ways of doing it.
[01:58:21.305 --> 01:58:23.867]  If you look at, like, not just 11, but 29.
[01:58:23.867 --> 01:58:24.727]  2 plus 9 equals 11.
[01:58:24.727 --> 01:58:30.730]  That's the day they crashed the Wall Street on 10-29-1929.
[01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:37.613]  If you look at last year, on your birthday, they ousted Mubarak on 2-11, and that's... Taylor, stay there.
[01:58:37.613 --> 01:58:41.715]  We'll come back and talk about it on the other side.
[01:58:41.715 --> 01:58:45.217]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.217 --> 01:58:47.118]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.138 --> 01:58:55.681]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.681 --> 01:58:56.601]  Number one.
[01:58:56.601 --> 01:59:00.024]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.024 --> 01:59:00.884]  Number two.
[01:59:00.884 --> 01:59:05.767]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.767 --> 01:59:06.508]  It's true.
[01:59:06.508 --> 01:59:11.391]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.391 --> 01:59:12.211]  Number three.
[01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:15.794]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.794 --> 01:59:19.496]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.696 --> 01:59:20.497]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.497 --> 01:59:23.260]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:26.944]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.944 --> 01:59:27.724]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.724 --> 01:59:31.889]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.889 --> 01:59:36.634]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.934 --> 01:59:41.097]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.097 --> 01:59:42.879]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.879 --> 01:59:45.140]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:47.743]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.743 --> 01:59:49.124]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:49.124 --> 01:59:55.068]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.919 --> 02:00:10.766]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.766 --> 02:00:12.348]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.348 --> 02:00:13.890]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:18.096]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.096 --> 02:00:22.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.912 --> 02:00:31.954]  Alright, Stuart Rhodes is coming up as a constitutional lawyer to look at the fact that you can't legalize tyranny.
[02:00:31.954 --> 02:00:34.554]  Look at the NDAA, Ron Paul, and more.
[02:00:34.554 --> 02:00:36.115]  We'll continue with your calls.
[02:00:36.115 --> 02:00:39.335]  Gary in Ohio, finishing up with you.
[02:00:39.335 --> 02:00:46.577]  Yes, I know going back to the Babylonians, Egyptians, you name it, they are obsessed with numerology.
[02:00:46.577 --> 02:00:49.978]  And you're certainly right about that, but you were going over the number 11 itself.
[02:00:51.857 --> 02:00:59.881]  Well, in certain factions within the New World Order, they're very obsessed with doing things on certain dates, because they understand, 11 deals with vibrational energy.
[02:00:59.881 --> 02:01:02.462]  Now, and it deals with emotional energy.
[02:01:02.462 --> 02:01:09.765]  You are an emotional person, you're born on the 11th, they do things on the 11th, 29 plus 9 equals 11, they get an emotional reaction out of people.
[02:01:09.765 --> 02:01:10.625]  So it's very deep.
[02:01:10.625 --> 02:01:14.827]  Now let me, you know a little bit about history, so let me just give you the story.
[02:01:14.827 --> 02:01:18.569]  On 1111, at exactly 11 o'clock, the Great War ended.
[02:01:19.437 --> 02:01:24.258]  They made sure they ended it on 11-11 at exactly 11 o'clock because you can't have peace on 11.
[02:01:24.258 --> 02:01:26.458]  Not possible.
[02:01:26.458 --> 02:01:29.879]  If you're into numerology, you'll understand this, but here's how the story goes.
[02:01:29.879 --> 02:01:35.120]  From that peace treaty, there was a country created called the Second Republic of Poland.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.021]  It was created on 11-11.
[02:01:37.021 --> 02:01:40.921]  What country was used to start World War II?
[02:01:40.921 --> 02:01:41.422]  Poland!
[02:01:41.422 --> 02:01:43.002]  Poland, yeah.
[02:01:43.002 --> 02:01:45.963]  Exactly, when the Russians and the Nazis invaded.
[02:01:45.963 --> 02:01:48.023]  Now, we're looking at World War III of Iran.
[02:01:48.726 --> 02:01:54.487]  Interesting enough, Iran, an Islamic Republic, was created on your birthday, Alex.
[02:01:54.487 --> 02:01:57.128]  2-11.
[02:01:57.128 --> 02:02:01.469]  You see how they put all the connecting pieces into place?
[02:02:01.469 --> 02:02:05.629]  JFK, he tried to break the back of the Federal Reserve on 6-4, 1963.
[02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:09.510]  If you add up the dates, 6-4-1-9-6-3, add up to 29, 2 plus 9 equals 11.
[02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:11.231]  He signed executive order 11-11 that day.
[02:02:11.231 --> 02:02:11.311]  1-1-1-1-0.
[02:02:18.376 --> 02:02:20.177]  He waited to that day to sign it.
[02:02:20.177 --> 02:02:24.421]  Because he was trying to use numerology to break the Federal Reserve's back.
[02:02:24.421 --> 02:02:26.362]  And by the way, JFK was born on the 29th.
[02:02:26.362 --> 02:02:27.443]  2 plus 9 equals 11.
[02:02:27.443 --> 02:02:30.085]  We can go into politics about this.
[02:02:30.085 --> 02:02:31.326]  Barack Obama, born 8-4 in 1961.
[02:02:31.326 --> 02:02:31.946]  8-4-1-9-6-1, add to the 29.
[02:02:31.946 --> 02:02:33.127]  2 plus 9 equals 11.
[02:02:33.127 --> 02:02:35.329]  Look at all the people from the Democratic side.
[02:02:35.329 --> 02:02:35.989]  Bill Clinton, born 8-19-1946.
[02:02:35.989 --> 02:02:36.750]  Add everything up.
[02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:37.010]  38-3-8-11.
[02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.630]  John McCain, born on the 29th.
[02:02:48.703 --> 02:02:54.745]  You see how they pick their puppets?
[02:02:54.745 --> 02:02:55.665]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:02:55.665 --> 02:03:00.987]  People who are born on the 11th and the 29th and are 11th, they have a certain level of charisma about them.
[02:03:00.987 --> 02:03:01.307]  Like you!
[02:03:01.307 --> 02:03:02.167]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:03:14.096 --> 02:03:23.160]  I'm not trying to laugh at you, it's just that the elite, I know are really into numerology, and I probably should study it more before I laugh.
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:29.202]  It's just, I mean, if this is true, then the people running things are just out of their minds.
[02:03:29.202 --> 02:03:32.783]  But I know that they make movies about what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:03:32.783 --> 02:03:34.004]  Take Fox TV.
[02:03:35.931 --> 02:03:51.330]  Had basically the exact same thing that really happened on 9-11 on TV six months before, where the government hijacks a jet by remote control to blame it on Al-Qaeda, to fly it into the World Trade Center to attack Afghanistan, but they use a drill to make NORAD stand down.
[02:03:52.737 --> 02:04:00.021]  And then I even talked to the host of the show and he said, yeah, the CIA approached us and would plant these plots on us.
[02:04:00.021 --> 02:04:05.685]  And then the question is, well, why did they want people to know what they were going to do before they did it?
[02:04:05.685 --> 02:04:09.087]  And the answer is, they're into it lesser magic.
[02:04:09.087 --> 02:04:17.632]  They believe that if they tell you what they're going to do before they do it, that gives it like good hoochoo or whatever when they really do it.
[02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:19.671]  And it's just, it's crazy.
[02:04:19.671 --> 02:04:21.633]  And then people say, well look, they're in control.
[02:04:21.633 --> 02:04:23.214]  There must be something to it.
[02:04:23.214 --> 02:04:26.277]  It's just that I know they're into all this stuff.
[02:04:26.277 --> 02:04:35.665]  I just don't spend a lot of time looking into it because it's a riddle wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a McDonald's cheeseburger package.
[02:04:35.665 --> 02:04:38.547]  I mean, I just don't know where it's going or what to do.
[02:04:38.547 --> 02:04:41.430]  I mean, it just gives me a headache.
[02:04:44.714 --> 02:04:48.457]  Oh man, I'm not really a very superstitious person, but I don't open umbrellas inside.
[02:04:48.457 --> 02:04:51.599]  I don't walk under ladders.
[02:04:51.599 --> 02:04:58.404]  I put my horseshoes, you know, feet standing up, and I do knock on wood.
[02:04:58.404 --> 02:04:59.024]  Why do I do that?
[02:05:03.086 --> 02:05:07.049]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:07.049 --> 02:05:15.916]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.916 --> 02:05:20.540]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:31.369]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.989 --> 02:05:41.491]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:46.933]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.933 --> 02:05:54.414]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.414 --> 02:05:57.175]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:06:02.313 --> 02:06:06.317]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.317 --> 02:06:09.581]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.581 --> 02:06:14.386]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.386 --> 02:06:20.753]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.753 --> 02:06:23.016]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.536 --> 02:06:23.836]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.836 --> 02:06:24.136]  Bernanke?
[02:06:24.136 --> 02:06:24.696]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.696 --> 02:06:26.117]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:26.117 --> 02:06:28.537]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.441 --> 02:06:49.730]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:58.840]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:00.953 --> 02:07:02.254]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.254 --> 02:07:07.838]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:07.838 --> 02:07:12.861]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:07:12.861 --> 02:07:18.425]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:07:18.425 --> 02:07:23.669]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:30.574]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:30.754 --> 02:07:31.874]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:31.874 --> 02:07:34.935]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:07:34.935 --> 02:07:38.556]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:38.556 --> 02:07:41.757]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:41.757 --> 02:07:43.978]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:43.978 --> 02:07:44.918]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:44.918 --> 02:07:45.318]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:45.318 --> 02:07:48.559]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:48.559 --> 02:07:50.319]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:08:02.287 --> 02:08:04.528]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.528 --> 02:08:10.031]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.031 --> 02:08:28.261]  Alright, I still haven't gotten to it, but it's the video of out in Los Angeles a sheriff's deputy punching a now on record a mentally handicapped woman because she dared to say, oh, you're the big man, tell him to get off the bus.
[02:08:28.261 --> 02:08:31.203]  And people said she got on, was very polite, didn't do anything wrong.
[02:08:32.453 --> 02:08:34.655]  So now beating up bag ladies is what's going on.
[02:08:34.655 --> 02:08:38.277]  And the cop comes over and gets in the guy's face who's videotaping it.
[02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:42.860]  And again, this just illustrates how this has become the norm.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:49.904]  And people watch this around the world, even in third world countries, where their police don't act like this and say, what's happened to America?
[02:08:49.904 --> 02:08:53.507]  The question is, what happened to the American people to just put up with this?
[02:08:54.187 --> 02:09:08.052]  Now Stuart Rhodes heads up Oath Keepers, he's a constitutional lawyer, worked in Ron Paul's staff as well, and of course a former army veteran, a paratrooper who was retired out of the military in a parachuting accident.
[02:09:08.052 --> 02:09:20.797]  And he wrote his thesis in college on the history of basically military dictatorships and America's role and history in that with Lincoln and Stanton and what brought about posse comitatus.
[02:09:21.809 --> 02:09:27.214]  So we're going to be discussing that history and now how it ties into NDAA.
[02:09:27.214 --> 02:09:41.647]  But then I will, before he leaves, I promise we'll get to Rob and Sean and many others that are listening on stations like WJOC 1490 AM in Tennessee.
[02:09:41.647 --> 02:09:44.069]  We'll talk to Sean and others that are holding.
[02:09:45.629 --> 02:09:54.695]  And I do have some other news I want to get to as well, but to give us a condensed history of it, because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it, Stuart Rhodes joins us.
[02:09:54.695 --> 02:09:58.978]  I thought that I would add one more point to this too.
[02:09:58.978 --> 02:10:07.064]  I shot a video, you can simply search the term for it, NDAA is a hoax, you cannot legalize tyranny.
[02:10:07.064 --> 02:10:11.587]  Now tyrants can criminally carry it out, if not resist it.
[02:10:11.587 --> 02:10:14.950]  Both through information warfare, the truth,
[02:10:16.622 --> 02:10:22.183]  And physically, if your back's against the wall.
[02:10:22.183 --> 02:10:26.324]  I mean, Hitler didn't have really the legal standing to go into Poland, but he did.
[02:10:26.324 --> 02:10:30.105]  Or to go into France, but he did, because he had people that would follow his criminal orders.
[02:10:30.105 --> 02:10:31.765]  Same thing with the redcoats.
[02:10:31.765 --> 02:10:38.287]  Same thing with white abolitionists who were hung by the hundreds for trying to free black slaves.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:46.245]  Their argument was, as a Christian, I don't believe that these people are animals and I think they're free souls and should be free.
[02:10:46.245 --> 02:10:52.990]  They call them kooks and nuts and lunatics, but in the end, their sacrifice came out on top and that's what scares evil.
[02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:55.792]  That's why I always want you to think it's invincible.
[02:10:55.792 --> 02:11:02.958]  And so, they might try to carry out secret arrest of citizens, disappearing us into black sites, black holes, but
[02:11:03.957 --> 02:11:12.666]  It only convicts the establishment as just as bad as we thought they were, and verifies everything we've said, and they're basically tattling on themselves.
[02:11:12.666 --> 02:11:18.211]  They're confessing in their hubris, in their attempt to intimidate people.
[02:11:18.211 --> 02:11:21.975]  They've gone from just lying about New World Order to going, yeah, you bet.
[02:11:21.975 --> 02:11:23.056]  Uh-huh.
[02:11:23.056 --> 02:11:24.317]  We're spying on patriots.
[02:11:24.317 --> 02:11:25.058]  Yeah, we'll arrest you.
[02:11:26.141 --> 02:11:27.742]  Yeah, we're getting ready for some new terror attacks.
[02:11:27.742 --> 02:11:28.703]  We're going to blame on you.
[02:11:28.703 --> 02:11:33.086]  I mean, Democrats are putting out all these policy reports saying, gee, Oklahoma sure helped us.
[02:11:33.086 --> 02:11:34.347]  A new one's coming.
[02:11:34.347 --> 02:11:35.708]  We're going to arrest everybody.
[02:11:35.708 --> 02:11:39.091]  I mean, that's even on Fox News.
[02:11:39.091 --> 02:11:41.993]  So now they've moved into kind of a cornered hissing.
[02:11:45.738 --> 02:11:50.040]  Mangy, you know, wolf in a corner snarling at us.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:52.221]  The problem is they've put us in a corner.
[02:11:52.221 --> 02:11:54.662]  So, there's no getting out of this without a fight.
[02:11:54.662 --> 02:11:56.923]  The question is what type of fight will it be?
[02:11:56.923 --> 02:12:03.525]  Do we work extra hard now to educate police and military that will be the enforcers of this where the rubber meets the road?
[02:12:03.525 --> 02:12:09.628]  Or do we just shoot our mouths off and pile up giant amounts of guns and just say, well, let them come get it?
[02:12:10.871 --> 02:12:16.456]  I'd rather work as hard as I can to avert this, and then if it comes, our numbers are that much greater.
[02:12:16.456 --> 02:12:19.559]  That's the only sensible course.
[02:12:19.559 --> 02:12:21.441]  And so you cannot legalize tyranny.
[02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:22.302]  It's very, very simple.
[02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:27.112]  And again, he's founder and director of Oath Keepers, served as U.S.
[02:12:27.112 --> 02:12:30.936]  Army paratrooper until disabled in a rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump.
[02:12:30.936 --> 02:12:34.280]  Former firearms instructor, former member of Ron Paul's D.C.
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:35.061]  staff.
[02:12:35.061 --> 02:12:40.607]  Stewart currently writes the monthly Enemy at the Gates column, or did for SWAT Magazine.
[02:12:40.607 --> 02:12:41.908]  He's a graduate of Yale Law School.
[02:12:43.083 --> 02:12:50.649]  Where his paper, Solving the Puzzle of Enemy Combatant Status, won Yale's Miller Prize for Best Paper in the Bill of Rights.
[02:12:50.649 --> 02:12:53.431]  And he also has taught at the U.S.
[02:12:53.431 --> 02:13:05.639]  Military History at Yale, was a Yale Research Scholar, and is also writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people, which has now happened, OathKeepers.org.
[02:13:05.639 --> 02:13:08.622]  Okay, Stuart, let's give people a snapshot of history.
[02:13:08.622 --> 02:13:09.602]  But first, let's get into
[02:13:11.263 --> 02:13:16.366]  My breakdown and would you like to elaborate on that or add anything to it?
[02:13:16.366 --> 02:13:17.887]  Well, I think you're correct.
[02:13:17.887 --> 02:13:20.528]  That's the response we have to have.
[02:13:20.528 --> 02:13:22.389]  I mean, we need to prepare for the very worst.
[02:13:22.389 --> 02:13:34.056]  And so, but on the way there, like you said, we have a very narrow window of opportunity to raise the awareness of the American people and to do all we can through peaceful means.
[02:13:34.056 --> 02:13:39.859]  And while we're doing that, the same way the founders did, they exhausted all their peaceful means, but they also
[02:13:41.087 --> 02:13:49.454]  rallied more people to the cause, won more people over, and steeled them up and hardened them, and got them ready for the confrontation.
[02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:51.996]  And that's what we have to do, both things.
[02:13:51.996 --> 02:14:03.145]  And so what I encourage people to do is go look at what Jefferson and Madison did in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, which were a gross violation of the First Amendment.
[02:14:03.445 --> 02:14:05.647]  They did two things at the same time.
[02:14:05.647 --> 02:14:07.008]  One, they nullified.
[02:14:07.008 --> 02:14:11.271]  Went to the states and said, you have an obligation to interpose and nullify.
[02:14:11.271 --> 02:14:16.074]  You said, anything contrary to the Constitution is null and void from inception.
[02:14:16.074 --> 02:14:17.355]  It is not law.
[02:14:17.355 --> 02:14:18.036]  It is nothing.
[02:14:18.636 --> 02:14:20.498]  So that's the attitude we have to have.
[02:14:20.498 --> 02:14:23.700]  We do not give it any recognition whatsoever.
[02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:29.184]  You can say they passed an unconstitutional, invalid statute, but it is not lawful.
[02:14:29.184 --> 02:14:30.565]  We do not recognize it.
[02:14:30.565 --> 02:14:31.966]  That's what Jefferson and Madison did.
[02:14:31.966 --> 02:14:38.090]  They didn't go to the federal courts and beg them to recognize that this was a gross violation of the First Amendment.
[02:14:38.090 --> 02:14:40.912]  They went to the state legislature and said, you have an obligation.
[02:14:41.312 --> 02:14:53.129]  Those who don't know, they tried to bring in tyranny just a few years after our country got on its feet and the original founders got together and said, lock and load, we're going to try to peacefully back them off, but if they don't, it's another war.
[02:14:54.167 --> 02:14:58.790]  Right, the Alien Sedition Acts criminalized speech.
[02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:07.396]  You had newspaper editors, reporters, and writers being arrested for criticizing the president, John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[02:15:07.396 --> 02:15:13.040]  And the Federalists were doing this during the kind of quasi-war with France.
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:19.905]  So throughout history, it's always during wartime that they try to convince you you must give up your liberty
[02:15:20.545 --> 02:15:21.966]  In the name of fighting the war.
[02:15:21.966 --> 02:15:29.832]  And so the Federalists, in the name of fighting the war against the French, the undeclared war against the French, tried to silence dissent.
[02:15:29.832 --> 02:15:33.114]  And so Jefferson and Madison, like I said, they did two things at once.
[02:15:33.114 --> 02:15:37.358]  They said there's null and void from inception in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions.
[02:15:37.358 --> 02:15:38.698]  The state stood up.
[02:15:38.698 --> 02:15:46.564]  But they also started a whole new political party and they swept the Federalists out of office in what's now called the Revolution of 1800.
[02:15:47.765 --> 02:15:52.129]  You know, Jefferson was elected president, and they swept all the Federalists out of Congress.
[02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:59.655]  And so that's what we need to do right now in response to this atrocious, unconstitutional, intolerable act.
[02:15:59.655 --> 02:16:01.096]  And history repeats itself.
[02:16:01.096 --> 02:16:09.083]  If we didn't have such fraud and modern mind control, undoubtedly he'd be the presumptive nominee, he would defeat Obama, and we would see a repeat.
[02:16:09.083 --> 02:16:11.926]  We're just in worse states than our founders were.
[02:16:12.642 --> 02:16:14.803]  Yeah, Ron Paul is Jefferson.
[02:16:14.803 --> 02:16:22.087]  Let me take off my Oathkeeper hat for a second and just say that as an individual, I endorse Ron Paul.
[02:16:22.087 --> 02:16:33.092]  As an individual veteran of combat arms and airborne, as a legal scholar, there is nobody else out there who is going to defend the Constitution like he will.
[02:16:33.092 --> 02:16:37.054]  All the rest of them would have been just like McCain, who wrote the NDAA.
[02:16:38.055 --> 02:16:40.138]  Obama has already committed treason.
[02:16:40.138 --> 02:16:41.900]  He's killing American citizens.
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:44.644]  He's declared himself an elected dictator, essentially.
[02:16:44.644 --> 02:16:49.772]  And the rest of them up there, Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, they'd all be the same.
[02:16:49.772 --> 02:16:51.575]  So, you know, this is your Jefferson.
[02:16:52.754 --> 02:16:56.296]  Ron Paul is the closest thing to a modern Jefferson there is.
[02:16:56.296 --> 02:16:57.717]  He's like Jefferson reincarnate.
[02:16:57.717 --> 02:17:05.922]  And if you don't vote for him, you are furthering us on that road to having no choice but to fight for our freedom again.
[02:17:05.922 --> 02:17:10.085]  Isn't it curious how many historians and scholars have noted that history repeats?
[02:17:10.085 --> 02:17:13.967]  I mean, it doesn't so much repeat as it rhymes.
[02:17:13.967 --> 02:17:16.008]  Who was it that said history rhymes?
[02:17:16.008 --> 02:17:18.690]  That was Mark Twain.
[02:17:18.690 --> 02:17:20.431]  I mean, it really does go in these cycles.
[02:17:21.598 --> 02:17:23.659]  Well, it does, and it's always warfare.
[02:17:23.659 --> 02:17:40.523]  If you look at after the Alien Sedition Acts, they put that genie back in the bottle, the peaceful revolution of 1800 took care of it, but then came the Civil War, and it was in the Civil War, in the name again of national security, that Lincoln became essentially an elected dictator.
[02:17:40.523 --> 02:17:49.426]  He imprisoned newspaper editors, he imprisoned congressmen, he even wrote an arrest warrant out for Chief Justice Taney when he
[02:17:51.044 --> 02:17:53.986]  He balked against his suspension of habeas corpus.
[02:17:53.986 --> 02:18:02.372]  So, you know, he just decided he was going to do whatever he wanted to do, and all of his supporters in the Republican Party, the original Republican Party, were all for it.
[02:18:02.372 --> 02:18:12.239]  And in the North, this is the precedent, this is the first time that the power of the President as Commander-in-Chief was used against the American people.
[02:18:12.239 --> 02:18:19.845]  He claimed the authority, much like Bush and Obama, he claimed the authority to apply the laws of war, not just to the
[02:18:20.385 --> 02:18:25.229]  The breakaway southern states that had seceded and become their own country.
[02:18:25.229 --> 02:18:28.531]  He also applied the laws of war to northerners.
[02:18:28.531 --> 02:18:35.156]  And the Supreme Court in 1866, in the ex parte Milligan case, ruled that unconstitutional.
[02:18:35.596 --> 02:18:38.118]  But that's a case that came after the war was over.
[02:18:38.118 --> 02:18:39.138]  And it doesn't matter, though.
[02:18:39.138 --> 02:18:46.163]  Whenever they're taking over states today, they always go back to what Lincoln did, which in the North was undoubtedly classical tyranny.
[02:18:46.163 --> 02:18:50.746]  I mean, I understand the more sophisticated nuances of the British manipulating the South and all of it.
[02:18:50.746 --> 02:18:52.487]  It's always a double game.
[02:18:52.487 --> 02:18:57.510]  But undoubtedly, then Stanton after that and executing people extrajudicially.
[02:18:57.510 --> 02:19:02.333]  And in modern times, they're pointing at that and saying they'll use it against us.
[02:19:03.186 --> 02:19:04.006]  Well, exactly.
[02:19:04.006 --> 02:19:10.730]  They sweep under the rug the fact that the Supreme Court ruled all of that completely unconstitutional.
[02:19:10.730 --> 02:19:16.733]  In Ex parte Milligan, in this case, it was the case of a man who was accused of violating the laws of war.
[02:19:16.733 --> 02:19:18.454]  He was a citizen of Indiana.
[02:19:18.454 --> 02:19:21.596]  He was a civilian, but he was accused of violating the laws of war.
[02:19:21.596 --> 02:19:28.119]  And Lincoln had detained 15,000 American Northerners under military jurisdiction, and he had tried
[02:19:28.937 --> 02:19:31.619]  Almost 5,000 of them by military tribunal.
[02:19:31.619 --> 02:19:33.401]  And this guy was one of those.
[02:19:33.401 --> 02:19:40.606]  And so they said, look, the laws of war apply to him, and therefore a military tribunal is all he's going to get.
[02:19:40.606 --> 02:19:43.088]  That was the argument of the government lawyers.
[02:19:43.088 --> 02:19:45.610]  And in fact, they said this of the Bill of Rights.
[02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:50.834]  They said, these in truth are all peace provisions of the Constitution.
[02:19:50.834 --> 02:19:55.878]  And like all other conventional and legislative laws and enactments, are silent amidst arms.
[02:19:56.178 --> 02:19:57.879]  Stay there, we're gonna be right back.
[02:19:57.879 --> 02:19:59.880]  Stuart Rose, we're gonna go back to that quote on the other side.
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:00.500]  This is key.

[02:21:32.328 --> 02:21:36.891]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.891 --> 02:21:42.715]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.715 --> 02:21:46.357]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:46.357 --> 02:21:49.179]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:22:34.295 --> 02:22:38.156]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[02:23:55.187 --> 02:23:56.609]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:24:08.669 --> 02:24:10.571]  Yeah, take a look out your window.
[02:24:10.571 --> 02:24:12.513]  There's a scene you need to catch.
[02:24:12.513 --> 02:24:15.076]  Yeah, sometimes Satan.
[02:24:36.282 --> 02:24:41.689]  Yeah, the New World Order says they're doing all this to keep us safe.
[02:24:41.689 --> 02:24:43.411]  But they're not doing that, are they?
[02:24:43.411 --> 02:24:50.540]  You know, Stewart, looking at history, and I want to continue here with you on the history, then look at what's happening with Ron Paul right now and take some calls.
[02:24:51.542 --> 02:24:54.243]  But tyrants behave the same as well.
[02:24:54.243 --> 02:24:58.285]  They always have to hire a bunch of people that'll follow any order.
[02:24:58.285 --> 02:25:03.788]  So then over a short period of time, the very worst gravitate into the positions of power.
[02:25:03.788 --> 02:25:13.813]  And so the tyranny degenerates quickly and always causes a rebellion against it because even the sheep are forced to stand up just for self-preservation.
[02:25:13.813 --> 02:25:14.414]  So there's a
[02:25:15.863 --> 02:25:26.712]  A wild frenzy that ensues and we're now seeing just government getting crazier and wilder and more arrogant and frothing by the moment.
[02:25:26.712 --> 02:25:29.854]  Please continue, you've gotten up to the Civil War.
[02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:39.142]  Right, in that case about the use of military tribunal against an American citizen in the North, the Supreme Court in 1866
[02:25:41.208 --> 02:25:45.372]  The government lawyers argued the exact same thing we're hearing now.
[02:25:45.372 --> 02:25:56.864]  They said, by the Constitution as originally adopted, no limitations were put upon the war-making and war-conducting powers of Congress and the President.
[02:25:56.864 --> 02:26:04.831]  And then as a fallback, they said, finally, if the military tribunal has no jurisdiction, the petitioner may be held as a prisoner of war.
[02:26:05.812 --> 02:26:06.393]  We're good to go.
[02:26:23.813 --> 02:26:30.000]  Yeah, if you've got such proof that somebody is aiding a foreign military, put the proof up!
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.622]  That's why we have trials!
[02:26:31.622 --> 02:26:32.443]  Oh no!
[02:26:32.443 --> 02:26:38.009]  Not only will we secretly arrest you, we'll never even have a public trial, and no one must know that we grabbed you!
[02:26:38.009 --> 02:26:40.772]  I mean, that's open tyranny right there!
[02:26:40.772 --> 02:26:42.254]  That's always the greatest threat!
[02:26:42.947 --> 02:26:50.330]  Well, the Constitution mandates in Article 3, Section 2, that all crimes must be tried by jury.
[02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:55.611]  And then Article 3, Section 3, defines the crime of treason.
[02:26:55.611 --> 02:27:01.113]  And it defines it as making war against the United States or aiding its enemies.
[02:27:01.113 --> 02:27:03.414]  That is the definition of treason.
[02:27:03.414 --> 02:27:05.775]  And so, today, they're circumventing
[02:27:06.215 --> 02:27:14.999]  That trial requirement, very plain text of the treason clause, and they're circumventing the Bill of Rights just like the Lincoln administration did.
[02:27:14.999 --> 02:27:16.340]  Well, let's take that plain reading.
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:21.563]  If you're waging war or aiding the enemies, the Congress is pretty much globalist run.
[02:27:21.563 --> 02:27:24.444]  They actually fit the original treason definition.
[02:27:24.444 --> 02:27:31.227]  They're waging war against our Bill of Rights Constitution, our free market, our private property, our sovereignty, our borders.
[02:27:31.227 --> 02:27:32.368]  They are the tyrants!
[02:27:32.968 --> 02:27:33.789]  Don't just say that.
[02:27:33.789 --> 02:27:35.510]  They are traitors.
[02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:37.371]  They are treasonous.
[02:27:37.371 --> 02:27:37.852]  Exactly.
[02:27:37.852 --> 02:27:43.355]  Well, they fit the exact definition of treason, making a war against the American people.
[02:27:43.355 --> 02:27:49.199]  They're asserting the power of the President to treat the American people exactly the same as if they were Iraqis.
[02:27:49.199 --> 02:27:50.500]  Because we're America.
[02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:54.943]  I see these newscasts where the government's getting ready to deal with their main threat, us, the American people.
[02:27:54.943 --> 02:27:55.403]  What?
[02:27:55.403 --> 02:27:56.924]  We're the government.
[02:27:56.924 --> 02:27:58.085]  We're the people.
[02:27:58.085 --> 02:28:00.347]  Romans 13, we're the government.
[02:28:00.347 --> 02:28:02.208]  Render unto us, it's our country.
[02:28:03.837 --> 02:28:08.019]  I want to read you what the Supreme Court had to say in 1866.
[02:28:08.019 --> 02:28:11.040]  They rejected completely that argument.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:25.107]  They said, even these provisions, the Bill of Rights, expressed in such plain English words that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, are now, after the lapse of more than 70 years, sought to be avoided.
[02:28:25.607 --> 02:28:47.692]  Those great and good men foresaw that troubleous times would arise when rulers and people would become restive under restraint and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper, and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril unless established by irreparable law.
[02:28:48.382 --> 02:28:49.862]  That's what the Bill of Rights is.
[02:28:49.862 --> 02:28:51.203]  It's irreparable law.
[02:28:51.203 --> 02:28:53.043]  They understood human nature.
[02:28:53.043 --> 02:28:57.504]  They understood that people can be driven by fear to give up their freedom.
[02:28:57.504 --> 02:29:00.004]  And that's why you have a Bill of Rights.
[02:29:00.004 --> 02:29:04.165]  It leaves it out of the reach of the people, even when they're afraid.
[02:29:04.165 --> 02:29:05.426]  And it's the highest level.
[02:29:05.426 --> 02:29:11.867]  Nothing can abridge it because it only enshrines inherent organic rights that are unalienable.
[02:29:12.711 --> 02:29:13.152]  That's right.
[02:29:13.152 --> 02:29:17.177]  And the Constitution would never have been ratified without the promise of the Bill of Rights.
[02:29:17.177 --> 02:29:21.163]  And when you read the preamble to the Bill of Rights, it tells you what its purpose is.
[02:29:21.163 --> 02:29:23.586]  It is to prevent disconstruction.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:30.641]  It is to prevent abuse of powers granted in the Constitution and prevent misconstruction.
[02:29:30.641 --> 02:29:33.722]  And yet, they willfully misconstrued it.
[02:29:33.722 --> 02:29:35.663]  They did it back then, they're doing it now.
[02:29:35.663 --> 02:29:42.764]  The Congress and the President are in open treason by the very constitutional definition.
[02:29:42.764 --> 02:29:46.725]  And of course they're engaged in other criminal activities like Fast and Furious.
[02:29:46.725 --> 02:29:49.786]  They are the enemy of America.
[02:29:50.697 --> 02:29:54.619]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.619 --> 02:30:01.481]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.481 --> 02:30:05.623]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[02:30:05.623 --> 02:30:09.764]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[02:30:09.764 --> 02:30:19.228]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:30:19.728 --> 02:30:19.948]  We're good.
[02:30:39.394 --> 02:30:39.895]  You may be arrested.
[02:31:05.382 --> 02:31:06.643]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.643 --> 02:31:10.565]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:10.565 --> 02:31:12.967]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.967 --> 02:31:18.670]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:24.914]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:25.334 --> 02:31:31.317]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:31.317 --> 02:31:35.499]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.499 --> 02:31:39.782]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.782 --> 02:31:45.725]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.725 --> 02:31:49.287]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:49.287 --> 02:31:51.268]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:51.268 --> 02:31:51.688]  It's here.

[02:32:13.283 --> 02:32:19.988]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:32:57.895 --> 02:32:58.676]  Got it.
[02:32:58.676 --> 02:32:59.557]  Others don't.
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:23.869]  Well, constitutional lawyer, Yale scholar, veteran, former Ron Paul staffer, founder of oathkeepers.org, Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[02:33:23.869 --> 02:33:28.013]  I want to get to some calls, Stuart, and I want to have you back on for a whole other interview on this subject.
[02:33:28.013 --> 02:33:33.579]  But let's continue with the history because these aren't just words we're saying here.
[02:33:33.579 --> 02:33:34.600]  We have a government.
[02:33:36.212 --> 02:33:56.343]  that is totally illegitimate and has been caught committing so many crimes it's it's dizzying for special interest profits and now they're openly selling shutting down free speech on the web and and checkpoints and TSA checkpoints, total federalization, tenth, ninth amendment violations.
[02:33:56.343 --> 02:33:59.265]  They're not just eating around the edges now they are in full
[02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:08.323]  Assault on the heart of every basic liberty, not even our Constitution or Bill of Rights, the finest example of it.
[02:34:08.323 --> 02:34:11.245]  They are burrowing into Magna Carta.
[02:34:11.245 --> 02:34:13.466]  They are annihilating just common sense.
[02:34:13.466 --> 02:34:17.449]  They are trying to manifest every even absurdist
[02:34:18.109 --> 02:34:25.034]  That's right, that they've created the second track exactly like was done in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia and unfortunately
[02:34:41.181 --> 02:34:44.163]  During the Civil War in the United States.
[02:34:44.163 --> 02:34:48.525]  But the Supreme Court put that genie back in the bottle in 1866.
[02:34:48.525 --> 02:34:52.427]  Lincoln opened the, let the genie loose of martial law.
[02:34:52.427 --> 02:34:54.068]  You know, use martial law.
[02:34:54.068 --> 02:34:55.889]  The Supreme Court ruled this.
[02:34:55.889 --> 02:34:57.029]  Here's what they said.
[02:34:57.029 --> 02:35:08.295]  No usage of war could sanction a military trial for any offense whatever of a citizen in civil life in no wise connecting with the military service.
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:14.126]  Congress could grant no such power and the honor of our national legislature be it said.
[02:35:14.126 --> 02:35:19.171]  It has never been provoked by the state of the country even to attempt its exercise.
[02:35:20.394 --> 02:35:22.055]  Even in the Civil War, the U.S.
[02:35:22.055 --> 02:35:27.156]  Congress didn't try to authorize military trial.
[02:35:27.156 --> 02:35:33.538]  So the current Congress has gone even further than what they did during the Civil War.
[02:35:33.538 --> 02:35:39.720]  So the court said, one of the plainest constitutional provisions was, therefore infringed
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:48.768]  When Milligan was tried by a court not ordained and established by Congress and not composed of judges appointed during good behavior.
[02:35:48.768 --> 02:35:53.273]  In other words, not an Article 3 court, not a jury trial.
[02:35:53.273 --> 02:35:57.357]  And so, and this is what happened then is precisely the same thing
[02:35:57.957 --> 02:36:01.879]  That's happening now, and it's also exactly what the Founders faced.
[02:36:01.879 --> 02:36:13.905]  You look at the Declaration of Independence, they list among the grievances is denial of jury trial, and also the attempt to impose upon them a jurisdiction foreign to their Constitution.
[02:36:13.905 --> 02:36:21.108]  And back then, what Parliament had done is they passed statutes that expanded the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Courts.
[02:36:21.824 --> 02:36:25.506]  Is a way to strip the colonists of their ancient right to jury trial.
[02:36:39.433 --> 02:36:43.496]  The pure, the pure precept that I'm the leader, I can do whatever I want.
[02:36:43.496 --> 02:36:49.220]  What happens as it becomes manifest that it is illegitimate, it is fraudulent.
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:56.586]  It's got a gaggle of criminals posing as media, deceiving and dissembling the truth over the public.
[02:36:56.586 --> 02:36:58.507]  They've seized the infrastructure.
[02:36:58.507 --> 02:37:01.409]  They're accelerating the dismantling of the country.
[02:37:01.409 --> 02:37:06.753]  They're demonizing Americans who actually know that they're the enemy and foreign and illegitimate.
[02:37:07.253 --> 02:37:23.471]  And it's all hurtling towards confrontation, and the enemy knows that we're now awake to them, and instead of just being hubris-filled, is scrabbling quickly to try to man the parapets against us as the economic collapse accelerates.
[02:37:24.878 --> 02:37:29.242]  Well, they understand it's a two-way window, like you've said for a long time.
[02:37:29.242 --> 02:37:31.684]  It goes both ways, it's a two-way window.
[02:37:31.684 --> 02:37:42.173]  They understand that the more extreme they get and the more illegitimate they get, the more the curtains pull back and we see the little man behind the curtain, we realize how illegitimate and fraudulent he is.
[02:37:42.173 --> 02:37:46.337]  And so, they're taking the mask off, but in many ways that's helping us.
[02:37:46.337 --> 02:37:49.380]  The NDAA is a gift to the freedom movement.
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:51.783]  I mean, they were already claiming these powers.
[02:37:51.783 --> 02:37:54.868]  Both Bush and Obama already used these powers.
[02:37:54.868 --> 02:38:01.698]  Bush detained two American citizens, Jose Padilla and Yasser Hamdi, and Obama just starts killing American citizens.
[02:38:01.698 --> 02:38:03.401]  So they're already doing it anyway.
[02:38:03.401 --> 02:38:04.823]  So I like the fact
[02:38:05.223 --> 02:38:12.628]  That they were brazen enough to put it right there in black and white in a congressional statute, because now it's waking Americans up.
[02:38:12.628 --> 02:38:13.569]  Finally!
[02:38:13.569 --> 02:38:19.133]  I mean, I've been saying this for, since 2001 I've been screaming about this, and it was hard to get anybody to listen to it.
[02:38:19.133 --> 02:38:22.595]  But now they understand that they are destroying the Bill of Rights.
[02:38:22.595 --> 02:38:24.177]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:38:24.177 --> 02:38:25.217]  It's right in their face.
[02:38:25.217 --> 02:38:27.479]  And so it's a tool for us to wake them up.
[02:38:28.855 --> 02:38:46.884]  But getting back to the history real quick, after that attempt to apply the laws of war, after that usage was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1866, it was never used again until 1942 during World War II by FDR.
[02:38:46.884 --> 02:38:49.986]  There were eight German saboteurs that came ashore.
[02:38:49.986 --> 02:38:51.447]  One of them claimed to be a U.S.
[02:38:51.447 --> 02:38:52.147]  citizen.
[02:38:52.147 --> 02:38:54.108]  They were captured and tried by tribunal.
[02:38:54.768 --> 02:38:55.208]  I don't
[02:39:15.385 --> 02:39:15.945]  of the
[02:39:34.813 --> 02:39:38.994]  They upturned the Ex parte Milligan decision in 1866.
[02:39:38.994 --> 02:39:43.996]  They totally ignored the treason clause and violated the Constitution grossly.
[02:39:43.996 --> 02:39:49.878]  And that is the precedent that after that was not used again until post 9-11.
[02:39:49.878 --> 02:39:57.320]  And that's the precedent Ex parte Cuaron that the Bush administration reached back to from 1942 and grabbed it and said, hey, look.
[02:39:57.801 --> 02:40:00.626]  We can do whatever we want, even to American citizens.
[02:40:09.876 --> 02:40:26.753]  And when you get all the internal documents and the MIAC and Homeland Security reports and all the rest of it, it's admitted, as you know, but for the audience and maybe new listeners, that it's all about conservatives, libertarians, patriots, oath keepers, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Alex Jones, filmmakers.
[02:40:27.714 --> 02:40:31.835]  It's clearly an attack on the American people, and they're training the police for this.
[02:40:31.835 --> 02:40:36.075]  None of it has to do with the Arab terrorist that they were first selling.
[02:40:36.075 --> 02:40:39.816]  So they always sell on an unpopular minority, just like Hitler did.
[02:40:39.816 --> 02:40:44.157]  Then it's expanded on to everyone, and it's just so transparent.
[02:40:44.157 --> 02:40:46.277]  We've got to get that message out.
[02:40:46.277 --> 02:40:52.158]  But I mean, constitutionally, obviously it's the 10th Amendment, 9th Amendment because of jurisdiction, and then it's the 4th Amendment.
[02:40:52.158 --> 02:40:56.639]  But all over the country now, they're having federally run, and there's a new one if you read the fine print.
[02:40:57.864 --> 02:40:59.627]  The Orange County Register is reporting on this.
[02:40:59.627 --> 02:41:00.908]  We can put it on screen.
[02:41:00.908 --> 02:41:04.774]  Police use a roadblock to gather serial killer information.
[02:41:04.774 --> 02:41:08.459]  In the last few months, three homeless have been stabbed in a town.
[02:41:08.459 --> 02:41:12.705]  So they go out on a highway, and it shows video of it, shut down the highway.
[02:41:13.795 --> 02:41:16.238]  And ask people if they saw anything.
[02:41:16.238 --> 02:41:18.061]  I mean, this is completely random.
[02:41:18.061 --> 02:41:19.623]  Makes no sense.
[02:41:19.623 --> 02:41:21.105]  And it's the feds running it.
[02:41:21.105 --> 02:41:27.693]  It turns out it's basically a TSA icebreaker of why they're setting up unconstitutional checkpoints.
[02:41:28.450 --> 02:41:30.351]  And that many other areas, they even dispense with that.
[02:41:30.351 --> 02:41:33.013]  They just actually just pull you out of your car and search it.
[02:41:33.013 --> 02:41:36.574]  But I mean, you can clearly see them testing the perch.
[02:41:36.574 --> 02:41:43.438]  You can see them, you know, really trying, oh, the Army's here to help search your car for alcohol.
[02:41:43.438 --> 02:41:45.299]  Oh, the Marines are here.
[02:41:45.299 --> 02:41:47.320]  You know, now we see the military on the streets.
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:55.585]  I mean, they're really, and that's the proof of the criminality, is that they're doing it incrementally by design to acclimate everyone involved.
[02:41:56.789 --> 02:41:57.489]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:57.489 --> 02:42:00.430]  Like you said, it was just like what they did in Nazi Germany.
[02:42:00.430 --> 02:42:07.692]  The Reichstag fire decree was the reaction to the burning of the legislature, and it was aimed, supposedly aimed, at the communists.
[02:42:07.692 --> 02:42:13.794]  But then they immediately expanded it out from there to trade unionists, and then the Jews, and on down the line.
[02:42:13.794 --> 02:42:15.855]  And the same thing is going to happen here.
[02:42:15.855 --> 02:42:16.935]  It's happening right now.
[02:42:16.935 --> 02:42:23.958]  The demonization, as you said, is targeted at constitutionalists, targeted at, you know, veterans, targeted at
[02:42:25.558 --> 02:42:25.698]  I think?
[02:42:41.198 --> 02:42:41.258]  to
[02:42:58.658 --> 02:43:05.601]  That is precisely what they argued and wanted is what has now been put in place first by the Bush administration.
[02:43:05.601 --> 02:43:21.227]  And so the original idea of using the laws of war against terrorism was actually first thought of about to be used against right-wing domestic terrorists and right-wing radicals.
[02:43:21.227 --> 02:43:27.209]  That was the first proposed use during the Clinton administration, but Clinton didn't do it.
[02:43:27.873 --> 02:43:31.336]  But Bush then did what Clinton did not do.
[02:43:31.336 --> 02:43:37.962]  He updated that old 1942 case and applied it to the so-called War on Terror.
[02:43:37.962 --> 02:43:45.149]  And so now, what Clinton did not have at his fingertips, Bush put in place, and now Obama has.
[02:43:45.149 --> 02:43:47.411]  Like the Ring of Power, out of the Lord of the Rings.
[02:43:47.411 --> 02:43:49.552]  It's right there on his desk.
[02:43:49.552 --> 02:43:52.075]  Whenever he wants to, he can grab it and use it.
[02:43:52.595 --> 02:44:08.844]  And notice he went through all these different manipulations where, oh, it didn't affect citizens, but then it did affect citizens, but don't worry, we won't use it against citizens, but oh, he's going to veto it, so it's okay, and then he does sign it.
[02:44:09.364 --> 02:44:11.886]  I mean, they're using laws of war against us.
[02:44:11.886 --> 02:44:14.048]  We're the enemy, and it's all deception.
[02:44:14.048 --> 02:44:15.269]  But look at this article.
[02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:18.852]  Police use roadblock to gather serial killer information.
[02:44:18.852 --> 02:44:23.797]  If you scroll down to the video on the Orange County Register, it shows a major highway shutdown.
[02:44:25.174 --> 02:44:29.917]  And people pull up to FBI with clipboards demanding they answer questions.
[02:44:29.917 --> 02:44:33.879]  I mean, this is clearly just turning everything into the TSA.
[02:44:33.879 --> 02:44:39.602]  And then they use an excuse to sell the public on it, we're trying to get a serial killer.
[02:44:39.602 --> 02:44:40.302]  No, they're not.
[02:44:40.302 --> 02:44:43.504]  They know full well this isn't how you find a serial killer.
[02:44:43.504 --> 02:44:52.669]  I mean, it's just all about them seizing the roads, seizing the infrastructure, and training us that they will stop us when they want, and we will answer their questions when they want.
[02:44:53.345 --> 02:44:58.218]  Again, this is an FBI that ships guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:44:58.218 --> 02:44:59.602]  This is a government...
[02:45:01.747 --> 02:45:02.668]  That is terrorist!
[02:45:02.668 --> 02:45:04.068]  I mean, I don't know what else to say.
[02:45:04.068 --> 02:45:20.719]  Stewart, what would you do if you just pull up to a checkpoint with the FBI out of their jurisdiction on a major highway in the middle of California in Orange County in Anaheim demanding to basically, you know, answer their ghoulish questions.
[02:45:20.719 --> 02:45:22.239]  I mean, it's just, it's so sick.
[02:45:22.239 --> 02:45:23.160]  These people are so sick.
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:24.961]  And of course... Well, you have to refuse.
[02:45:24.961 --> 02:45:28.723]  We have to use civil disobedience and you have to nullify as individuals.
[02:45:28.723 --> 02:45:29.404]  We have to start
[02:45:30.262 --> 02:45:33.184]  Refusing and withdrawing our consent.
[02:45:33.184 --> 02:45:38.848]  And something else that happened... But again, it's this idea that if anything could ever kill you, we've got to have checkpoints there.
[02:45:38.848 --> 02:45:46.273]  So, oh my gosh, three homeless have been stabbed to death here, and so we'll just start shutting down the entire area and making you all prisoners.
[02:45:46.273 --> 02:45:50.156]  I mean, do people see this as the perfect excuse to take over everything?
[02:45:50.156 --> 02:45:53.198]  That the military-industrial complex is eating America right now?
[02:45:54.932 --> 02:46:06.609]  Well, I think more Americans are waking up to the fact, and like I said, that's what's good about this, is the more they overstep and the more they do this, the more it wakes us up.
[02:46:06.609 --> 02:46:10.215]  But we have to, if we wait too long to fix this,
[02:46:11.184 --> 02:46:14.366]  Then we will become acclimated.
[02:46:14.366 --> 02:46:26.914]  It's a choice between becoming the Fourth Reich, you know, are we 1934 Germany where they just quietly went along with it and sat down and shut up because they were afraid of being jailed?
[02:46:26.914 --> 02:46:31.156]  Or are we 1774 America in the spirit of 76?
[02:46:31.156 --> 02:46:33.798]  You know, that's what we have to choose.
[02:46:33.798 --> 02:46:35.359]  Let's expand on that.
[02:46:35.359 --> 02:46:36.580]  I mean, let's expand on that.
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:39.562]  This is the entire acclimation program.
[02:46:40.863 --> 02:46:48.848]  And they really want to get us ready for checkpoints everywhere so you're on a pickup list and you don't know and you pull up and they grab you and you disappear.
[02:46:48.848 --> 02:46:49.168]  Right.
[02:46:49.168 --> 02:46:50.609]  And I want to warn the police and others.
[02:46:50.609 --> 02:46:55.893]  I mean, once it goes to this level, you're not going to have a very safe job.
[02:46:55.893 --> 02:46:57.654]  I'll tell you right now.
[02:46:57.654 --> 02:47:04.098]  Well, you know, I've talked to veterans already across the country and they all say the same thing.
[02:47:04.098 --> 02:47:07.820]  They say, well, how do I know if I get pulled over by a police officer?
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:09.982]  How do I know it's a normal police stop?
[02:47:10.692 --> 02:47:16.376]  That is not some black bag thing that we turned over to the Department of Defense to take an object Guantanamo.
[02:47:16.376 --> 02:47:22.019]  And my answer now is, well, you know, right now they probably won't do that, but that's where we're headed.
[02:47:22.019 --> 02:47:22.920]  And like you said,
[02:47:23.872 --> 02:47:31.557]  Once the first one is detained like that, every other veteran, every other American out there is going to be like, well, hey, I will not know.
[02:47:31.557 --> 02:47:33.979]  I'm going to assume the worst and I'm going to resist.
[02:47:33.979 --> 02:47:46.188]  And a lot of them already told me that, that when that day comes and they see that they're actually in danger of being black bagged, they will not allow themselves to be handcuffed, even by a police officer, because they will not know.
[02:47:46.188 --> 02:47:48.069]  Because the government is illegitimate.
[02:47:48.069 --> 02:47:51.652]  I mean, again, look at these quotes, almost every comment.
[02:47:53.053 --> 02:47:55.615]  Uh, here in the Orange County and there's hundreds of them.
[02:47:55.615 --> 02:47:57.177]  What a dumb idea, really a roadblock.
[02:47:57.177 --> 02:48:08.849]  Most people driving in Orange County have no clue who is actually sitting next to them in a vehicle, let alone clues to who, you know, some bum was, you know, hacked to death in a dirty riverbed miles away.
[02:48:08.849 --> 02:48:09.430]  Here's another one.
[02:48:11.212 --> 02:48:12.052]  It goes on.
[02:48:12.052 --> 02:48:13.194]  Civil rights violation.
[02:48:13.194 --> 02:48:17.078]  This sounds like a Nazi checkpoint with regular citizens having no rights.
[02:48:17.078 --> 02:48:22.323]  Do our police really believe they have gathered this much power that they can just start doing this?
[02:48:22.323 --> 02:48:24.946]  Yeah, their bosses who are criminals tell them to do this.
[02:48:24.946 --> 02:48:26.608]  This is perch testing.
[02:48:26.608 --> 02:48:27.649]  It goes on.
[02:48:27.649 --> 02:48:29.891]  Complete violation of Terry vs. Ohio.
[02:48:31.232 --> 02:48:32.193]  And here's a minion.
[02:48:32.193 --> 02:48:36.295]  Kudos to the special task force.
[02:48:36.295 --> 02:48:38.936]  You're out in the community trying to get things done.
[02:48:38.936 --> 02:48:40.076]  Good job, guys.
[02:48:40.076 --> 02:48:41.797]  She probably works in the county.
[02:48:41.797 --> 02:48:44.458]  Your ignorance of your rights could not be more complete.
[02:48:44.458 --> 02:48:47.500]  Terror management theory at its best.
[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:49.861]  And it just goes on with the comments.
[02:48:49.861 --> 02:48:53.102]  Almost no one buying any of this information.
[02:48:53.102 --> 02:48:56.083]  It seems to me that they are stopping people with hope of raising revenue.
[02:48:56.083 --> 02:48:57.244]  Yeah, they did do some arresting.
[02:48:57.304 --> 02:48:58.025]  I don't know.
[02:49:14.295 --> 02:49:15.335]  Is this even legal?
[02:49:15.335 --> 02:49:17.816]  A random checkpoint to interview potential witnesses?
[02:49:17.816 --> 02:49:18.656]  Seriously?
[02:49:18.656 --> 02:49:20.676]  No Fourth Amendment issues here?
[02:49:20.676 --> 02:49:27.057]  Then it just goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[02:49:27.057 --> 02:49:30.998]  The good news is, Stuart, we're not buying it, are we?
[02:49:30.998 --> 02:49:34.398]  No, and more Americans across the country are not buying it.
[02:49:34.398 --> 02:49:37.799]  And that's why we are different than the Germans.
[02:49:37.799 --> 02:49:43.540]  That's why it will not go the same way as Germany that just slid into a dark
[02:49:44.292 --> 02:49:46.013]  Tyranny with a little whimper.
[02:49:46.013 --> 02:49:47.134]  We will not go that far.
[02:49:47.134 --> 02:49:49.436]  What about 3 million guns?
[02:49:49.436 --> 02:49:53.358]  1.5 million plus instant checks in the month of December alone, breaking all records.
[02:49:53.358 --> 02:49:57.081]  I mean, there aren't even liberals anymore in this country that know how to talk.
[02:49:57.081 --> 02:49:59.923]  I mean, so-called liberals are all buying weapons and everything.
[02:49:59.923 --> 02:50:03.965]  I mean, what does the new ruler think they've done, Stewart?
[02:50:03.965 --> 02:50:06.407]  Every liberal I know is arming to the teeth and is waking up.
[02:50:07.768 --> 02:50:14.833]  And we just had El Paso County, Colorado pass a resolution against the NDAA nullifying it.
[02:50:14.833 --> 02:50:17.315]  And that's what has to happen across the country.
[02:50:17.315 --> 02:50:35.168]  And in fact, I'm going to a meeting this weekend in Topeka, Kansas, where we're bringing legislators and activists in from all over the country, and we're going to draft model resolutions and build on what was already done in El Paso County, Colorado, and spread the message of nullification at the local level.
[02:50:35.168 --> 02:50:36.409]  Towns, counties, and states.
[02:50:37.372 --> 02:50:42.075]  Yeah, it's happening, and the feds can say, well, we nullify that.
[02:50:42.075 --> 02:50:43.556]  No, we nullify you.
[02:50:43.556 --> 02:50:45.857]  You work for offshore banks.
[02:50:45.857 --> 02:50:50.980]  You individually may not be a criminal, but you work for a system that's run by criminals.
[02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:57.004]  The heads of your organizations are mafia, organized crime, scum.
[02:50:57.004 --> 02:50:59.845]  You are illegitimate, and the republic is rising.
[02:50:59.845 --> 02:51:00.686]  We veto you.
[02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:03.192]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:03.192 --> 02:51:13.862]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:51:13.862 --> 02:51:17.946]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:51:18.306 --> 02:51:21.049]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:51:21.049 --> 02:51:32.339]  By getting the films, pumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:32.339 --> 02:51:35.482]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:35.822 --> 02:51:41.943]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:41.943 --> 02:51:51.846]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:51.846 --> 02:51:53.346]  The war is here.
[02:51:53.346 --> 02:51:55.247]  It's an info war.
[02:51:55.247 --> 02:51:58.107]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:52:01.648 --> 02:52:05.489]  If you don't want to be unprepared, BePrepared.com.

[02:52:11.930 --> 02:52:12.870]  Why do they lead?
[02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:16.531]  Because of best value, best selection, and their low price guarantee.
[02:52:16.531 --> 02:52:21.152]  Take advantage of BePrepared.com's inventory reduction sale going on right now.

[02:52:39.476 --> 02:52:40.577]  BePrepared.com.

[02:52:44.438 --> 02:52:44.618]  That's 800-999-1863.
[02:52:50.399 --> 02:52:51.301]  The choice is clear.

[02:53:02.671 --> 02:53:06.032]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[02:53:56.904 --> 02:53:57.764]  Atwood Rope.
[02:53:57.764 --> 02:53:59.566]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[02:54:06.488 --> 02:54:13.109]  I'll do a little bit of overdrive so I can get to the callers that have been holding it along, just like Rob and Sean and others.
[02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:14.069]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[02:54:14.069 --> 02:54:30.052]  But look at another one of these comments here on the Orange County Register where they have giant Fedrun checkpoints searching and demanding answers from people about a serial killer miles away in some ravine stabbing homeless people weeks after.
[02:54:30.052 --> 02:54:34.593]  One of the commenters, Rick Moreno, says, if you have any information, don't call.
[02:54:35.546 --> 02:54:41.267]  You might get a, he mentions local police, you might get a better response calling Anaheim or the FBI.
[02:54:41.267 --> 02:54:51.170]  I called the town more than three weeks ago when the video came out of the bank robbers asking for any information that someone might have.
[02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:57.251]  I left three messages for two different detectives and never did they call me back or even a thank you.
[02:54:57.251 --> 02:54:58.492]  Even though my info was good.
[02:54:59.628 --> 02:55:04.431]  Now folks, I've called the Homeland Security numbers on air that they have on TV, if there's terrorists.
[02:55:04.431 --> 02:55:05.772]  No one ever calls you.
[02:55:05.772 --> 02:55:08.174]  Or if you say, I know where terrorists are.
[02:55:08.174 --> 02:55:09.755]  They're like, okay, name and number.
[02:55:09.755 --> 02:55:11.176]  They never call you.
[02:55:11.176 --> 02:55:13.657]  I mean, I know that the heads of Al Qaeda meet at the Pentagon.
[02:55:13.657 --> 02:55:15.198]  I have all the documents.
[02:55:15.198 --> 02:55:16.579]  And they're just like, mm-hmm.
[02:55:16.579 --> 02:55:19.961]  But even if you just say, I have information on terrorists, they don't call you back.
[02:55:19.961 --> 02:55:21.783]  It's all fake and they know it.
[02:55:22.483 --> 02:55:24.125]  They know it!
[02:55:24.125 --> 02:55:29.991]  Austin's got tens of millions of dollars in the last decade on million and a half dollar robots.
[02:55:29.991 --> 02:55:34.295]  And they go out once a week and blow up a cardboard box on the highway in Ninny.
[02:55:34.295 --> 02:55:35.977]  And it's just all about milking us.
[02:55:35.977 --> 02:55:41.903]  It's just a total scam and a state of fear while the criminal city council robs everyone.
[02:55:41.903 --> 02:55:43.585]  I'm sorry, Stuart Rhodes comments on this.
[02:55:44.824 --> 02:55:45.704]  Well, you're right.
[02:55:45.704 --> 02:55:51.747]  It's like a disease, like a cancer that has spread, metastasized and spread.
[02:55:51.747 --> 02:55:55.029]  And it's the same thing the Founders faced, right?
[02:55:55.029 --> 02:55:59.711]  A swarm of officers sent out to eat away at their substance.
[02:55:59.711 --> 02:56:03.433]  I mean, everything that we're experiencing, they experience.
[02:56:03.433 --> 02:56:10.036]  That's why we should call people who want checkpoints and all that, should be called loyalists.
[02:56:10.036 --> 02:56:13.198]  And they should be given, we should give them red coats as gifts.
[02:56:14.218 --> 02:56:17.140]  And that's their bad, because that's what they really are.
[02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:20.762]  They have rejected the republic.
[02:56:20.762 --> 02:56:24.024]  They've rejected the concept of freedom.
[02:56:24.024 --> 02:56:27.987]  They want to live like a third world dictatorship like North Korea.
[02:56:27.987 --> 02:56:29.167]  They should just go there.
[02:56:29.167 --> 02:56:31.649]  And we should just call them what they are.
[02:56:31.649 --> 02:56:33.330]  They're totalitarians.
[02:56:33.330 --> 02:56:35.151]  They're loyalists.
[02:56:35.151 --> 02:56:37.092]  They would have been perfectly at home.
[02:56:38.317 --> 02:56:52.772]  being a Tory back in 1775 and calling for the military trial of the American colonists and the rebels and calling for the arrest of John Hancock in San Adams and stuffing them away in a military brig.
[02:56:52.772 --> 02:56:53.994]  So that's what they are.
[02:56:53.994 --> 02:56:56.336]  Or putting them on a prison ship to starve to death.
[02:56:56.336 --> 02:56:58.499]  Rob in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:57:00.467 --> 02:57:05.814]  Very riveting, very riveting discussion, and I was happy to hold and listen through it.
[02:57:05.814 --> 02:57:08.897]  I'd like to get to my points very quickly.
[02:57:08.897 --> 02:57:15.546]  Francis and Friends is a show normally hosted by Francis Swagger, Jimmy Swagger's wife.
[02:57:15.546 --> 02:57:19.090]  It's on the Sunlight Broadcasting Network, and I happen to be listening over the web.
[02:57:20.311 --> 02:57:35.960]  And yesterday Donnie Swagger, her son, was hosting and on the show he falsely proclaimed that Ron Paul is quote-unquote not a Christian and does not know the Lord Jesus Christ and characterized Ron Paul as anti-Israel and pro-Muslim.
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:39.062]  Is that because Ron Paul doesn't visit low-rent prostitutes?
[02:57:41.221 --> 02:57:48.342]  And today's show was just as bad with Donnie Swagger characterizing Dr. Paul as a fruitcake and an alien from another planet.
[02:57:48.342 --> 02:57:53.263]  Well look, I don't know about all those guys, but the whole system is attacking Ron Paul.
[02:57:53.263 --> 02:57:55.264]  What does that tell you?
[02:57:55.264 --> 02:58:06.646]  That's exactly right, and I'd like to say that I did my incremental part by posting these videos on YouTube under the title, Donnie Swagger Falsely Proclaims Dr. Paul Not a Christian.
[02:58:07.296 --> 02:58:23.090]  And there was another instance where Frances Swigert was hosting a show and she called you a traitor, Alex, wherein she said that she characterized you as a traitor for discussing America's problems with RT and basically equating you going on RT with you traveling to Russia.
[02:58:24.289 --> 02:58:25.849]  I know, that's a neocon outfit.
[02:58:25.849 --> 02:58:31.371]  I know there's some other groups that have been calling for my arrest because I do British and French and Japanese TV.
[02:58:31.371 --> 02:58:36.152]  I mean, they're just loyalist traitors and they don't want me talking about the Republic.
[02:58:36.152 --> 02:58:43.594]  But whatever, I haven't heard those little discredited people, so good for them.
[02:58:43.594 --> 02:58:46.754]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.754 --> 02:58:48.695]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.544 --> 02:58:56.108]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:56.108 --> 02:58:57.028]  Number one.
[02:58:57.028 --> 02:59:00.451]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.451 --> 02:59:01.312]  Number two.
[02:59:01.312 --> 02:59:06.195]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.195 --> 02:59:06.936]  It's true.
[02:59:06.936 --> 02:59:11.820]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.820 --> 02:59:12.640]  Number three.
[02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:16.223]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.223 --> 02:59:19.926]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.126 --> 02:59:20.927]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.927 --> 02:59:23.689]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.689 --> 02:59:27.371]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.371 --> 02:59:28.152]  Number 5.
[02:59:28.152 --> 02:59:32.315]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.315 --> 02:59:37.058]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.358 --> 02:59:41.521]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.521 --> 02:59:43.322]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.322 --> 02:59:45.543]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:45.543 --> 02:59:48.165]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.165 --> 02:59:54.009]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:54.009 --> 02:59:56.050]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.050 --> 02:59:59.272]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:09.821 --> 03:00:13.363]  You know, we're looking at how tyrants always operate, Stuart.
[03:00:13.363 --> 03:00:18.607]  And they always say people that are criticizing them work for a foreign power.
[03:00:18.607 --> 03:00:23.250]  And they've got to take your rights and clap you in irons because you're not a patriot.
[03:00:23.250 --> 03:00:27.674]  But we're the people actually defending America and what made the country great.
[03:00:28.234 --> 03:00:29.075]  And it's so simple.
[03:00:29.075 --> 03:00:38.323]  We're fighting global banks that take over countries and then use false nationalism to play our countries off against each other.
[03:00:38.323 --> 03:00:40.785]  What would you say to the last caller before I go to Sean?
[03:00:42.779 --> 03:00:46.662]  No, I've heard the same allegations made against you and also Ron Paul.
[03:00:46.662 --> 03:00:48.003]  I mean, Congressman Paul is a Christian.
[03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:49.184]  I used to work with the man.
[03:00:49.184 --> 03:01:00.312]  I used to work for him, and I can tell you that he's a very principled, pro-life Christian, but he's a constitutionalist also, and he stands on the Constitution.
[03:01:00.752 --> 03:01:09.176]  And that's what all of these Roman XIII's twisting, obedient, loyalist, fake Christians don't like.
[03:01:09.176 --> 03:01:13.799]  They want obedience, they want submission, absolute submission to the state.
[03:01:13.799 --> 03:01:18.821]  That's why there's a really great book out right now by Chuck Baldwin on Romans XIII that I recommend.
[03:01:18.821 --> 03:01:19.722]  Yeah, we've had him on about it.
[03:01:20.442 --> 03:01:21.342]  That's great.
[03:01:21.342 --> 03:01:25.064]  So that's the antidote to all that nonsense.
[03:01:25.064 --> 03:01:26.425]  But there are loyalists.
[03:01:26.425 --> 03:01:33.408]  Most of these churches are 501c3 and the feds tell them, you promote our agenda or you're going to lose it.
[03:01:33.408 --> 03:01:35.168]  They have the clergy response teams.
[03:01:35.168 --> 03:01:39.070]  I mean, it's like in China, the communists have a loyal church they allow to operate.
[03:01:39.070 --> 03:01:41.131]  It's the same thing.
[03:01:41.131 --> 03:01:41.771]  That's right.
[03:01:41.771 --> 03:01:42.511]  That's right.
[03:01:42.511 --> 03:01:45.953]  So, you know, the best way to handle them is to boycott them.
[03:01:45.953 --> 03:01:46.873]  Like the founders did.
[03:01:46.873 --> 03:01:47.854]  Shun them.
[03:01:47.854 --> 03:01:48.574]  Boycott them.
[03:01:49.892 --> 03:01:50.412]  That's right.
[03:01:50.412 --> 03:01:54.596]  I mean, I see police now, and I walk over in a restaurant or whatever, and I say, how are you guys doing?
[03:01:54.596 --> 03:01:56.437]  Where do you stand on the Constitution and the Republic?
[03:01:56.437 --> 03:01:57.478]  And they say, well, we stand with it.
[03:01:57.478 --> 03:01:58.639]  I go, good job, and shake their hand.
[03:01:58.639 --> 03:01:59.279]  Do they act weird?
[03:01:59.279 --> 03:02:02.582]  I go, oh, it's weird for a citizen to come over and talk to you.
[03:02:02.582 --> 03:02:04.844]  You ought to ask yourselves why you think that's weird.
[03:02:05.484 --> 03:02:09.889]  You want to ask yourselves why me, the little slave, talking to you is weird.
[03:02:09.889 --> 03:02:13.412]  How has America gotten so weird that we're not supposed to communicate with each other?
[03:02:13.412 --> 03:02:16.936]  It's time to get out of your shells, folks, or be put in a cell.
[03:02:16.936 --> 03:02:20.379]  It's time to get out of the shell or be put in a cell.
[03:02:20.379 --> 03:02:22.601]  Either hang together, hang separate.
[03:02:22.601 --> 03:02:27.686]  Let's go ahead and go to Sean in Tennessee, listening on WJOC, 1490 AM in Tennessee.
[03:02:27.686 --> 03:02:28.027]  Go ahead.
[03:02:28.595 --> 03:02:30.116]  Alex, I love your show.
[03:02:30.116 --> 03:02:32.237]  I'm glad I finally get you here in Chattanooga.
[03:02:32.237 --> 03:02:35.979]  We have so needed this kind of information for a very long time now.
[03:02:35.979 --> 03:02:41.503]  I mean, you are truly appreciated here for all you do on this program to fight these globalists.
[03:02:41.503 --> 03:02:41.843]  Thank you.
[03:02:41.843 --> 03:02:43.204]  God bless you.
[03:02:43.204 --> 03:02:44.525]  And you're truly appreciated.
[03:02:44.525 --> 03:02:52.109]  And I'm also a big supporter and regular listener to another one you might be very familiar with on GCN, quite familiar with Pastor Butch Paul.
[03:02:52.109 --> 03:02:52.890]  Oh, great guy.
[03:02:52.890 --> 03:02:54.130]  Need to get him on.
[03:02:54.130 --> 03:02:56.932]  And he fights these exact same people you just mentioned, the 501c3s.
[03:02:58.949 --> 03:03:08.475]  But I have a question, if you don't mind, that relates to a super technology that the government uses to control the ionosphere and jet streams and weather patterns.
[03:03:08.475 --> 03:03:10.376]  Talking about HAARP?
[03:03:10.376 --> 03:03:11.897]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:11.897 --> 03:03:19.302]  Well, I wonder, is this same technology used to possibly control people or political dissidents?
[03:03:19.662 --> 03:03:26.667]  Well, yeah, they wouldn't use the big antennas for that, but they've got patented little small psychotronic things that they've used.
[03:03:26.667 --> 03:03:32.971]  There's actually been treaties on that with the Euro, the U.S., and Russia not to use it from 1979.
[03:03:32.971 --> 03:03:39.176]  Stuart, you want to get into any of the secretive weapons that you've read about or anything?
[03:03:39.176 --> 03:03:42.198]  I mean, all I really know about is the same thing you've heard about.
[03:03:42.198 --> 03:03:43.619]  I don't know much beyond that.
[03:03:45.598 --> 03:03:49.881]  Yeah, and you know, a lot of these super high-tech weapons and stuff, it's all just bravado.
[03:03:49.881 --> 03:03:56.807]  It's all a system trying to... Look, the people that win wars are the people that don't stop fighting and who have right on their side.
[03:03:56.807 --> 03:03:57.468]  Okay?
[03:03:57.468 --> 03:04:00.110]  Tyrants never succeed when people stand up against them.
[03:04:00.110 --> 03:04:01.451]  Take Gandhi.
[03:04:01.451 --> 03:04:07.255]  He spent 30 years just getting the Indians to have respect for themselves and to learn to stand up.
[03:04:07.255 --> 03:04:09.917]  And when they stood up, there was nothing the British Empire could do.
[03:04:09.917 --> 03:04:11.499]  Closing comments on that, Stuart Rhodes.
[03:04:11.499 --> 03:04:12.520]  Thank you so much, Sean.
[03:04:13.626 --> 03:04:14.787]  Well, that's absolutely correct.
[03:04:14.787 --> 03:04:19.449]  I mean, that's the great secret that they don't want you to realize.
[03:04:19.449 --> 03:04:24.571]  The truth is that you are, in the end, you hold all the power in your hands.
[03:04:24.571 --> 03:04:27.413]  And you includes the military and police.
[03:04:27.413 --> 03:04:29.014]  And that's why I started Oath Keepers.
[03:04:29.014 --> 03:04:30.714]  Because they can't do it without them.
[03:04:30.714 --> 03:04:36.637]  And so, that's why we should look towards what happened in 1989 in East Germany, like Gunther Spenz talked about on your show.
[03:04:36.637 --> 03:04:39.879]  A mass stand-down and a mass stand-up by the people.
[03:04:40.779 --> 03:04:52.271]  You know what, Stewart, I've already got a guest on the nightly news tonight, but we might want to, either today or tomorrow, tape more about the police and the military's choice, because that's the most important part of this discussion, and I didn't even get into that.
[03:04:52.271 --> 03:04:57.876]  Maybe we should tape it, put it on the news tonight, and then air it tomorrow on the radio, part two.
[03:04:57.876 --> 03:04:59.178]  I'll talk to you here at the end.
[03:04:59.178 --> 03:04:59.919]  Stay with us.
[03:04:59.919 --> 03:05:00.880]  Retransmission coming up now.
