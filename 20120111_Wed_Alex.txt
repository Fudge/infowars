[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well

[00:19.360 --> 00:44.200]  Texas Alex Jones well my friends it's another global transmission against
[00:44.200 --> 00:49.160]  tyranny every day is a blessing we live on a beautiful planet full of
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.400]  wonderful people there are so many just dynamic and invigorating things going
[00:54.400 --> 01:01.360]  on we live on a world full of good and opportunity and evil and corrupt
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.680]  individuals understand that and they seek to dominate and control societies
[01:06.680 --> 01:10.760]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be joining us in the third hour today constitutional
[01:10.760 --> 01:21.320]  lawyer to break down the NDA and the transference constitutionally into this
[01:21.320 --> 01:27.160]  modern despotic state and the fact that this is all illegitimate and illegal
[01:27.160 --> 01:32.120]  you can't legalize tyranny I've explained this many times but he'll be
[01:32.120 --> 01:37.280]  joining us we'll also look at the phenomenal situation I mean Ron Paul
[01:37.280 --> 01:41.960]  they gave him like 8% in New Hampshire last time four years ago they engaged in
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.360]  massive fraud on every front and there's some evidence of that we're working on
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.920]  getting Bev Harrison today or tomorrow but still a very strong second with the
[01:52.920 --> 01:58.920]  controlled corporate zombie signal media the zombie control trance control
[01:58.920 --> 02:03.560]  enemy control media and that's what it is I mean it's not media it's not there
[02:03.560 --> 02:10.000]  they're biased their globalist fronts to create a false spectrum a projection of
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.320]  false reality that they then trick you to debate within the controlled spectrum
[02:15.320 --> 02:21.000]  of false information and lying by omission and twisting and spinning and
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.680]  outright obfuscation of the truth and lying in a lecherous larcenous
[02:28.680 --> 02:36.480]  Luciferian gibber now we're going again to be here for the next three hours we're
[02:36.480 --> 02:41.280]  gonna go over all of this and every day I see footage like this and I most the
[02:41.280 --> 02:46.000]  time mention it but never get to it and if you're a radio listener you go to
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.160]  info wars.com you can watch the footage it's also at drudgereport.com but bus
[02:51.160 --> 02:58.800]  confrontation caught on video in bellflower and the LA County Sheriff's
[02:58.800 --> 03:04.080]  deputies get on board there is a polite woman who the passengers say got on who
[03:04.080 --> 03:12.080]  has apparently special needs and the woman says oh aren't you a big shot to
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.380]  the cop so he cold cocks the old what appears to be mentally retarded woman
[03:17.380 --> 03:22.760]  knocking to the ground and then goes after the guy videotaping you are here
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.460]  to pay taxes and take cancer-filled shots and drink fluoride water and watch
[03:27.460 --> 03:32.840]  television to be programmed and the guys like well well give me your idea I'm
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.320]  gonna run you your background because he's black he's like well I'm a veteran

[03:42.960 --> 03:47.000]  slave and of course it turned out the guys who he said he was but what if you
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.240]  weren't a veteran like do I have my first amendment if I'm not a veteran by
[03:51.240 --> 03:53.680]  the way they have a big study out with high schoolers most of them believe
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.880]  there's no first amendment and I guess they just love the idea of arresting
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.440]  everyone for their speech so just just just giant masses of dumbed-down
[04:02.440 --> 04:09.960]  idiots with police who were drawn from that very same pool just ready to round
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.200]  house full-power punch a woman because he's like aren't you a big shot you're

[04:17.920 --> 04:25.240]  I mean if some poor homeless person says oh aren't you a big shot even if I was
[04:25.240 --> 04:30.760]  tired had a headache whatever it was I have too much pride in myself to full
[04:30.760 --> 04:34.240]  power punch somebody in the face and then run around and try to take somebody's
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.520]  camera away but again you got to ask what type of people like oh this is a

[06:02.880 --> 06:07.400]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[06:07.400 --> 06:11.520]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[06:11.520 --> 06:15.440]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.080]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[06:19.080 --> 06:23.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[06:23.640 --> 06:28.280]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[06:28.280 --> 06:32.040]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.480]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[06:35.480 --> 06:39.440]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.440 --> 06:42.680]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered

[08:24.920 --> 08:32.400]  all right we've got some really big breaking news obviously here today you
[08:32.400 --> 08:40.160]  know I told you back in October and then in November that war was already taking
[08:40.160 --> 08:47.880]  place in Iran and now if you just type in war is already taking place in Iran
[08:47.880 --> 08:53.000]  you will see hundreds of newspapers and publications just now telling the
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.880]  population this kind of like the New York Times two weeks ago and again
[08:57.880 --> 09:04.960]  yesterday came out and reported oh the government in fast and furious is also
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.800]  laundering millions in drug money no it's not millions it's hundreds of
[09:10.800 --> 09:16.320]  billions now again I'm not tuning our horn this is all in federal court the
[09:16.320 --> 09:20.760]  government admits to this the so-called government but Stuart Rhodes
[09:20.760 --> 09:27.080]  constitutional law scholar former top Ron Paul staffer will be joining us in
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.360]  the third hour today because he can break down the NDAA and a full spectrum
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.880]  tyranny and the fact that it's illegitimate I shot a video last week
[09:36.880 --> 09:40.120]  that's still the featured video on our YouTube channel unfortunately only has
[09:40.120 --> 09:43.920]  250,000 views or something it should have about five million but whatever I
[09:43.920 --> 09:48.040]  can make a joke video and it gets three million views but serious stuff doesn't
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.920]  I shouldn't complain the point is is that we break down the fact you can't
[09:52.920 --> 09:58.360]  legalize tyranny and the NDAA is a hoax and I'm explain this again they had
[09:58.360 --> 10:04.080]  laws that black people weren't humans in this country and it took people mainly
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.680]  white Christians saying you know what I don't care if you say that's the law and
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.680]  I don't care if you hang me for it I'm going to go help break people off of the
[10:14.680 --> 10:19.240]  property that you say is property but break them off of the plantation
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.480]  property and I'm going to try to you know get them to safe places and then
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.760]  after a while a lot of folks said you know what you're gonna try to kill me
[10:26.760 --> 10:30.760]  I'll just start carrying guns and shooting back you know what you can't
[10:30.760 --> 10:36.080]  legalize tyranny and it's real simple I mean Hitler was the law and so did you
[10:36.080 --> 10:38.960]  just have to you know when they came to get you and your wife and kids and take
[10:38.960 --> 10:43.160]  you away because of what race you were what political persuasion you know did
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.200]  you just go with them yeah most people said you're the law and the German
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.160]  soldiers and others at Nuremberg said well we were following orders and some
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.640]  of the prosecutors at Nuremberg said well let's let them go and they said no
[10:54.640 --> 11:00.080]  we can't do that but nowadays nowadays every time I see in Amish being
[11:00.080 --> 11:05.000]  arrested for producing their own milk or people selling eggs or whatever on the
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.080]  side of the street or they said I'm just doing my job now what you're doing is
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.400]  helping destroy this country and and and now you see the wages of the New
[11:13.400 --> 11:19.720]  World Order you see that globalism is a curse you see that it's like the plague
[11:19.720 --> 11:26.520]  it's not rosy and cute and trendy and what the intellectuals are for one
[11:26.520 --> 11:31.680]  world is not one world of peace and liberty it's one world under despotic
[11:31.680 --> 11:36.720]  corporate rule with technocratic autocrats that sit back in their
[11:36.720 --> 11:40.960]  oligarchy and punch buttons and never even look at what they're doing to
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.800]  people and and and who have a cosmology and a philosophy of hating their fellow
[11:45.800 --> 11:52.120]  humans and seeing us as a disease to be eradicated modern transhumanist eugenics
[11:52.120 --> 11:58.560]  and mark my words it's all written on the wall it's all public the only
[11:58.560 --> 12:03.920]  question is do you have the will to admit the truth because if you look at
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.680]  the facts and admit the truth you there is no choice you will join liberty
[12:09.680 --> 12:13.840]  there is no choice because the New World Order isn't inviting you to join them
[12:13.840 --> 12:18.240]  midterm not long term you don't have to wait long term now for the stuff to come
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.960]  down midterm and short term you're going to be squeezed you're going to be run
[12:22.960 --> 12:26.200]  over you're going to be enslaved you're going to be humiliated you're going to
[12:26.200 --> 12:32.400]  die an early death from all the binary weapons and and and and other systems
[12:32.400 --> 12:37.800]  they put into us if you don't know what that is you better look it up because
[12:37.800 --> 12:41.840]  this is about entertainment it's all about jokes about games about being a
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.600]  big radio host all about that garbage this is about the real world ladies and
[12:46.600 --> 12:54.360]  gentlemen and facing it head-on it's the only way to stop it now
[12:54.360 --> 13:03.280]  what's amazing is that in the last five years there have been hundreds of
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.720]  assassinations and thousands of killings because in some cases they blow up
[13:07.720 --> 13:13.120]  whole buildings full of people blow up whole military bases and Iran doesn't
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.520]  like to look weak so they're always saying oh that bridge just blew up when
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.000]  Ahmed energy drove across center oh this command military base or this
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.080]  internal police base headquarters just blew up there's a crater at a 15 story
[13:25.080 --> 13:32.440]  building nothing's there the building's blown all over the city as a gas main so
[13:32.440 --> 13:37.760]  Iran won't say it's the US and Israel and England and our own government won't
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.440]  you remember last year Stuxnet was launched and I said you watch the
[13:43.440 --> 13:46.880]  North Com and the cyber command that's already in place even though they haven't
[13:46.880 --> 13:53.000]  passed the law they don't care laws and they've occupied this country see it's
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.840]  our military people are Americans and love America but they're under mind
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.960]  control just like everybody else they don't understand the commanders the
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.080]  leadership the system above them they work for the New World Order but because
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.040]  they're wearing an American flag on their arm notice you see more and more
[14:08.040 --> 14:11.240]  American flags everywhere like like people trying to say I'm in with the
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.880]  police state I'm in with the system I I go along with the war that's what it
[14:15.880 --> 14:21.360]  symbolizes now with most of the people I've talked to have American flags all
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.360]  over their cars it's like why do you got a stick it everywhere because you know
[14:24.360 --> 14:32.120]  deep down it's gone it's gone like the year 1957 and it ain't coming back
[14:32.120 --> 14:38.680]  America is gone you know man Cal this morning I was on a show he said Alex
[14:38.680 --> 14:43.960]  is the US government is America giving Latin American leaders cancer and I said
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.760]  buddy America doesn't exist anymore it can always be resurrected like the
[14:48.760 --> 14:52.960]  phoenix you can always bring it back because it's an idea liberty freedom
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.280]  Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence but it's basically gone
[14:56.280 --> 15:01.400]  and so of course you can't ever get it back because people won't admit how far
[15:01.400 --> 15:07.760]  gone it is like children the corporate horror media talk to the public like
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.240]  like like like like lobotomized sheep that's how they see us with their little
[15:12.240 --> 15:19.640]  Fox News Christmas cards to each other is us as sheep pulling them I don't want
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.120]  to analyze that more later today it in detail because I didn't even properly
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.680]  analyze it I've looked at those Christmas cards more carefully now and Fox News
[15:27.680 --> 15:30.440]  put this out publicly they sent it to their competitors and they and they
[15:30.440 --> 15:38.600]  published it and it's sheep in a sled race and Fox News is ahead of CBS News
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.400]  ABC News and NBC News saying they're now competing with the networks and their
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.200]  sheep pulling them and then looking over the hilltop as spectators or MSNBC and
[15:48.200 --> 15:54.240]  CNN saying you're not even in the slay race you know why because in the in the
[15:54.240 --> 16:02.240]  image they have no sheep and you notice there they're really foxes in the image
[16:02.240 --> 16:07.680]  they're like big foxes they're more like wolves giant wolves now there's the
[16:07.680 --> 16:14.040]  image they're telling you everything in that image this is because again
[16:14.040 --> 16:21.000]  criminals and scum and chicken net control freaks revel in lying to people
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.920]  like you see someone being conned or mistreated you instinctively don't like
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.320]  it because you feel a brotherhood of humanity sociopaths and their psycho
[16:28.320 --> 16:34.720]  controllers the psycho should have said atop them they revel in seeing goodness
[16:34.720 --> 16:38.520]  pulled down it's a very secure feeling you like cookies and milk by the fire
[16:38.520 --> 16:42.760]  they like little kids chained down with electric drills going in them you know
[16:42.760 --> 16:47.400]  I mean you know they're a different breed of people we face and until you
[16:47.400 --> 16:50.920]  realize that and they're trying to turn our psychic atmosphere into their
[16:50.920 --> 16:54.600]  atmosphere with all the shows about how tortures cool and go ahead and torture
[16:54.600 --> 17:00.960]  people's kids it's cool this is pure evil and they I said you watch they're
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.440]  gonna launch the Stuxnet's been launched this industrials hacking system that
[17:06.440 --> 17:09.800]  has to be injected directly into the computer systems that aren't networked
[17:09.800 --> 17:13.120]  but they'll still use that even though it's a different type of attack to say
[17:13.120 --> 17:16.920]  we should censor the internet and shut things down and that somehow a foreign
[17:16.920 --> 17:21.160]  government put out Stuxnet like Russia China and sure enough a month later they
[17:21.160 --> 17:24.640]  came out and said yeah Stuxnet's a foreign power we need to take your rights
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.920]  away on the internet because of it and it's admitted the United States and
[17:29.920 --> 17:32.920]  Israel cook the thing up
[17:35.240 --> 17:43.280]  now I ran in the last month has had top generals shot top scientists car bombed

[24:19.920 --> 24:32.160]  I see articles all the time in the news about conspiracy theorists say Israel
[24:32.160 --> 24:38.400]  has hundreds of nuclear weapons no James weapons quarterly since the late 1960s
[24:38.400 --> 24:42.720]  says Israel has nuclear weapons every major government out there that has
[24:42.720 --> 24:49.560]  analysis says they've got at least 300 and ICBMs to deliver them anywhere in
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.280]  the world and medium-range missiles I mean but but again only Americans are
[24:54.280 --> 24:58.320]  talked to like we're children and I've actually had people calling the show
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.920]  before and say you shouldn't talk about Israel and its nukes you know number one
[25:02.920 --> 25:06.620]  you're wrong but number two you shouldn't talk about it and say okay okay
[25:06.620 --> 25:13.240]  Russia launched the Stuxnet against Iran okay some type of mythical creature
[25:13.240 --> 25:18.760]  is blowing up all these military bases okay that matter you've had all these
[25:18.760 --> 25:22.640]  Israeli scientists come out and and break down that they've got of course
[25:22.640 --> 25:26.280]  they've got it and then it becomes the hypocritical discussion why can they
[25:26.280 --> 25:31.720]  have it or why does Pakistan have over a hundred nuclear weapons I don't know if
[25:31.720 --> 25:35.520]  the so-called mainstream media said they didn't now would I have to go oh well
[25:35.520 --> 25:43.640]  you say so I mean if Barbara Walters or somebody said walk off a cliff you can
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.680]  fly I'm like oh well I'll just jump off the Grand Canyon because you said so I
[25:47.680 --> 25:55.880]  mean they just would straight-faces spew the most ridiculous a bull at people
[25:55.880 --> 26:01.280]  we're a laughing stock around the world Americans because of the brainwashing
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.320]  compared to any other nation to cannot mention continents systems of
[26:06.320 --> 26:13.360]  government famous events I mean just don't have passports on average no
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.160]  nothing and think having potbellied known criminals stick their hands down
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.600]  your pants and grab your genitals they think that's freedom and then I get up
[26:25.600 --> 26:28.960]  here and say you know there's a covert war going in Iran that's ridiculous
[26:28.960 --> 26:36.080]  none of that's going on and Bush five years ago signed the order to launch
[26:36.080 --> 26:40.640]  this stuff and Obama has expanded it and a known al-Qaeda group that has been
[26:40.640 --> 26:45.120]  taken off the terrorist list now and is hanging out in DC and and we're all
[26:45.120 --> 26:48.240]  a lock he was hanging out secretly the head of the Pentagon and I talked to
[26:48.240 --> 26:51.040]  these guys that just love to get rid of our rights because you know the Arabs
[26:51.040 --> 26:54.520]  have got to die and I tell them you know most of the Homeland's Kurdish focused
[26:54.520 --> 26:58.320]  on conservatives libertarians now you know that I can give you all these
[26:58.320 --> 27:01.760]  examples of al-Qaeda working for the US government people like Tucker Carlson
[27:01.760 --> 27:05.560]  we was talking to Adam versus the man Adam Gokesh he said your parasites
[27:05.560 --> 27:10.920]  Alex Jones isn't is a bleeper and you have no proof how dare you say this with
[27:10.920 --> 27:13.440]  no proof and it's like the proofs everywhere but they just say you have
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.400]  no proof that I mean it's like this trick of just I say so as a whole my
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.040]  gosh you're an establishment person and your hair has come so nice and you're
[27:22.040 --> 27:26.560]  acting condescending I better bow down to you right away I mean it's like a
[27:26.560 --> 27:34.800]  game it's a it's a trance it's a joke I mean every form of classical tyranny is
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.440]  rearing up in our face and we're here ringing the alarm bells and they're
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.240]  saying anybody that says that we should follow the Constitution is crazy
[27:43.240 --> 27:47.600]  anybody that says if you don't follow the Constitution you'll get into tyranny
[27:47.600 --> 27:55.800]  is crazy it's all happening I mean look at this out of Harat's report Tehran
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.840]  Karbalm kills Iranian nuclear scientist it goes on to say the government news
[28:00.840 --> 28:08.360]  agency reports that Amadi Roshan 32 supervised development of the net as in
[28:08.360 --> 28:13.920]  uranium enrichment facility the Tehran official blames Israel for the bombing so
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.240]  Iran's actually coming out and you're pointing out who's behind it which the
[28:18.240 --> 28:20.840]  before they wouldn't do because it made them look weak but now it's too obvious
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.640]  with bombs going off constantly but what does the New York Times say they
[28:24.640 --> 28:33.000]  condescended I'm sure that he did it to himself blaming US and Israel all those
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.520]  nasty Iranians they did it again they said the sky was blue is there no shame
[28:38.520 --> 28:45.040]  I mean they expect us to believe Israel and the people that run the US the
[28:45.040 --> 28:48.680]  globalist would carry out covert operations that they admit they're
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.600]  doing see that's what's funny separately because they have to authorize it it's
[28:52.600 --> 28:56.640]  all authorized and admitted they're doing it but then for the public they say
[28:56.640 --> 29:04.760]  oh how silly I heard a funny one today Martha they said Israel was the one
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.640]  blowing up all those military bases and I've seen some of the satellite photos
[29:09.640 --> 29:13.200]  of these bases it's got to be 2,000 pound bombs they're dropping I mean some of
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.000]  these are aircraft up there doing this this isn't just saboteurs but it doesn't
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.080]  matter cuz cuz a good old boy who thinks he's a good old boy he didn't know how
[29:20.080 --> 29:23.400]  to skin a buck around a trot line but he he knows how to wear a John Deere hat
[29:23.400 --> 29:27.880]  he'll go Martha listen to this the Iranians are saying our government would
[29:27.880 --> 29:32.140]  do that our government wouldn't do that everybody knows it's Iraners that blow
[29:32.140 --> 29:36.880]  stuff up them Arabs hey buddy they're not Arabs they're Persians shut up I
[29:36.880 --> 29:40.440]  want to give my rights up I hope the foreign banks take everything I got
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.480]  because it's patriotic all right tons of news straight ahead you don't want to
[29:44.480 --> 29:52.560]  miss what's coming I'll stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:52.560 --> 29:58.480]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:01.280 --> 30:06.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[30:06.080 --> 30:10.640]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[30:10.640 --> 30:14.920]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turn
[30:14.920 --> 30:19.760]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[30:19.760 --> 30:24.920]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[30:24.920 --> 30:29.440]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[30:29.440 --> 30:34.120]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[33:24.840 --> 33:29.960]  they've got that Iranian former U.S. Marine Corps guy who said he was
[33:29.960 --> 33:34.720]  visiting his grandma over there people could say well why don't why do they
[33:34.720 --> 33:40.560]  always assassinate people with bombs because that way you make sure you get
[33:40.560 --> 33:44.880]  them you can't insert somebody like Chris Kyle a sniper into the middle of a
[33:44.880 --> 33:51.000]  major Iranian city a guy who can barely speak English from Texas much less
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.520]  speak Farsi and again I've seen these satellite photos or some of these
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.120]  bases that have been blown up it's not even saboteurs on the ground doing this
[34:00.120 --> 34:05.800]  very serious situation here's another one assassination of Iranian nuclear
[34:05.800 --> 34:10.400]  scientist is a familiar story one in Telegraph the script by now is
[34:10.400 --> 34:17.160]  familiar enough an assassin riding a motorcycle that's the Mossad signature
[34:17.160 --> 34:25.080]  leaves through Tehran morning traffic towards his target almost invariably a
[34:25.080 --> 34:31.320]  car the vehicle of choice or officials of Iran's nuclear program because it's a
[34:31.320 --> 34:39.720]  Pujo you pronounce it continuing leaning out a hand the motorist attaches a
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.640]  magnetic explosive device sometimes called a sticky bomb to the door nearest
[34:44.640 --> 34:49.120]  the man he's trying to kill and then speeds off seconds later the bomb is
[34:49.120 --> 34:54.280]  detonated by remote control it is so sophisticated that only the target is
[34:54.280 --> 34:59.600]  killed those sitting next to him or in front or behind him escape but just
[34:59.600 --> 35:06.640]  cuts and bruises you have to shape charge Wednesday's target was Mustafa
[35:06.640 --> 35:13.960]  Ahmadiyya Roshan killed in his vehicle in front of a university campus in East
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.880]  Tehran a chemist by training he was a deputy director of Iran's main uranium
[35:19.880 --> 35:23.640]  enrichment plant a role given to him because it was expertise in gas
[35:23.640 --> 35:28.600]  separation technology a technique vital to the enrichment process he was the
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.280]  fifth Iranian nuclear scientist to be targeted in the past two years and the
[35:33.280 --> 35:42.080]  fourth to die the only survivor was the biggest prize of all in 2010 I'm not
[35:42.080 --> 35:46.120]  going to even try to pronounce the name now the head of Iran's atomic energy
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.840]  organization was well trained enough to recognize that the clicking sound of the
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.840]  door of his car meant he and his wife let clear just in time the same down the
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.720]  other side of Iran's capital one of his colleagues was less fortunate and fell
[36:01.720 --> 36:06.800]  victim to another motorcycle assassin Iran's officials were quick to a
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.680]  portion blame Wednesday the latest attack directing angry accusations about
[36:12.680 --> 36:17.800]  Israel and their intelligence service the Mossad and at the Americans a lot of
[36:17.800 --> 36:20.800]  Western security experts will say that the Iranians have some justification
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.600]  their suspicion at least as far as Israel's concerned Mossad is expert at
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.360]  carrying out assassinations abroad and Israel has most to lose from Iran
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.320]  acquiring a nuclear weapon and boy you better believe the folks carrying these
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.640]  out of risk in their lives trying to get into Iran and do that the latest
[36:38.640 --> 36:42.400]  assassination comes at a particularly tense time in Iran's relations with the
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.680]  West in the past fortnight the United States and Europe have begun the process
[36:46.680 --> 36:49.960]  of implementing sanctions that could be the first time seriously threatened the
[36:49.960 --> 36:55.280]  Iranians the Iranian regime survival Iran is responded by threatening to seal
[36:55.280 --> 36:58.440]  off the trade-off or moose through which one-fifth of the world's oil
[36:58.440 --> 37:04.560]  supplies passes sentencing a U.S. former Marine of Iranian descent to death on
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.920]  spying charges and holding war games in the Persian Gulf this week it announced
[37:09.920 --> 37:16.080]  that the uranium enrichment began at a second facility Fordow buried deep
[37:16.080 --> 37:19.240]  underground making it much harder to use military force to destroy Iran's
[37:19.240 --> 37:24.680]  nuclear program and the word I've got from multiple military sources high and
[37:24.680 --> 37:30.640]  low including Colonel Schaefer is that they do actually have atomic weapons
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.160]  they probably do they could have easily gotten them from Pakistan I mean South
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.400]  Africa had a bunch of nukes most countries have race-specific bio weapons
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.200]  can you imagine what happens when these accidentally get out or are released or
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.880]  somebody gets mad because their husband or wife gets killed and so they release
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.240]  a race-specific bio weapon and you've got all these eugenicists at the major
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.240]  universities here in the West writing public papers about how great it's
[37:57.240 --> 38:00.800]  going to be when the airborne bird flu or Ebola gets released and how they're
[38:00.800 --> 38:06.440]  ready to die with their family and how beautiful it is I mean whoa I'm not
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.200]  worried about Iran the West wants to attack Iran for political diversions
[38:12.200 --> 38:18.000]  while they implode the world economy Israel is into six months of rioting
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.040]  and demonstrations across the board from across their political spectrum
[38:22.040 --> 38:28.760]  Europe the United States everybody is angry but if they get us into a big war
[38:28.760 --> 38:33.120]  Americans will rally around the flag that's plastered on the war the Israelis
[38:33.120 --> 38:41.040]  will do it the Brits will do it and this is going to be a big war and most
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.720]  military sources I talked to him my own analysis is that Iran is going to
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.440]  concentrate its attacks on Western targets the Strait of Hormush and Israel
[38:49.440 --> 38:54.600]  and other areas of the Middle East Central Asia that they probably won't
[38:54.600 --> 39:00.360]  attack the West but the head of their intelligence unit for their Parliament
[39:00.360 --> 39:08.520]  said they are going to target Tel Aviv and New York and other cities which is a
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.200]  terrible idea to talk about it especially but if they do do it that
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.680]  will I mean I mean if a scratch is laid on American that there will be news
[39:18.680 --> 39:23.040]  cameras weeping wailing freaking out how dare them when we're bombing them do
[39:23.040 --> 39:28.320]  something nuke them I mean people will be trying to strap their children on
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.320]  missile cones you know kill brown people you know I want to breathe
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.840]  radiation I mean I mean it's it's it's tribal it's fun to get into it's fun to
[39:38.840 --> 39:43.040]  freak out and watch a car bomb go off and NINI and and bow to men in black
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.280]  uniforms standing around on street corners with machine guns it's fun to
[39:46.280 --> 39:50.920]  have your wife and children groped and humiliated for the average mind control
[39:50.920 --> 39:56.560]  sheeple who wants to vote for Mitt Romney who supports open borders abortion
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.320]  carbon taxes and wrote Obamacare so I mean you know that there is a large
[40:01.320 --> 40:08.280]  contingent of sheeple who are hopelessly confused from birth and just are ready to
[40:08.280 --> 40:11.960]  do whatever they're told and I see a bunch of Christian groups mainly Christian
[40:11.960 --> 40:15.520]  Zionist groups going praise God the end of the world's about to begin nuclear
[40:15.520 --> 40:19.680]  armageddon and then I hear them accuse the some of the Muslims for wanting that
[40:19.680 --> 40:25.320]  as well and there are some groups over there that are just as crazy and it's
[40:25.320 --> 40:27.840]  like you're saying they're bad because they think the end of the world's coming
[40:27.840 --> 40:35.280]  but you're saying nuke them start make Jesus come back I mean wow and most of
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.200]  these people are incredibly soft they've got their little office job you know they
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.640]  go to the cafeteria for church on Sundays they sit around they have no idea
[40:44.640 --> 40:49.680]  what a real depression is going to be like they have no idea what potentially
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.560]  hundreds of thousands of body bags are going to be like instead of instead of
[40:53.560 --> 40:57.200]  just a few thousand they have no idea what $10 a gallon gas is going to be like
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.880]  and and they're all gonna be waiting you're going Jesus come get me come get
[41:01.880 --> 41:06.240]  me where's the golden ladder leading down where's Jacob's ladder where's the
[41:06.240 --> 41:12.800]  you know where's where's captain Kirk up there saying you know beam him up and it
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.520]  didn't going to happen and you're just going to be there going beam me up beam
[41:17.520 --> 41:21.520]  me up beam me up Christians have done it in the last hundred years in every
[41:21.520 --> 41:24.960]  country when they're being killed they just roll over because the last 150
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.960]  years they've taught this pre-tribulation rapture business and whether that was true
[41:28.960 --> 41:32.440]  or not the point is you've got to fight evil if you're a good person you're
[41:32.440 --> 41:36.440]  going to stand up against corruption Christian or not and these copouts and
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.120]  this this stuff for the secular world they'll make fun of Christians or
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.040]  Muslims or Jews all day or Hindus or Buddhist but they'll but I feel these
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.340]  secular atheists and kind of New-Ager people they're like well it is a new
[41:48.340 --> 41:52.240]  energy force the Mayans who couldn't invent the wheel they say it's the end
[41:52.240 --> 41:56.040]  of the world which they really didn't say that but whatever so there's
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.000]  something to it and look at all the craziness because the New World Order
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.800]  has a timetable to start World War 3 in 2012 and they want you to sit back and
[42:05.800 --> 42:09.800]  go there's nothing we can do it is the end of the world we must pray to the
[42:09.800 --> 42:15.920]  Lord yeah you better pray to God to get you in gear
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.240]  I mean you think you're on this planet so if everything starts going crazy and
[42:20.240 --> 42:26.360]  haywire you're just supposed to salute the so-called Christian leaders like
[42:26.360 --> 42:32.800]  Santorum and Obama and just say you keep us safe from the from the Muslim
[42:32.800 --> 42:38.000]  scourge as they sell it I mean Santorum's back out saying eradicate Muslims
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.760]  basically oh yeah I'm sure that they're gonna lay down for that you know
[42:43.760 --> 42:51.280]  there's only a billion 300 million of them and most of them just want to live
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.240]  in a free market system they're anti-communist but let's let's turn
[42:55.240 --> 42:59.000]  them into anti-America and then let's play us off against each other while the
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.560]  bankers sit there and come in and pick up the pieces divide and conquer see I'm
[43:03.560 --> 43:07.800]  not a pit bull to be thrown in another ring with another pit bull I'm not a
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.480]  rooster that you throw me in the ring everybody's betting money the bankers
[43:11.480 --> 43:14.760]  are betting money and I sit there with little razor blades on my feet and I sit
[43:14.760 --> 43:19.120]  there and try to slice the other guy to death you know what I'm not a rooster I'm
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.040]  not a pit bull yeah I'm not getting in the ring for you okay I know who the real
[43:23.040 --> 43:33.040]  enemy is I know who the ringmaster is oh yeah you can there's all sorts of
[43:33.040 --> 43:41.040]  aggressive forms of fish and you can go buy them and you can stick them in a
[43:41.040 --> 43:44.800]  fish tank together and watch them kill each other that's just not my cup of tea
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.760]  I'm not like the you know NFL guys or whatever that you know the dog doesn't
[43:48.760 --> 43:53.520]  win the fight I electrocute them or whatever because I'm tough real men you
[43:53.520 --> 43:57.440]  know I walk around big pit bulls and everything you know I'm not a real
[43:57.440 --> 43:59.920]  American you've got to get down to that you've got to understand that I'm not
[43:59.920 --> 44:03.000]  for torturing kids I'm not for endless war I'm not for having the troops you
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.520]  used to play the uranium and just beat the chest and go we're tough we can use
[44:06.520 --> 44:12.640]  it blood right there oh well one room out of kids to form to yeah I'm I'm not
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.480]  here to be a chump I'm not here to be an idiot I'm not here to be a moron I'm
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.760]  not here to buy every new fraud that's crammed down my throat I'm done and I'm
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.040]  angry and I break with this whole matrix system this whole fake lie and I break
[44:28.040 --> 44:36.560]  with the fear I break with all of it because giving into fear is like a
[44:36.560 --> 44:42.560]  prison it's horrible I can't imagine what it's like to live in it I can't
[44:42.560 --> 44:47.640]  imagine but it's like to turn myself over to it so a bunch of perverts and
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.880]  scammer politicians can sit up there and lick their lips and threaten me with
[44:51.880 --> 45:01.600]  terrorists if I don't bear my loins to some pervert at the airport and I've
[45:01.600 --> 45:04.120]  watched these TSA people and they're rubbing people down and they're getting
[45:04.120 --> 45:14.400]  off on it it's it is a hallucination it is it is insanity it is crazy how by
[45:14.400 --> 45:19.480]  successive approximation by increments the system has trained us to accept
[45:19.480 --> 45:26.160]  basically anything and now Fast and Furious comes out Monsanto knowing that
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.080]  their crops are destroying the biosphere comes out I've got news on that
[45:29.080 --> 45:34.480]  just hundreds and hundreds of huge facts of total corruption come out and it
[45:34.480 --> 45:38.440]  almost has the opposite effect well that's just the way it is you know
[45:38.440 --> 45:40.920]  nothing you can do about it yeah nothing you can do about it because you've just
[45:40.920 --> 45:44.800]  decided to sit there on your butt because you think you're winning by not
[45:44.800 --> 45:51.640]  carrying and you know getting your MSG chips and your and your giant leader you
[45:51.640 --> 45:59.920]  know big gulp of aspartame and curling up on your couch and not caring so you
[45:59.920 --> 46:03.680]  can be shot up with a bunch of vaccines so ten years from now you can be
[46:03.680 --> 46:09.520]  shriveled you know down to 85 pounds vomiting your guts out begging for mommy
[46:09.520 --> 46:15.360]  as you die a cancer with 30 years cut off your life and the new order says well
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.520]  they're animals so they deserve to die and then you let them set up a system
[46:19.520 --> 46:23.760]  and you buy into being an animal so so that they can play their little game
[46:23.760 --> 46:27.360]  with you because a new order has all these sick little rules I figured out
[46:27.360 --> 46:31.800]  you have to let them in you have to opt in you have to decide to be an animal
[46:31.800 --> 46:36.600]  you have to decide to go along with this well not me not me I'll tell you new
[46:36.600 --> 46:43.800]  world order people are the animals you think you're so tough because you're so
[46:43.800 --> 46:49.320]  hard you're not hard you enjoy this stuff your worms you're like cancer is
[46:49.320 --> 46:53.280]  cancer winning when it races to the body no it's killing its own host you're
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.840]  aberrant you're malfunctioning you're diseased you're pathetic you're weak
[46:58.840 --> 47:08.400]  and you will fail of your own weight this whole plastic fake system is going down
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.200]  and it's not gonna be pretty the globals that they're gonna ride this ride this
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.400]  tiger yeah you're gonna ride it just like the guy Slim Pickens at the end of
[47:17.400 --> 47:21.400]  Dr. Strangelove riding that hydrogen bomb down you're not coming out of this
[47:21.400 --> 47:25.160]  just get that through your little pea brain you think the dark force that
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.240]  energizes you is planning to actually give you all this power once you read
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.160]  the old parables of the genie you asked for five thousand pounds of gold you
[47:34.160 --> 47:37.040]  better tell them where to put it because they're gonna give it to you and drop it
[47:37.040 --> 47:42.360]  right on your head in those parables is a lot of truth be careful what you ask
[47:42.360 --> 47:48.720]  for be careful what you want you're attracted to death and power wait till
[47:48.720 --> 47:52.200]  you've actually stuck your arm in there you're gonna find out what you were
[47:52.200 --> 48:01.400]  looking for so all of this is going on now shifting gears into some positive
[48:01.400 --> 48:08.080]  news for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction Newtonian physics
[48:08.080 --> 48:17.960]  proven accurate basic laws of this dimension basic primitive laws
[48:17.960 --> 48:28.240]  Ron Paul a powerful second in New Hampshire with the entire global mouthpiece
[48:28.240 --> 48:34.240]  zombie control signal telling people with the endless group of narcissistic
[48:34.240 --> 48:39.640]  ghouls telling you in their little in their little skexie outfits they're
[48:39.640 --> 48:43.760]  there they're fine gowns to impress you at the king's court make you feel small
[48:43.760 --> 48:49.240]  but they're the big architecture behind them to make you feel little there they
[48:49.240 --> 48:54.880]  are perched on high telling you Ron Paul can't win and now there's first he
[48:54.880 --> 48:58.280]  couldn't win first he couldn't get two points now okay he is in second place
[48:58.280 --> 49:03.840]  nationwide and almost every major state but he still can't win the it the
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.880]  nominee is Mitt Romney is Mitt Romney and they just we're gonna say that and say
[49:08.880 --> 49:15.640]  that like a group of parrots forever but it doesn't matter even if they steal
[49:15.640 --> 49:20.240]  elections even if Ron Paul loses he wins by engaging and developing a movement
[49:20.240 --> 49:24.600]  and developing an idea think of where we've come in four years think of where
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.720]  we're going in four and people say well they can kill Ron Paul what and make him
[49:28.720 --> 49:34.640]  an icon even bigger kill me turn me into an icon strike me down become more
[49:34.640 --> 49:41.120]  powerful than you can possibly imagine they can't strike you down they can't
[49:41.120 --> 49:46.040]  try this is it we are unlocking people's minds most people are not bad most
[49:46.040 --> 49:50.400]  people are not evil most people are not corrupt they believe this false system
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.720]  we've got a fight with the truth and our ideology of liberty against the
[49:54.720 --> 49:59.760]  ideology of globalism and bondage and despotism it's not a hard sell you want
[49:59.760 --> 50:03.440]  what made America great liberty and pointing your ship that direction never
[50:03.440 --> 50:07.640]  meant we actually got there but we were going the right direction going towards
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.760]  the sunshine towards the fertile fields towards the goodness towards
[50:11.760 --> 50:16.600]  transparency towards honor towards small government towards family and
[50:16.600 --> 50:21.000]  everything that's good instead of our ship in these dark waters where the sea
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.680]  stinks and the crews dying and our teeth are falling out and there's big
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.640]  waves and there's a big tempest giant storm on the horizon and we're going
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.640]  full blast into that and Ron Paul and others are trying to turn the ship and
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.920]  there's all these little scared minions up there you bought off by the bankers
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.640]  fiat money by their Ponzi scheme stabbing at us and saying no we're
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.720]  fighting over the wheel fighting over the wheel but more and more people who
[50:48.720 --> 50:52.280]  are on the sidelines are going why are those zombies fighting with them over
[50:52.280 --> 50:55.840]  the wheel we obviously want to go back towards the sun we want to go back
[50:55.840 --> 51:02.040]  towards the calm we want to go back to where it's good hello I'm Alex Jones

[54:23.120 --> 54:36.440]  you don't. I'll be sorry for you if you don't join us on the love train. Well, that's not
[54:36.440 --> 54:40.220]  manly though. Manly is to kill a bunch of brown people and breathe DU and come back
[54:40.220 --> 54:46.360]  and have to form children. You know, last night we aired a little promo video for a
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.640]  group that brings Iraqi and Afghan children to the U.S. You have their arms and legs blown
[54:51.640 --> 54:55.760]  off their eyeballs blown out and who never got medical treatment. Some of them have shrapnel
[54:55.760 --> 54:59.760]  in their spines. They get a medical treatment. And I saw comments on the YouTube that we
[54:59.760 --> 55:05.320]  posted this morning of the nightly news saying, how dare you? They want to kill us. They're
[55:05.320 --> 55:10.600]  animals. You're a traitor. We're going to get the Hodges. And I tracked back some of
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.720]  the people's, you know, they're, they're tracked them back to their pages and it was all just
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.720]  pro war, pro death because see, they have to say their savages when they see children
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.940]  they've maimed and, and blown the tops of their heads off or blown their little mandibles
[55:25.940 --> 55:30.080]  off and their tongues are flopping all around in pain. They've got to say good. They're
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.280]  animals. They deserve to die. A couple of days ago, I was on the radio with opiate Anthony
[55:35.280 --> 55:40.000]  and it was early in the morning. I was half awake. I did an okay job, but I probably should
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.400]  have been a lot meaner to them in hindsight. And then they go, here's Chris Kyle, the sniper
[55:45.400 --> 55:50.280]  who claims all this about Jesse Ventura. And I should have brought up, you know, you say
[55:50.280 --> 55:56.240]  these are all savages, including the women you shot, but I didn't even, you know, bring
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.040]  that up because it's so over the top. But see, you've got to do that. I mean, if you're
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.240]  killing soldiers in a uniform or we're trying to kill you, it's just the foreign enemy.
[56:06.240 --> 56:09.160]  You're part of this country. They're part of that. You don't have to call them savages.
[56:09.160 --> 56:12.560]  You know, but no, see, when you're mainly killing men, women and children, they're tired
[56:12.560 --> 56:18.440]  of being occupied or it's just little kids that you bombed. Most of the people in there
[56:18.440 --> 56:23.240]  celebrating this, they actually would freak out if they saw a child with the, with their
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.980]  lower manable blown off and would, you know, these are cowardly people. These aren't actually
[56:26.980 --> 56:31.640]  soldiers that were part of it who were saying it's okay. No, it's just these soft people
[56:31.640 --> 56:37.480]  who, who think it's real tough and they get very upset by seeing these little kids that
[56:37.480 --> 56:41.560]  I played the video on the news. So if any of our listeners wanted to financially check
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.720]  it out and maybe support, because I've also supported, you know, when the VA won't take
[56:45.720 --> 56:49.920]  care of us troops that get hurt, I've, I've supported some of those groups too, whether
[56:49.920 --> 56:53.040]  it's our troops, which aren't really our troops anymore. They're globalist troops. They're
[56:53.040 --> 56:58.560]  still Americans who've been used or whether it's a little, little brown kids. I mean,
[56:58.560 --> 57:08.800]  I, do I have a soft heart? You know, I don't think so. I think I have a heart and I also
[57:08.800 --> 57:15.200]  am God's fear and God's just God. Let me tell you, we're going to pay for all that in spades.
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.280]  Even though America was hijacked and was finagled into it, we will still be punished for all
[57:20.280 --> 57:28.200]  of that. Man, that's a scary thing. I can feel God. I can feel justice. I'm really worried
[57:28.200 --> 57:36.600]  about America. I'm worried about all of us because, because it's, it's bad. And you know,
[57:36.600 --> 57:42.720]  if we just said what we did was wrong and repented, then that would offer us a great
[57:42.720 --> 57:49.160]  deal of protection, but we won't. Instead, many people dance in the blood of the innocence.
[57:49.160 --> 57:56.720]  They rub it all over themselves. They, they, they, they spiritually fornicate with unclean
[57:56.720 --> 58:07.480]  ideas, spirits, they, they, they, they buy into it. And I, I, I didn't get into the positive
[58:07.480 --> 58:13.200]  news with Ron Paul yet because I got off into that. But Ron Paul does say he's nipping
[58:13.200 --> 58:19.520]  at the white Obama's heels. Mitt Romney, the white Obama. Ooh, that'd be a good video
[58:19.520 --> 58:31.120]  of me. Meet the white Obama. We've got to destroy Mitt Romney because it's been a long
[58:31.120 --> 58:35.440]  time since we actually had a presidential candidate that wasn't a globalist puppet.
[58:35.440 --> 58:43.600]  His name's Ron Paul. We got to get behind him. Stay with me.
[58:43.600 --> 58:50.920]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.920 --> 58:54.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[58:54.960 --> 58:59.840]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[58:59.840 --> 59:03.640]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds that
[59:03.640 --> 59:07.120]  all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[59:07.120 --> 59:11.680]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[59:11.680 --> 59:17.920]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[59:17.920 --> 59:22.480]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[59:22.480 --> 59:26.600]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[59:26.600 --> 59:34.040]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[59:34.040 --> 59:45.120]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[59:45.120 --> 01:00:05.680]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:27.040]  All right, here's the deal. We've got a lot of other world news, and I'm going to cover
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.360]  it. We're going to go over this hour, but I also want to take your calls on the Iran
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:39.040]  situation, on Ron Paul's turbocharging, a strong second in New Hampshire. He's in first
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:45.600]  or second in Nevada and other juicy states. Santorum and his bloodlust for World War
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.960]  III is probably the leader down in Florida, so Paul is not going to be contesting that
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.320]  state, obviously, in wasting people's money. But again, now is the time to be supporting
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:06.320]  our omnibudsman, our elder statesman, Ron Paul. Now is the time to get behind him like
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.840]  ever before. I want to open the phones up on any of the issues I've mentioned or any
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.080]  issues you want to get into. We've also got the footage and audio coming up of the police
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:25.480]  officer, just absolutely Mike Tyson punching a special needs mentally challenged woman.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:35.040]  So it's very manly though. I get upset by this video because it's so manly to beat up
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:43.080]  a retarded person that it's so manly that I'm feeling weak right now. I'm feeling pathetic
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:51.240]  right now. I wish I was man enough to do this, and I'm intimidated by it. It makes you feel
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:57.880]  small to see this type of manhood in action. This is what it's all about. This is what
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.320]  America's all about. In fact, maybe the American flag shouldn't be a sheep sticking its head
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.200]  in the ground, the ostrich sheep, the ostrich sheeple. Maybe it should be like an old lady
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:14.800]  or like a mentally retarded child with a cop beating their head in, because that's freedom.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:25.040]  After all, she angered his ego. She called him the big man. Well, they show her. You
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:33.080]  can call me big man, huh? Call me big shot? Show you big shot. Then the cop, he's not
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:39.280]  done there. There's somebody on the bus back 15 feet away videotaping it. Ooh, you don't
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:47.800]  do that in America. You don't do that in America, buddy boy. So they are trying to convert the
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:56.200]  police over into a bunch of really shameful people. I, I know most police still aren't
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:10.800]  like this. A lot of them are. And I just, to me, it's shameful. I just don't feel tough
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:19.440]  hitting a woman. And I really don't feel tough with a badge and a gun and then quote authority
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:26.960]  cold cocking somebody because they said something to me. I didn't like something a 10 year old
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:34.040]  would do. You know, I had quite a few girlfriends and I've got a theory about women. One of
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.160]  the crew members actually has this theory. I think it's true. Half, half of the women
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.440]  out there are 50% crazy and the other half are completely crazy. But you know, men are
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.440]  crazy as well. I've a theory about men. Half the men out there are 50% crazy and the other
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:57.760]  half are 100% crazy. So women can't live with them, can't live without them. But I have
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.840]  had many girlfriends over the years who were getting an argument with you. And if you wouldn't
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.160]  argue with them, they'd start hitting you or clawing you or whatever. And I never really
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.200]  even had like, like if a man did it, it's like an automatic challenge and you, you beat
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.800]  the daylights out of them. But a woman does it. It's more like a flailing, like you've
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.800]  got like a, it's, it's almost laughable and they get really get me out of me, start laughing
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.960]  at them. But I have you held down girlfriends and stuff like that when they're clawing at
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.080]  you and stuff. And then they always get real mad. Oh, now you're attacking me. I'm like,
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.280]  no, I'm keeping you from doing something to me. The point is this woman didn't do any
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:41.920]  of that. She just simply gotten his face sand stuff to him. And so he punches her full power
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:50.200]  and then goes after somebody's first amendment to videotape. So that's coming up 800-259-9231
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:05:01.920]  is the toll free number to join us 800-259-9231. We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.200]  We've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.800]  your self produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.640]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.080]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver

[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.880]  looking at budgetary issues and things. Be able to offer that soon. Right now it kicks
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.800]  you off after about 20 minutes. The free audio stream is there, but that's not the reason
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:05.000]  that we're unlike other media. Yeah, I crawled up from nowhere, built my own system. That's
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  different. I talk about real issues. I'm shattering the left right paradigm, the distractions
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.120]  and diversions that are put out there to blind us from the real world. Our planet has been
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.800]  captured by six mega banks that control the central banks of almost every nation in the
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.920]  world. The ultra rich actually control the money. They're not trying to make money. They
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.280]  literally make the money. And so they always want to get your country, your individual,
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:38.200]  your company, your town in debt. And because they, the engine of free market is so powerful,
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.560]  they've never been able to do that even with wars to a true servitude level. So now they've
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.800]  just put all their politicians in place and had them shine on to the 1500 conservative
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:59.480]  trillion. That's 1500 trillion with a capital T. And now have signed the world onto it.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:06.600]  The world's waking up. So they want to start a big war as another distraction for that.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:12.680]  As I say, war is the health of the state grows the state throughout history. And so the state
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:20.920]  itself piloted and hijacked by miscreant new world order. Acolytes is taking us into a
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.400]  very, very dark waters indeed. I want to take your phone calls in the shower. The toll free
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:33.480]  number to join us is 800-259-9231. And I do see Rocco, Ronnie, Don, Gary, Rob and many others
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:39.400]  that are holding. We'll be getting to all of you today. But first off, I want to hit some more
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:45.800]  Ron Paul news. Again, obviously he came in a strong second in New Hampshire despite the fact
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:54.760]  that many zombies it appears did vote for Lord Romney. Because the media told him this is the
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:11:01.320]  only one that can win the Republican nomination. And they had all these talking parrots regurgitating
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:09.000]  and repeating at nauseam. Not that Polly wanted to crack her, but that Ron Paul couldn't win would
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.840]  never win. It's impossible. He's pathetic. He's dangerous. He's this. He's that. He wants you
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:23.080]  to die in a nuclear war. Same thing they used against one of his idols, Barry Goldwater,
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.680]  who fought the globalists and exposed the trilateral commission in CFR. In fact, guys,
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.040]  will you print me Barry Goldwater quote on trilateral commission? It's the longer one about
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.080]  how they're taking over the country. And when I read this quote, you'll know how accurate it is.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:44.200]  And here we are 40 years later when he was running against LBJ because he and on an anti-war
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.680]  candidacy, by the way, but from a conservative true conservative position and nationalist
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.480]  position, they ran ads showing a little girl standing there with a flower and then a hydrogen
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:12:01.800]  bomb goes off and kills her. It's like, don't vote for Goldwater. He wants to kill your baby.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:11.560]  But despite them throwing everything they've got against Ron Paul, he is in first or second in
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:19.240]  almost every state. And he's gaining momentum. And if the world, if so called conservatives and
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.000]  people just snap their fingers and go, Hey, wake up, wake up. Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare,
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.360]  the Massachusetts law that he wrote it. Mitt Romney's for abortion, open borders, gun control,
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:40.680]  and a bunch of other carbon taxes. I mean, he is the white Obama. Meet the white Obama.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.600]  Meet the white Obama. I mean, look, that's just like I told people, why are you bashing Obama in
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:52.520]  the 2008 election? You Republicans, you love George Bush, you should love Obama. Banker,
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:13:00.280]  bailouts, takeovers, everything. Just different rhetoric, hiring lobbyists, all of it. What they
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:06.600]  do is the same. The rhetoric's different. Mitt Romney with a little Kindle face goes,
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:13.000]  hello, return Roe v. Wade. I mean, he's a liar. At least Obama tells you the truth.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.080]  Yeah, this is the shorter version of the quote. This is from his
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:24.600]  book with no apologies. In fact, you guys give it to me. Thank you for this one,
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:30.200]  but the larger one from no apologies and that actually have that book around her somewhere.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.320]  The trilateral commission is intended and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.760]  consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of the political
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.920]  governments of the United States. The trilateral commission represents a skillful,
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.240]  coordinated effort to seize, control, and consolidate the four centers of power,
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.960]  political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:03.480]  Clergy response teams, anyone? It's a global standardized system. And it doesn't give this
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.920]  Liberty Tree quotes where this was said, but this is an excise piece. Yeah, this,
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:14.360]  the book, no apologies. Mary Goldwater. You know that Jewish guy, Ron Paul,
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:21.960]  supported for president cause Ron Paul's so anti-Semitic makes my head spin sometimes.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.080]  Let's get into some of the other Ron Paul news. He has said
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.280]  that it's time for the other candidates to drop out. I mean, some of them got three or four, five
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.680]  points. It is time for them to drop out because all those other groups that are going to stay in
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.560]  there, that's mainly folks that will not vote for a Mormon. No matter how you slice it, I'm not
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.840]  getting into Baptist or Mormon or Catholic bashing. Okay. If you love God, you love life,
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.240]  you don't like corruption. I like you. You know, it's all the sectarianism that causes all the
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.000]  fighting. I'm not going to get into judgments here and turn this into, you know, beat my chest
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.160]  religiously and, you know, follow what I believe. I have a personal relationship with my creator.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  I can feel it. I know it. I've experienced it. And you know what? I don't really find that in
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.800]  these churches. I don't get a good vibe in them. So that's why I'm not in them. Pharisees came to
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.640]  Christ and they said, why don't you come to temple? Why don't you get up there on the hill with us
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:28.680]  and pray? And he said, I'll do that in private in my closet. I, uh, you guys get up there and
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:41.000]  talk about how good you are all day up there. But the issue here is that Mitt Romney, depending
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.920]  on how you slice it, will probably lose to Obama. He's a former big globalist heads fund person,
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.720]  all of it. And it, in a way, it doesn't even matter because you get him in there. Now they'll
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.800]  get three or four more years before people figure out, Hey, this guy's the same as Obama was.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:06.520]  Remember all those poor Obama bots, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.920]  Brain little Obama bot sheep, little Obama sheeple. Oh, thank you, president. I'm going to get a free
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.920]  car and a free house and all my problems are solved. You're going to take the money from the rich
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:25.720]  people. There's only $2 trillion in domestic wealth that's left here. I mean, there's global
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.040]  is to control tens of trillions of peace on record. They're all offshore and exempt from taxes on
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.720]  record. But let's say you took the $2 trillion. Oh, what's that going to do for the $15 trillion
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:42.760]  deficit or the GDP that's $15 trillion? Now the debt's greater than the entire GDP yearly.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:51.320]  But you can't explain that to someone who is poor, who is into the entitlement society,
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.480]  somebody who's poor, trying to put themselves through night school while working two jobs.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.880]  They understand it. And if we keep a free market, they're going to expand the middle
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.640]  class. We could all be middle class. We could all be wealthy. Our poorest people are wealthy
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:09.480]  compared to people 2,000, 3,000 years ago. There's unlimited potential, but through an
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:17.960]  incredible free market driven Liberty based market, there's so much wealth that it's a disruptive
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:24.840]  technology is what the globalists call it. And it will unseat their monopolies and technology
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.960]  will accelerate so fast and humans will get life extension. And then our population will
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.720]  become so giant that they'll build cities up and down instead of out. We will colonize space
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.160]  and it's over. And the globalists just don't like that. They romanticize a post industrial.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.480]  They're going to have high tech reservations they go to for new bodies and new tech.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:52.760]  And the rest of us will be in loincloths, very small numbers, basically of like aborigines that
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:59.240]  they keep in certain green belt sectors to study primitive humans and enable split off
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.800]  in their new species. Now, again, when the New York Times and CBS News attacked me for this
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.960]  and say, I believe this, no, I don't believe this. I give the quotes in my films and here on air.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:17.720]  This is what they're setting up. This is a future without us. This is a future that doesn't need us.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.840]  The elites have decided we've got robots. We've got drones. We don't want you anymore.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.680]  And the ultimate exercise of power, the big gleaming switch that ensures that they get
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:36.520]  what they want, at least to one level, is to release the super bio weapons and kill the majority
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.880]  of the people. And they'll go into their armor redoubts and the military all be happy to be there.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:50.600]  You know, select military and COG and then emerge after it and be given the cure and the antidote and
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:57.960]  then be integrated into the new future. And I'm telling you, they're planning this. So you talk
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:06.280]  about doomsday, folks, this is going to be bad. And you could say, well, okay, we've seen the
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.240]  globalist talk about this and set it up. We see the architecture going in that way. You know,
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:17.480]  the whole global societal infrastructure architecture. But will they really do it? I don't
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:22.520]  know. I mean, I know they're already playing with us like a cat plays with a mouse for 20
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.920]  minutes before it eats it. We got blood coming out our eye. We're scratched. Our back legs are
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:33.560]  broken. The cat's playing with us. It's dumping heavy metals into the food and water. All these
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:39.400]  other poisons, deadly vaccines, all the degenerative diseases exploding, cancer. And I'm like,
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:45.880]  I don't know. They've sure done a lot of other horrible stuff, though. I mean, here's CBS news
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.120]  where they're shooting kids up with live polio. Here's another one killing newborn babies with
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.280]  these shots. I mean, I don't know. They say they're going to do it. They've always done everything
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:10.200]  they say they're going to do. The cops are like, I want to beat some old ladies up right now.

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:18.040]  Here to build the death plane. So it's time for the other candidates to step down like Michelle
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:24.600]  Bachman did. They're not going to win. It's between Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. The only person challenging
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:32.680]  Mitt Romney's Ron Paul. Now, the prostitute media is doing something that's illogical,
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:37.960]  if you think logically, but may work on some sheeple. They're doing a couple things. They're
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:45.960]  saying everybody should stay in because it's still an open race, but Ron Paul can't win and should
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.640]  drop out because there's no way he'll ever be the nominate. Now, he's in second place, undisputed
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.120]  across the country, and in second place in New Hampshire, third place, and there was a lot of
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.560]  chicanery, probably one in Iowa, and that's even come out in the local papers that, oh yeah, Carl
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.240]  Rove reported, the people didn't show up with the votes. We just decided Santorum went up six points
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:12.760]  or whatever. And so Ron Paul's out there saying, no, it's time for all of you to drop out and all
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.600]  those other folks are anti-Romney. They're going to go to Paul and he's going to have more points
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:24.280]  than, than Romney if you break down the numbers. And in different polls, he beats Obama by more
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:35.400]  points than Mitt Romney does. And I don't trust Mitt Romney as far as I could throw him. I mean,
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:40.360]  he is a globalist who is for the socialist healthcare for all the rest of the garbage.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.000]  Now he'll tell you what you want to hear. But I mean, haven't you been conned before?
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.000]  I mean, the idiots that said that he, you know, that Obama was like Jesus, remember that?
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.760]  And he was going to save us and he was the one and Pepsi got behind it.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.440]  I mean, haven't you learned people that all this hype is just that hype? It's hot air.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.880]  Here's Ron Paul talking about nipping on Mitty's heels. Here it is.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:13.960]  I called Governor Romney a short while ago before he gave his talk and congratulate him
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.200]  because he certainly had a clear cut victory, but we're nibbling at his heels.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.480]  But there was another victory tonight. He had a victory, but we have had a victory for the cause
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:42.840]  of liberty tonight. Yes. That's right. There is no doubt. There is no doubt that this whole
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.320]  effort that we are involved in will not go unnoticed. Let me tell you.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.760]  You only lose when you don't get in the game. You only lose when you give up. Don't you get it?
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:03.320]  Everybody's learned about the New World Order and torture and wars and the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:09.880]  This is, I mean, if the Bilderberg group in 2006 was pulling their hair out about the
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:15.320]  Liberty movement growing, the militia movement, the patriot movement, Ron Paul was just mentioned
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:26.040]  in there as one of the main constellation points. Now it's just, it's surging. It's growing. If you
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.440]  look at the exponential growth curve, it's just stratospheric. And we've all got a responsibility,
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.280]  those of us that represent liberty and freedom and dignity in the Republic.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:45.320]  We really carry with us the remnant of what made America great. We carry with us
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:28:00.120]  really the Republic's family jewels. We were the example to live by for freedom worldwide.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.160]  America was admired. We were the good guys. We weren't perfect, but compared to everybody
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.040]  else, we were the good guys. We were the excellers. We had the highest test scores. We had the toughest
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.160]  men. We had the most inventors. We were the people that never gave up. We were the honorary folks
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.240]  that didn't put up with government tyranny and didn't get bossed around by bureaucracy.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:24.440]  Everywhere else where humanity was bent over under the whip of bureaucrats and paramilitary police.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.920]  We were the people that were willing to go to the end and willing to die.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:40.120]  That iconic image worldwide. And now look at us. We were taken over. We were fed poison,
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:48.760]  cultural and physical poison. We were beguiled. But now the giant is poisoned and sick, but still
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:54.840]  incredibly powerful. And any time it wants to, it can break the trance and stand. And the giant's
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:01.800]  now awake at the edge of the bed in an incredible hangover. Little globalist demons crawling all
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.800]  over it trying to suck the blood out of it. But just the fact that it's woken up, the heart's
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:12.120]  beating, the strength is reviving it. And we are there breathing life into it. And worldwide,
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.160]  people see Ron Paul. They see the Liberty Movement. They see the common sense. They see the goodness.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:25.080]  And there's Ron Paul type movements all over the world to rediscover true freedom.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:34.760]  This is a revolution of ideas. And ideas are bulletproof. No army could stop an idea whose
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:41.080]  time has come. The New World Order asked us to kneel and be their slaves. All Ron Paul is asking,
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:48.040]  all I'm asking is that you stand. Is that cruel? We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:57.080]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.920]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:22.920]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:28.440]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:33.400]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:39.560]  to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship,
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:45.480]  body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:51.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:46.200]  All right. Well, there's pure Americana Elvis. The nowadays Americana is evil, so I guess Elvis is with Alcada. I guess all of us are, except for the folks that actually run Alcada up there at the Pentagon.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:55.200]  Here are some of the quotes on a very Goldwater's book, and I'll go to your calls. Here's a page 284 of No Apologies.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:09.200]  The Trilateral Commission, I already read this earlier, but I'll get to the new ones. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:20.200]  All this is to be done in the interest of creating a more peaceful, more productive world community. Throughout my public life and in these pages, I have refrained from judging other men's motives.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:29.200]  I have no hesitancy about judging their wisdom and the results of the actions taken. And he goes on to talk about how it's really evil.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:39.200]  Page 285, what the trilateralists truly intend is the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation-states involved.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:53.200]  They believe the abundant materialism they propose to create will overwhelmingly existing differences, and managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:03.200]  Here's another one, page 286. David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter in him their ideal candidate.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:17.200]  They helped him win the nomination and the presidency. To accomplish this purpose, they mobilized the power and the money power of Wall Street bankers, the intellectual influence of the academic community, which is subservient to the wealth of the great tax-free foundations,
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:25.200]  and the media controllers represented in the membership of the Council on Foreign Relations and CFR, CFR and trilateral commission.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:43.200]  Continuing, page 299, we have arrived at our present position of peril in a world and at home, because our leaders have refused to tell us the truth unless we, who profess to believe in freedom, wake up, the world is headed for a period of slavery.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:59.200]  He wrote this back in the 1970s, 1979. That's excerpts of the No Apologies, the personal and political memoirs of the United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater, 1979.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:15.200]  And a lot of people think, well, if the TV says that that's establishment, I'll go with that and I'll be establishment. No, you're following the edicts and the ideas of radical globalists who are anti-human and who see you as dogme.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.200]  And they've been very good at making it all look very reasonable what they're doing.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:38.200]  All right, I'm going to your calls and a bunch of other news ahead of Stuart Rhodes joining us to break down what's happening. Constitutional law scholar, Yale graduate, top of his class, Army paratrooper, Ranger, the whole nine yards, worked for Ron Paul for many years.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:55.200]  We'll get his take on Ron Paul up front. Then we'll get into his thesis paper a decade or so ago, getting into martial law, how it can be brought to America, the NDAA, and the fact that you can't legalize tyranny.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:10.200]  So that's coming up with Stuart Rhodes and we'll also take some calls towards the end of the interview with Stuart. But here we are now an hour and 36 minutes into the transmission or 37 minutes in and I haven't plugged anything.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:26.200]  Hey, everything I promote and plug. When you hear me intro something, you hear me promoting something with my voice. It means I believe in it. They take that for what it's worth. But whatever I promote, I'm into. And you heard a caller a few days ago, I meant to elaborate on it.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:40.200]  And I didn't say, Alex, I have your bumper sticker info wars.com on my car. And everywhere I go, the police are fans because a lot of good police out there and people at the university or listeners.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:49.200]  And he said, you know, every four or five people I talked to, at least one of them is a listener. Now you're really starting to reach critical mass.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:57.200]  Yeah, not only do you support us when you buy an info wars.com t shirt, you're going to meet like minded people.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  You're you want to meet people that are into liberty.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:07.200]  Wear an info wars.com shirt. Have an info wars.com bumper sticker.
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:19.200]  Have an in the Fed sticker and we sell a whole bunch of bumper stickers at cost, by the way, we've just gotten some new bumper stickers in some new designs, by the way. So they're at cost what it cost us.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.200]  In fact, they tried to get me to raise the prices a little bit back in the warehouse because they're like, you're actually losing money on this.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.200]  But the point is, I want to get this information out and that's how we reach new people.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:39.200]  That's why when I say when you buy my films and get them make copies Obama deception, follow Republic in game, the film I produced, Invisible Empire, which is excellent.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.200]  Give them to people.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.200]  Aram on access TV.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:50.200]  Again, we have this idea that we all have to beat the new world order by ourselves overnight.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:57.200]  There's not some dragon we can't corner in some cave and stab it in the heart. Well, then I'm not going to do it.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:05.200]  Civilizations are built and tyrannies are defeated inch by inch, centimeter by centimeter, millimeter by millimeter.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:11.200]  And right now we're gaining thousands of miles on the new world order.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:19.200]  I mean, we are the new order is stalling and trying to get everything done right now because it's running out of grease.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.200]  It's like a big metal machine that's seizing up.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:32.200]  Meanwhile, oil's pumping through us. I mean, we're getting more and more powerful, stronger and stronger.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:37.200]  That's why the corner rat that still has a lot of power is going to pull out all the stops.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.200]  I mean, we are at an amazing threshold.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:53.200]  Flashpoint, jump point, crossroads, tectonic shift, quickening, climax, acceleration, great time of change.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:40:00.200]  Did I say quickening? I mean, it's here and it's just going to get wilder as I keep telling you.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:10.200]  We're going to look back on 2012 as a cakewalk, but in all that adversity comes great opportunity.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  I mean, we were dying because we were living in slow death, slow new world order, hidden.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:25.200]  Now it's coming out in the open. Now it's saying, okay, we tried to be cloaked to sell our agenda, but that didn't work.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.200]  So now we're uncloaking. Look at how scary we are.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:32.200]  Look at all the murders and death and evil. Aren't you intimidated?
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.200]  And people are going, no, I'm not intimidated.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:48.200]  I mean, really at the moment that they uncloak themselves as the vampire like psychic vampire global as they are, as they uncloak themselves.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  Are we supposed to now all just run under the table or get mad at the messenger? No.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:59.200]  This is what you were born to do. You were born to be here now.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:09.200]  You're part of a generation that's seeing shifts in technology and culture and computing power that is going to just exponentially get wilder.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:22.200]  We are involved in an amazing time and it's just going to get wilder and crazier and stranger and more fantastical by the minute.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.200]  And you notice some people are waking up to that and going, wow, others are getting more complacent.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:31.200]  Things are boring. Nothing's going on. I'm sick of my iPad.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:39.200]  Those are zombies, folks, totally in the matrix.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:49.200]  I mean, this morning I walked on the back porch and it was a frosty morning, giant moon in the sky, champagne sunrise, cup of coffee, 6 a.m.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:42:09.200]  and I was just like, wow, the leafless black woods, the hill, watched a horse in a donkey in the ranch across from me, nibbling at the grass,
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:20.200]  heard coyotes howling, turkeys gobbling. It's unbelievable.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:26.200]  And you can walk out anywhere you want and see beauty.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:39.200]  One place you really see it is in the electric inquisitiveness and goodness of a child's eyes.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.200]  And it is for the children that we do what we do.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.200]  So don't let this train pass you by.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:52.200]  Don't sit on the sidelines while the greatest events in human history are just beginning to unfold.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:57.200]  It's like the concert and you've heard them warming up.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:08.200]  It's an interesting sound, but suddenly the music is coming alive with the opening ballad.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:21.200]  And this whole thing is about to begin. The good, the bad, the ugly, all of it in this huge passion play with real people on the stage, a planet,
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:32.200]  hurtling through space at tens of thousands of miles an hour, circling a giant ball of flame with the nebulas in the universe all around us
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:44.200]  and our wives and our husbands and our grandparents and our ancestors before and streaming out our progeny to come.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.200]  It's unbelievable.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:58.200]  I mean, these idiots don't know that there isn't a creator of all this. They can't resonate with it and feel it.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:05.200]  You know what's good. You know what's bad.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:17.200]  You know the law of the universe. You know ugly from beauty. You know innocence from corruption.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.200]  All right, I'm going to stop preaching.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:27.200]  The point is that I was going to do a short plug for waking people up, books, videos, and you support us, infowars.com, the t-shirts, all of it.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:34.200]  And we're running that special for a few more weeks where you can get all of my films for 70 plus percent off the Everything Special, great weapon in the Info War.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:42.200]  We've also got a bunch of new films we're carrying, like A Noble Lie, the Oklahoma City Inside Job movie. Excellent to expose the vampires.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:49.200]  And yeah, there it is. Game done, plug it in, infowars.com or 888-25-33139.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:45:00.200]  Rocco, thank you for holding from North Carolina. Instead of how about them bears or how about them cowboys? How about that Ron Paul?
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:06.200]  They keep saying he can't win. The underdog is rising, rising. What do you say about that?
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:12.200]  Oh, we know. We know some people are talking the truth, but we're not going to hear that in corporate media.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.200]  It may be a coincidence, Alex, but I don't know if you've visited WorldNet Daily's website.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:22.200]  It really looks like infowars now. They redid the whole website, but the content doesn't.
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  They ran a hit piece yesterday called the Ron Paul Saul Linsky. It was terrible.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:32.200]  The good thing is, though, they did put up comments that didn't take them down.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:39.200]  People, I was putting up links and stuff. But again, it looks like infowars, but the content's not quite there yet.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:49.200]  Well, I mean, Joseph Farah overall walks a line between being kind of neocon pro-war because he is Lebanese
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.200]  and I know the Lebanese Christians have been persecuted and that does happen.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:46:02.200]  And so, you know, he is kind of a lecoudnik. You know, he's, he's, he's, you know, super pro, what you'd call right wing Israel,
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.200]  but it's it's left wing, right wing. It's all made up.
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.200]  And then separately, they do a lot of, you know, anti-globalist stuff over the years.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:17.200]  And I think overall, WorldNet Daily has done a good job. I mean, you know, they've done more harm than good.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.200]  Obviously, people are too weak-minded. A lot of them to really face the truth.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:30.200]  I mean, the truth is horrific. I mean, I was on more radio stations 12 years ago or 11 years ago than I am now.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:34.200]  Now I'm on a lot bigger ones and stuff, so we have more, exponentially more listeners.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:38.200]  We're on XM and a lot of other stuff, but number one on the internet.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.200]  But, you know, stations were calling when I was saying 9-11's an inside job.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.200]  I mean, I saw Building 7 blow up. I had all the evidence that they were calling saying,
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.200]  they all thought I was going to stop. They said, tell Mr. Jones that, you know,
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.200]  he's going to stop that or he won't be on next week.
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.200]  And I said, well, just tell him, sorry, I'm not going to stop.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:58.200]  And I said, if you've got a problem with that, Ted, I'll just leave.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.200]  And he said, no, no, I'm going to back your First Amendment.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.200]  I'm not saying you should stop. We're just getting all these calls.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.200]  And I called a few of the stations and I said, look, here's the evidence.
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:09.200]  They said, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear the evidence. I just can't have this.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:15.200]  And I'm like, I understand just, you know, I'm not trying to get in your face. I'm not trying to, you know,
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.200]  say, I'm going to do what I want just to be naughty.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.200]  I cannot sell out what I believe to be true.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.200]  Okay, I cannot compromise that. Just not going to happen.
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:28.200]  And so about 70% of the stations I was on dumped my show.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.200]  Everybody was like, aha, look at Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.200]  That was, I didn't even think about it.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.200]  I mean, it's not even, it's not debatable.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.200]  Why even be on the air if you're not telling the truth?
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:44.200]  Why even be on the air if you're not going to the hard places?
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.200]  But I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.200]  Hey, Alex, can I play a website, local paycheats in North Carolina?
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.200]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.200]  It's FoundersTruth.org, FoundersTruth.org.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.200]  We're educating voters, trying to get voters to think in terms of the Constitution.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:06.200]  And we're looking for candidates we can support that will support the Constitution locally.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.200]  All right, buddy, I appreciate that.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:11.200]  I've been really ranting here.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  Don and Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.200]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.200]  Hey, buddy.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.200]  Hey, just a couple of quick points and a question for explaining to the listeners.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.200]  One thing is listening at work.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200]  I mean, this is so simple.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.200]  I take my iPhone, I have a little speaker, I plug into it.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:29.200]  I'm only allowed to listen to break and lunch, but I take advantage of that.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.200]  And I can even tell you how many people that have woken up there,
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.200]  I'd have to sit there and credit tally it out.
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.200]  But at first they kind of laugh, they go, what are you listening to?
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.200]  And then pretty soon they're intrigued and they listen.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.200]  So that's my point there.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.200]  Work is a good advantage on your break time for your speech.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.200]  The second point is, with, say, in America, it's gone.
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.200]  Both my parents are gone, bless their souls.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.200]  And I can plaster their picture in every room all over every wall.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.200]  And that doesn't bring them back, but I can believe in their idea.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.200]  And I can revive that and make that relevant.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.200]  Well, that's how you honor your ancestors is by being a person that stands up against evil.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:14.200]  I mean, that's why they say, honor your forebears, honor, honor your family name.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  I mean, it's so simple.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.200]  That's all we've got.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.200]  And that's so valuable.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:25.200]  And sell all that out for some plastic Hollywood crud, this fake culture.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.200]  Exactly.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:30.200]  And I miss them dearly, just like I do miss America.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:32.200]  But I can keep them around.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.200]  I can revive them.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.200]  I can revive the idea just like you said.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.200]  It is that easy.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:42.200]  And my question is, explain to people that the delegates and the whole voting process,
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  because I think everybody gets nervous and scared.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.200]  Oh, no, Romney won New Hampshire.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200]  It's over.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:54.200]  No, Ron Paul, especially if he has such a big ground force, can actually get even more delegates than even what his percentage showed.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.200]  And he did that in Iowa too.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:58.200]  And people got to go.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.200]  They've got to be involved.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  They've got to be delegates.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:12.200]  That way, when they try to steal it from Ron Paul or whatever coming up at the convention, Ron Paul, people can basically do a lot of things.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:14.200]  They could force Ron Paul into the VP.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.200]  He probably wouldn't do that with somebody like Romney and Romney wouldn't do that.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  And I mean, who knows what can happen.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.200]  They keep telling us he can't win, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.200]  So that, well, we just expect he can't.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.200]  But we see that we're on the verge of breaking that hoax right now.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.200]  And we can make the hoax fully fall.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.200]  We've blown big holes on it, but it hadn't fallen completely.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  It will then boomerang and backfire like Judo on the globalist and will send Ron Paul over the top.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  All right, we'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:51:18.200]  And we've got a guest come on about 15 minutes. Stay with us.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:27.200]  For stickers and t-shirts at infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.200]  and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.200]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:41.200]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:51.200]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.200]  The war is here. It's an info war.
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:52:22.200]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:27.200]  It's not a dissatisfaction of smoking, but no smoking hazards.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:40.200]  Choose from a wide variety of our new American-made vapor yet e-liquid flavors at lasig.com, spelled L-E-C-I-G.com, or call 870-518-4307.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.200]  That's 870-518-4307.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.200]  Lasig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:54.200]  This morning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or cancer.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use. You must be 18 years or older to purchase.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:30.200]  All you do is just add water, and because they're sealed so well, they come with a 25-year shelf life.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:39.200]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.

[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:16.200]  Ron Paul, for 35 years or so, has been trying to wake people up about liberty.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:22.200]  Then he got challenged to run for Congress, and look now where he is and what he's done.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  Think of what you're going to do by being involved.
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:41.200]  You've got to think big but long-term, and as long as you wake just a few people up like the caller said earlier, and know that others are doing that, it's just exponential.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:48.200]  And I talk to people in grocery stores. I talk to people at restaurants. I talk to people at the park.
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:58.200]  I mean, people come up to me, hey, who are already awake, I take time to talk to them, because I appreciate the fact that they care about reality.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:03.200]  I appreciate the fact that we're growing our numbers to face down this evil.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:11.200]  Yeah, the government's passing laws saying it can arrest us and throw away the key. That just proves they're a bunch of crooks.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:21.200]  It shouldn't scare us, because we already knew they were crooks. They're just making sure and confessing, publicly confessing.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:28.200]  You should be afraid of not facing them down and getting people ready to defeat these people.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:36.200]  You don't protect yourself from tyrants by running and hiding. They always run wild in countries where people roll over.
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:40.200]  We're not going to roll over. You're like, yeah, but the public's a bunch of sheep.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:47.200]  If 30, 40, 50% doesn't know how to brush their teeth, it's not our fault. They're not in the game.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:57.200]  You go to a basketball game, there's 10,000 people in the stands, but there's a fraction of that on the floor.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:01.200]  Okay?
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:06.200]  So I'm going to say it again, folks, engage, get involved.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  That's what it's going to take. Let's go to Gary in Ohio. Gary, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  Thank you, Alex. Well, you're talking about let's get engaged. Let's do it right now.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:22.200]  People who study New World Order understand there's different factions within New World Order.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  And if you study them very deeply, you understand there's one thing they can't lie about, and that's dates.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  You talked about al-Qaeda being kind of got popular before.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:39.200]  Well, if you look at the date al-Qaeda was established, August 11, 1988, remember that number 11?
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  Because the two biggest attacks in al-Qaeda's history, what they're known for, is an attack on 9-11, which around the world is known as 9-11,
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  and an attack 9-11 days later in Madrid on 3-11.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:57:00.200]  When you go around and you look at the New World Order, you'll notice they start planning attacks on certain days, Alex.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:04.200]  And since you're born on the 11th, I'm sure you understand a little bit.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  You know, I know that the global controllers are totally obsessed with numerology, and they really believe in it.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.200]  I don't spend my time in things like that one way or the other.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:21.200]  I mean, I know they believe in it. I know they think it's sacred geometry and all this stuff.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.200]  But there's also a lot of big dates where people think things are going to happen and they don't.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:32.200]  But I know Madrid even came out in the Spanish Papers, was a government operation.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:35.200]  They were running a anti-terror drill. It turned out it was the cops that did it.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.200]  And then they blew up some patsies in a building to blame it on them.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:45.200]  I know 7-7, the head guy was MI-6 who was running the patsies. It appears they were part of a drill.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:48.200]  Some of them escaped, so they were shot at Canary Wharf.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:50.200]  That all came out in the news, but was buried.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:56.200]  The British government actually arrested the guy that made a video about it, exposing it. Incredible.
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:01.200]  But it actually went over to London right after it happened to cover it. We cover it in my film Terror Storm.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:07.200]  But that's basically it. I mean, on the issue of dates.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.200]  I just look at the facts of the case versus what dates they do it.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:18.200]  I mean, look at 7-7, 3-11, 9-11. You're right. Anything else?
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:21.200]  Well, if you look at, well, there's different days to do it.
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:25.200]  If you look at, like, not just 11, but 29. People signed equals 11.
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:30.200]  That's the day they crashed the Wall Street on 10th 29, 1929.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:36.200]  If you look at last year, on your birthday, they ousted Mubarak on 2-11, and that ousted Mubarak...
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:39.200]  Well, stay there. We'll come back and talk about it on the other side.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:59:08.200]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:19.200]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:23.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:27.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:32.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:37.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:43.200]  To get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:43.200 --> 02:00:09.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:31.200]  All right, Stuart Rhodes is coming up as a constitutional lawyer to look at the fact that you can't legalize tyranny.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:34.200]  Look at the NDAA, Ron Paul and more.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.200]  We'll continue with your calls.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.200]  Gary in Ohio, finishing up with you.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:46.200]  Yes, I know going back to the Babylonians, Egyptians, you name it, they are obsessed with numerology.
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  And you're certainly right about that, but you were going over the number 11 itself.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:01:00.200]  In certain factions within the New World Order, they're very obsessed with doing things on certain dates because they understand 11 deals with vibrational energy.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:10.200]  You are an emotional person, you're born on the 11th, they do things on the 11th, 292 plus 9 equals 11, they get emotional reaction out of people.
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:15.200]  You know a little bit about history, so let me just give you the story.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:19.200]  On 11-11 at exactly 11 o'clock, the Great War ended.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:25.200]  They made sure it ended on 11-11 at exactly 11 o'clock because you can't have peace on 11.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.200]  If you're in a numerology, you understand this, but here's how the story goes.
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:35.200]  From that peace treaty, there was a country created called the Second Republic of Poland.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:37.200]  It was created on 11-11.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.200]  What country was used to start World War II?
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.200]  Poland.
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:43.200]  Poland.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.200]  Exactly, when the Russians and the Nazis invaded.
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.200]  Now, we're looking at World War III of Iran.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  Being enough, Iran and the Islamic Republic was created on your birthday, Alex, 211.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:01.200]  You see how they put all the connecting pieces into place.
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:08.200]  JFK, he tried to break the back of the Federal Reserve on 6-4 1963.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:13.200]  If you add up the dates, 6-4 1963, add up to 292 plus 9 equals 11.
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.200]  He signed executive order 11-11 that day, 11-1-1-0.
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  He waited to that date of signing because he was trying to use numerology to break the Federal Reserve's back.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:28.200]  And by the way, JFK was born on the 29th, 2 plus 9 equals 11.
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.200]  We can go into politics about this.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:37.200]  Barack Obama born 8-4 1961, 8-4 1961 adds up to 29, 2 plus 9 equals 11.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:39.200]  Look at all the people from the Democratic side.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:46.200]  Bill Clinton born 8-19 1946, add everything up, 38, 3 and 8-11.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:50.200]  John McCain born on the 29th, Sarah Payne born on the 11th.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:55.200]  You see how they picked their profits?
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.200]  Yeah, how are they using numerology if they just so happen to be born on there?
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.200]  I guarantee you, I wasn't involved in any conspiracy.
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:03.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:10.200]  People who are born on the 11th and the 29th and who are 11, they have a certain level of charisma about them.
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:11.200]  Like you.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.200]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:16.200]  I'm not trying to laugh at you.
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:22.200]  It's just that the elite, I know we're really into numerology and I probably should study it more before I laugh.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:29.200]  It's just, I mean, if this is true, then the people running things are just out of their minds.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:33.200]  But I know that they make movies about what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:45.200]  Fox TV had basically the exact same thing that really happened on 9-11 on TV six months before where the government hijacked the jet by remote control to blame it on Al Qaeda,
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:52.200]  to fly it into the World Trade Center, to attack Afghanistan, but they use a drill to make NORAD stand down.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:59.200]  And then I even talked to the host of the show and he said, yeah, the CIA approached us and would plant these plots on us.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:05.200]  And then the question is, well, why did they want people to know what they were going to do before they did it?
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.200]  And the answer is they're into it lesser magic.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:17.200]  They believe that if they tell you what they're going to do before they do it, that gives it like good who'd you or whatever when they really do it.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.200]  And it's just, it's crazy.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.200]  But then people say, well, look, they're in control of it.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.200]  There must be something to it.
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:35.200]  It's just that I know they're into all this stuff. I just don't spend a lot of time looking into it because it's a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a McDonald's cheeseburger package.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.200]  I mean, I just don't know where it's going or what to do.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:41.200]  I mean, it just, it just, it just gives me a headache.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:48.200]  Oh man, I'm not really a very superstitious person, but I don't open umbrellas inside.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:50.200]  I don't walk under ladders.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:56.200]  I put my horseshoes, you know, feet standing up and I do knock on wood.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:59.200]  Why do I do that?
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:06.200]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:15.200]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:20.200]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:31.200]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:41.200]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:46.200]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:54.200]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:57.200]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:06.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:14.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:20.200]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:25.200]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:35.200]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:42.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:44.200]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:49.200]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:54.200]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:07:18.200]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:30.200]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:34.200]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:38.200]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:41.200]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:48.200]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:52.200]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:57.200]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:23.200]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.200]  And people said she got on, was very polite, didn't do anything wrong.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:34.200]  So now beating up bag ladies is what's going on.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:38.200]  And the cop comes over and gets in the guy's face who's videotaping it.
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:42.200]  And again, this just illustrates how this has become the norm.
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:46.200]  And people watch this around the world, even in third-world countries,
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:49.200]  where their police don't act like this and say, what's happened to America?
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:53.200]  The question is, what happened to the American people to just put up with this?
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:57.200]  Now Stuart Rhodes heads up Oath Keepers, he's a constitutional lawyer,
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:01.200]  worked in Ron Paul's staff as well, and of course,
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:05.200]  former Army veteran, a paratrooper who was retired out of the military
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.200]  in a parachuting accent.
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.200]  And he wrote his thesis in college on the history of basically military
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:17.200]  dictatorships and America's role and history in that with Lincoln and Stanton
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:21.200]  and what brought about Possecom and Tottis.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.200]  So we're going to be discussing that history and now how it ties into NDAA.
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:33.200]  But then I will, before he leaves, I promise we'll get to Rob and Sean
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:41.200]  and many others that are listening on stations like WJOC 1490 AM in Tennessee.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.200]  We'll talk to Sean and others that are holding.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.200]  And I do have some other news I want to get to as well,
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:51.200]  give us a condensed history of it because those that don't know history
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:52.200]  are doomed to repeat it.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.200]  Stuart Rhodes joins us.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.200]  I thought that I would add one more point to this too.
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:03.200]  I shot a video, you can simply search the term for,
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.200]  NDAA is a hoax, you cannot legalize tyranny.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:11.200]  Now, tyrants can criminally carry it out if not resistant,
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.200]  both through information warfare, the truth,
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  and physically if you're backs against the wall.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:25.200]  I mean, Hitler didn't have really the legal standing to go into Poland,
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.200]  but he did, or to go into France, but he did because he had people
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:30.200]  that would follow his criminal orders.
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:35.200]  Same thing with the Red Codes, same thing with white abolitionists
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.200]  who were hung by the hundreds for trying to free black slaves.
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:43.200]  Their argument was as a Christian, I don't believe that these people are animals
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.200]  and I think they're free souls and should be free.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.200]  They call them kooks and nuts and lunatics,
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:51.200]  but in the end their sacrifice came out on top
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.200]  and that's what scares evil.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.200]  That's why I always want you to think it's invincible.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:59.200]  And so they might try to carry out secret arrest of citizens
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:02.200]  disappearing us into black sites, black holes,
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:07.200]  but it only convicts the establishment is just as bad as we thought they were
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:12.200]  and verifies everything we've said and they're basically tattling on themselves.
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.200]  They're confessing in their hubris, in their attempt to intimidate people.
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.200]  They've gone from just lying about New World Order to going, yeah, you bet.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:25.200]  Uh-huh. We're spying on patriots, yeah, we'll arrest you.
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.200]  Yeah, we're getting ready for some new terror attacks.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.200]  We're going to blame on you.
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:31.200]  I mean, Democrats are putting out all these policy reports saying,
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:32.200]  gee, Oklahoma sure helped us.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  A new one's coming and we're going to arrest everybody.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:38.200]  I mean, that's even on Fox News.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:42.200]  So now they've moved into kind of a cornered, hissing,
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:49.200]  uh, mangy, you know, wolf in a corner snarling at us.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.200]  The problem is they've put us in a corner.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:54.200]  So there's no getting out of this without a fight.
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:56.200]  The question is what type of fight will it be?
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:59.200]  Do we work extra hard now to educate police and military?
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:03.200]  That will be the enforcers of this where the rubber meets the road?
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:07.200]  Or do we just shoot our mouths off and pile up giant amounts of guns
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:10.200]  and just say, well, let them come get it?
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:13.200]  I'd rather work as hard as I can to avert this.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:16.200]  And then if it comes, our numbers are that much greater.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.200]  That's the only sensible course.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:21.200]  And so you cannot legalize tyranny.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:23.200]  It's very, very simple.
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:26.200]  And again, he's founder and director of Oath Keeper,
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:28.200]  served as U.S. Army paratrooper until disabled
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:30.200]  in a rough terrain parachuting accident.
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.200]  During a night jump, former firearms instructor,
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.200]  former member of Ron Paul's D.C. staff,
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.200]  Stuart currently writes the monthly Enemy at the Gates column,
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  or did for SWAT Magazine.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.200]  He's a graduate of Yale Law School,
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:45.200]  where his paper, Solving the Puzzle of Enemy Combat Status,
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  won Yale's Miller Prize for Best Paper on Bill of Rights.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:54.200]  And he also is taught at the U.S. Military History at Yale.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.200]  He was a Yale research scholar and is also writing a book
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:02.200]  on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people,
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.200]  which has now happened, Oathkeepers.org.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:08.200]  Okay, Stuart, let's give people a snapshot of history.
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:12.200]  But first, let's get into my breakdown.
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:16.200]  And would you like to elaborate on that, or add anything to it?
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.200]  Whether you're correct, that's the response we have to have.
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:22.200]  I mean, we need to prepare for the very worst.
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.200]  And so, but on the way there, like you said,
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:27.200]  we have a very narrow wind of opportunity
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.200]  to raise the awareness of the American people
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:33.200]  and to do all we can through peaceful means.
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.200]  And while we're doing that, just saying what the founders did,
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:38.200]  they exhausted all their peaceful means,
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:42.200]  but they also rallied more people to the cause,
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.200]  won more people over, and steeled them up and hardened them,
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.200]  and got them ready for the confrontation.
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.200]  And that's what we have to do, both things.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:55.200]  And so, what I encourage people to do is go look at what
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:00.200]  Jefferson and Madison did in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798,
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.200]  which were a gross violation of the First Amendment.
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:05.200]  They did two things at the same time.
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.200]  One, they nullified.
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.200]  They went to the states and said,
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.200]  you have an obligation to interpose and nullify.
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:14.200]  You said, anything contrary to the Constitution
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:16.200]  is null and void from inception.
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:18.200]  It is not law. It is nothing.
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:20.200]  So that's the attitude we have to have.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:23.200]  We do not give it any recognition whatsoever.
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:27.200]  You can say they passed an unconstitutional, invalid statute,
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:30.200]  but it is not lawful. We do not recognize it.
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:32.200]  That's what Jefferson and Madison did.
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:35.200]  They didn't go to the federal courts and begged them to recognize
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  that this was a gross violation of the First Amendment.
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.200]  They went to the state legislature and said,
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  you have an obligation.
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:42.200]  So they nullified.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:44.200]  Those who don't know, they tried to bring in tyranny
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:46.200]  just a few years after our country got on its feet,
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:48.200]  and the original founders got together and said,
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.200]  lock and load. We're going to try to peacefully back them off.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  But if they don't, it's another war.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:58.200]  Right. The Alien Sedition Acts criminalized speech.
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:01.200]  You had newspaper editors, reporters, and writers
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.200]  being arrested for criticizing the president, John Adams,
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.200]  the second president of the United States.
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:11.200]  And the federalists were doing this during the kind of
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.200]  quasi-war with France.
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.200]  So throughout history, it's always during wartime
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:20.200]  that they try to convince you you must give up your liberty
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  in the name of fighting the war.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.200]  And so the federalists, in the name of fighting the war
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:27.200]  against the French, the undeclared war against the French,
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  tried to silence dissent.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.200]  And so Jefferson and Madison, like I said,
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:33.200]  they dated two things at once.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.200]  They said it was null and void from inception
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:37.200]  in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions.
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.200]  The state stood up.
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:41.200]  But they also started a whole new political party
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  and they swept the federalists out of office
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:47.200]  in what's now called the Revolution of 1800.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:50.200]  Jefferson was elected president and they swept
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.200]  all the federalists out of Congress.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.200]  And so that's what we need to do right now in response
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:59.200]  to this atrocious, unconstitutional, intolerable act.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:01.200]  And history repeats itself.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  We didn't have such fraud and modern mind control.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.200]  Undoubtedly, he'd be the presumptive nominee.
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:07.200]  He would defeat Obama.
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:09.200]  And we would see a repeat.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:12.200]  We're just in worse states than our founders were.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:16.200]  Yeah, Ron Paul is Jefferson.
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.200]  Let me take off my Oathkeeper hat for a second
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.200]  and just say that as an individual,
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:24.200]  I endorse Ron Paul as an individual veteran
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:27.200]  of combat arms and airborne as a legal scholar.
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:29.200]  There is nobody else out there
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  who is going to defend the Constitution like he will.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:35.200]  All the rest of them would have been just like McCain
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:37.200]  who wrote the NDAA.
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:39.200]  Obama has already committed treason.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.200]  He's killing American citizens.
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:44.200]  He's declared himself an elected dictator, essentially.
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.200]  And the rest of them up there, Romney, Gingrich, Santorum,
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:49.200]  they'd all be the same.
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:52.200]  So, you know, this is your Jefferson.
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:56.200]  Ron Paul is the closest thing to a modern Jefferson there is.
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:57.200]  He's like Jefferson reincarnate.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.200]  And if you don't vote for him,
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:04.200]  you are furthering us on that road to having no choice
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.200]  but to fight for our freedom again.
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:09.200]  Isn't it curious how many historians and scholars have noted
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.200]  that history repeats?
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:13.200]  I mean, it doesn't so much repeat as it rhymes
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:15.200]  who was it that said history rhymes?
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:18.200]  That was Mark Twain.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:21.200]  I mean, it really does go in these cycles.
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.200]  Well, it does.
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.200]  It's always warfare.
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.200]  If you look at after the alien sedition acts,
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.200]  they put that genie back in the bottle.
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:31.200]  They had the peaceful revolution in 1800, took care of it.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.200]  But then you came, then came the Civil War.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:37.200]  And it was in the Civil War in the name again of national security
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:40.200]  that Lincoln became essentially an elected dictator.
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:42.200]  He imprisoned newspaper editors.
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:44.200]  He imprisoned congressmen.
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  He even wrote an arrest warrant out for Chief Justice Taney
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:53.200]  when he balked against his suspension of habeas corpus.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:56.200]  So, you know, he just decided he's going to do whatever he wanted to do
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.200]  and all of his supporters in the Republican Party,
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:01.200]  the original Republican Party, were all for it.
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:04.200]  And in the north, this is the precedent.
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:08.200]  This is the first time that the power of the president
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:11.200]  and his commander-in-chief was used against the American people.
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:15.200]  He claimed the authority, much like Bush and Obama,
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  he claimed the authority to apply the laws of war,
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:22.200]  not just to the breakaway southern states that had seceded
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  and become their own country.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:27.200]  He also applied the laws of war to Northerners.
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:32.200]  And the Supreme Court in 1866 and the ex-Party Milligan case
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:34.200]  ruled that unconstitutional.
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:37.200]  But that's a case that came after the war was over.
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:40.200]  And it doesn't matter, though, whenever they're taking over states today,
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:42.200]  they always go back to what Lincoln did,
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:45.200]  which in the north was undoubtedly classical tyranny.
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.200]  I mean, I understand the more sophisticated nuances of the British manipulating the south and all of it.
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.200]  It's always a double game.
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:57.200]  But undoubtedly, then, Stanton after that and executing people extrajudicially.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:00.200]  And in modern times, they're pointing at that
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:02.200]  and saying they'll use it against us.
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:07.200]  Well, exactly. They sweep under the rug the fact that the Supreme Court ruled
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:10.200]  all of that completely unconstitutional.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.200]  In ex-Party Milligan, in this case, it was the case of a man
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:16.200]  who was accused of violating the laws of war.
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.200]  He was a citizen of Indiana.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.200]  He was a civilian.
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.200]  But he was accused of violating the laws of war.
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.200]  And Lincoln had detained 15,000 American Northerners
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:27.200]  under military jurisdiction.
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.200]  And he had tried almost 5,000 of them by military tribunal.
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.200]  And this guy was one of those.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.200]  And so they said, look, the laws of war apply to him
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:40.200]  and therefore a military tribunal is always going to get.
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:42.200]  That was the argument of the government lawyers.
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.200]  And in fact, they said this to the Bill of Rights.
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:50.200]  They said, these, in truth, are all peace provisions of the Constitution.
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:54.200]  And like all other conventional and legislative laws and enactments,
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:56.200]  are silent amidst arms.
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:57.200]  Stay there. We're going to be right back.
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:59.200]  Stuart Rose, we're going to go back to that quote on the other side.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:01.200]  This is key. Know your history, folks.

[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.200]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers investment advisors
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:36.200]  won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:39.200]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:42.200]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:45.200]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:50.200]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:56.200]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.

[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.200]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:34.200]  amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:38.200]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own.
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:41.200]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts,
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.200]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:48.200]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator

[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:27.200]  It will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:31.200]  The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:36.200]  you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:38.200]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:41.200]  or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:44.200]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:46.200]  have already seen in the last four months.
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:47.200]  Prepare now.
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:52.200]  Go to 123survivalplan.com and learn which 37 food items
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:53.200]  you should hoard.
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:56.200]  Easy to remember, 123survivalplan.com.
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:24:22.200]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:36.200]  Yeah, sometimes Satan.
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:41.200]  Yeah, the new old order says they're doing all this to keep us safe.
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:44.200]  But they're not doing that, are they?
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:47.200]  You know, Stuart, looking at history, and I want to continue here with you
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:50.200]  on the history, then look at what's happening with Ron Paul right now
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:51.200]  and take some calls.
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:54.200]  But tyrants behave the same as well.
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.200]  They always have to hire a bunch of people that'll follow any order.
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:02.200]  So then over a short period of time, the very worst gravitate
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:03.200]  into the positions of power.
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:06.200]  And so the tyranny degenerates quickly
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:09.200]  and always causes a rebellion against it
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:13.200]  because even the sheep are forced to stand up just for self-preservation.
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:18.200]  So there's a wild frenzy that ensues.
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.200]  And we're now seeing just government getting crazier
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:26.200]  and wilder and more arrogant and frothing by the moment.
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:27.200]  Please continue.
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.200]  You've gotten up to the Civil War.
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:30.200]  Right.
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:34.200]  In that case, about the use of military tribunal
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.200]  against an American citizen in the North,
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.200]  the Supreme Court in 1866,
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:45.200]  the government lawyers argued the exact same thing we're hearing now.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:49.200]  They said by the Constitution, as originally adopted,
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:52.200]  no limitations were put upon the war-making
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:56.200]  and war-conducting powers of Congress and the President.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  And then as a fallback, they said,
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:02.200]  finally, if the military tribunal has no jurisdiction,
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:05.200]  the petitioner may be held as a prisoner of war,
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:08.200]  aiding with arms the enemies of the United States
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:11.200]  and held under the authority of the United States
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:13.200]  until the war terminates,
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.200]  which is exactly the argument that Bush made
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:19.200]  and Obama and now Congress in the NDAA,
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:23.200]  the same argument that the powers of the Commander-in-Chief
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:24.200]  are unlimited.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:28.200]  Yeah, if you've got such proof that somebody is aiding a foreign military,
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:29.200]  put the proof up.
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:31.200]  That's why we have trials.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  Oh, no, not only will we secretly arrest you,
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.200]  we'll never even have a public trial
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.200]  and no one must know that we grabbed you.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:40.200]  I mean, that's open tyranny right there.
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:42.200]  That's always the greatest threat.
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.200]  Well, the Constitution mandates an Article III
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:50.200]  Section II, that all crimes must be tried by jury.
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:55.200]  And then Article III, Section III, defines the crime of treason.
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:59.200]  And it defines it as making war against the United States
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.200]  or aiding its enemies.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.200]  That is the definition of treason.
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.200]  And so today, they're circumventing that trial requirement
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:10.200]  for a plain text of the treason clause
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:12.200]  and they're circumventing the Bill of Rights
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:14.200]  just like the Lincoln administration did.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:16.200]  Well, let's take that plain reading.
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:19.200]  If you're waging war or aiding the enemies,
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:21.200]  the Congress is pretty much globalist run.
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:24.200]  They actually fit the original treason definition.
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:27.200]  They're waging war against our Bill of Rights Constitution,
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  our free market, our private property,
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.200]  our sovereignty, our borders.
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:33.200]  They are the tyrants.
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:34.200]  Don't just say that.
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  They are traitors.
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:37.200]  They are treasonous.
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:38.200]  Exactly.
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:41.200]  Well, they fit the exact definition of treason,
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.200]  making war against the American people.
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.200]  They're asserting the power of the president
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:48.200]  to treat the American people exactly the same
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.200]  as if they were Iraqi.
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:50.200]  Because we're America.
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:52.200]  I see these newscasts where the government's getting ready
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:53.200]  to deal with their main threat.
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.200]  Us, the American people, what?
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  We're the government.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:58.200]  We're the people.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:00.200]  Romans 13, we're the government.
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:01.200]  Render unto us.
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  It's our country.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  Now, I want to read you what the Supreme Court had to say
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:08.200]  in 1866.
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:11.200]  They rejected completely that argument.
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.200]  They said, even these provisions, the Bill of Rights,
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:17.200]  expressed in such plain English words
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:20.200]  that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  are now, after the lapse of more than 70 years,
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.200]  sought to be avoided.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:29.200]  Those great and good men foresaw that troublesome times
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:32.200]  would arise when rulers and people would become
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:36.200]  restive under restraint and seek by sharp and decisive
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:40.200]  measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper.
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:43.200]  And that the principles of constitutional liberty
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:48.200]  would be in peril unless established by irreparable law.
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:50.200]  That's what the Bill of Rights is.
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:51.200]  It's irreparable law.
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  They understood human nature.
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.200]  They understood that people can be driven by fear
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:57.200]  to give up their freedom.
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:00.200]  And that's why you have a Bill of Rights
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:03.200]  that leaves it out of the reach of the people
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.200]  even when they're afraid.
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:05.200]  And it's the highest level.
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:08.200]  Nothing can abridge it because it only enshrines
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:12.200]  inherent organic rights that are unalienable.
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:13.200]  That's right.
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:15.200]  And the Constitution would never have been ratified
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:17.200]  without the promise of the Bill of Rights.
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:19.200]  And when you read the preamble of the Bill of Rights,
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:21.200]  it tells you what its purpose is.
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:24.200]  It is to prevent misconstruction.
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:28.200]  It is to prevent abusive powers granted in the Constitution
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:30.200]  and prevent misconstruction.
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:33.200]  And yet they willfully misconstrued it.
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:34.200]  They did it back then.
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:35.200]  They're doing it now.
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:39.200]  The Congress and the President are in open treason
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:42.200]  by the very constitutional definition.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:45.200]  And of course they're engaged in other criminal activities
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.200]  like Fast and Furious.
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:50.200]  They are the enemy of America.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.200]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:54.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:57.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.200]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:05.200]  a decade into the 21st century?
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:07.200]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:09.200]  If not yours, your neighbors.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:11.200]  Thankful for the unemployment checks
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:12.200]  since you were laid off.
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:15.200]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.200]  in hopes of a Christmas gift
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:19.200]  along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:23.200]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.200]  The fact is, in all this craziness,
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:27.200]  there's only one thing you can control.
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:30.200]  Your greatest dependency, your food supply.
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:33.200]  Make 2012 the year you take control
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:35.200]  by getting prepared.

[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:06.200]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:10.200]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:12.200]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:15.200]  The United States has now recognized globally
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:18.200]  as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:21.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:23.200]  of a secret network of FEMA cares,
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:25.200]  now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:27.200]  This documentary exposes how the continuity
[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:29.200]  of government program has established
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:31.200]  an old powerful shadow state.
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.200]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:35.200]  to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.200]  Prepare to enter the secretive world
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:39.200]  of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:42.200]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:45.200]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:48.200]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.200 --> 02:31:50.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:51.200]  It's here.

[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:38.200]  that is totally illegitimate
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.200]  and has been caught committing so many crimes
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.200]  it's dizzying
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:45.200]  for special interest profits
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:47.200]  and now they're openly selling
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:49.200]  shutting down free speech on the web
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:52.200]  and checkpoints and TSA checkpoints,
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:56.200]  total federalization, 10th, 9th amendment violations.
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:58.200]  They're not just eating around the edges now.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:01.200]  They are in full assault
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.200]  on the heart of every basic liberty,
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:06.200]  not even our Constitution or Bill of Rights,
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.200]  the finest example of it.
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  They are burrowing into Magna Carta.
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  They are annihilating just common sense.
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:15.200]  They are trying to manifest
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:21.200]  every even absurdist dystopic cartoonism of tyranny.
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.200]  But they're setting it up beside us
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:26.200]  while liberty still is practiced and is ongoing
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:29.200]  and the two rails are now going towards
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:31.200]  a collision course.
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:34.200]  That's right, that they've created the second track
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:37.200]  exactly like was done in Nazi Germany
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:39.200]  and Stalinist Russia
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.200]  and unfortunately during the Civil War
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.200]  in the United States.
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.200]  But the Supreme Court put that genie
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.200]  back in the bottle in 1866.
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:50.200]  Lincoln opened the let the genie
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:52.200]  lose of martial law,
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:54.200]  used martial law.
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:56.200]  The Supreme Court ruled this.
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:58.200]  Here's what they said.
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:01.200]  No usage of war could sanction a military trial
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  for any offense whatever
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  of a citizen in civil life
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.200]  in no wise connecting with the military service.
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.200]  Congress could grant no such power
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:14.200]  and the honor of our national legislature be it said.
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:17.200]  It has never been provoked by the state of the country
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:20.200]  even to attempt its exercise.
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:22.200]  Even in the Civil War,
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:24.200]  Congress didn't try
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:27.200]  to authorize military trial.
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:29.200]  So the current Congress
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.200]  has gone even further
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:34.200]  than what they did during the Civil War.
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:36.200]  The court said one of the plaintest
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:38.200]  constitutional provisions was
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:40.200]  therefore infringed
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:42.200]  when Milligan was tried by a court
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:45.200]  not ordained and established by Congress
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:47.200]  and not composed of judges
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.200]  appointed during good behavior.
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:52.200]  In other words, not an Article III court,
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:54.200]  not a jury trial.
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:56.200]  What happened then
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:58.200]  is precisely the same thing
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.200]  that's happening now
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:02.200]  and it's also exactly what the Founders faced.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:04.200]  You look at the Declaration of Independence,
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:06.200]  they list among the grievances
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:08.200]  is denial of jury trial
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:10.200]  and also the attempt
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:12.200]  to impose upon them a jurisdiction
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:14.200]  foreign to their constitution
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:17.200]  and back then what Parliament had done
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:19.200]  to the statutes that expanded
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Courts
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  is a way to strip the colonists
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  of their ancient right to jury trial.
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:27.200]  And the exact same thing is being done
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:29.200]  here again. So what happens
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:31.200]  as the crooks who admittedly
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  they get caught inside our trading,
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.200]  so Congress says, well, it's legal for us too
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:37.200]  because we say so. Again, another
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:39.200]  pure, tyrant statement,
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.200]  the pure, the pure precept
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.200]  that I'm the leader, I can do whatever I want.
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  What happens as
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  it becomes manifest that it is illegitimate,
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.200]  it is fraudulent,
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:51.200]  it's got a gaggle of
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:53.200]  criminals posing as media
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.200]  deceiving and dissembling the truth
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:57.200]  over the public, they've seized
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.200]  the infrastructure, they're accelerating
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.200]  the dismantling of the country,
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  they're demonizing Americans who actually
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:05.200]  know that they're the enemy
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:07.200]  and foreign and illegitimate
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:09.200]  and it's all hurtling towards
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:11.200]  confrontation and the enemy
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:13.200]  knows that we're now awake to them
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.200]  and instead of just being hubris filled
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.200]  is scrabbling quickly
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.200]  to try to man the parapets
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  against us
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:23.200]  as the economic collapse accelerates.
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.200]  Well, they understand
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:27.200]  it's a two-way window
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:29.200]  like you've said for a long time.
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:31.200]  It goes both ways at the two-way window.
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.200]  They understand that the more extreme
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:35.200]  they get and the more illegitimate they get
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:37.200]  the more the curtains pull back
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.200]  and we see the little man behind the curtain
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.200]  and we realize how illegitimate and fraudulent
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:43.200]  he is and so
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:45.200]  they're taking the mask off but in many ways
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.200]  that's helping us. The NDAA
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  is a gift to the freedom movement.
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.200]  I mean they were already claiming these powers
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.200]  both Bush and Obama already
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.200]  used these powers. Bush
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.200]  detained two American citizens
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  Jose Padilla and Yasser Hamdi
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:01.200]  and Obama just started killing American citizens
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:03.200]  so they're already doing it anyway.
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:05.200]  So I like the fact
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:07.200]  that they were brazen enough to put it
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  right there in black and white
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:11.200]  congressional statute because now it's
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:13.200]  waking Americans up. Finally
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.200]  I mean I've been saying this for
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:17.200]  since 2001 I've been streaming about this
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  and it was hard to get anybody to listen to it
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.200]  but now they understand that they are
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.200]  destroying the Bill of Rights. It's not a conspiracy
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.200]  theory, it's right in their face
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.200]  and so it's a tool for us to wake them up.
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  So but getting
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.200]  back to the history real quick after
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:33.200]  that attempt to
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:35.200]  apply the laws of war after that usage
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.200]  was ruled unconstitutional
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:39.200]  by the Supreme Court in 1866.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.200]  It was never used again
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:43.200]  until
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  1942 during World War II
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.200]  by FDR.
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:49.200]  There were eight German saboteurs that came
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.200]  ashore. One of them claimed to be a
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  US citizen. They were captured and tried
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:55.200]  by Tribunal.
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.200]  And the court in that case, in Ex parte
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:59.200]  Quarin
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.200]  the same New Deal court that
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.200]  found it okay to
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.200]  in turn the Japanese Americans
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  over 100,000 US citizens
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:09.200]  the same court that gave FDR
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.200]  everything else he wanted in the New Deal
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:13.200]  unrestrained power, they ruled
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  that the citizenship
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.200]  of the saboteur
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  was irrelevant.
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:21.200]  They ruled that what counted
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  so the court said
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  was what he was accused of doing
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  so because he was accused of violating
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  the laws of war, the court ruled
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:31.200]  that he would get a military
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  tribunal rather than a jury trial.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  They totally
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.200]  upturned the Ex parte Milligan
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.200]  decision in 1866.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:41.200]  They totally ignored the Trees and Claws
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.200]  and violated the Constitution
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  grossly. And that is the precedent
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:47.200]  that after that was not used
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  again until post 9-11.
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.200]  And that's the precedent
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  Ex parte Quarin of the Bush administration
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.200]  reached back to from 1942
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:57.200]  and grabbed it and said, hey look
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.200]  we can do whatever we want
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.200]  even to American citizens.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:03.200]  But let's get to the heart of this.
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:05.200]  We're told this is done to stop Al Qaeda
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.200]  who's been given Libya who's being used
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:09.200]  to attack Iran all on record
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.200]  and when you get all the internal
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:13.200]  documents and the Mayak and Homeland
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.200]  Security reports and all the rest of it
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  it's admitted as you know
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.200]  but for the audience and maybe new listeners
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:21.200]  that it's all about conservatives
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  libertarians, patriots, oath keepers,
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.200]  Ron Paul, Bob Barr,
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:27.200]  Alex Jones, filmmakers
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:29.200]  it's clearly an attack on the
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:31.200]  American people and they're training the police for this
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  none of it has to do with
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:35.200]  the Arab terrorist that they were
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  first selling. So they always sell
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:39.200]  on an unpopular minority just like Hitler
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  did then it's expanded on
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:43.200]  to everyone and it's just
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.200]  so transparent we've got to get that
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:47.200]  message out but I mean
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.200]  constitutionally obviously it's the 10th
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.200]  amendment, 9th amendment because it's a jurisdiction
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:53.200]  and then it's a 4th amendment but all over the
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.200]  country now they're having federally run
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:57.200]  and there's a new one if you read the fine print
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.200]  the Orange County Register is reporting on this
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.200]  we can put it on screen. Police
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  use a roadblock to gather serial killer
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:05.200]  information and the last few
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.200]  months three homeless have been stabbed
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.200]  in a town so they go out on a highway
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  and it shows video of it
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.200]  shut down the highway
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:15.200]  and ask people if they
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  saw anything I mean this is completely
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  random makes no sense
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:21.200]  and it's the feds running and it turns
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:23.200]  out it's basically a TSA
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:25.200]  icebreaker of
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.200]  why they're setting up unconstitutional
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:29.200]  checkpoints and that many other
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:31.200]  areas they've been dispensed with that they just actually
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  just pull you out of your car and search it
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  but I mean you can clearly see them
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:37.200]  testing the perch you can see
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:39.200]  them you know really trying
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  oh the army's here to help
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  search your car for alcohol
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  oh the Marines are here
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.200]  you know now we see the military on the streets
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  I mean they're really and then that's the
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  proof of the criminality is that they're
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  doing it incrementally by design
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:55.200]  to acclimate everyone involved
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  yeah exactly like
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.200]  like you said it was just like what they did
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:01.200]  in Nazi Germany the Reich
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.200]  talk fire decree was the reaction to the
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.200]  burning of the legislature and it was
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  aimed supposedly aimed at the communists
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  but then they immediately expanded it
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  out from there to trade unionist
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  and then to Jews and on down the
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.200]  line and the same thing is
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  going to happen here is happening right now
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:19.200]  the demonization as you said is
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:21.200]  targeted at constitutionalist
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  targeted at you know veterans
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.200]  targeted at
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.200]  conservatives and libertarians
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  and one thing people need to understand
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.200]  is that there was a law review
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  article written back in 1996
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  right after Oklahoma City
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:37.200]  where two lawyers argued
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:39.200]  that the laws of war should be
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  used against McVeigh
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  to triumph by military tribunal and
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.200]  they also said that Clinton should use
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  the laws of war against
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  the militia movement and they cited
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:51.200]  to the X Part A
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  case from 1942 and they argued
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:55.200]  that it should be updated and used
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:57.200]  against terrorist suspects
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.200]  and so that is
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:01.200]  precisely what they argued and wanted
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.200]  is what has now been put in place
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:05.200]  first by the Bush administration
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  and so the original idea
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:09.200]  of using the laws of war
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.200]  against terrorism was
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:13.200]  actually first thought of
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  about it would be used
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:17.200]  against right wing
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:19.200]  domestic terrorist
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  and right wing radicals
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.200]  that was the first
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:25.200]  proposed use during the Clinton
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:27.200]  administration but Clinton didn't do it
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.200]  but Bush then did
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:31.200]  what Clinton did not do
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:33.200]  he updated that
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:35.200]  the old 1942 case
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:37.200]  and applied it to the so called war on terror
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:39.200]  and so now
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:41.200]  what Clinton did not have
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:43.200]  at his fingertips Bush put
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:45.200]  in place and now Obama has
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:47.200]  got the ring of power out of the Lord of the Rings
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.200]  it's right there on his desk
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:51.200]  whatever he wants to
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:53.200]  he can grab it and use it
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:55.200]  and notice he went through all these different
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:57.200]  manipulations where
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:59.200]  it didn't affect citizens
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:01.200]  but then it did affect citizens
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:03.200]  but don't worry we won't
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:05.200]  use it against
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:07.200]  citizens but oh he's going to veto it
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:09.200]  so it's okay and then he does sign it
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.200]  I mean they're using laws of war
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:13.200]  against us we're the enemy
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:15.200]  of all deception but look at this article
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.200]  police use roadblock
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:19.200]  to gather serial killer information
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:21.200]  if you scroll down to the video
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:23.200]  on the Orange County Register it shows a major
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:25.200]  highway shutdown
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.200]  and people pull up
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:29.200]  to FBI with clipboards demanding
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.200]  they answer questions I mean this is clearly
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:33.200]  just turning everything into the TSA
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  and then they use
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:37.200]  an excuse
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.200]  to sell the public on it we're trying to get
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:41.200]  a serial killer no they're not
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.200]  so well this isn't how you find a serial killer
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  I mean it's just all about
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.200]  them seizing the roads
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:49.200]  seizing the infrastructure and training us
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:51.200]  that they will stop us when they want
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:53.200]  and we will answer their questions when they want
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:55.200]  I mean again this is an FBI
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.200]  that ships guns into Mexico
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:59.200]  to blame the Second Amendment this is a
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:01.200]  government
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:03.200]  that is terrorist
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:05.200]  I don't know what else to say
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.200]  what would you do if you just pull up to a checkpoint
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:09.200]  with the FBI out of their jurisdiction
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:11.200]  on a major highway
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:13.200]  in the middle of California
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:15.200]  in Orange County
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:17.200]  in Anaheim demanding to
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:19.200]  basically you know answer
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:21.200]  their ghoulish questions I mean it's just
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:23.200]  it's so sick these people are so sick and of course
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:25.200]  we have to you have to refuse we have to
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.200]  use civil disobedience and you have to
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.200]  nullify as individuals we have to start
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:31.200]  refusing
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:33.200]  and withdrawing our consent and
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.200]  something else that has this idea that
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:37.200]  if anything could ever kill you we've got
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:39.200]  to have checkpoints there so oh my
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:41.200]  gosh three homeless have been stabbed to death here
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.200]  and so we'll just
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:45.200]  start shutting down the entire area and making
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:47.200]  you all prisoners I mean do people see
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:49.200]  this is the perfect excuse to take over
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:51.200]  everything at the military industrial
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:53.200]  complex is eating America right now
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:55.200]  well
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  I think more Americans are waking up to
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.200]  the fact and and like I said that's
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  that's what's good about this is the more
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:03.200]  they
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:05.200]  overstep and the more they do this the more
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:07.200]  it wakes us up but we have to
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:09.200]  if we wait too long
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.200]  to fix this
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:13.200]  then we will become
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:15.200]  acclimated it's a choice between
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  becoming the fourth Reich
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.200]  you know are we 1934 Germany
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.200]  where they just quietly went along
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:23.200]  with it and and and sat
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:25.200]  down and shut up because they were afraid
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  of being jailed or
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:29.200]  are we 1774
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  America in the spirit of
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:33.200]  76 you know that's what we have to
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:35.200]  choose and let's expand on that
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:37.200]  I mean let's expand on that this is the
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:39.200]  entire acclimation
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:41.200]  program
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:43.200]  and they really want to get us ready for
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:45.200]  checkpoints everywhere so you're on a pickup
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.200]  list and you don't know and you pull up and
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:49.200]  they grab you disappear
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:51.200]  and I want to warn the police and others I mean once
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:53.200]  it goes to this level
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:55.200]  you're not going to have
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.200]  a very safe job I'll tell you right now
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:46:59.200]  and well you know I've talked to veterans
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.200]  already across the country
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:03.200]  and they all say the same
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:05.200]  thing they say well how do I know
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:07.200]  if I get pulled over by a police officer
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:09.200]  how do I know it's a normal
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  police stop that is not
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:13.200]  some black bag thing they'll be turned over
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:15.200]  to the Department of Defense and taken off
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:17.200]  like Guantanamo and my answer now is
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:19.200]  well you know right now they probably
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:21.200]  won't do that but that's where we were
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  headed and like you said
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  once the first one is detained
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  like that every other veteran
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  every other American out there is going to be like
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:31.200]  well hey I will not know
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  I'm going to assume the worst and I'm going to
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:35.200]  resist and a lot of them already told me that
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:37.200]  that when that day comes and they see
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  that they're actually in danger
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:41.200]  of being black bag they will not
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:43.200]  allow themselves to be handcuffed
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:45.200]  even by a police officer because
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  they will not know because the government is
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:49.200]  illegitimate I mean again
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:51.200]  look at these quotes almost every comment
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:55.200]  here in the Orange County and there's hundreds of them
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  what a dumb idea really a roadblock
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.200]  and most people driving in Orange County
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:01.200]  have no clue who is actually sitting next to them
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.200]  in a vehicle let alone
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  clues to who
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:07.200]  some bum was
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:09.200]  hacked to death in a dirty river
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  bed miles away here's another one
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200]  it goes on civil rights
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200]  violation that sounds like Nazi
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.200]  checkpoint with regular citizens having no
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  rights do our police really believe
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:21.200]  they have gathered this much power that
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.200]  they can just start doing this
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:25.200]  yeah their bosses who were criminals tell
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.200]  me that they're just perched testing
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  it goes on complete violation
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.200]  of Terry versus Ohio
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  and here's a minion kudos to the special
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.200]  task force you're done
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:37.200]  you're out in the community
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.200]  trying to get things done good job
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  guys you probably works in the county
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.200]  your ignorance of your rights could not
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.200]  be more complete terror management
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.200]  theory at its best
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  and it just goes on with the comments
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.200]  almost no one buying
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:53.200]  any of this information it seems
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.200]  to me that they are stopping people with hope
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.200]  of raising revenue yet they did do some arrest
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  and sticker tickets while they were at it
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.200]  it was all just a sickening excuse under
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  federal ghoul control I guess
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.200]  the feds weren't busy shipping guns out little
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:07.200]  kids out of the country it goes on to say
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:09.200]  I do not think that they will uncover much
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:11.200]  stopping many people because they are
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:13.200]  in the area maybe
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  I'm wrong is this even legal
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  a random checkpoint to interview potential
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  witnesses seriously no fourth amendment
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.200]  issues here and it just goes
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:23.200]  on and on and on
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  and on and on and on
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:27.200]  and on and on the good news
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:29.200]  is Stuart we're not buying
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  it are we no
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.200]  and more Americans across the country are
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  not buying it and that's
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.200]  why we are different than the
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:39.200]  Germans that's why it will not
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  go the same way
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  as Germany just slid into a
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  dark tyranny with a little
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  whimper we will not go that
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  what about 3 million guns 1.5
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:51.200]  million plus instant checks
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:53.200]  in the month of December alone breaking all records
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.200]  I mean there aren't even liberals anymore in this country
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  that know how to talk
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  I mean so-called liberals are all buying weapons
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.200]  and everything I mean
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  what does the new order think they've done Stuart
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  every liberal I know is
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:07.200]  arming to the teeth and is waking up
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:09.200]  and we just had El Paso County
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.200]  Colorado pass a resolution
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.200]  against the NDA
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  nullifying it and that's what
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  has to happen across the country
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:19.200]  and in fact I'm going to a meeting
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  this weekend in Topeka
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.200]  Kansas where we're bringing legislators
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:25.200]  and activists in from all over the country
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  and we're going to draft
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.200]  model resolutions and build on what was already
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.200]  done in El Paso County Colorado
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  and spread the message
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  of nullification the local level
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  towns counties and states
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.200]  yeah it's happening and
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  you know the feds can say well that
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:43.200]  we nullify that no we nullify you
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:45.200]  you work for offshore banks
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:47.200]  you individually may not be a criminal
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  but you work for a system

[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:15.200]  but look at another one of these comments here
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.200]  on the Orange County Register
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.200]  where they have giant fed run
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:21.200]  checkpoints searching and
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:23.200]  demanding answers from people about a serial killer
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.200]  miles away in some ravine
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:27.200]  stabbing homeless people
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:29.200]  weeks after
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.200]  one of the commenters, Rick Moreno
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:33.200]  says, if you have any information
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.200]  don't call
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:37.200]  you might get, he mentions local police
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.200]  you might get a better response calling
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  Anaheim or the FBI
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:43.200]  I called
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  the town more than three weeks ago
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:47.200]  when the video came out of the bank robbers
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  asking for any information
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:51.200]  that someone might have
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:53.200]  I left three messages for two different detectives
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.200]  and never did they call me back
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:57.200]  or even a thank you
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:59.200]  even though my info was good
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  now folks, I've called the homeland security
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.200]  numbers on air that they have on TV
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  if there's terrorist, no one ever calls you
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.200]  or if you say, I know where terrorists are
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:09.200]  they're like, okay
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  name and number, they never call you
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.200]  I mean, I know that the heads of al-Qaeda
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:15.200]  meet at the Pentagon, I have all the documents
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:17.200]  and they're just like, mm-hmm
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:19.200]  even if you just say, I have information on terrorists
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:21.200]  they don't call you back, it's all fake
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:23.200]  they don't know it
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:25.200]  they know it
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:27.200]  Austin's got tens of millions of dollars
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.200]  in the last decade on
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:31.200]  million and a half dollar robots
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:33.200]  and they go out once a week and blow up a cardboard box
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:35.200]  on the highway in NINI
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:37.200]  and it's just all about milking us
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  it's just a total scam
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200]  and a state of fear
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.200]  while the criminal city council robs everyone
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  I'm sorry, Stuart Rhodes comments on this
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  well, you're right
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  it's like a disease
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  that has been castacized
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  and spread and it's the same thing
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.200]  the founders faced, right
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  a swarm of officers
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  sent out to eat away at their substance
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:01.200]  I mean, everything
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  that we're experiencing, they experience
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.200]  that's why we should call
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.200]  people who want checkpoints
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:09.200]  and all of that should be called loyalists
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:11.200]  and they should be given
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.200]  we should give them red coats as gifts
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.200]  and that's their bad
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:17.200]  because that's what they really are
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:19.200]  they have rejected
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:21.200]  the republic
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.200]  they've rejected the concept of freedom
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.200]  they want to live like a third world
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  dictatorship like North Korea
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:29.200]  they should just go there
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:31.200]  and we should just call them what they are
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.200]  they're totalitarians
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.200]  they're loyalists
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:37.200]  they would have been perfectly at home
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  being a Tory
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:41.200]  back in 1775
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.200]  and calling for the military's
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:45.200]  trial of the American
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.200]  colonists and the rebels
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:49.200]  and calling for the arrest of John Hancock
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  and Sam Adams and stuffing them
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.200]  in a military brig
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:55.200]  or putting them on a prison ship
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:57.200]  to starve to death
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  Robin Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:01.200]  very riveting
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:03.200]  very riveting discussion
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  and I was happy to listen through it
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  I'd like to get to my points very quickly
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:09.200]  Francis and Friends
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:11.200]  is a show
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  normally hosted by Francis Swagger
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:15.200]  Jimmy Swagger's wife
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.200]  it's on the Sunlight Broadcasting Network
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:19.200]  and I happened to be listening over the web
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:21.200]  and yesterday Donnie Swagger
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:23.200]  her son was hosting
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:25.200]  and on the show
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:27.200]  he falsely proclaimed that Ron Paul is
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  quote unquote not a Christian
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.200]  and does not know the Lord Jesus Christ
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:33.200]  and characterized Ron Paul
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  as anti-Israelan pro-Muslim
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  is that because Ron Paul doesn't visit
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.200]  low rent prostitutes
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:41.200]  and
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:43.200]  today's show was just as bad
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:45.200]  with Donnie Swagger characterizing
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.200]  Dr. Paul as a fruitcake
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:49.200]  and an alien from another planet
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.200]  I don't know about all those guys
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:53.200]  but the whole system is attacking Ron Paul
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:55.200]  what does that tell you?
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.200]  that's exactly right
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:57:59.200]  I'd like to say that I did my incremental part
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:01.200]  by posting these videos
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:03.200]  on YouTube under
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:05.200]  the title Donnie Swagger falsely proclaims
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:07.200]  Dr. Paul not a Christian
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:09.200]  and there was another instance where Francis
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.200]  Swagger was hosting a show
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:13.200]  and she called you a traitor Alex
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:15.200]  wherein she said that she characterized
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:17.200]  you as a traitor for discussing
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:19.200]  America's problems with RT
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:21.200]  and basically equating
[02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:23.200]  you going on RT with you traveling to Russia
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:25.200]  I know
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:27.200]  that's a neocon outfit
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.200]  I know some other groups have been calling for my arrest
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:31.200]  because I did British and French
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:33.200]  and Japanese TV
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:35.200]  they're loyalist traders
[02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:37.200]  and they don't want me talking about the Republic
[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:39.200]  I haven't heard those little discredited people
[02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:41.200]  so good for them
[02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:45.200]  thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:47.200]  visit GCNLive.com
[02:58:47.200 --> 02:59:09.200]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:19.200]  the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:21.200]  number 4
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:23.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:25.200]  every year thousands of families
[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:27.200]  lose their power from weather related onages
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:29.200]  number 5
[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:31.200]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.200]  insurance and peace of mind
[02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:35.200]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:37.200]  one of my old sponsors
[02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:41.200]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:43.200]  that's mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:45.200]  remember the government doesn't own the sun
[02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:47.200]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:51.200]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:53.200]  coast to coast
[02:59:53.200 --> 02:59:55.200]  direct from Austin
[02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:59.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[02:59:59.200 --> 03:00:09.200]  network
[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:11.200]  you know we're looking at how
[03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:13.200]  tyrants always operate Stuart
[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:15.200]  and they always say people that are
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:17.200]  criticizing them work for a foreign power
[03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:19.200]  and they've got to take your rights
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:21.200]  and clap you in irons
[03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:23.200]  because you're not a patriot
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.200]  but we're the people actually defending
[03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:27.200]  America and what made the country
[03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:29.200]  great and it's so simple
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:31.200]  we're fighting global banks
[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:33.200]  that take over countries
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:35.200]  and then use false nationalism
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:37.200]  to play our countries off against each other
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:39.200]  what would you say to the last caller
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:41.200]  before I go to Sean?
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:43.200]  no I've heard the same allegations
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:45.200]  made against you and also Ron Paul
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:47.200]  I mean Congressman Paul was a Christian
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:49.200]  I used to work with the man
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:51.200]  I used to work for him
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:53.200]  and I can tell you that he's a very
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:55.200]  principled pro-life Christian
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:57.200]  but he's a constitutionalist also
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:59.200]  and he stands on the Constitution
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:01.200]  and that's what all of these
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:03.200]  Roman 13's
[03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:05.200]  twisting, obedient,
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:07.200]  loyalist, fake Christians
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:09.200]  don't like
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:11.200]  they want obedience, they want submission
[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:13.200]  absolute submission to the state
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:15.200]  that's why there's a really great
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:17.200]  book out right now by Chuck Baldwin on
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:19.200]  Romans 13 that I recommend
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:21.200]  yeah we've had him on about it
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:23.200]  that's great so you need to
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:25.200]  get an antidote to all that nonsense
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:27.200]  but there are loyalists
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:29.200]  most of these churches are 501c3
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:31.200]  and the feds tell them
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.200]  you promote our agenda, you're going to lose it
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:35.200]  they have the clergy response teams
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:37.200]  I mean it's like in China
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:39.200]  the communists have a loyal church
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:41.200]  they allow to operate, it's the same thing
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:43.200]  that's right, that's right
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:45.200]  so the best way to handle them
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:47.200]  is to boycott them
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:49.200]  like the founders did, shun them, boycott them
[03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:51.200]  that's right
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:53.200]  at least now
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:55.200]  and I walk over in a restaurant and I say
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:57.200]  how are you guys doing, where are you standing
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:59.200]  in the constitution of the republic
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:01.200]  and they say well we stand with it, I go good job
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:03.200]  and shake their hand but if they act weird I go
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:05.200]  oh it's weird for a citizen to come over
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:07.200]  and talk to you, you want to ask yourself
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:09.200]  why you think that's weird
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:11.200]  you want to ask yourselves why me
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:13.200]  the little slave talking to you is weird
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:15.200]  how has America gotten so weird that we're not
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:17.200]  supposed to communicate with each other
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:19.200]  and it's time to get out of your shells folks
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:21.200]  we're not going to sell
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:23.200]  either hang together, hang separate
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:25.200]  let's go ahead and go to Sean in Tennessee
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:27.200]  listening on WJOC
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:29.200]  1490am in Tennessee, go ahead
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:31.200]  Alex I love your show
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:33.200]  I'm glad I finally get you here in Chattanooga
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:35.200]  we have so needed this kind of information
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:37.200]  for a very long time now
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:39.200]  I mean you are truly appreciated here
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:41.200]  for all you do on this program
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:43.200]  to fight these globalists
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:45.200]  thank you God bless you
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:47.200]  and you're truly appreciated
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:49.200]  to another one you might be very familiar with
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:51.200]  on GCN quite familiar with
[03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:53.200]  Pastor Butch Paul
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:55.200]  oh great guy, need to get him on
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:57.200]  and he fights these exact same people
[03:02:57.200 --> 03:02:59.200]  you just mentioned the 501c3
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:01.200]  but I have a question if you don't mind
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:03.200]  that relates to a super technology
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:05.200]  that the government uses
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:07.200]  to control the ionosphere
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:09.200]  and jet streams and weather patterns
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:11.200]  talking about harp
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:13.200]  yeah absolutely
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:15.200]  well I wonder is this same technology
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:17.200]  used to possibly control people
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:19.200]  or political dissidents
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:21.200]  well yeah they wouldn't use
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:23.200]  the big antennas for that but they've got patented
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:25.200]  little small psychotronic
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:27.200]  things that they've used
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:29.200]  there's actually been treaties on that
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:31.200]  with the euro, the US and Russia
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:33.200]  not to use it from 1979
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:35.200]  Stuart you want to
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:37.200]  get into any of the secret of weapons
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:39.200]  that you've read about or anything
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:41.200]  I mean all I really know about
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:43.200]  is the same thing you've heard about
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:45.200]  that
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:47.200]  yeah and you know a lot of these
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:49.200]  super high tech weapons and stuff
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:51.200]  it's all just bravada, it's all a system
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:53.200]  trying to, look the people that
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:55.200]  win wars are the people that don't stop
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:57.200]  fighting and who have right on their side
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:03:59.200]  ok, tyrants never succeed
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:01.200]  when people stand up against them, take Gandhi
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:03.200]  he spent 30 years just getting
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.200]  the Indians to have respect for
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.200]  themselves and learn to stand up
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:09.200]  and when they stood up there was nothing the British Empire could do
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:11.200]  closing comments on that Stuart Rhodes
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:13.200]  thank you so much Sean
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:15.200]  well that's absolutely correct
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:17.200]  I mean that's the great secret
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:19.200]  that they don't want you to realize
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:21.200]  the truth is that you are
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.200]  in the end you hold all the power
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:25.200]  in your hands and
[03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:27.200]  you includes the military and police
[03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:29.200]  and that's why I started it with keepers
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:31.200]  because they can't do it without them
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:33.200]  and so that's why we should look towards
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:35.200]  what happened in 1989 in East Germany
[03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:37.200]  when Günther Spence talked about on your show
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:39.200]  a mass stand down and a mass stand up
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:41.200]  by the people
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:43.200]  you know what Stuart I've already got a guest on the nightly news tonight
[03:04:43.200 --> 03:04:45.200]  but we might want to
[03:04:45.200 --> 03:04:47.200]  either today or tomorrow tape more about the police
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:49.200]  and the military's choice because that's the most
[03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:51.200]  important part of this discussion
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:53.200]  and I didn't even get into that maybe we should tape it
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:55.200]  put it on the news tonight and then air it tomorrow
[03:04:55.200 --> 03:04:57.200]  on the radio part 2
[03:04:57.200 --> 03:04:59.200]  I'll talk to you here at the end
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:09.200]  I'll tell you what this retransmission coming up now
