[00:00.000 --> 00:29.620]  Well, this morning, President Trump took to Twitter and says, why did the Obama administration
[00:29.620 --> 00:34.920]  start an investigation into the Trump campaign long before the election in November, wanted
[00:34.920 --> 00:40.680]  to discredit so Crooked H would win unprecedented bigger than Watergate, plus Obama did nothing
[00:40.680 --> 00:43.000]  about Russian meddling.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.520]  Yet here is Robert Mueller continuing his investigation into Trump and collusion, moving
[00:49.520 --> 00:55.200]  on from Russia to Saudi Arabia, here's Alex Jones breaking it down.
[00:55.200 --> 01:01.480]  We could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudi side in this
[01:01.480 --> 01:02.480]  dispute.
[01:02.480 --> 01:06.720]  They're 80% of Islam, Mecca's based there, they run the whole thing, they're running
[01:06.720 --> 01:07.720]  it.
[01:07.720 --> 01:13.160]  So you go to who is in charge to stop it.
[01:13.160 --> 01:19.800]  Robert Mueller has moved on from Russiagate to now investigating Saudi influence and Chinese
[01:19.800 --> 01:20.800]  influence.
[01:20.800 --> 01:25.040]  And I'm going to play the part about Saudi influence and they go, and Trump's under
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.040]  criminal investigation.
[01:26.040 --> 01:27.600]  I thought it was about Russians.
[01:27.600 --> 01:31.640]  Why did Trump go to Saudi Arabia instead of Qatar or the UAE?
[01:31.640 --> 01:36.000]  Because Saudi Arabia runs the whole Middle East except for Iran.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.920]  It runs 80% of Islam, the Sunnis.
[01:38.920 --> 01:41.760]  They were the ones funding ISIS and funding the Democrats.
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.840]  They arrested thousands of the ruling class who were funding the deep state here.
[01:46.840 --> 01:51.280]  They went there to cut the funding off, short of having a war with Saudi Arabia and the
[01:51.280 --> 01:55.560]  king was so blown away with the president there knowing everything, all his briefings
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.600]  with General Flynn and other generals that sent Flynn, whose names I'm not supposed to
[01:59.600 --> 02:06.320]  say, some of the former heads of the president's advisors, I'm just letting the deep state
[02:06.320 --> 02:09.040]  know I know all of it.
[02:09.040 --> 02:15.480]  That was brought and then ISIS crumbled and it helped Russia defeat ISIS in the US military.
[02:15.480 --> 02:16.480]  That's how you do it.
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.960]  If you go to the war, if you go to the Saudi King, I know you're threatened by internal
[02:18.960 --> 02:23.160]  groups using ISIS to control you, because the Saudis, some of them don't like to see
[02:23.160 --> 02:24.160]  them.
[02:24.160 --> 02:26.480]  They want to just be successful and not be radical as long.
[02:26.480 --> 02:27.480]  Now they're reforming.
[02:27.480 --> 02:28.480]  Women can drive cars.
[02:28.480 --> 02:29.480]  Women can have jobs.
[02:29.480 --> 02:31.520]  The jibs may come off.
[02:31.520 --> 02:35.800]  Trump went and said, you know, I can overthrow you right now.
[02:35.800 --> 02:36.800]  Stop it.
[02:36.800 --> 02:38.520]  And then they made a deal.
[02:38.520 --> 02:40.520]  That isn't spun into being anti-American.
[02:40.520 --> 02:42.600]  Do you know where Saudi agents-
[02:42.600 --> 02:48.680]  Nader's want to know if anyone's agent is the UAE to buy political favor or influence
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.360]  with the Trump campaign through campaign money.
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.560]  The businessman George Nader, the Times reports, was a frequent visitor to the Trump White
[02:55.560 --> 03:01.080]  House in 2017, advised top Trump aides on Middle East policy ahead of the president's
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.280]  visit to Saudi Arabia last year, and Nader has been a sort of advisor to one of the leaders
[03:06.280 --> 03:07.840]  of the UAE.
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.560]  Now the special counsel is interviewing witnesses about Emirati influence, and the president
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.280] 's son-in-law Jared Kushner's family business ties to the Middle East.
[03:16.280 --> 03:19.840]  Like if you wanted to end World War II before it started, you'd go to Hitler.
[03:19.840 --> 03:22.440]  Owen, this is twilight zone now.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.440]  Well, think about it.
[03:23.440 --> 03:25.720]  Just like Russia, who was it that was-
[03:25.720 --> 03:26.720]  No, no, no.
[03:26.720 --> 03:27.720]  It was never Russia.
[03:27.720 --> 03:28.720]  It was Saudi collusion.
[03:28.720 --> 03:29.720]  But it was-
[03:29.720 --> 03:30.720]  No, we're gonna arrest Trump for Saudi collusion.
[03:30.720 --> 03:32.200]  But who actually colluded with the Saudis?
[03:32.200 --> 03:33.200]  Okay, you're-
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.200]  Kill him.
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.200]  Exactly.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.200]  So they take everything that Hillary-
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.920]  He was there cutting off their funding.
[03:37.920 --> 03:41.440]  So does this once again, though, but does this show, I mean, what does this show about
[03:41.440 --> 03:42.440]  Mueller?
[03:42.440 --> 03:43.800]  Does this show that Mueller is covering for Hillary?
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.800]  I mean, what-
[03:44.800 --> 03:45.800]  Because that is just so weird.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.800]  I mean, why all of a sudden is Mueller looking into Saudi Arabia?
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.800]  Like what's going on with that?
[03:48.800 --> 03:51.280]  All we know is, why did he go to Saudi Arabia?
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.520]  It's only the most powerful country in the Middle East, not Israel.
[03:54.520 --> 03:56.840]  Israel has nukes, but financially, Saudi Arabia.
[03:56.840 --> 03:57.840]  Since when-
[03:57.840 --> 03:58.840]  Here's another incredible angle.
[03:58.840 --> 04:00.000]  This wasn't even news.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.360]  People have been colluding with Russia and Saudi-
[04:02.360 --> 04:03.760]  Well, they call nukes-
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.400]  The president, under the constitution, can make any deal he wants, then if you want to
[04:07.400 --> 04:08.400]  impeach him, that's fine.
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.400]  But he has that power.
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.200]  I can imagine what he's going through behind the scenes.
[04:11.200 --> 04:12.880]  I can just imagine.
[04:12.880 --> 04:15.720]  There's evidence of Russian collusion with Hillary.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.080]  Well, we know that.
[04:17.080 --> 04:18.080]  It's confirmed.
[04:18.080 --> 04:23.120]  Mueller and Comey separately ordered stand-downs when she was Secretary of State under Obama
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.040]  and when she was co-president back in the 90s with Bill Clinton.
[04:28.040 --> 04:32.000]  These witnesses have already left the department, which means the Inspector General does not
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.360]  have jurisdiction.
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.680]  And there are other agencies like the State Department where Michael Horowitz at DOJ has
[04:37.680 --> 04:39.800]  no jurisdiction whatsoever.
[04:39.800 --> 04:45.360]  Only over the weekend, I've counted up almost two dozen witnesses that the Inspector General
[04:45.360 --> 04:50.360]  would not have access to were he alone conducting this investigation.
[04:50.360 --> 04:56.080]  So I think we're trending, perhaps, towards another special counsel because of this unique
[04:56.080 --> 05:00.920]  fact pattern and the fact that there are witnesses outside the region.
[05:00.920 --> 05:01.920]  I'm so excited.
[05:01.920 --> 05:08.600]  The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
[05:08.600 --> 05:12.040]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[05:12.040 --> 05:17.480]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[05:17.480 --> 05:20.440]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:20.440 --> 05:26.400]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[05:26.400 --> 05:27.880]  but it wasn't prescription.
[05:27.880 --> 05:33.080]  But they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[05:33.080 --> 05:38.040]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO,
[05:38.040 --> 05:40.720]  made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[05:40.720 --> 05:47.120]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.920]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[05:50.920 --> 05:53.720]  It is amazing.
[05:53.720 --> 06:05.720]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[06:05.720 --> 06:10.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[06:10.720 --> 06:34.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[06:34.720 --> 06:40.640]  Welcome to the Info War, Owen Shroyer sitting in for Alex Jones.
[06:40.640 --> 06:44.000]  We're going to be hearing from Alex at the bottom of the hour.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.600]  Stacks of news coming in, reports coming in, specials breaking, a huge, huge interview
[06:50.600 --> 06:55.400]  with Ted Nugent that Info Wars is going to have the exclusive on here soon.
[06:55.400 --> 06:58.480]  We've got some clips of that.
[06:58.480 --> 07:04.280]  But I'm not sure what the biggest news is right now because you've got the tech left
[07:04.280 --> 07:10.760]  trying to censor free speech, censor conservatives.
[07:10.760 --> 07:17.280]  On top of that now, you have conservatives being doxxed by, we can only estimate what
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.760]  is the radical left, Michael Savage has all of his secret homes quote unquote visited
[07:23.760 --> 07:26.120]  by political operatives in the last three days.
[07:26.120 --> 07:28.800]  How did they get that information?
[07:28.800 --> 07:36.160]  You had the Huffington Post doxx a Florida teacher who has a podcast that she's just
[07:36.160 --> 07:37.520]  a conservative free thinker.
[07:37.520 --> 07:41.160]  I wouldn't listen to it, very libertarian ideas, but she's a white nationalist.
[07:41.160 --> 07:46.120]  So the Huff Post doxx is her, and now her job is pride and jeopardy.
[07:46.120 --> 07:49.080]  And then we've got all these video clips that we're going to play today.
[07:49.080 --> 07:52.720]  Whenever Info Wars goes out in the streets, whether it's myself or Jake Lloyd or Millie
[07:52.720 --> 07:56.840]  Weaver, we get spit at, we get assaulted, we get shoved.
[07:56.840 --> 08:00.080]  There's this one weird tactic that the left does where they just like come up to you and
[08:00.080 --> 08:02.480]  they kind of just like shove their butt into you.
[08:02.480 --> 08:04.000]  I don't know, it's really weird.
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.480]  And so this is what we deal with, but this is why they're trying to censor our channel.
[08:07.480 --> 08:13.640]  So you've got that huge story, the censorship, attacking free speech, attacking the Second
[08:13.640 --> 08:15.640]  Amendment.
[08:15.640 --> 08:20.600]  But then you've got President Trump this morning tweeting out about the Obama administration's
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.400]  illegal spying saying it's bigger than Watergate.
[08:25.400 --> 08:27.640]  Now this is true.
[08:27.640 --> 08:28.760]  It is bigger than Watergate.
[08:28.760 --> 08:29.840]  We've got all the evidence.
[08:29.840 --> 08:31.960]  We know who colluded with Russia.
[08:31.960 --> 08:37.840]  And so now Mueller is taking his investigation into a different direction and looking at
[08:37.840 --> 08:41.920]  Saudi Arabia, looking in that direction.
[08:41.920 --> 08:47.920]  And there's nothing there except more Hillary crimes to cover up.
[08:47.920 --> 08:56.200]  So you see this from President Trump and his base scratches their heads and says, well,
[08:56.200 --> 08:57.320]  why aren't we doing something?
[08:57.320 --> 08:58.680]  Why aren't people being arrested?
[08:58.680 --> 09:06.400]  Why isn't Obama being hauled in front of a committee for a hearing right now?
[09:06.400 --> 09:07.480]  Why isn't that going on?
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.920]  Why aren't people hauling in these FISA judges, asking them questions?
[09:11.920 --> 09:17.200]  Did they try to hide the fact this was opposition research paid for by Hillary Clinton?
[09:17.200 --> 09:20.200]  See, think about it.
[09:20.200 --> 09:25.680]  The left gets to start violence at Trump rallies.
[09:25.680 --> 09:31.120]  They get caught by Project Veritas, Bob Kramer gets fired, Aaron Black gets exposed.
[09:31.120 --> 09:37.040]  The left gets to censor you on social media, whether it be Facebook or YouTube or Twitter
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.320]  or Google rigging up their algorithms.
[09:40.320 --> 09:48.120]  The left gets to collude with Russia to make up opposition research that's then used to
[09:48.120 --> 09:51.320]  slander and libel President Trump.
[09:51.320 --> 09:57.480]  And this is what the left, all being done by the political left right now.
[09:57.480 --> 10:05.840]  But a conservative is a Nazi or a white nationalist if they want a border.
[10:05.840 --> 10:06.840]  This is madness.
[10:06.840 --> 10:07.840]  This is chaos.
[10:07.840 --> 10:09.440]  This is 1984.
[10:09.440 --> 10:11.560]  This is mental illness is what it is.
[10:11.560 --> 10:17.680]  I mean, you want to talk about mental illness, you've got leading stories.
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.000]  If FISA's on the streets of San Francisco isn't enough for you, you go over to the east coast
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.160]  in New York City and there's going to be some pervert on the subway jacking off.
[10:27.160 --> 10:33.400]  So that's a story now out of New York, while you've got piles of FISA's in San Francisco.
[10:33.400 --> 10:36.120]  Democrat run cities.
[10:36.120 --> 10:39.280]  It's mental illness.
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.920]  And it just all happens to be on the political left right now.
[10:44.920 --> 10:50.800]  So YouTube has, we've gone from one strike to two strikes to three strikes to two strikes
[10:50.800 --> 10:56.960]  to one strike, basically in the last 24 or 48 hours.
[10:56.960 --> 10:58.960]  Drudge is still covering it.
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.080]  YouTube hits infowars with third strike as fight goes nuclear.
[11:02.080 --> 11:07.960]  Thanks to our story at infowars.com.
[11:07.960 --> 11:15.280]  Then you've got dicks is now purging pro-gun patriotic merchandise.
[11:15.280 --> 11:21.520]  So I guess if you want to buy a t-shirt that has an American flag on it, don't go to dicks
[11:21.520 --> 11:24.120]  because that's patriotic merchandise.
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.040]  You can't have that.
[11:26.040 --> 11:31.400]  Or I don't know, maybe there's like a flag t-shirt with like a Moan Labe or like a rifle
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.400]  on it or something.
[11:32.400 --> 11:33.400]  Nope.
[11:33.400 --> 11:34.400]  You can't do that either.
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.400]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:39.400 --> 11:43.720]  Like I said earlier, you've got a Florida teacher accused of having a white nationalist podcast.
[11:43.720 --> 11:45.160]  Just a conservative podcast.
[11:45.160 --> 11:50.280]  She gets doxxed by the Huffington Post, the Huffington Puffington Post over there, doxxes
[11:50.280 --> 11:54.480]  a Florida teacher for having a conservative podcast because, you know, you're not allowed
[11:54.480 --> 11:56.920]  to have a free speech if you're a conservative.
[11:56.920 --> 12:02.640]  If you're a liberal, if you're a good liberal and you are making death threats to conservatives
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.240]  and making death threats to the president and having death threats in your music videos
[12:07.240 --> 12:10.640]  and your plays and everything, that's just a good liberal.
[12:10.640 --> 12:17.640]  See, it's a good liberal to have a play called Kill Climate Deniers.
[12:17.640 --> 12:23.720]  You see, this is the hatred of the left.
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.840]  The left is honestly a death cult.
[12:25.840 --> 12:28.160]  That's not just rhetoric.
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.440]  There's a reason why they pretend to kill Donald Trump in their music videos and their
[12:31.440 --> 12:32.960]  art and their plays.
[12:32.960 --> 12:40.560]  There's a reason why they have a play called Kill Climate Deniers.
[12:40.560 --> 12:41.560]  That's what they want to do.
[12:41.560 --> 12:43.600]  They want to kill you.
[12:43.600 --> 12:44.920]  But even this is a misnomer.
[12:44.920 --> 12:47.160]  See, do you see how they twist things?
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.680]  This is 1984.
[12:48.680 --> 12:51.920]  They are the climate deniers.
[12:51.920 --> 12:53.800]  They are the ones that deny science.
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.000]  They make up formulas and then say that proves global warming.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.760]  There is no science.
[12:59.760 --> 13:05.560]  From the very beginning, who they dub a climate denier were the ones that said, no, no, no,
[13:05.560 --> 13:07.680]  no, this is climate.
[13:07.680 --> 13:08.920]  This is climate change.
[13:08.920 --> 13:10.000]  This is what happens.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.720]  So we say climate change.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.920]  They say manmade global warming.
[13:13.920 --> 13:19.120]  Now you've got record snowfall, record cold temperatures, nor Easter's everywhere.
[13:19.120 --> 13:24.120]  And so they have to take a step back from saying manmade global warming because that's
[13:24.120 --> 13:25.120]  obviously fake news.
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.480]  Now they look like idiots on that.
[13:26.480 --> 13:28.440]  They get exposed, rigging the temperatures.
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.680]  So now they just say, manmade climate change, and if you don't think it's manmade, then
[13:33.680 --> 13:35.920]  you're a climate denier.
[13:35.920 --> 13:40.920]  And if you are a climate denier, well, then we have to kill you.
[13:40.920 --> 13:41.920]  And it doesn't stop there.
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.760]  They're going to want to kill you if you're a Christian.
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.960]  They're going to kill you if you're a nationalist, a conservative.
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.960]  I mean, this is what it's all about.
[13:47.960 --> 13:49.880]  That's why they want to just censor everything.
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.440]  They say they're about free speech, and then they censor everything that opposes their
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.440]  views.
[13:54.440 --> 13:57.000]  They say that they're for life and love and life.
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  Oh, it's so good.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.480]  But then they abort babies.
[13:59.480 --> 14:02.000]  They hate you.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.680]  Another big story that's on Infowars.com from Leo Zagami.
[14:04.680 --> 14:06.240]  We're reaching out to him right now.
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.640]  Italy's 2018 rigged elections.
[14:09.640 --> 14:14.040]  Italy will most likely remain in the hands of the left-wing Mondialists sponsored and
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.800]  manipulated by George Soros trying to get Leo on to talk about that.
[14:18.800 --> 14:25.280]  Not to mention, you've got this breaking news where the Vatican is essentially being blackmailed
[14:25.280 --> 14:34.240]  by a escort who's saying that there's at least 40 gay priests in the Vatican and drugs, prostitution,
[14:34.240 --> 14:35.240]  blackmail.
[14:35.240 --> 14:38.600]  So that's all developing right now as well.
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.920]  Leo Zagami is the expert to talk about on all that.
[14:42.920 --> 14:46.880]  Like I said, we're going to have some clips of videos that they want banned, but folks,
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.560]  we are truly all under attack here.
[14:50.560 --> 14:53.800]  And if they can take down Infowars, they can take down everybody.
[14:53.800 --> 14:55.320]  And CNN is behind a lot of this.
[14:55.320 --> 15:00.320]  And I theorize that CNN is going and flagging our videos, or the Brian Stelters at CNN have
[15:00.320 --> 15:01.840]  nothing better to do.
[15:01.840 --> 15:07.960]  So we have just extended the poll review special to the Defeat CNN to Crush Infowars Special.
[15:07.960 --> 15:10.920]  So the Defeat CNN to Crush Infowars Special.
[15:10.920 --> 15:16.560]  So if you want to defeat CNN, go to InfowarsStore.com, take advantage of our huge specials.

[15:48.280 --> 15:51.440]  All right, on the other side, we're going to go to some of these viral videos on the
[15:51.440 --> 15:53.160]  Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[15:53.160 --> 15:55.400]  This is the reason why they want us banned.
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.880]  Nobody else will do what we do.
[15:59.880 --> 16:00.880]  This is Dan Pilla.
[16:00.880 --> 16:02.400]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[16:02.400 --> 16:03.960]  Our tax debt's crippling you?

[16:06.800 --> 16:09.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.800]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:12.800 --> 16:13.800]  case.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.680]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[16:28.880 --> 16:34.240]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.320]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[16:38.320 --> 16:40.080]  medical expenses.

[16:59.160 --> 17:01.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.

[17:05.560 --> 17:06.560]  by you.
[17:06.560 --> 17:10.600]  All symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops.
[17:10.600 --> 17:14.880]  Poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that
[17:14.880 --> 17:16.360]  something is wrong.

[18:04.240 --> 18:09.360]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.400]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.400 --> 18:17.760]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.080]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[18:23.080 --> 18:29.480]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.

[18:34.600 --> 18:36.720]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.720 --> 18:40.960]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[18:40.960 --> 18:43.760]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.760 --> 18:48.440]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.360]  Available in original, or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting

[18:58.200 --> 18:59.840]  At InfowarsLife.com.
[18:59.840 --> 19:02.840]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[19:02.840 --> 19:03.840]  Victor, you're calling?
[19:03.840 --> 19:04.840]  Go ahead.
[19:04.840 --> 19:05.840]  Yes.
[19:05.840 --> 19:06.840]  Hi, Alex.
[19:06.840 --> 19:12.080]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering
[19:12.080 --> 19:13.080]  all the time.
[19:13.080 --> 19:17.400]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[19:17.400 --> 19:21.600]  In particular, silver bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little stick,
[19:21.600 --> 19:26.000]  you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.520]  it, like, I'll still feel a little stick, but it won't last as long.
[19:29.520 --> 19:32.960]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[19:32.960 --> 19:35.000]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.400]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage
[19:38.400 --> 19:42.840]  of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank
[19:42.840 --> 19:43.840]  you.
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.960]  But when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a
[19:47.960 --> 19:48.960]  98% review.
[19:48.960 --> 19:53.480]  It is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country discounted
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.760]  high-quality colloidal silver.
[19:54.760 --> 20:03.040]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[20:03.040 --> 20:25.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:25.040 --> 20:26.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.280 --> 20:28.400]  I want to show you're filling in for Alex today.
[20:28.400 --> 20:31.680]  We're going to be hearing from Alex at the bottom of the hour.
[20:31.680 --> 20:34.400]  He's got some breaking news to cover.
[20:34.400 --> 20:40.600]  Now, what I want to do in this segment and the next is to play some of the videos that
[20:40.600 --> 20:46.880]  we feature on the Alex Jones channel here that you're just not going to get anywhere
[20:46.880 --> 20:47.880]  else.
[20:47.880 --> 20:55.240]  We go out on the street and we offer the Trump protesters, the liberals, the protesters,
[20:55.240 --> 21:01.440]  the women marchers a platform, and we give them a microphone and we say, hey, what's
[21:01.440 --> 21:02.440]  on your mind?
[21:02.440 --> 21:03.960]  Why are you out here protesting?
[21:03.960 --> 21:05.240]  What do you think about this issue?
[21:05.240 --> 21:07.440]  What do you think about this?
[21:07.440 --> 21:11.600]  And we experience pretty much the same thing every time either they're completely clueless,
[21:11.600 --> 21:16.480]  they're ignorant, they have no idea what they're doing there, or they're hateful, they're violent,
[21:16.480 --> 21:18.280]  and they're disgusting.
[21:18.280 --> 21:24.560]  So this first video that we're going to go to, Jake Lloyd goes to UT to file a man on
[21:24.560 --> 21:30.560]  the street where I'm convinced now it used to be we could go out and actually do a report
[21:30.560 --> 21:33.000]  and not just be harassed the whole time.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.360]  We've kind of passed that threshold now.
[21:35.360 --> 21:41.800]  And I think that UT has lookouts or something and whenever we go to UT's campus now, they
[21:41.800 --> 21:46.320]  have an email chain or something and they inform people and then they go out and they
[21:46.320 --> 21:50.320]  seek us out so that they can try to disrupt our videos.
[21:50.320 --> 21:54.120]  But that's fine because please, it's great content.
[21:54.120 --> 21:59.440]  So please, please let the crazy liberals know when we go to UT and please come embarrass
[21:59.440 --> 22:01.720]  yourself so that we can get videos like this.
[22:01.720 --> 22:07.960]  So these are the types of videos that they want banned from YouTube because it shows
[22:07.960 --> 22:10.160]  the left for who they really are.
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.480]  So here's Jake Lloyd going to UT just trying to shoot a video, ask people what they think
[22:14.480 --> 22:18.520]  about issues when he's rudely disrupted by some liberal protesters.
[22:18.520 --> 22:22.520]  Oh my gosh, why are you wearing a mask?
[22:22.520 --> 22:23.520]  Why are you wearing a mask?
[22:23.520 --> 22:24.520]  You know who wears masks?
[22:24.520 --> 22:25.720]  Criminals wear masks.
[22:25.720 --> 22:28.160]  People about ready to commit a crime, that's who wears masks.
[22:28.160 --> 22:35.000]  Okay, the Democrat party is the party of criminals, still being run by Hillary Clinton, one of
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  the biggest of all time.
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.920]  All right, you're blocking the wrong side of the phone there.
[22:41.920 --> 22:44.000]  Let's go guys.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  Let's go.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  So here's Jake Lloyd.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  He can't even film this or report as camera man's getting shoved.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  Oh yeah, then they run away.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.440]  Please stop touching us.
[22:56.440 --> 23:01.520]  This is what they do, they get up in your face and they either rub like their body on
[23:01.520 --> 23:05.760]  you like some weird fetish or they shove their sign in your face and then you fight back
[23:05.760 --> 23:08.360]  and you're like, hey get off me and they're like, whoa, what are you doing, you're out
[23:08.360 --> 23:09.360]  of control.
[23:09.360 --> 23:10.360]  Losers like to assault people.
[23:10.360 --> 23:14.800]  Okay, I understand, but like this is also like a school environment and like from no
[23:14.800 --> 23:15.800]  one.
[23:15.800 --> 23:18.720]  Yeah, we're trying to engage in political discourse and we have people like this guy coming up
[23:18.720 --> 23:19.720]  and assaulting people.
[23:19.720 --> 23:21.720]  School environment, you're not allowed to have free speech.
[23:21.720 --> 23:23.600]  School environment, no free speech here, school environment.
[23:23.600 --> 23:24.600]  That's a lie.
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.400]  No, it's not, I shoved them, you grab the fucking wire, try to pull it out of my hand.
[23:27.400 --> 23:28.400]  Oh yeah.
[23:28.400 --> 23:29.400]  I shoved them off.
[23:29.400 --> 23:31.600]  Yeah, that's the tactic they always try to do is they rip our wires.
[23:31.600 --> 23:32.600]  We started it, but that's fine.
[23:32.600 --> 23:34.600]  Like the chicken man.
[23:34.600 --> 23:35.600]  Oh yeah.
[23:35.600 --> 23:40.000]  Yeah, so anyways, tell the police can get here, we're going to describe this, we're going
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.520]  to keep trying to talk to people and see if anybody wants to talk to us.
[23:43.520 --> 23:47.320]  Oh, okay.
[23:47.320 --> 23:49.120]  I just heard them plug Supermil Vitali.
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.120]  We were having so much fun.
[23:50.120 --> 23:52.800]  50% off right now, info was so much fun.
[23:52.800 --> 23:58.360]  We were actually like kind of had like a little cute thing going on here and then people want
[23:58.360 --> 23:59.520]  to come up and have an issue.
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.920]  So, Jake Lloyd back again for infoors.com, we had to take a little break there for just
[24:03.920 --> 24:04.920]  a moment.
[24:04.920 --> 24:05.920]  So there's one example.
[24:05.920 --> 24:10.160]  Again, Jake just goes out, he's trying to shoot a man on the street saying, hey, I think
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.480]  he was trying to talk about gun control in this one or Trump or something, I don't remember.
[24:14.480 --> 24:20.240]  And they just show up, they shoved their signs and then, you know what, we might have to
[24:20.240 --> 24:21.840]  pull this video.
[24:21.840 --> 24:25.800]  If you've ever heard of Fleckis talks, all of these protesters, he asked them if they
[24:25.800 --> 24:27.840]  vote, none of them even vote.
[24:27.840 --> 24:28.840]  They don't even vote.
[24:28.840 --> 24:32.600]  I guarantee you, those people out there carrying those signs don't even vote.
[24:32.600 --> 24:36.800]  They probably don't even know anything about those candidates, but regardless, that's what
[24:36.800 --> 24:37.800]  happens.
[24:37.800 --> 24:44.240]  Jake Lloyd just goes out and because he has an info wars mic flag, he's the bad guy.
[24:44.240 --> 24:47.160]  Jake Lloyd, oh, it's an info wars reporter.
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.160]  Get him.
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.160]  Get him.
[24:49.160 --> 24:50.400]  Go shove a sign in his face.
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.400]  We're from free speech.
[24:51.400 --> 24:53.480]  Don't stop his right to free speech.
[24:53.480 --> 24:54.480]  We're loving intolerantly.
[24:54.480 --> 24:58.000]  Let's go like weird fetishly rub our butt on him.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.720]  Tell you, it's the weirdest thing.
[24:59.720 --> 25:00.920]  Ask anybody who goes to these things.
[25:00.920 --> 25:02.320]  They all do the same thing.
[25:02.320 --> 25:08.560]  Now, there was another, well, this was a march for Trump in Austin, Texas this weekend that
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.040]  I attended and there were again some radical commies that showed up to try to disrupt things.
[25:14.040 --> 25:17.800]  Here's a video of one of them getting arrested.
[25:17.800 --> 25:18.800]  Get this lady.
[25:18.800 --> 25:19.800]  No, no, no, you know this lady.
[25:19.800 --> 25:20.800]  You know her.
[25:20.800 --> 25:21.800]  Yes.
[25:21.800 --> 25:22.800]  How are you today, man?
[25:22.800 --> 25:23.800]  Oh my gosh.
[25:23.800 --> 25:24.800]  Well, you have a sign.
[25:24.800 --> 25:26.520]  Why don't you actually execute your free speech?
[25:26.520 --> 25:27.520]  I feel bad for that one.
[25:27.520 --> 25:29.720]  Hey, how's your day been?
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.320]  You may recognize her from other viral videos.
[25:31.320 --> 25:32.320]  How's your day been?
[25:32.320 --> 25:33.320]  Wow.
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.320]  How's your pirate radio show?
[25:34.320 --> 25:36.240]  This is the guy that took it down.
[25:36.240 --> 25:38.240]  Did you destroy that tower?
[25:38.240 --> 25:40.800]  Wait, was that you?
[25:40.800 --> 25:42.280]  Tower wasn't destroyed, dude.
[25:42.280 --> 25:43.280]  Okay.
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.280]  There's some other.
[25:44.280 --> 25:45.280]  Here's some other.
[25:45.280 --> 25:46.280]  That guy got in a fight earlier.
[25:46.280 --> 25:47.280]  Got his butt here.
[25:47.280 --> 25:48.280]  There's a protest in Trump today.
[25:48.280 --> 25:49.280]  That's why he has glasses on.
[25:49.280 --> 25:50.280]  He had a huge black guy.
[25:50.280 --> 25:51.280]  All right.
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.280]  Don't want to talk.
[25:52.280 --> 25:55.280]  I think that's pretty much it, though.
[25:55.280 --> 25:57.960]  That lady was swinging them out.
[25:57.960 --> 25:58.960]  Hold on, hold on.
[25:58.960 --> 26:00.880]  We've got another Trump protestor here.
[26:00.880 --> 26:03.960]  Sir, look at all the Trump protestors on the street.
[26:03.960 --> 26:05.600]  We've got a Trump protestor.
[26:05.600 --> 26:06.600]  Anything, sir?
[26:06.600 --> 26:07.600]  Anything?
[26:07.600 --> 26:08.600]  No.
[26:08.600 --> 26:09.600]  Trump protestor, sir?
[26:09.600 --> 26:10.600]  No.
[26:10.600 --> 26:11.600]  No.
[26:11.600 --> 26:12.600]  Nothing from the Trump protestors.
[26:12.600 --> 26:14.600]  I thought the Trump protestors would want to talk.
[26:14.600 --> 26:16.080]  They never do.
[26:16.080 --> 26:17.080]  That's funny.
[26:17.080 --> 26:18.080]  That's funny.
[26:18.080 --> 26:19.080]  All right.
[26:19.080 --> 26:20.440]  All right.
[26:20.440 --> 26:21.440]  Let's speed up the pace here.
[26:21.440 --> 26:22.440]  I didn't follow that.
[26:22.440 --> 26:23.440]  I didn't think it was worth it.
[26:23.440 --> 26:24.440]  I just thought it was worth it.
[26:24.440 --> 26:25.440]  Well, that's true.
[26:25.440 --> 26:26.440]  Right over there.
[26:26.440 --> 26:27.440]  Right over there.
[26:27.440 --> 26:28.440]  Okay.
[26:28.440 --> 26:29.440]  Okay.
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.680]  We got some, we got some Communist Antifa protestors here.
[26:32.680 --> 26:34.720]  We saw, we saw that guy back there.
[26:34.720 --> 26:37.240]  You see the rainbow flag up there?
[26:37.240 --> 26:38.240]  Rainbow flag?
[26:38.240 --> 26:39.240]  I see a sign.
[26:39.240 --> 26:40.240]  Usually.
[26:40.240 --> 26:41.240]  Oh, there they are.
[26:41.240 --> 26:42.240]  Okay.
[26:42.240 --> 26:43.240]  Oh, wow.
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.240]  We've got some wild ones.
[26:44.240 --> 26:45.240]  Yeah.
[26:45.240 --> 26:46.240]  Oh, wow.
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.240]  Yeah.
[26:47.240 --> 26:48.240]  They all had their faces covered as usual.
[26:48.240 --> 26:49.240]  All right.
[26:49.240 --> 26:55.720]  So here's the police here, maintaining a line between the protesters in the street, though.
[26:55.720 --> 26:58.640]  And they're, hey, this is what you call Key Boston weird.
[26:58.640 --> 26:59.640]  Antifa.
[26:59.640 --> 27:00.640]  No, no.
[27:00.640 --> 27:03.640]  This is what you call Key Boston weird right here.
[27:03.640 --> 27:04.640]  Oh my God.
[27:04.640 --> 27:06.280]  I can't believe I'm reliving this right now.
[27:06.280 --> 27:08.280]  This is like weird for me.
[27:08.280 --> 27:10.280]  Look at this.
[27:10.280 --> 27:15.240]  This is what I had to deal with.
[27:15.240 --> 27:20.240]  We've got a protestor getting arrested now.
[27:20.240 --> 27:23.240]  See if you can get a shot of this.
[27:23.240 --> 27:24.240]  We're getting blocked here.
[27:24.240 --> 27:25.240]  We're getting blocked here.
[27:25.240 --> 27:26.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.240]  I'm on you.
[27:27.240 --> 27:28.240]  I'm on you.
[27:28.240 --> 27:36.040]  I do believe that this was the only arrest from the March.
[27:36.040 --> 27:38.320]  There he is.
[27:38.320 --> 27:40.720]  He's got his face covered.
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.040]  Face covered helmet on.
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.040]  Wearing all black.
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.040]  Black lives matter.
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.040]  Sure.
[27:47.040 --> 27:48.040]  White over here.
[27:48.040 --> 27:49.040]  What is it?
[27:49.040 --> 27:50.040]  All race.
[27:50.040 --> 27:51.040]  What is it?
[27:51.040 --> 27:52.040]  Sure.
[27:52.040 --> 27:53.040]  He doesn't know.
[27:53.040 --> 27:54.040]  So there's one down.
[27:54.040 --> 27:55.040]  If you've got a whole paragraph on the front of your shirt.
[27:55.040 --> 27:56.040]  All right.
[27:56.040 --> 27:57.040]  Good luck.
[27:57.040 --> 27:58.040]  We're being told to keep moving now.
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.040]  All right.
[27:59.040 --> 28:00.040]  So, so there you go.
[28:00.040 --> 28:02.040]  So there's, so there's an example of some of the stuff.
[28:02.040 --> 28:03.040]  Oh my God.
[28:03.040 --> 28:06.600]  So if you, if you follow our videos and we'll, we're going to play more of these later, we're
[28:06.600 --> 28:10.800]  actually about to be joined by Leo Zagami here coming up in the next segment for half
[28:10.800 --> 28:16.200]  an hour to talk about his newest article on the Italian elections, as well as the black
[28:16.200 --> 28:20.560]  male supposedly that's, that's being sent to the Vatican right now.
[28:20.560 --> 28:23.000]  But we're going to have more of those videos, but there's this, there was this, I'm telling
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  you, actually having to like watch that and relive it, it's like eerie, man.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.560]  I mean, those people are really just sad.
[28:31.560 --> 28:34.040]  The one woman, you, you, you'll recognize the one woman.
[28:34.040 --> 28:35.120]  She's been in a viral video.
[28:35.120 --> 28:36.520]  She's like totally soul sucked.
[28:36.520 --> 28:38.240]  You feel bad for her.
[28:38.240 --> 28:41.640]  And then you've got this other woman, the famous woman who makes fart noises with her
[28:41.640 --> 28:42.640]  mouth.
[28:42.640 --> 28:44.120]  She was back out on Saturday.
[28:44.120 --> 28:47.720]  She was still making fart noises with her mouth, but she added the clown costume this
[28:47.720 --> 28:48.720]  time.
[28:48.720 --> 28:51.720]  You see, she wasn't crazy enough with just making the fart noises.
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.720]  Now she wants to be a clown that makes fart noises.
[28:53.720 --> 28:56.720]  I mean, they're really, they're really ratcheting it up when they go high.
[28:56.720 --> 28:58.720]  I mean, they go high, baby.

[33:30.360 --> 33:35.960]  Coming from Alex in the next segment, in this segment though, I'm joined by Leo Zagami.
[33:35.960 --> 33:42.600]  He has just published the article on infowars.com, Italy's 2018 rigged elections.
[33:42.600 --> 33:45.160]  He's going to be breaking this down with us right now.
[33:45.160 --> 33:47.600]  Leo, thank you so much for joining us on short notice today.
[33:47.600 --> 33:48.600]  Hello, everybody.
[33:48.600 --> 33:53.600]  It's actually my birthday, so I guess today- Oh, well, happy birthday!
[33:53.600 --> 33:56.920]  A pleasant surprise on both sides.
[33:56.920 --> 34:03.240]  And I hope to give you the latest information on what apparently is a rigged election from
[34:03.240 --> 34:04.240]  the start.
[34:04.240 --> 34:14.560]  I mean, they worked for over a year on placing this new voting system called Rosatellum.
[34:14.560 --> 34:20.240]  And basically, they have done something that is only facilitating the possibility to maintain
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.080]  the same positions, maybe activating some new alliances in the process.
[34:26.080 --> 34:35.480]  Because there is a limit of 40% that is required to each party or coalition for having the
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.520]  governability of Italy and establishing a new government.
[34:39.520 --> 34:48.520]  As 40% in a proportional system with many parties is almost impossible, these elections
[34:48.520 --> 34:50.280]  are basically rigged.
[34:50.280 --> 34:56.960]  And they have also part of this electoral system has been built in a way that you're
[34:56.960 --> 35:05.160]  not really capable as a candidate to have your own independence, because the party is
[35:05.160 --> 35:15.720]  just getting those ones who are already in the process, in the sanitarian process chosen
[35:15.720 --> 35:16.720]  from on top.
[35:16.720 --> 35:19.880]  And they don't have to necessarily be from the same party.
[35:19.880 --> 35:26.960]  In fact, in communist Bologna, left wing Bologna, an ex-Christian Democrat like Ferdinando
[35:26.960 --> 35:34.160]  Casini, who is the favorite politician of Pope Francis, was reelected thanks to a left-wing
[35:34.160 --> 35:35.160]  party.
[35:35.160 --> 35:43.040]  That would be impossible to even imagine 40 or 50 years ago when the Christian Democrats
[35:43.040 --> 35:46.360]  and the Communists were fighting against each other.
[35:46.360 --> 35:55.080]  Then we had also the re-election, for example, of an old Berlusconi politician called Lorenzini,
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.680]  who was the minister for Matteo Renzi.
[35:58.680 --> 36:03.360]  And she was also re-elected by rigging the system in Modena.
[36:03.360 --> 36:13.280]  So we have also in Milan, for example, a whole area of Milan where the electorate, of course,
[36:13.280 --> 36:17.520]  was pushed to vote for the people chosen by George Soros.
[36:17.520 --> 36:22.440]  Because George Soros has been really present in these Italian elections.
[36:22.440 --> 36:29.240]  And what people from the international media tend to ignore is that even the so-called
[36:29.240 --> 36:35.840]  revolutionaries of these elections, the five-star movement, who have become the first party
[36:35.840 --> 36:44.000]  in Italy with the 50% of the votes, have actually already chose a minister for their economy,
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.040]  who works for the open democracy and for the open society of George Soros.
[36:49.040 --> 36:58.160]  So they might now force a sort of coalition between all the factions that are under George
[36:58.160 --> 37:08.200]  Soros in the left wing and come up with probably another government by the same people, more
[37:08.200 --> 37:09.200]  or less.
[37:09.200 --> 37:15.040]  There is even the possibility that the present prime minister, who is Paolo Gentiloni, will
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.800]  stay in his place for a second mandate.
[37:17.800 --> 37:25.720]  So these elections, which of course have seen a rise in the populist vote, because the Northern
[37:25.720 --> 37:32.480]  League has risen so high in the coalition that was led by Berlusconi.
[37:32.480 --> 37:39.080]  So basically Berlusconi now is not any more the leader of this coalition, but is Matteo
[37:39.080 --> 37:40.560]  Salvini.
[37:40.560 --> 37:49.000]  And Matteo Salvini has just gone a few minutes ago to visit Stilvio Berlusconi in Isbilla,
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.720]  apparently staying only for a little while.
[37:52.720 --> 37:59.800]  And this is a sign of a very tense situation, because behind the scenes, like I wrote also
[37:59.800 --> 38:08.080]  in a recent article, Matteo Salvini, of course, is a typical far-right populist that is working
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.720]  for the sovereignty of Italy, while instead Berlusconi behind the scenes might have stroke
[38:12.720 --> 38:15.600]  a secret deal with Matteo Renzi.
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.760]  However, now the Democrat leader in Italy, which is Matteo Renzi, which is of course a
[38:21.760 --> 38:30.800]  tool of the Clinton Foundation, of George Soros, he is about to be kicked out of his own party.
[38:30.800 --> 38:38.240]  But they have been waiting now for his resignations for hours, and this resignation, of course,
[38:38.240 --> 38:45.120]  has been delayed and delayed longer, longer times for giving this resignation, which of
[38:45.120 --> 38:47.120]  course is inevitable.
[38:47.120 --> 38:52.560]  But because behind the scenes, apparently, there is the possibility that the five-star
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.120]  movement strikes a deal with the left wing of George Soros and part of the Democrat
[38:58.120 --> 38:59.120]  party.
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.000]  And in that case, they will have the majority of the House, and they will be able to establish
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.120]  this new government that in any case is ruled by George Soros, who will continue to flood
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.440]  Italy with immigrants, who will continue with his demented policies.
[39:17.440 --> 39:20.440]  So in the end, nothing will really change.
[39:20.440 --> 39:26.800]  What I think is very sad out of these Italian elections is that the Italians wasted 400 million
[39:26.800 --> 39:35.200]  euros for organizing these elections, and it was a complete fuss, meaning they had devised
[39:35.200 --> 39:41.120]  this new anti-fraudulent system, but it was a fiasco.
[39:41.120 --> 39:48.240]  Well, it seems to me that the Rosatellum system that you're talking about is really just
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.200]  in opposition to stop any grassroots movements from having any political grounds.
[39:53.200 --> 39:55.320]  Again, the story is on Infowars.com.
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.400]  You also get into a role of Steve Bannon in these elections as well.
[40:00.400 --> 40:02.840]  Again, all of that is in the story at Infowars.com.
[40:02.840 --> 40:06.360]  But Leo, before we go here, we've got just over two minutes left.
[40:06.360 --> 40:12.320]  I'm sure that you've heard about the blackmail scandal that is enveloping the Vatican right
[40:12.320 --> 40:19.280]  now with a male escort who's saying that at least 40 gay priests were sent to the Vatican.
[40:19.280 --> 40:20.640]  What can you tell us about this?
[40:20.640 --> 40:23.400]  What do you know about this?
[40:23.400 --> 40:30.400]  This story is very important because apparently this male escort has saved around 50 screenshots
[40:30.400 --> 40:35.000]  of all his partners in the Catholic Church.
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.480]  So he has evidence with these screenshots of all the requests that he was getting.
[40:41.480 --> 40:43.600]  Some of the requests are outrageous.
[40:43.600 --> 40:50.280]  I mean, a group of monks invited him to their monastery in the middle of a forest so he
[40:50.280 --> 40:54.640]  could be a passive partner to their sexual exploitation.
[40:54.640 --> 40:56.640]  And he said, well, I hope you're passive.
[40:56.640 --> 40:57.640]  We have three monks.
[40:57.640 --> 41:00.840]  We want to invite you for this gay orgy.
[41:00.840 --> 41:07.000]  And this is only one of the many things that comes out of this scandal involving this male
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  escort.
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.840]  So, I mean, the situation is very tense because there is a possibility that this male escort
[41:14.840 --> 41:21.320]  might really need a few bodyguards to stay alive because with the amount of information
[41:21.320 --> 41:26.560]  that he could bring out, he could definitely put in trouble a lot of people here.
[41:26.560 --> 41:33.720]  We're not talking only about Catholic priests, but also cardinals, bishops, and the hierarchy
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.560]  of the Vatican, of course, is very scared of all this.
[41:37.560 --> 41:42.960]  And of course, this is all kind of right on the heels of the number two to the pope who
[41:42.960 --> 41:45.560]  is also enveloped in a scandal as well.
[41:45.560 --> 41:47.360]  I mean, how does the Vatican deal with this?
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.160]  How is the Vatican dealing with this?
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.080]  I mean, this is serious stuff, serious allegations.
[41:52.080 --> 41:53.760]  I'm not hearing about any reform.
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.840]  I'm not hearing the pope address this.
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.320]  I mean, are they just trying to brush it under the rug?
[41:59.320 --> 42:00.320]  Absolutely.
[42:00.320 --> 42:06.280]  Oh, and there is even another scandal that has come out in the last few days regarding
[42:06.280 --> 42:13.160]  a priest who was condemned by the Italian authorities, but the Vatican since last week
[42:13.160 --> 42:18.840]  reinstalled him so he could preach mass, he could celebrate mass.
[42:18.840 --> 42:21.400]  So this is really scandalous.
[42:21.400 --> 42:28.080]  And of course, all this is in the Italian media has been cited, it's been put cleverly
[42:28.080 --> 42:33.280]  on the side during these elections, which of course are taking the majority of the space,
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.920]  even if they are completely rigged and we know that nothing will change.
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.040]  All right, Leo Zagami, thank you so much for your time.
[42:40.040 --> 42:46.840]  Again, the story, Italy's 2018 rigged elections by Leo Zagami is on infowars.com right now.
[42:46.840 --> 42:50.800]  I say the Vatican, I mean, we need serious reformation.
[42:50.800 --> 42:52.640]  The pope is a joke.
[42:52.640 --> 42:56.280]  The holes in the basements and the dwellings of the Vatican need to be investigated.
[42:56.280 --> 42:59.720]  What kind of secret history does the Vatican know?
[42:59.720 --> 43:01.880]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.080]  We're really, really proud of it.

[43:54.280 --> 43:56.760]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[45:00.280 --> 45:06.640]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[45:06.640 --> 45:13.000]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[45:13.000 --> 45:20.240]  or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[45:20.240 --> 45:22.440]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[45:22.440 --> 45:26.160]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.840]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste

[45:36.120 --> 45:38.720]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[45:38.720 --> 45:41.960]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.920]  Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[45:45.920 --> 45:50.360]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[45:50.360 --> 45:53.200]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.320]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[45:56.320 --> 46:01.040]  against us so we need your support.
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.800]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfowarsLife.
[46:05.800 --> 46:10.920]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.120]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.240]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:19.240 --> 46:23.720]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[46:23.720 --> 46:28.320]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.760]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[46:32.760 --> 46:35.240]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[46:35.240 --> 46:39.320]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[46:39.320 --> 46:40.320]  That's why.
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.200]  Improving gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.640]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care, and a 50 billion
[46:48.640 --> 46:52.000]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.240]  Head to InfowarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today.
[46:56.240 --> 47:03.400]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[47:03.400 --> 47:33.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:34.280 --> 47:37.960]  Thanks, Gene, for consolidating power.
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.240]  China has become more and more autocratic over the past six months to a year.
[47:43.240 --> 47:46.840]  He's made conscious moves to become more and more autocratic.
[47:46.840 --> 47:53.520]  You have Donald Trump praising Erdogan when he consolidates power, when he goes out and
[47:53.520 --> 48:08.320]  rags his butt, when Republicans ignore the fact that this man is talking about being
[48:08.320 --> 48:15.240]  president for life, if they think that Donald Trump is joking, then they're fools.
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.520]  Alex Jones here on the road with two really important points I want to make.
[48:18.520 --> 48:25.600]  In a moment I'll get into CNN's claim, and now MSNBC's claim via Joe Scarborough that
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.440]  President Trump wants to be a dictator.
[48:29.440 --> 48:31.480]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.040]  First off, I just really want to up front thank all the listeners and viewers and supporters
[48:36.040 --> 48:42.360]  and activists and pro-liberty people out there that have taken action the last two weeks.
[48:42.360 --> 48:49.720]  All Info Wars has been under massive boycotts, massive hack attacks, massive disinformation
[48:49.720 --> 48:58.840]  campaigns, false EEOC complaints filed via Hillary Clinton's former lawyer.
[48:58.840 --> 49:04.680]  The list goes on and on, and because of your steadfastness and your support and standing
[49:04.680 --> 49:11.160]  beside us and standing with us, Info Wars is moving forward through this unprecedented
[49:11.160 --> 49:18.440]  barrage and attack and maintaining our current trajectory to expand in the face of the globalists.
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.120]  But your support has just come in right at where we needed it, so I want to thank you
[49:22.120 --> 49:23.120]  all.
[49:23.120 --> 49:27.280]  I want to thank the local radio stations, the TV stations, everybody.
[49:27.280 --> 49:32.200]  One area that has expanded under the attack is the number of TV stations and radio stations
[49:32.200 --> 49:34.640]  contacting us to pick up the broadcast.
[49:34.640 --> 49:41.520]  We have been deluged the last few months, but now it has reached really an amazing deluge
[49:41.520 --> 49:47.240]  with the crew that we've got, two great men working on taking all your calls and signing
[49:47.240 --> 49:49.720]  all the affiliate relations agreements, but I want to make it clear.
[49:49.720 --> 49:51.120]  For television, we are free to air.
[49:51.120 --> 49:57.360]  You can play over all the ads, U Name It, UHFVHF Cable, U Name It.
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.320]  We are here for you, infowars.com, forward slash show, that links the affiliate page
[50:02.320 --> 50:05.040]  and the contact information.
[50:05.040 --> 50:06.040]  Now that's it.
[50:06.040 --> 50:11.200]  We've had Hillary Clinton's former, not just lawyer, but her former assistant lawyer when
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.480]  he got out of Georgetown and then worked for its State Department.
[50:15.480 --> 50:24.840]  He is quarterbacking the complete fiction filings that we are completely confident will be
[50:24.840 --> 50:29.800]  disintegrated in court and that we will be totally vindicated and then take action after
[50:29.800 --> 50:35.600]  that because we have to set the precedent that you can't just absolutely tell unbelievable
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.080]  lies about us and get away with it, that sets the precedent for not just us to be defamed
[50:40.080 --> 50:41.480]  for political purposes, but others.
[50:41.480 --> 50:44.800]  So again, that's a serious fight coming up and that takes major funds, so we appreciate
[50:44.800 --> 50:46.280]  all of you supporting us.
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.840]  We've got the biggest sales ever extended right through this week that we had last week,
[50:50.840 --> 50:54.600]  the Paul Revere, Defend Free Speech, Defend the Internet, Defend the Second Amendment
[50:54.600 --> 50:55.600]  broadcast.
[50:55.600 --> 51:03.160]  And that's going to extend those sales, get us to hear my sweet little daughter back
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.880]  there, ten months old now.
[51:04.880 --> 51:08.000]  Did she just turn ten months three days ago, baby?
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.240]  So I don't know, I don't know, fifty days ago.
[51:11.240 --> 51:19.720]  So we've got all that going on today, so again, ladies and gentlemen, where was that
[51:19.720 --> 51:22.440]  before we had some a little sweetheart chiming in?
[51:22.440 --> 51:25.200]  Oh, I was getting into.
[51:25.200 --> 51:29.800]  We're having these big sales in defense of the Second Amendment, defense of free speech,
[51:29.800 --> 51:30.800]  defense of the Internet.
[51:30.800 --> 51:37.240]  And you can see how it is going on big time, and they can't stand the fact that you continue
[51:37.240 --> 51:43.480]  to support us, that you continue to pray for us, that you continue to take action.
[51:43.480 --> 51:48.800]  Now that said, let's get to the latest info, not against us, but against Trump.
[51:48.800 --> 51:54.520]  Oh, but let me add one other point on that issue.
[51:54.520 --> 51:55.520]  It's incredible.
[51:55.520 --> 52:00.000]  I'm not even going to give these so-called journalists any attention, but without looking,
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.960]  I saw three different publications last night and this morning.
[52:06.960 --> 52:15.240]  Three different publications that said that I totally made it up, YouTube isn't trying
[52:15.240 --> 52:20.880]  to bring me down, nobody's filing false complaints, there are no strikes, there have been five
[52:20.880 --> 52:22.160]  strikes in ten days.
[52:22.160 --> 52:26.160]  Now, they've removed all but one of them, but three of those would bring us down.
[52:26.160 --> 52:30.240]  We had three strikes as of Saturday, but the account was still there.
[52:30.240 --> 52:34.560]  I called some of our sources inside YouTube and they went and looked at it and they said,
[52:34.560 --> 52:36.160]  yeah, this is really weird.
[52:36.160 --> 52:40.920]  It feels like some of your strikes have disappeared, but it doesn't even say that they accepted
[52:40.920 --> 52:41.920]  your appeal.
[52:41.920 --> 52:43.560]  This is very unusual.
[52:43.560 --> 52:48.360]  There's three strikes sitting here, maybe it's under review, but a lot of times it'll
[52:48.360 --> 52:52.000]  just roll over in a few hours and it hasn't rolled over yet and then you'll be deleted.
[52:52.000 --> 53:00.600]  Last night, I saw two articles, this morning I saw another one saying I made it up, CNN
[53:00.600 --> 53:04.640]  ten days ago didn't say they were filing complaints to get us taken down.
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.200]  There weren't thousands of news articles saying that the last ten days.
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.760]  There's not CNN going out and trying to stop Neil Strauss from working with me to publish
[53:13.760 --> 53:16.000]  a book on CNN money.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.760]  There's not CNN contacting a bunch of the so-called sponsors on YouTube that really
[53:19.760 --> 53:23.920]  weren't even sponsors and getting them to pull advertising to break this press fenith
[53:23.920 --> 53:24.920]  and I'm collapsing.
[53:24.920 --> 53:32.000]  None of that happened because a particular Buzzfeed writer says so and he talked to somebody
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.760]  that hasn't worked at our office in two years.
[53:35.760 --> 53:37.720]  Now that's journalism.
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.200]  We talked to someone that worked there two years ago and they say YouTube didn't talk
[53:42.200 --> 53:44.440]  to Jones.
[53:44.440 --> 53:45.440]  That's funny.
[53:45.440 --> 53:46.440]  That's really, really funny.
[53:46.440 --> 53:49.600]  That person never had any contact with anyone at YouTube accounts and nothing to do with
[53:49.600 --> 53:50.600]  that.
[53:50.600 --> 53:51.600]  I mean that is at the next level.
[53:51.600 --> 53:56.120]  I saw two other articles just saying, so see they haven't succeeded in taking us down.
[53:56.120 --> 53:57.120]  You know they're fighting hard.
[53:57.120 --> 54:05.160]  They're all over the news and so now they're just saying that it's all made up.
[54:05.160 --> 54:06.160]  It's all a hoax.
[54:06.160 --> 54:08.560]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[54:08.560 --> 54:14.760]  Now continuing, they were always saying that President Trump wasn't really running for
[54:14.760 --> 54:15.760]  president.
[54:15.760 --> 54:16.760]  It was all a stunt.
[54:16.760 --> 54:20.440]  That's why he's running for a second term because it's all a stunt and he never wanted
[54:20.440 --> 54:21.440]  to be president.
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.440]  Yeah, right.
[54:22.440 --> 54:26.040]  Alright, finishing this transmission, I got a call that interrupted me.
[54:26.040 --> 54:29.720]  The point is that they always said that President Trump didn't want to run for president and
[54:29.720 --> 54:30.720]  it was all a big hoax.
[54:30.720 --> 54:34.040]  It's about all the money he spent, the time, the energy.
[54:34.040 --> 54:35.560]  They said his wife didn't want to do it.
[54:35.560 --> 54:37.360]  I've talked to people behind the scenes.
[54:37.360 --> 54:40.760]  Trump's been totally committed from the beginning, really believes in what he's doing.
[54:40.760 --> 54:45.760]  Now that said, remember they all said CNN, you name it, that he never wanted to be president.
[54:45.760 --> 54:52.720]  Well now he announces 980-something days out that he wants to be president and he wants
[54:52.720 --> 55:00.120]  to run for a second term and then, he's speaking at Marlago a few days ago, I remember seeing
[55:00.120 --> 55:02.760]  the CNN article about it but actually went and looked at some of the other articles about
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.320]  folks that were actually there and he was joking about the Chinese president getting
[55:09.320 --> 55:12.920]  rid of term limits and basically becoming a dictator because he's already elected by
[55:12.920 --> 55:16.880]  the Communist Party and in other accounts they said that everybody laughed.
[55:16.880 --> 55:18.640]  He was telling jokes.
[55:18.640 --> 55:25.400]  Even the CNN report says he was telling jokes but they still acted like it was serious.
[55:25.400 --> 55:35.360]  Now people like Scarborough, Mr. Disinformation, who said he never wanted to be president,
[55:35.360 --> 55:41.080]  who said Trump was a fraud, he comes out and says Trump's serious and wants to be a dictator.
[55:41.080 --> 55:47.760]  Now if Trump did get rid of term limits and then he was elected by U.S. citizens, that
[55:47.760 --> 55:51.760]  would mean we got rid of term limits for the presidency like we don't have for the Congress.
[55:51.760 --> 55:54.280]  He wouldn't be a dictator, he'd be elected but here's the key.
[55:54.280 --> 55:59.360]  Trump has said he wants to do it in one term if he could and fix the country and leave
[55:59.360 --> 56:05.280]  or he'd do it in two but he'll be 79 years old when he leaves office if he gets a second
[56:05.280 --> 56:06.280]  term.
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.840]  79, he got into office at 71, okay?
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.360]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, this is a complete fraud.
[56:16.360 --> 56:21.720]  He was joking and that shows how you can't even joke with these people because they
[56:21.720 --> 56:23.720]  spin everything.
[56:23.720 --> 56:27.280]  Bill Clinton said things would be a lot easier if I was a dictator just so long as I'm the
[56:27.280 --> 56:33.640]  dictator and so did, so did Obama, so did a bunch of Bush, a bunch of them said that.
[56:33.640 --> 56:37.920]  But with Trump, he's transferring power back to the people, taking it away from the globalist,
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.000]  taking it away from the dictatorial TPP, taking it away from the dictatorial EU that's unelected.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.800]  China is run by a communist dictatorship.
[56:44.800 --> 56:47.120]  The EU is an unelected dictatorship.
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.640]  The Democrats are the ones that want to bring in total tyranny and ban free speech.
[56:50.640 --> 56:56.680]  They're the authoritarians and so their claims of pushing all this are a total and complete
[56:56.680 --> 56:57.680]  abject fraud.
[56:57.680 --> 57:00.680]  All right, again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[57:00.680 --> 57:05.880]  I want to salute you, infowars.com, newswars.com, prisonbunna.com.

[57:08.720 --> 57:09.720]  They are so critical.
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.040]  Please spread the word and please understand the fight to censor us is ongoing, but they're
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.960]  censoring everybody and they backed down the last few days, but then SPLC operatives
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.360]  that run YouTube now are coming back in and still doing the strikes.
[57:22.360 --> 57:25.040]  So this ongoing saga is going to be ongoing.
[57:25.040 --> 57:30.800]  They're just hoping to confuse everybody and keep manipulating things until you guys just
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.640]  give up and stop paying attention and that's how freedom dies is in the dark.
[57:34.640 --> 57:36.720]  So there's an information war going on.
[57:36.720 --> 57:40.000]  It's who wants to fight the distance, who wants to go the 12 rounds.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.840]  We're winning right now in round seven, but it's a close one.

[58:54.720 --> 58:58.960]  of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[58:58.960 --> 59:03.480]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[59:03.480 --> 59:06.200]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[59:06.200 --> 59:13.240]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works and there's no way to quantify
[59:13.240 --> 59:18.360]  how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[59:18.360 --> 59:24.200]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[59:44.480 --> 59:46.120]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[59:46.120 --> 59:53.560]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[59:53.560 --> 01:00:07.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:18.440]  You found it the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:25.920]  So the Oscars were last night, nobody knew, but they did happen and Jimmy Kimmel, he blew
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:34.200]  it, he sucked again, he had to push his political agenda during his monologues, of course pushing
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:43.120]  gun control, bashing Trump, lying about the misnomer of unequal pay, says penis-free Oscar
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.040]  statue is Hollywood's ideal man.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.760]  How did a guy, Jimmy Kimmel, go from hosting the man show that featured women on trampolines
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.240]  to the human knish that you see in front of you that is now just a mouthpiece for the
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.800]  Democrat Party?
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:09.720]  What a pathetic sack, but nobody watched as the Oscars hit ratings low, meanwhile Black
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:18.520]  Panther continues to surge in the box office while what used to be a popular actress, Jennifer
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.440]  Lawrence, Red Sparrow, flops, yeah, that's what happens, Jennifer, when you try to shove
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.960]  your political agenda down people's throats.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.640]  Ryan Seacrest is under attack with accusations, he's fighting them, it's just a dangerous
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.000]  precedent that these people are setting where you just can accuse somebody of sexual harassment
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.960]  and then they're guilty without due process.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:46.200]  And one of the Nimrods over at the Oscars last night, Emma Watson, first of all, she
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:53.040]  has a haircut straight out of Dumb and Dumber, and then she goes dumbest and she puts a tattoo
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:02.600]  on her arm, times up and misspells time, ouch, but you know what's funny, time is up, time
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:08.240]  is up on you, time is up on Hollywood, time is up on being bullied by the left, time is
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.400]  up on the deep state, time is up on globalism, so time is up.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.000]  Can you imagine though if we had the schools guarded like the Oscars were guarded last
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.960]  night, can you imagine if we had the same type of security at our schools that we had
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.800]  at the Oscars last night?
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.560]  But this is Hollywood, these are the gods and goddesses, so we have to have arm security
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.640]  for them, but the children, you know, we just push gun control when something bad happens
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.640]  to them.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.440]  But here's a little montage of some of the highlights from last night's Oscars that
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:03:08.160]  everybody missed.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:21.040]  This is the guy who used to host the show that was all about men objectifying women.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.200]  I'm done, thank you, thank you, that's why nobody watches.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.160]  You know what, I'm glad that they go with the theme times up, I'm telling you, time
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:38.120]  is up for them, their time is up, yeah, there's the old, yeah, yeah, pull that back up, there's
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.880]  the old logo for the man show, the man show, it was called the man show.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.880]  And then, I mean, so this is actually art from Sabo, who we have on, who's gonna come
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.400]  on today.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.360]  Actually at one o'clock here central, Sabo is gonna come on, now this guy's become famous
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:03.220]  for some of his street art, where he just uses art and creativity to call out the double
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:10.680]  standards in Hollywood and to call out the double standards of liberalism.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:16.240]  So Sabo's gonna be joining us, it's just nuts, I mean these people are such frauds, oh man
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.680]  made global warming, how much gasoline do you think all of them burnt flying on their
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.240]  jets to get to the Oscars last night, how much energy do you think was spent lighting
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.520]  the Oscars so that all the prima donnas could be properly lit, how about all the money spent
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.800]  on security and arms to secure that event, but don't have that at schools, no, no, no,
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.800]  no, if there's a threat of a gun at a school, the answer is gun control, but if there's
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.760]  a threat on the celebrities at the Oscars, the answer is arm security, lots of guns,
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.280]  heavy security, that makes sense, you see Hollywood stars are all that matters, they're
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:58.440]  the most important thing on earth, just ask them.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.400]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support

[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:17.360]  your television, keep your television, it's probably watching you so just go to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:24.120]  and support us and help us grow in the face of CNN and eventually just drown CNN fake
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.040]  news out.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:34.080]  My next, there's a nice picture of Lemonhead, Don Lemonhead, my next guest is Brandon Tatum
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:40.600]  at the officer Tatum, you can find his YouTube channel, BTCruiser34, you probably recognize
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.160]  him, he's been on with us before, we're going to talk a little bit about gun control, a
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.320]  little bit about some of the other issues going on right now.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:53.640]  You know, Brandon, it's just amazing to me how here we are in the middle of being lectured
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:01.160]  by all of the liberals, you can't have guns, we need to stop ARs, we need to do something
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.560]  about this Second Amendment and all this stuff and then you have the Oscars last night, I
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.720]  know what do you have, armed security, heavily secured, you know, lots of security detail
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.840]  with guns, I mean, it's weird how they want to be protected by guns, but if you want to
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.920]  protect a school with guns, the answer is no guns.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.520]  Yeah, I think it's just we're being influenced to run, not you and I, but the masses are
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.800]  being influenced and run by people who are ignorant that just have a platform.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.720]  So ignorant people with a platform, they spew out all of these things that sound politically
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.200]  correct, that sounds, I guess conducive to their cause, but it's absolutely ignorant,
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]  man.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.400]  There's no way form of fashion that people that can sit in a room and feel comfortable
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.760]  safe and protected by others will then reject the idea that our students and our schools,
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.920]  our young people and even citizens walking around with the Second Amendment, you know,
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.440]  constitutional right should be somehow robbed of their rights to defend themselves.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:03.320]  Yeah, and it's very, it's just a very dangerous slippery slope, even to ban bump stocks in
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.520]  my opinion, because they want to use this terminology where they say anything that increases
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.520]  the rate of fire.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:12.320]  So what are they going to come after next, a new trigger, a new scope, I mean, so there's
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.000]  all kinds of things there.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.640]  But you know, going back, you're a former police officer, when you looked at the event
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.920]  that happened in Florida, just from a scenario situation and you hear about the officers
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.720]  not going in, you hear about the stand down, you hear about them telling medical teams
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.080]  not to go in and then the medical teams saying we wanted to go in and we were told not to
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080]  go in.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.840]  I mean, what kind of tactics are, were they using there?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.920]  I mean, did this sound like normal police tactics or did it sound like something else
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920]  was going on?
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:46.600]  Well, this is a complete disgrace from the top all the way down, you know, obviously
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:52.480]  they dropped the ball in multiple areas with the FBI, the local law enforcement, the school,
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.280]  somebody dropped the ball when it comes to this kid, they could have prevented the shooting,
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.720]  had nothing to do with gun laws.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.680]  If they would have just implemented the things that are already in place, this guy wouldn't
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.680]  have killed anybody.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.240]  But the protocol for active shooting, I mean, I learned this six years ago when I became
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.840]  a police officer and this has been going on forever.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.720]  When there's an active shooting that is occurring in the school, you have to man up and you
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.040]  have to take responsibility for you being the one to have to save these young children.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.400]  There is no staging.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.400]  There is no planning.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.800]  I mean, you may have two or three seconds to figure out how you're going to go and assess
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.080]  the issue and take down the threat.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.080]  That's it.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.080]  There is no waiting.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.920]  There is no coming up with ideas.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.760]  There's no, I'm waiting for my commander.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.320]  And I'll tell you what, as a police officer, a former police officer, if I was in that
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.560]  situation, if the chief came and told me, stand down, I'll tell him to screw himself
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.760]  and I'll go in there and save those children's lives.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.600]  Because I look at it as if, what if those were my children?
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.040]  What if my kids were in that school getting shot to death?
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.160]  Would I sit outside and wait or would I go in there and risk my life to save those children?
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.640]  Well, and it sounds to me that the officer that is being called a coward that didn't
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.040]  go into the situation, it sounds to me like he was trying to use some sort of tactical
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.600]  excuse and say, well, I didn't know where the shooter was, so I was trying to hold my
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600]  place.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.600]  Okay, maybe that's true.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.600]  Maybe it's not.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.600]  But according to the way that they train you, that's not how it was supposed to go down.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.760]  And then on the back end, though, it's almost as if they're trying to protect this officer
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.040]  and then they let him walk away with his pension and retire.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.000]  I mean, how do they allow this to happen?
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.920]  First the guy, dereliction of duty, doesn't go in to save children's lives and then they're
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.400]  going to give him a nice severance package on top of it?
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.600]  Yeah, it's disgraceful, man.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.120]  I'm not sure what the heck is going on in that county.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120]  I don't understand.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.560]  Listen, our general orders in my former police department is cowardice is actually against
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.560]  the general order.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.040]  Like if you cower in any situation that's presented to you and that caused other people
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:56.640]  to get hurt or you can pretty much fail in your assignment, you can be terminated.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.920]  And when I say terminated, terminated doesn't mean give you an early retirement.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.440]  Terminated means that you have not accomplished what you've sworn to do, therefore, you can
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.000]  no longer do this job.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.400]  If you can no longer do this job before your retirement date, then that means you're fine.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]  No pension or nothing.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.000]  I honestly believe that I know that man probably worked his whole career, worked for 20 years.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:26.080]  But when you, in your career, being a coward, not saving lives, you don't deserve a pension.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.600]  You deserve to keep working until you figure out what's going on in your inner man that
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.000]  you will let people die.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.480]  There's no tactical advantage.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.840]  There's no tactical scheme.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.040]  Listen, when you see people getting shot, why everybody's running and screaming, you need
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.600]  to be tracking the person who's shooting people because if he's on the other side of the school
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.520]  and you're sitting at a post, he's going to kill people before you run into it.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.080]  So I don't like his excuse.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.320]  I understand the hard work and dedication it takes to be a police officer.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.760]  But at the end of the day, when you do something that egregious, you shouldn't have your pension.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.280]  Well, and it sounds to me like you could have yourself sit this down if you're the officer
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.400]  and you can say, look, I was a coward that day.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.720]  I blew it.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.200]  And so I'm going to quit.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.600]  You know, I can no longer fulfill my duties.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600]  I just can't do it.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600]  I don't have the spine anymore.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600]  Whatever.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600]  So he quits.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.680]  And then you have the sheriff, you know, who lambasts him saying, yeah, he's a coward.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.680]  He blew it.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.040]  But then they give him his retirement.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.720]  I mean, it just sounds very strange.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.520]  I mean, if this went on in a department that you worked for, what would you be thinking
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.840]  about the sheriff that allowed this to happen?
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.240]  Oh, man, I mean, I don't understand how he still have his job because it starts from
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.600]  the top down when your officers are not responding properly and you have to wait to wait for an
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:43.680]  outside agency to come and take responsibility for a situation that you were initially responding
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680]  to.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.240]  Then that means that the chief is not, or the sheriff is not doing his job.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.840]  That person is voted in.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.600]  That person can be voted out.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.680]  And I don't understand how this man still has his job after he gets on TV and says some
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.280]  of the dumbest things that I've ever heard, he failed to take accountability for anything
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.280]  that happened.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.680]  I don't think I heard him say it was his fault.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.760]  He keep pointing the finger, blaming the NRA and everybody else from the things that I've
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  heard.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.120]  But at the end of the day, man, what it comes down to is that this man needs to take accountability
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:16.280]  for his actions when his troops don't do what they're supposed to do, causing people
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.160]  to lose their lives unnecessarily, even when it comes to reporting or even the actions
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.160]  during that day.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.080]  That man need to, he need to step down.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.880]  He need to walk away from the job.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.240]  He don't need to pander to anybody else.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.800]  And I think that that was a failed part on everybody's end for that man to keep his
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.720]  job and for them officers to not act.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:40.280]  Yeah, there were about 10 to 20 mistakes that should have prevented that shooting from
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:46.400]  happening long before Cruz ever decided to grab that gun, hop in an Uber and show up
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.960]  at school that day.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.360]  It's really sad, but we need to talk about the real issues here.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.560]  And there's about 20 of them before we even get to gun control.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.160]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:04.000]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  I buy some.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  I use some.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  I store some.

[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.120]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID Blocking Wallet technology over 10 years ago, major
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.200]  designer brands have tried to create their own versions, but do they really work?
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.080]  We let real people test designer brand RFID Blocking Wallets using the same rigorous testing

[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.000]  I expected notable brands to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.640]  was not fully protective.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.160]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.160]  that they do.

[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.040]  I Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.880]  I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold Wallets to my friends and family.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.880]  Check the label.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.480]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.120]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold Wallet.

[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.360]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.200]  particles in the gut.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.640]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.

[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:25.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:33.720]  So Kim Jong Un is going to be meeting with South Korean officials and this is the first
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:42.320]  time since he became leader in 2011 he's going to be meeting face to face with South Korean
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.880]  officials.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.200]  Now how much credit does Trump get for that?
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:55.000]  Well you can have that conversation but certainly you would think some, you would say that President
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.720]  Trump has certainly influenced Kim Jong Un some and the South Koreans some.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.880]  So he deserves some credit.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:11.000]  Now CNN covered this story in like five different articles and hardly gave Trump any credit
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.880]  for it at all.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:20.080]  So it's Trump's fault when North Korea threatens to blow us all up, then it's Trump's fault
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.200]  when North Korea actually might be getting diplomatic with South Korea for the first
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:30.480]  time in almost a decade though, you know, Trump is nowhere to be found in a CNN article.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.720]  So that's just how the Communist News Network operates.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.160]  That is if they can find time from praising Kim Jong Un's sister all day long.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.400]  My guest is Brandon Tatum, former police officer.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.640]  You can find him on Twitter at the officer Tatum, his YouTube channel BTCruiser34 and
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:53.160]  his Patreon account Patreon slash Brandon Tatum is how you can support him, check out
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.520]  all of his work.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.960]  Let's go, let's get into the Oscars.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.880]  Now Brandon, I'm pretty sure that we're about the same age, I'm 28 years old.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:05.640]  I remember growing up, I think it was on, actually I think it was on like the original
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.240]  expansion of Fox Sports, it was like Fox Sports West or something or it was featured on I
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.200]  think the first Fox Sports expansion when they launched all these other syndicates and
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.280]  it was the man show and it was on late nights and I would always watch it, you know, when
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:26.320]  my parents went to bed and you know, I'm enjoying the fact that there's these, you know, women
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.960]  bouncing around on trampolines and Jimmy and Norm MacDonald are making the crass potty
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.960]  humor jokes.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.920]  Okay, you know, it was funny for a young kid, you know, staying up late.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.440]  How did we go from that Jimmy Kimmel to the Jimmy Kimmel we see today that's a mouthpiece
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.120]  for the Democrat Party and beyond that, I guess you could understand how that happens,
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:51.840]  but how is it that he actually gets to fill this throne, he is the heir of the liberals
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.640]  to tell us how to think on late night television at the Oscars, it's like, how does he make
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.240]  that transition and get away with it?
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:05.080]  Yeah, man, I have no idea, that's probably the million dollar question, man.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:11.720]  It's really interesting to me that these people have gone completely berserk, man.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.280]  They've, you know, Trump derangement syndrome, and I said this early in the year, people
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.840]  reiterate this, but I really think it's the real thing, man.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.080]  These people are cracking up left and right.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.440]  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel is losing his mind and they have no shame in what they're saying.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.880]  Even as ridiculous as it is, they have no shame.
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.880]  I don't understand.
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:37.800]  Maybe because he, you know, taking the syndrome pill or something and he's gone crazy and
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.880]  he's adopted the principles, so they want to continue to use him moving forward.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.760]  Other than that, I have no idea why this guy is acting like this.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.280]  No, I think when the, we're on, are we on the DSM five now, guys?
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.640]  When the DSM six comes out, Trump derangement syndrome honestly needs to be in it.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.520]  No, I think that that's a real thing.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.040]  Now I doubt that, I doubt that, but it should.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040]  I mean, this is a real thing.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.120]  We're actually dealing with this.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.480]  I mean, look at this.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:08.760]  Peter suspends user for calling Maxine Waters crazy old lying lunatic and a bad wig.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.260]  That's just the truth.
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.440]  I mean, that's just the truth.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.440]  And then Maxine Waters says, Maxine Waters says that Trump is racist for questioning
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.680]  her IQ.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:23.920]  If that isn't Trump derangement syndrome, I don't know what is Maxine Waters has Trump
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.920]  derangement syndrome.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.400]  How else do you explain it?
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.920]  Yeah, yeah, they, I mean, I'm telling you what, man, it's not even just the people who
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.120]  are in these political positions.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.120]  People with a lot of fame.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.600]  I mean, every day people that I run into are completely losing their minds.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.600]  I mean, with no kind of articulable facts to illustrate anything that they're talking
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600]  about.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.720]  All it is, if you say Trump, they go straight to saying he's a racist, that he's never
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.720]  done nothing.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.360]  I've had people say that he haven't passed any legislation or we're not passing legislation
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.960]  that Trump hasn't done anything for this country that Trump is running us into the ground.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.720]  He's racist against black people trying to put us back into slavery.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:08.560]  I have had people literally grown adults who supposedly have a functioning brain that are
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.040]  saying things like this, and not only are they saying these things, they actually believe
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.040]  these things.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.440]  That is the, that is the huge problem.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:20.040]  And I think that that's where we come into play, that we continue to push the message.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:24.480]  We continue to tell the truth no matter at what cost it is.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.760]  And for people who support us to continue to show support so we can, so we can have a
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.480]  platform to pass this message on, because if we do not, if we fail to do this at this
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.600]  crucial time, then these leftist lunatics with Trump derangement syndrome are gonna
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.800]  influence our children, not mine and yours, but they're gonna influence the young people
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800]  of this country.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.280]  And before you know it, we're not gonna have a country anymore.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.040]  So I think it's invaluable for us to continue the path that we're doing and for people who
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.960]  are really a part of this movement and message to continue to support and keep us moving
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  forward.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.160]  And they really are already doing that.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.960]  I mean, this is what we're seeing in the public education system at the universities.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.480]  It's really sad.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.800]  But it's like a gut blow.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.320]  I mean, it's like you talk to an individual and you say, all right, you know, why don't
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320]  you like Trump?
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.800]  But Trump hasn't done anything for America.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.960]  He puts Russia before America and it's just like, it's like you just got kicked in the
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  gut.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]  You're like, oh, like what?
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.720]  Like what in the, you can't even believe it's like you lose your air.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.280]  It's like, how do you, what?
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]  All right.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280]  You know what?
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.880]  The mental institution is two blocks that way, I think you'll find where you belong.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.880]  All right.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.320]  Brandon, I wanted to bring this story up today and you used to play football at the University
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.320]  of Arizona.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.640]  So I wanted to bring up this story because I find it very inspiring.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.000]  One handed linebacker makes statement with Combine performance, Shakeem Griffin.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.960]  I'm not sure if you know this guy, but he has, he's a linebacker from Central Florida
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:52.200]  University and he's missing a hand and part of his arm and he's doing well in the Combine.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.720]  He's trying to become an NFL linebacker.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.440]  But the reason I wanted to bring this up, and you can talk about, you know, obviously
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.440]  the difficulty it would be for a, for a linebacker to play with one hand.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.040]  I mean, that's the biggest thing you got to wrap people up and tackle them.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:10.040]  But to me, this is a great story of perseverance, of not letting the status quo keep you down,
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.120]  of just pounding through whatever obstacles you have to get through to accomplish your
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120]  dream.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.400]  I mean, what do you think about this, this one handed linebacker trying to make the NFL
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.400]  right now?
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.400]  Pretty inspiring to me.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.920]  Yeah, it's pretty inspiring, but this is, this is the American spirit.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.680]  This is, this is what I feel America is all about.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.920]  Is people who overcome adversities with minimal excuses, because this is a perfect example.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.440]  That man can lay down, say, I don't have a hand on missing part of my arm, so maybe
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.720]  I can't tackle or I'm not good enough or I shouldn't give it a try.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:46.040]  But with the spirit, the American spirit that I feel like is in me and you, is that you
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.440]  don't have time to waste making excuses.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.040]  If you want to get it done, then you get it done at all costs.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.120]  And because he's not using these excuses of, of, I don't know, that he was held down when
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  he was young.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.680]  He probably got bullied when he was young.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.920]  All of these things, he's putting that aside and saying, you know what, I'm going to pursue
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:07.880]  my dreams with all I have and in this country is the only country that I can do that and
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.200]  actually become successful.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.840]  So man, I think kudos to him.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.980]  I hope he make it to the NFL and I hope he show the world that it does not matter what
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:16.480]  disposition you have.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.920]  If you bust your tail, you work hard, you believe you can accomplish anything.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920]  Exactly.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.920]  That is so well said.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.560]  And that is the American dream.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.560]  And you know what?
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.400]  It probably is a lot harder for Shaq Griffin to make the NFL than people with two hands,
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.000]  but he's not going to let that stop him.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.360]  That's what America is all about.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360]  That's the American dream.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.440]  That's, that's inspirational to me.

[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920]  Hear that?
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.480]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.440]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.960]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.880]  TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:04.080]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.200]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.400]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.520]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.600]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.040]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.520]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:37.600]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.600]  That's why.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.440]  Your immune gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.880]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care, and a 50 billion
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.240]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.480]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today.

[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.760]  the products that you need each month.

[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.800]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.400]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.920]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.360]  and normal breathing.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360]  This is pollen block.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.680]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.760]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.440]  and excessive mucus production.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.200]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:38.320]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.120]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.720]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.960]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:33:01.160]  InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-A-253-3139.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:12.720]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:19.440]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:32.640]  the Infowar and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:37.520]  Jones here about to take off on a family vacation here.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.040]  We'll be working vacation, there will be live reports, there will be tape reports coming
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.040]  in.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.000]  Owen Troyer's been a great job hosting live right now, but before they close the cockpit
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.400]  door and I take off, I wanted to call in with a couple of key tidbits.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:56.800]  A very, very exciting positive news that the globalists do not want us to celebrate or
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:03.080]  be aware of, because it is a road map, it is a major road map to victory.
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.960]  And that road map to victory is this, they just had Italian elections and they've got
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.160]  about eight different major parties, they're a parliamentary system, not two major parties
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.440]  like us.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:19.760]  And the huge news is, ladies and gentlemen, is that normally a populist party or other
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.120]  side parties might get 5% of the vote, they got right above 50% and the Democratic Party
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.720]  of Italy just was swept from power and their leader just resigned.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:34.000]  This is happening in every nation across the world, so the demographic numbers, the facts,
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.360]  the voting blocks, all show that despite the fact that the globalists have had to flood
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:42.880]  the first world, the third world populations and brainwash them and the globalist minions,
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.400]  it has not been successful at all.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.200]  So there is that really, really exciting news that that happens.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.880]  And then of course, in the history of...
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.280]  I'll get my backpack a little cold, tell us a little warmth as we were sitting out on
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.360]  the tarmac for an hour and a half, thank you.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.280]  Okay, there you go, we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour and a half, but there's
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  a lot to take off now.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.360]  Let me just get back to what I was saying.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.120]  The other big news is in the history of Kim Jong-un being the third generational dictator
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:16.000]  of North Korea, he's never met with any delegation from the South, but he invited the intelligence
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.960]  minister and others there of an emergency meeting and that just shows you how Trump has gotten
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.160]  them to come to the table and in the history before that, there's only been other three
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.520]  other such meetings.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:33.640]  So since 1949 when the whole communist invasion happened out of China and they tried to take
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:38.400]  over North and South Korea, this is the fourth such meeting of this type improves the Trump
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.960]  is right by not going along with the strategic patients and letting them build their nuclear
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.800]  arsenal and threaten their neighbors, but by standing up to them and building up force
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:51.200]  and being serious about doing something, they have been now forced to back off and come
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.200]  to the table.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.720]  So yet again, ladies and gentlemen, things are really changing, it's a big deal.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.800]  Now here's the negative news, I saw the reports on early voting here in Texas, the AP report
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:08.080]  of the Democrats have doubled their turnout in early voting that they did in the major
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:14.840]  election in 2016 and normally you've got about 20% more that vote during a general election,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.600]  not a midterm election, so the fact that the Democrats are doubling in their turnout in
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.120]  the early voting in Texas shows it's going to be absolutely massive and in many other
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.600]  states like California and Illinois, they let illegal aliens get driver's license and
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.360]  then vote, so that tells you that there's major election fraud going on everywhere and
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:40.760]  that they're voting repeatedly and often as Obama told the illegal aliens to do and folks
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.080]  voting on the names of dead people, so if your father or mother or brother or sister
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.560]  died and they're on the voting roll, you've got to go check the voting roll and make sure
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.280]  they're taken off the voting roll or you can believe for many decades there's some folks
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:58.680]  voting that were 150 years old in Illinois, they will be voting for the next few decades
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:03.440]  at least unless you don't let the Democrats vote in their stat, people tend to blame illegal
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.320]  aliens, they're just people they put on buses and take around to vote 10 times off the voter
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:10.840]  roll, it's really the Democratic Party caught on video orchestrating that entire situation
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:15.480]  as you know, the project very cost caught them, so good news, humanity's waking up,
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:19.560]  populism's exploding, but the globalists are engaged in more crime than ever.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.440]  Back to Owen Schrodinger live transmission from the ATX, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:28.960]  You know, this really is an interesting story that I've kind of been monitoring and it just
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.600]  actually keeps getting worse where now as Alex was just reporting they have the numbers
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.280]  in where it looks like they're actually getting double the amount of early voting registration
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.720]  for Democrats that they have in the past and you actually break it down by numbers specifically
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:50.600]  if you look at the state of Texas and it's very strange because you say at one angle
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.560]  you could understand, okay, the liberals are foaming at the mouth right now, they are going
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.880]  around doing all these voting registration activities, they do it outside of Black Panther
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:05.120]  movies, they do it outside of events, they do it anytime they can, you've got cities
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.360]  like Chicago where they're trying to get basically illegals, noncitizens to vote, they're giving
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.120]  them the right to vote, you've got states like California where you know that's going
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:20.720]  on and then they use their dirty tactics of just finding out who's still on the voter
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.800]  roll that shouldn't be there, like dead people or what have you and it's funny because I
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:32.960]  was thinking about this and you've got elections coming up here and actually I'm actually registered
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.680]  to vote in St. Louis, Missouri, that's how I voted for Trump, I did a, I forget what
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.360]  it's called, an absentee ballot but I still need to register to vote here in Texas, I
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:46.080]  need to take care of that, I'll probably take care of that this week but I was thinking,
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:55.680]  I was like, you know, so, it's like I don't, how do you explain this, do you do what James
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.960]  O'Keefe of Project Veritas has done and other people have done and do you expose what the
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.680]  Democrats are doing to get votes, like should I, do I intentionally try to vote multiple
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.560]  times like I'm a Democrat, like do I intentionally try to rig the system and cheat like the Democrats
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:19.640]  do, just to prove you can do it, just to prove how Democrats have basically zero security
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.800]  for elections anymore, so they want to complain, oh my gosh, Russian meddling in the election,
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.560]  they're looking around every corner, looking around under the desk, what, Russian meddling
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:37.080]  everywhere, oh, but then they don't even want voter ID at the booth.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.280]  Now how do you explain that?
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:47.080]  How do you explain the Democrat party crying, spending millions of dollars weeping every
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:52.880]  day, preaching every day, Russian collusion, Russian collusion, Russian collusion, Russian
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.280]  meddling in the election, Russian influence in the election, the elections, they're screaming
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:03.520]  at the top, the elections null and void, the elections null and void, it was Russia, Russia
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.560]  tampered with the elections, Trump is not the president, it was Russia, and then the
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:15.040]  same Democratic party says you don't need a voter ID, what's that, oh you just, you
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.960]  just came across the border from Mexico, you want to vote, come on down baby, Democrat
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.720]  baby, we got you.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.120]  How do you explain that?
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:35.000]  Well, it's pretty simple actually, surprisingly it's actually very simple.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.920]  Democrats thrive off the illegal vote.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.400]  Why do you think people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters take more
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:52.760]  time and energy to acquire a vote from a non-citizen, why do you think they campaign and take up
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:41:00.480]  the pulpit on issues that don't actually affect Americans but non-citizens?
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.320]  Well think about it, what does a political candidate do as soon as they get into office,
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:14.440]  they are running for reelection, that is the Democrat platform, non-citizens, open borders,
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:22.320]  anyone can vote, however, if the results of the election determined by the American people
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.800]  go against the Democrats, then it must have been Russian meddling.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.040]  Why don't we just, you know what though, why doesn't Russia, see if Russia really wanted
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:36.480]  to meddle in the elections, all they would have to do is just send a tanker of people
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:43.560]  over, just send mass loads of planes and boats, just send over all these Russians and just
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:49.000]  have them go vote in California, I mean that's all they would have to do, they don't need
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.680]  to speak English, just send them on in, tell them they'll vote Democrat, oh yeah the Democrats
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.360]  will sign you up real quick, they'll either find a way to get you a vote, get you an ID,
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.680]  get you a driver's license or they'll find some dead schlep and then you can just vote
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:12.400]  in place of them, I mean it's insane, this is the Trump derangement syndrome, it's that
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:19.840]  real, but you do have President Trump calling out the Obama administration today saying
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:27.640]  their crimes, the illegal spying, bigger than Watergate and it is bigger than Watergate
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:34.680]  and everybody knows it's bigger than Watergate and that's why Trump's base is growing impatient
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:42.240]  because we are approaching a year and a half into Trump's first term, Hillary still walks
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:49.960]  free, Obama gets to walk free and just desecrate all over the portrait museum with that trash
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:55.120]  that he sends out there, let's get these people in front of a House committee and give a testimony
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:25.080]  to Trump, please that's what we want.

[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:01.520]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWarsLife.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.080]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.840]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.840]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.160]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.640]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.120]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.560]  reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.720]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:33.640]  these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:38.680]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.520]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.040]  species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:51.320]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.800]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:08.640]  if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours, just on the files
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.960]  I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.120]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:24.320]  But immune wall is incredible and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:25.880]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:32.000]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more, it is concentrated, you need
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.600]  to go read what is in here.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.560]  accelerate a citrus peel blend, I mean, this is the next level.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.280]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think is beyond seasonal, beta-glucan,
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.160]  olive leaf, and more.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:47:02.240]  Immune wall, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com or triple-8-253-3139.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:15.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:21.320]  So there's still a lot of news that I need to get to today, and we will get to it.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:27.520]  But before I get to that, I want to play these videos that we have on the Alex Jones channel.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:33.600]  They always go viral, and this is the type of content they want stopped from getting
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:41.280]  out there into the public hemisphere, into the public domain where the street minions
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:49.920]  of the left are the most vile, disgusting, hateful, ignorant people that you can meet.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:58.400]  The average individual that isn't politically active or informed or what have you is just
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:04.800]  neutral, sees that video and immediately wants to be removed from whatever that is.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:10.200]  They see that hate, they see that disgust, and they just want to separate themselves
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.200]  from that.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:16.040]  So maybe they become a conservative, or maybe they watch InfoWars now, or maybe they like
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040]  Trump, whatever it is.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.280]  That's always the instinctual reaction, is when you see something so disgusting as the
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:27.200]  average Trump protester, you just want to get away from that, as far away from that
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.200]  as possible.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.760]  So that's why they want videos like this censored.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:38.920]  So Trump comes to Austin, Texas to deal with Hurricane Harvey because the Emergency Management
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.880]  Center is here in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:46.920]  So we go out to cover that, and sure enough, Trump protesters show up, and they want Trump
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.840]  in peace, but they can't tell us why.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:58.820]  Here is that video.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.760]  This is not the right video.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.720]  This is the ultimate highlights video.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.640]  I am looking for the epic fail video.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:07.040]  Let's play that video.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.040]  people want to impeach the president. Let's see if they can figure out why.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.040]  Here in this part.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.040]  Well, go ahead.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:19.040]  Why is Infowars filming this part of the collection of people?
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.040]  Why wouldn't we?
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.040]  Why would you?
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.040]  Do these people, do these people, well because it makes no sense, don't these people want attention,
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  don't they want their message out?
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.040]  I think that everybody's working on getting their message out and we can do it pretty good without Infowars.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.040]  Here's a platform with millions of people, why not have our platform?
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.040]  Because your platform is fake news.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.040]  What did we report that's fake?
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.040]  Just about 90% of what...
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.040]  So just name one or two things, it should be easy.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:48.040]  I'm really not interested in...
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.040]  So nothing, so you've proved...
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.040]  So see, but here's the problem, ma'am.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.040]  No, no, you're not. You're young and beautiful.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.040]  No, you're young and beautiful. Listen, though.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.040]  We don't report fake news.
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:00.040]  Yes, about why you would even dare be here.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:04.040]  Because I want to hear from people like you to figure out what you're doing.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.040]  I mean, come on.
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.040]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.040]  Here we go. Give them their platform.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.040]  This is such a glorious moment for me.
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.040]  I got a chair going.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.040]  What about Gay Frogs?
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.040]  Hey, who behind their sign mentioned Gay Frogs?
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:23.040]  That's actually a real issue. That's the funny thing about it.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.040]  Is Infowars fake news?
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.040]  What is Infowars' report that's fake?
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.040]  I got nothing to say.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040]  He's got nothing?
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.040]  Are you like Infowars, sir?
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.040]  We're really don't like Infowars.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.040]  And I'm ashamed that Alex Jones is from Austin.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.040]  Why? He's from Dallas, actually.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.040]  He's based in Austin, right? You guys are...
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.040]  Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.040]  You're disgusting.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.040]  We bring a lot of money to the commerce here.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:49.040]  You should like that. We pay taxes.
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:52.040]  Based on conspiracy theories and fear-mongering and hatred.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.040]  It's pretty f***ing disgusting.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.040]  So, what do we do that's hate-mongering?
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.040]  You're a smarmy little prick.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.040]  What did I say that's...
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:00.040]  What are you talking about? I'm just gonna hate you.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:03.040]  How the f*** do you come out of my city, you prick?
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.040]  You gotta spread love, y'all.
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.040]  Is this spreading love, do you think?
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:08.040]  Are you spreading love?
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.040]  I'm just asking questions.
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.040]  Excuse me.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.040]  I showed up here and you're the one that started hating me.
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.040]  So, that's not...
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:19.040]  Actually, I was trying to talk to her and you stepped in front of me.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.040]  What am I?
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.040]  What am I?
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.040]  F*** off, aren't you?
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.040]  Dude, I'm literally standing here as...
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.040]  I've never been in a fraternity.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.040]  I'm cowardly.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.040]  Hold on, I'm cowardly for stepping into a crowd of people that hate me.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:35.040]  You're being provocative.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:36.040]  I'm being provocative.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040]  Okay, I'm being provocative.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.040]  Just by being here.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.040]  Just by being here, I'm provocative.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]  I'm not welcome here.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.040]  You guys are so tolerant.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:44.040]  Look at this guy.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.040]  None of them...
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.040]  Hey, look.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.040]  I asked one of you to have an educated conversation with me.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.040]  Just one.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.040]  Just one.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040]  Because you're too stupid.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.040]  Climate change is real, says this guy.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.040]  Because you're not smart enough.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.040]  Yeah, it's called climate.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.040]  I have every right to be here, folks.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:02.040]  This is the attack on free speech.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.040]  They're all allowed to have their message.
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.040]  I'm not allowed to have mine.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.040]  We'll never be divided.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:10.040]  Hey, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached?
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:12.040]  We'll never be divided.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.040]  The people.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.040]  I'm gonna ask everyone here why Trump should be impeached.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.040]  One by one.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:17.040]  The people.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  I've already asked these two.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.040]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.040]  The people.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.040]  United.
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.040]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.040]  Hey, why should Trump be impeached?
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.040]  See, this is what they do.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.040]  I told you.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.040]  I don't make this up.
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.040]  They come up and they rub against you.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.040]  It's some weird fetish of theirs.
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.040]  Why?
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:32.040]  United.
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.040]  They weren't hugged enough as children or something.
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:37.040]  Do you believe Trump should be impeached?
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.040]  Look at this one.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.040]  This one was out.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.040]  This one was out Saturday.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.040]  She's...
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.040]  This one, pause it right here.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.040]  This lunatic that's about to be featured here,
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.040]  making fart noises with her mouth.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.040]  Was that from like Anchorman or something when he's drunk?
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:54.040]  This lunatic was back on the streets on Saturday,
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.040]  still making fart noises with her mouth,
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.040]  but now dressed as a clown.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.040]  You can find that video on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.040]  Let's go back to this crazy.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:07.040]  Do you make fart noises with your mouth?
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.040]  I'd say yes.
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.040]  That's the first answer we've gotten out here.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  What?
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]  Do you believe Trump should be impeached?
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.040]  Look at this.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.040]  What's this lunatic?
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.040]  Because of a lot of things that he's done.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.040]  Like name a couple.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.040]  He has not united the country.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:22.040]  Well, how has he not united the country?
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.040]  You're the ones that are out here dividing it.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.040]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.040]  Give me the legal reasons.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.040]  Would you like a whistle?
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.040]  Well, yeah, let me have a whistle.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  Yeah, it's a lot easier to make fart noises with your mouth
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.040]  than answer questions, isn't it?
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.040]  It's a lot more fun, too.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:39.040]  Because you have a flag that you have something to say.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.040]  No, man, I'm just here asking people...
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.040]  I'm asking people why they want Trump impeached
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.040]  and nobody can answer the question.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.040]  I mean, fart whistles that this woman has.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.040]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.040]  It's been fake news for 15 years.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.040]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:53.040]  Hey, we found...
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.040]  Everything we report on comes true.
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.040]  Because he's lied a thousand times on record.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.040]  What does he lie about?
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.040]  Should we look it up on his phone?
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.040]  No, he's recording right now.
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.040]  But you're the one saying impeach the president.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:08.040]  Yeah, yeah, because you're the one who wants to impeach him.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.040]  I mean, I can impeach him myself.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.040]  But you're out here with the impeached Trump crowd.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:20.040]  Yeah, I would love to advance an impeachment agenda.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.040]  Why?
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.040]  Because we've got a liar.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:25.040]  I know, so it keeps coming back.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.040]  So what did he lie about?
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  Let's look this up.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  But you're out here protesting.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.040]  You shouldn't have to look it up.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.040]  You know, you should already know your cause, don't you think?
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.040]  You're probably, you know, right in some way.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.040]  I mean, if you have to look it up,
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.040]  it must not be that important to you, you know?
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.040]  This sounds like a leading question.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.040]  I'll tell you what, I'll let you do some research and we'll come back.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:46.040]  How about that?
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  Thank you.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.040]  No problem.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:49.040]  Hey, thank you for talking.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.040]  Thank you.
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.040]  Yeah, I'm married.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.040]  Well, I salute you.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:55.040]  It must take some courage to come out here with all these crazy protesters.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.040]  Hey, then watch out.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.040]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:03.040]  Hey, tell these people about the hate they're showing.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.040]  I'm just saying, like, anyway.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.040]  Yeah, I can't even interview this young man without them interrupting me.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.040]  I'm just, I'm just curious.
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.040]  What's it like to be a Trump supporter out here with all the Trump haters?
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.040]  Are they, you know, are they knowing?
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.040]  It's annoying.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.040]  Are they, are they telling you to leave like they're telling me to?
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.040]  No.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.040]  They're not telling you to leave?
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:22.040]  No.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.040]  Okay.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.040]  It's so good.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.040]  Actually, I'm having a pleasant conversation with this young man right now.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.040]  And I, cool.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.040]  Did you hear that?
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.040]  Yeah, well, they do.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.040]  Hey, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached, ma'am?
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.040]  Still away.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.040]  Still over.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:38.040]  Ma'am, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached?
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.040]  Please go sell your supplements somewhere else.

[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.040]  And now here's another little highlight video of just a compilation of all the other events
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:57.040]  we go to with these crazies.
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  A few minutes.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.040]  A few minutes.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:03.040]  This is one of, this is one of the most glorious moments of my career right here.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:10.040]  Please go sell your supplements.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:11.040]  Not just to be sad.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.040]  Not just to be sad.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.040]  But to ground ourselves in our resistance.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.040]  But to ground ourselves in our resistance.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.040]  What does that even mean?
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.040]  Look around you.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.040]  Look around you.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.040]  Look around you.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:19.040]  We are the people.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.040]  I'm the Keebler Elf out here leading this Trump protest.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.040]  The Keebler Elf.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:28.040]  Make America great again!
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.040]  Woo!
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.040]  Yeah, this kind of feels faster to me.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.040]  They're out here protesting fashions.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.040]  But it's not even beyond that.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.040]  I mean, these are all semantics.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:38.040]  I'm just talking about the feeling that I have in my bones.
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.040]  I'm just talking about my instinct and my spirit.
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:42.040]  That's just what it feels like.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:47.040]  I mean, I feel like I'm being lectured up here by these radicals who really just don't like
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.040]  the results of the election.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.040]  So they're trying to do anything.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.040]  Yeah, F me.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.040]  Here we go.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.040]  What up?
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.040]  Go fuck yourself.
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.040]  Hey, why?
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:56.040]  Why?
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:57.040]  What's wrong with me?
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.040]  Because the salt is not for a talk, mother.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.040]  I didn't.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:01.040]  Who did I assault?
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.040]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:03.040]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:04.040]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.040]  Did you catch that?
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:06.040]  I just got assaulted.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.040]  And she slaps me in the face.
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:11.040]  Right after she says, assault is not boy talk.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.040]  She then slaps me in the face.
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.040]  Go fuck yourself, Alex Jones.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:15.040]  So there you go.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.040]  I just literally got hit in the face.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.040]  You know what?
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.040]  All right, you can pull it down.
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.040]  You guys are fashions.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:24.440]  So that's what, you know, you have to go through these videos and you have to edit like every
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.680]  time these people talk.
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:31.680]  They can't even talk without saying, F you, F that, F this, ugh.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:34.680]  It's like, you know, read a book or something, man.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:38.840]  You can figure out another way to insult me without just the F word, can't you?
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.840]  But those are the videos.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.840]  They want banned, folks.

[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:28.820]  Well Alex Jones was kicking it with Ted Nugent over the weekend and we had a full film crew
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:35.120]  there and they shot some unbelievable footage, some great clips with Ted Nugent as well.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.560]  I mean this guy, this guy is just 1776 to the core.
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:46.280]  But the thing about it that's so great to me is that the things that Nugent says, it
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:48.120]  just resonates with the average person.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.600]  I mean this is what the average person is thinking.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:56.800]  It makes sense to the average person and he says it in such a clairvoyant fashion that
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:01.440]  the average individual just hears it and just says wow that makes sense to me.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.280]  Wow that's cool, that guy is making sense.
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:11.240]  So we've got some clips, the full Ted Nugent interview slash special, whatever you want
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:12.240]  to call it again.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.160]  They're shooting guns, they're talking about 1776, they're talking about Trump, they're
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:19.600]  talking about history, he's playing the guitar.
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.840]  So just really cool stuff that's going to come from that video.
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:27.240]  But we've got some clips we're going to roll here today before we release the full Ted
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:31.440]  Nugent exclusive special here with Alex Jones.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:37.080]  But here is Ted Nugent talking about what it means to be an American and the tradition
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:38.080]  of Americana.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:41.480]  I just wanted to play Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley music.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.040]  I just wanted to practice my guitar and out do the ventures and Lonnie Mack and Dwayne
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040]  Eddy.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:51.600]  So I had bands in Detroit in the shadow of Motown and when I was born in Detroit everybody
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:58.440]  knows Detroit was the global epicenter of work ethic and productivity.
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:04.520]  Neighborliness, goodwill, a work ethic that was unprecedented maybe in the history of
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:12.280]  our species except for maybe Glor in the year six when he finally got made fire.
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:17.960]  So I was in such a positive environment where America had proven to the globe that if you
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:24.680]  have freedom you are more dedicated to good over evil and that's how we defeated the
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:26.360]  Japs and the Nazis.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:30.600]  And the whole world looked to America and went boy there's some bad motherf***er man.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.760]  They climbed that Iwo Jima and they went to Boot Hill and they kicked ass on the maniac
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.560]  bonsais and the brainwashed Nazis.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:46.360]  So the whole world looked to America and identified that what we're doing is an experiment in
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:50.720]  self-government with the Constitution of Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence might
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:55.040]  be something they might want to look into.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.200]  So my positive spirit was untouchable, I just wanted to play this new uppity soundtrack
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.440]  that the Emancipation Proclamation gave to Chuck Berry and Bo did to the Little Richard
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:08.920]  to go ahead and express their musical dreams in defiance of all cultural controls of the
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:09.920]  time.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.000]  I mean Little Richard are you kidding me, what, the punks got nothing on Little Richard,
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.040]  I mean there's a black gay guy saying about whacking your daughter, duty fruity, I mean
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:27.960]  what, you cannot pump Little Richard, so I'm talking about inspiring in defiance of acceptable
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:33.960]  status quo music, my dad was a big Lawrence Walk fan, God bless him.
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:40.840]  So as I'm making my music and expressing myself in absolutism, never was I inhibited by any
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.440]  stretch of the imagination.
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.280]  And I started doing these interviews on radio stations where they started having rock and
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:50.320]  roll radio and they'd always ask me where I get all this energy, a lot of people thought
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.640]  I was on some kind of drugs because of the energy that I was influenced by Little Richard
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:57.360]  and James Brown and my black heroes.
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:01.120]  And I went, no, I just had a great weekend with my dad up north, we were deer hunting
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:07.680]  and they're a hippie discharge, you go, you like killed deer man, they go, no, we eat
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:16.880]  them alive, I got a question as that and I hit this brick wall of insanity that I found
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:22.880]  someone who found fault with this perfect weekend with my family hunting deer and now
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:29.680]  he's not just questioning it, he's angry, they're condemning me for murdering in the
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:35.760]  sand, I'm going, are you kidding me, what are you talking about?
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.960]  So that's the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent, again, Alex Jones went up to hang out with
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:44.920]  him over the weekend, they got a ton of cool footage, shooting guns, talking history.
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:47.800]  That full exclusive content is going to be on the Alex Jones channel soon.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:51.960]  We're going to have more clips later on in the show, but our next guest, Sabo, also
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:57.240]  embellishes and shows you the spirit of rebellion and defiance.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:03.560]  I'm so excited, the new product at MFullWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:08.360]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:13.840]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:16.840]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:23.120]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:29.280]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.280]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO,
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:40.080]  made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:45.560]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:50.040]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:06:18.040]  Red pill, now available at MFullWarsStore.com and your purchase of Fuzzy Operation.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:26.560]  My next guest, Sabo, is a street artist, a provocateur, a right-wing rebel, the badass
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:34.840]  behind unsavoryagents.com, and just like Ted Nugent, he embodies that defiant spirit
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:40.880]  of rebellion and that punk rock nature of pushing back against the establishment, and
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:46.200]  Sabo does it with his street art, you've probably seen it before, you know, it makes
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:51.720]  its way on the internet of things, it makes its way on Twitter and everywhere, you can
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:59.160]  find it, there's one of their most recent art work right there, and the Oscar for biggest
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:03.520]  pedophile goes to, of course, that triggered them all.
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:08.520]  So Sabo, thank you for coming on with us today, thank you for this interview.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:12.960]  Thank you for having me man, I've finally arrived, I'm on Infowars.
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:19.800]  Well, you know, it is the tip of the spear, no doubt, but it really is just a confluence
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:25.800]  of patriots that use this platform to share ideas and to try to start brush fires of liberty,
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:29.560]  and that's what you're doing, that's what you do with your street art, and you know,
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:34.920]  we're gonna have the crew rolling some of the stuff that you've put out, but what got
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.200]  you started into this?
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:41.160]  What was the process that made you think, okay, I can influence people, I can kind of
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:47.600]  be defiant, and I can use my creativity by just putting out artwork that challenges the
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:54.560]  thought of liberalism, that challenges the established view or belief of Hollywood.
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.120]  How did you get started?
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:01.120]  Well, what pushed me over the edge was getting old and not caring anymore.
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:05.960]  I had acquired creative skills, technical skills, and I got tired of working for other
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:11.040]  people and I just said, you know what, I wanna apply my skills to something that I love.
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:17.680]  And I love politics, so, and I've been doing this for quite some time, I believe that was
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:20.800]  around 2000.
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:26.440]  So where were you before, and are you saying that where you were expressing yourself before
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:29.720]  with your art, you know, it wasn't really welcome to conservatives, and that's why you
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:33.120]  kind of had to go rogue, if you will?
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:37.000]  You know, at the time we were just like the redheaded stepchildren, just getting beat
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.280]  all the time, it wasn't even a thought, but it became a thought to me because I would
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:49.520]  look around, listen to the radio, watch television, and I remember one night I was in Los Feliz,
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.440]  and I was looking for a Larry Elder book, and it was tucked away in the back of the
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.760]  store to where you couldn't find it, and all the liberal books were in the front.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:03.800]  And I was like, why are all our creative writers and all these people treated in such a way?
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.600]  And by the way, where are all the political artists out there?
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:11.040]  And I didn't really see any, and at that point I just said, you know what, this is what
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.040]  I'm going to do.
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:16.480]  Well, you know, it's amazing too, you bring up that, you were looking for that conservative
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.680]  book at, say, you know, local Barnes & Noble, or your local bookstore, that's actually something
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:28.200]  that these bookstores are doing, and if you know how it works, basically you can pay extra
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.920]  money to have your books laid out in the front of the store, or to have like a centerfold
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.440]  section there.
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:41.120]  And conservative authors will actually pay that fee, Michael Savage is a good example,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:47.400]  he pays the fee to get his book God, Faith and Reason on a centerpiece in the front of
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:52.560]  the store, and then they bury it, like you said, they bury it in the back, and they put
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:56.240]  it in a, I think religion and culture section or whatever, he wanted it in politics, he
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:57.520]  paid for it to be in the front.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:01.840]  So that's another thing they do, I mean, but isn't that amazing, I mean, how is that
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.120]  even legal, but that's what I'm saying, they don't care, they don't care, so that's kind
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.440]  of what you're feeling, it's like, okay, they don't care, they're going to shove us
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:11.400]  to the side, why should I care?
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.320]  You know what, they're not going to care, it's like God forbid, they have to like look
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.520]  on their computer to see if they even have it, they'll just flat out lie to you.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:25.280]  And you know, if anything that just means to me, we just have to be that much more vigilant.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.720]  So what do you think has been the artwork that you've made that's gotten the most buzz,
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:35.120]  is there anything that you've designed that's been by far the most popular, by far gotten
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.120]  the most attention?
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.960]  Yeah, I would say, you know, the Ted Cruz wasn't bad, and that had everything to do with
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:49.960]  the election cycle, I mean, it lasted as long as it did, and I was shocked that Cruz even
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.720]  ran with it.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.680]  There was actually a time when I was like, okay, dude, enough, but you know, he was gracious
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:02.520]  enough, he kept pushing it, but I mean, the past couple of months have been good with
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.160]  the whole Al Franken billboard and this last billboard in the Meryl Streep hit that we
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:13.320]  did recently, so it's just been going good in terms of traction.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:18.200]  Now you're essentially going up against the beast, I mean, a lot of the stuff that you
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:25.120]  do does feature, you know, Hollywood, there's some of the work right there with Meryl Streep,
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:28.880]  you know, she knew about Harvey Weinstein, they all knew about Harvey Weinstein, and
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:32.120]  you designed those things, and there's another one with Al Franken, I mean, this is some
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:36.880]  of the work that you're doing, but I mean, I would imagine, I mean, there's got to be
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:42.120]  some pushback on you, I mean, there has to be, do people threaten you, are they trying
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.120]  to stop you?
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:46.120]  I mean, what do you deal with just to get your work out there?
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:51.960]  Man, you know, I don't even really want to think that much about it because I kind of
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:55.920]  have the feeling that they're doing the opposition research on me right now, and they're going
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:01.400]  to find every goat I've ever screwed, or I don't know if I could cuss on this channel.
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.400]  No, you cannot.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:08.560]  Okay, then I won't, but I mean, they're going to like dig into my past, I'm sure.
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:13.000]  When I left yesterday morning, I saw someone standing across the street looking over at
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.200]  my place, and he just seemed weird.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:23.480]  And so I don't really, I like the fight, I don't mind, I like being on the field fighting.
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:29.600]  I get nervous when it gets quiet, and right now it's a little quiet, but it wouldn't surprise
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:30.600]  me.
[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:32.720]  Anything that's super illegal is gone.
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.320]  I've taken out of the apartment, it's gone wherever, and so they're more than welcome
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:40.560]  to raid the apartment at two o'clock in the morning whenever they like.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:47.280]  Well, I would think, again, just knowing how these Hollywood liberals work, I would think
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.720]  they see some of your street art out there, and then they see it making its way on social
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:52.720]  media.
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:54.840]  I would think they're doing everything to try to shut you down.
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.680]  I mean, that's how these people operate.
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:02.040]  They send out the dogs to try to stop people from calling them out, calling their truth
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:04.960]  out.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.040]  So I would imagine, I mean, obviously you deal with the politics, but you're probably,
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:12.600]  I mean, honestly, on a Maxine Waters radar, I don't really know if she cares that much.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:18.600]  She's dealing with her own stuff, but I would imagine that Hollywood is really the group
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:20.360]  of people that hate you.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.040]  Have you heard from anyone in Hollywood, maybe a conservative, that happens to hear about
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:25.040]  stuff in Hollywood?
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.040]  Do you know it?
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:30.160]  I mean, are you angering the Hollywood liberals as much as you'd like to be?
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:31.960]  You know, from what I understand, I am.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:35.280]  I love it when someone says, oh, I was at the studio the other day, and I mentioned your
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.160]  name and a top exec just rolled their eyes.
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:42.600]  I'm like, oh my God, a top exec knew who I was or who I am.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:50.480]  And so I find it flattering, but hell, I was supposed to go to the Oscars, but the individual
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:54.680]  that was supposed to take me, she kind of disappeared.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:58.560]  And I made a few phone calls and they're like, you know, man, her agent said, if she takes
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.320]  you, she'll never work again.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.640]  And not only that, she fell off a ladder.
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:06.760]  So I gave her a call and she says, I broke both my knees falling off of a ladder.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:08.920]  So that went my ticket to the Oscars.
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:14.040]  So I don't know what, what all that was about, but I hope her knees get better.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:17.160]  Boy, that is certainly a strange story there.
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.160]  I'm not surprised though.
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.840]  I believe, boy, if you would have been sitting at the Oscars, you can only imagine the type
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:24.400]  of looks you would have been getting there.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.400]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.440]  I was going for plan B. I was hoping Milo had the juice to get tickets.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.640]  And I was like, I'd be more than happy to take Milo.
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:36.680]  I'm sure he'd have a fabulous dress.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:40.560]  I'd have to wear a top hat because he's a full foot taller than I am.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.320]  So it would have been, it would have been great.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:46.680]  Well, and now Milo actually, he just had to cancel his last event because of a credible
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:47.680]  death threat.
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:48.680]  I think we had the story at infowars.com.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:51.080]  So, I mean, they're getting crazier.
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.280]  I mean, that, that is the truth.
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.760]  They are getting crazier, but you know, these are the people that say that they appreciate
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:58.400]  art and they appreciate culture.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:02.040]  So I think that there, there's a, there's a little, there's a little silver lining to
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:06.800]  what you do because you actually are an artist and it is creative stuff that you're doing.
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:09.720]  They, I think that they actually enjoy it a little bit.
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:13.280]  I think they actually enjoy it a little bit and they just cannot admit it.
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:14.280]  Yeah.
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:17.920]  You know, I get some compliments every now and then that like, you know, I'm a liberal.
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.160]  I don't exactly believe in what you're doing, but I like that's how you're doing it.
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:26.800]  There's something about it going on the street that kind of turns people on.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.880]  I mean, if I were to just do it and put it online, it wouldn't get nearly the traction.
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:31.880]  Yeah.
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:34.080]  The fact that you actually put it out on the street is great too.
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:38.160]  And that's how it gets even more eyes because, you know, not everybody is on social media.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:42.240]  In fact, more people are driving on the street past, you know, one of your billboards or
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:46.440]  one of the, you know, benches that, that you put your art on, probably then would see it
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:47.440]  on social media.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.560]  And that, that was kind of the rebellious rogue thing that, that you really did.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.560]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.000]  We got another segment with Sabo.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.520]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banion Hill.
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:15:59.520]  You like freedom?
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:00.520]  I do.
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:01.520]  You like money?
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:02.520]  I do too.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:06.320]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love freedom checks.
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:12.080]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:13.320]  stakes their claim.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:14.320]  Yep.
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.320]  You heard that right.
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.320]  $34.6 billion.

[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:26.560]  Take Doug, for example.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:32.120]  He's a 46 year old from Joplin, Missouri, who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:35.000]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.560]  But here's the thing.
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:41.960]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must

[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:34.360]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.120]  medical expenses.

[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:49.480]  Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.

[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:56.760]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com.
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.000]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  personally.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.880]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:12.640]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.680]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:23.040]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:30.560]  the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:34.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.800]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:44.720]  gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there.
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:45.720]  And it's amazing.
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:50.160]  Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what it could do for your family.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:52.520]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:56.800]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:00.120]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:04.320]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:08.000]  symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways.
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.640]  Eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:12.640]  This is pollen blood.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:18.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:24.160]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes,
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:25.720]  and excessive mucus production.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:30.480]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:36.640]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:41.440]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:44.960]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:35.080]  Well, little Brian Stelter and Donnie Boylemon, the Lemonhead, and the rest of the host over
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:39.840]  there at the Communist News Network want us shut down.
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:49.160]  You see, CNN is collapsing right now, and Infowars is blasting skyward, and it's killing
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:50.160]  CNN.
[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:55.320]  There's Don Lemon when he just saw the last rating cycle.
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:01.720]  So we are launching, well, we're continuing a special at Infowarsstore.com, but now into
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:08.320]  the second week of this special, defeat CNN's attempt to crush Infowars.

[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.960]  Defeat CNN's attempt to crush Infowars.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:02.960]  This is how we do it.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:03.960]  We're independent.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:04.960]  We're funded by you.
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:06.400]  No one controls what we say.
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:09.440]  No one tells us what we can or cannot report.
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:13.440]  And that's because we remain independent with your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:20.400]  My guest is Sabo, the street artist who is famous for depicting Hollywood in a more realistic
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:23.960]  light with his art as well as politics.
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:30.240]  I want to go to this real quick clip and then get Sabo's take on how this one individual,
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:33.840]  Jimmy Kimmel, ends up being the mouthpiece for the Democrat Party now.
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:38.040]  And the time's up, you know, me too movement as far as the men are concerned.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:39.040]  He's the voice.
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:44.520]  But here's just a quick clip of Jimmy Kimmel last night at the Oscars.
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:48.720]  Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood.
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.560]  And there's a very good reason why.
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:58.720]  Just look at him, keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word.
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:03.080]  And most importantly, no penis at all.
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:05.920]  He is literally a statue of limitations.
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:07.960]  Now, see, this is this is funny.
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:08.960]  The kind of men.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.400]  This is so this is this is funny, though, because think about this.
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:12.400]  What's happening all over.
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:13.800]  And talking about Harvey.
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:17.000]  So but think about the reality of the situation, Sabo.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.680]  So the actual, I mean, he was called a God.
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:26.440]  Harvey Weinstein, praised by Hollywood, praised by the Obamas, worked for to help
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:27.440]  get Clinton elected.
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.800]  Harvey Weinstein.
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:32.680]  He was the idol in Hollywood.
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:35.600]  He was the most admired man in Hollywood.
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:36.920]  He was the pervert.
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:38.720]  He was the man accused of rape.
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:41.520]  He was the man where the me too movement started.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:45.960]  And then Jimmy Kimmel makes some joke about how the most admired man in Oscar in the in
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:49.560]  Hollywood is the Oscar because he doesn't have a penis and doesn't grope you.
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:54.280]  When the most the real most admired man in Hollywood was Harvey Weinstein, who did all
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:55.280]  of that?
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:24:00.920]  I mean, how does how does Jimmy Kimmel become the mouthpiece of the the good liberal, the
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:07.040]  man that used to host the man show that featured women bouncing on chapeleons for entertainment?
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:11.560]  Well, it's like he said himself, he doesn't have a penis.
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:16.680]  You know, he's one of these neutered males that Hollywood just loves like Jimmy Fallon
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:18.760]  and the whole the whole bunch of them.
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:21.320]  They're squeaky clean to some degree.
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:26.440]  How we get how he gets away with the whole trampoline bed and I have no idea.
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:31.800]  But he was walking around asking young girls to touch his to touch his crotch for a for
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:32.800]  a skit.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:37.920]  Well, hey, man, Kobe Bryant got an award last night and I think he was accused of rape.
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:42.360]  Now to be fair, Kobe Bryant was accused of rape and he went through the legal system
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:43.360]  and beat the charges.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:46.800]  I don't I think that that was that was fair.
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.600]  So so but but you know, that's a whole nother element of this issue there.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.480]  Now you're watching the man show, you know, that's a whole nother element of this talking
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:58.200]  about due process where you can just accuse someone of touching you wrong and then all
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:02.480]  of a sudden they're they're a rapist, which, you know, is something that is going on right
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:03.480]  now, too.
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.880]  But I just don't understand this.
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:09.000]  It's like they want Hollywood, which wants you to forget.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  That's what it is.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.920]  That's why your art is so important because Hollywood just wants you to forget about their
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:13.920]  past.
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:14.920]  They do.
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:17.360]  And you know, I don't know how Bill Maher even has a job.
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.440]  I think that guy, it's my opinion, that guy's probably one of the most disgusting people
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:22.960]  in Hollywood.
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.880]  And I haven't seen any flak bill his way.
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:29.880]  I mean, you could have done a laundry list of people that have gotten away with murder.
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:34.800]  The only reason Weinstein's getting the heat that he's getting is he got caught.
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:36.480]  I don't know what it is.
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.240]  Well, you know, that's actually interesting because you think about it.
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.800]  Here's Hollywood lecturing us times up me, too.
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:47.400]  You were the problem.
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.920]  Why are you lecturing us?
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:50.800]  You need to be looking in the mirror.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:52.280]  Hollywood needs to be lecturing Hollywood.
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:58.480]  You know, 20 years ago, they could have pulled that Saul Alinsky stuff, like accused, you
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:03.040]  know, hold people to the fire with their morals and values.
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.440]  But when you yourself have no morals and values of virtues, who are you to point the finger?
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:13.320]  So I like, I like that America is starting to wake up and realize Hollywood's not the
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:16.920]  arbiter of these things and they can, they can go away.
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:17.920]  Yeah.
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:21.720]  And I guess that's why you're, you're seeing the people going to the cinema, people going
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:23.400]  to the movies way down.
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:28.720]  You're not seeing these big box office hits like you used to where, I mean, Jennifer Lawrence
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.440]  can barely even sell a movie anymore.
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:32.080]  She used to be Uber popular.
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:36.320]  I mean, remember Jennifer Lawrence was the star of the Hunger Games.
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.120]  I mean, that was a huge series.
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.680]  She was a huge hit.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.960]  Then she goes out and espouses her radical political views.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:45.400]  No one wants to see her movies anymore.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:49.280]  Does Hollywood even understand that they're, they're, they're hurting themselves?
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:50.280]  They don't.
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:52.360]  From what I understand, she was like filming some movie in Russia.
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:54.680]  It was probably the last movie she came out with.
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:57.840]  And some guy sheepishly walked up to her and said, Hey, can you get an autograph?
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.920]  Can I get an autograph for my girlfriend?
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:01.440]  And she punched them.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:03.600]  And she was all drunk and she assaulted them.
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:07.600]  I'm like, you know, sweetheart, you have a big house in the hill, a fat bank account
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:08.600]  and fame.
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:11.880]  It's like, for God's sake, just sign the man's paper.
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:15.320]  And it was at that point, I said, this woman just doesn't get it.
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:17.880]  Oh, well, that's, that's the understatement of the century.
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:25.040]  This is the same woman who lectures us about global warming and then films a movie in Russia.
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:29.160]  And you know that they had to fly jets out there, you know, they had to fly very expensive
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:30.160]  jets.
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:34.440]  They had to burn a lot of fuel, a lot of carbon emissions coming from filming those fancy movies.
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:35.960]  Jennifer Lawrence, you don't seem to compare about that.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.080]  You got to complain about that.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:42.240]  And then, oh, I don't know how we're going to survive Sabo, but Jennifer Lawrence is
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.720]  going to take a break from acting to, uh, to try to fix the American politics.
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:47.720]  Yeah.
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:48.720]  You know what that is?
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:51.720]  That's Jennifer Lawrence realizing that she's, she's failing now as an actress.
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:55.520]  So she's trying to get publicity around her failing acting career.
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:57.040]  She's doing us a favor, man.
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:58.040]  Keep resisting.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:00.000]  Keep, keep it up.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.560]  You're only showing your butts even more.
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:06.600]  And I love that they're doing it so early because we have another, what, seven years,
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:08.840]  six and a half years for this to go.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.520]  So 2020 is going to be a circus and I can't wait.
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:12.520]  Oh my gosh.
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:13.520]  Oh my gosh.
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:16.800]  Can you imagine, you look at Trump derangement syndrome where it is now.
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:17.800]  Oh my God.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:22.280]  Can you imagine in six years, we'd be lucky to have a platform.
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.040]  I'm off of a live streaming on YouTube till late eight.
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:28.600]  Oh, you've been banned on YouTube too.
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:31.360]  I've been banned on YouTube and, uh, a face.
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:32.360]  They took away my Facebook.
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:34.120]  What's your, what's your YouTube channel?
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:36.120]  Plug your YouTube channel.
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:43.520]  My YouTube channel is a unsavoryagents.com forward slash unsavoryagents or it's youtube.com
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.520]  forward slash unsavoryagents.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:45.520]  All right.
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.520]  So, so, so, all right.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:50.640]  So there's Sabo, a famous street artist, the right wing rebel who uses his art and creativity
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:53.520]  to put a mirror to Hollywood and Democrat politics.
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:55.400]  Thank you for your time, Sabo.
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:58.560]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banion Hill.
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.560]  You like freedom?
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:00.560]  I do.
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.560]  You like money?
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:02.560]  I do too.
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:06.360]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love freedom checks.
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:12.120]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:13.360]  states their claim.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:14.360]  Yep.
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:15.360]  You heard that right.
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:16.360]  $34.6 billion.
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:24.480]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com, thousands of people already lined up
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:25.480]  to cash in.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:26.480]  Take Doug, for example.
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:32.160]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri, set to get a check for $24,000.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:35.160]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:36.640]  But here's the thing.
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:42.040]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:44.920]  have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:45.920]  So don't wait.
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:51.360]  Get over to www.americanfreedomchecks.com before the April 1st deadline.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.360]  That's www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:59.360]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:00.880]  Victor, you're calling?
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:01.880]  Go ahead.
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:02.880]  Hi, Alex.
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:08.560]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering
[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:09.560]  all the time.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:13.840]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:18.480]  In particular, silver bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, maybe
[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:23.760]  like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet, and I'll still feel a
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.960]  little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:29.440]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:31.440]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:34.840]  Because people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:39.000]  of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  So thank you.
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.080]  But when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98-percent
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:46.080]  review.
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:49.920]  It is our highest-reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country discounted
[02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:51.200]  high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:56.520]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:59.360]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:07.160]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick,
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:08.160]  and stupid.
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:09.760]  So what do we do about it?
[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:13.320]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:20.080]  Fight back with the all-new, supercharged Brain Force Plus, and feel the rush without
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:21.080]  the crash.
[02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:27.040]  Brain Force Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and new tropics.
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:33.400]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called black pepper fruit extract that gives
[02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:36.000]  you an added kick.

[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:48.720]  that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:50.200]  It's the real deal.

[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:58.080]  Ike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:59.080]  Go ahead.
[02:31:59.080 --> 02:32:01.440]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:05.120]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:11.880]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:17.320]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome Brain Force,
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:18.320]  Anthroplex.
[02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:20.560]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.560]  Thank you.
[02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:25.680]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:26.680]  toothpaste fans.
[02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:28.480]  The super blue is awesome.
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:31.400]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:32.600]  They are quality.
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:34.560]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:37.600]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:38.600]  Absolutely.
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:44.320]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand
[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:46.280]  that there's a bigger problems going on.
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:50.440]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:33:13.800]  take our country back.
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:32.720]  So I didn't even know, I didn't even know that our last guest Sabo was also being banned
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:33.720]  on YouTube.
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:37.680]  I mean, it's, it's insane.
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:45.080]  So we report on this, not just InfoWars and the Alex Jones channel getting hit with the
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:51.120]  strikes and then them trying to shut, they're trying to strike the David Knight show.
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.920]  They try to strike the War Room show.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:54.600]  They try to shut those down.
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:00.880]  I mean, the War Room show that I usually host from 3 to 6 p.m. with Roger Stone.
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:05.160]  We haven't even been able to go live for like over a month.
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:09.400]  And they don't even tell us, it's just, nope, you know, you can't go live.
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:13.720]  And it's over, it's over some video that's already like everywhere.
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:17.920]  And it's just like, nope, you can't go live, which hurts the subscribers.
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:22.080]  And so then now on the Alex Jones channel, they say, oh, nope, you can't go live.
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:24.400]  You can't, you can't even upload a video.
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:30.520]  And that's where we were for about a 12 hour to 24 hour period over the weekend.
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:33.760]  And then they removed the strike and then they gave the strike back and then they removed
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:36.360]  the strike and then there's three strikes and then there's two strikes.
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:37.800]  Now I think we're down to one strike again.
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:40.680]  So it's like they're playing this game of tiddlywinks.
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:49.080]  Or my theory is the Southern Poverty Law Center and CNN has minions or even just the Bryan
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:50.080]  Stelters.
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:51.480]  I wouldn't be shocked if Stelter was behind this.
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:57.560]  I mean, Bryan Stelter, that guy, you think that guy has a life?
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:03.320]  So he goes and he flags or let's say anyone, is Southern Poverty Law Center or anybody,
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:08.400]  even just some, some, some, some idiot liberal that just goes on YouTube.
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:11.400]  They flag an info wars video.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:17.200]  They say info wars reports.
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:23.560]  All of the students that are activists from the Florida high school are crisis actors.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:25.840]  And so they report the video, they flag the video.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:29.600]  And then, you know, YouTube has some algorithm built in where it's just if, if, if info wars
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.160]  gets flagged or if Alex Jones gets flagged, it's just boom, they just, oh yeah, of course,
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:37.920]  I'm sure it's real, you know, we know that Alex is bad, info wars bad.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:40.800]  So yes, it must be real, whatever you're reporting.
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.760]  So we'll go ahead and initiate that strike.
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:49.000]  Then you, we appeal it.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.560]  They review the video.
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:57.080]  They find out that we didn't say what we were flagged for saying.
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:00.640]  And then they remove the strike.
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:09.920]  So then they create this whole buzz about it, info wars banned, info wars losing advertisers.
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:11.200]  Alex Jones not banned.
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:12.360]  He lied about being banned.
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:13.360]  No, he is banned.
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:14.360]  No, he's not banned.
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:16.000]  And then the advertisers have confusion.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.960]  And then you have fake ad buys where they just buy an advertisement to just say, we're
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:25.200]  pulling our advertisements.
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:28.960]  That's like CNN, CNN hires me just to fire me.
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:33.880]  It's like CNN hires Owen Troyer, CNN fires Owen Troyer, and then they make some huge
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:34.880]  story about it.
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:40.520]  Like they fired me and the whole thing was just a stunt.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.160]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:47.800]  And then again, you've got all these other channels, conservatives being censored, conservatives
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:48.800]  being banned.
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:53.480]  If you tweet, you get shadow, but you know what, you know what, you know, I already blew
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:54.480]  it.
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:55.480]  I already blew it this segment.
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:56.480]  We're going to do it next segment.
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:58.040]  We're going to go to this video.
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:36:59.400]  For next segment, guys, have the trade.
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:10.000]  Ted Cruz, so look, Project Veritas has already caught these people admitting what they do.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  Project Veritas caught these people admitting they want Alex Jones censored, admitting they
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:21.200]  want YouTube to stop letting Info Wars videos trend, Twitter admitting they want it to,
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:24.080]  they want to stop Info Wars videos from trending.
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:29.600]  Now this video of Ted Cruz is from back in January.
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:39.760]  Now I pride myself on trying to not miss anything, and I missed this one, but Ted Cruz asks administrators
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:46.560]  from Facebook and Twitter and YouTube about censorship and I mean, I don't know, I'm sitting
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.920]  and I'm watching this and I'm thinking, do we have a case of perjury against these people?
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:56.960]  But you'll notice that they don't answer Ted Cruz's questions about censorship.
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:00.480]  So I just want to make sure that I have the proper due diligence to cover that video.
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.280]  So I'm going to do that in the next segment because we're running out of time here.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:05.760]  Meanwhile, let me just blast through some news.
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:10.920]  Kim Jong-un is set to meet with the leaders from South Korea for the first time since
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:15.200]  he has become the dictator there in North Carolina.
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  So that's interesting news, big news.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:25.000]  You got President Trump calling out Barack Obama for crimes with the illegal spying bigger
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.440]  than Watergate rigging the election for Hillary not doing anything about the Russian meddling.
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:36.040]  I mean, okay, yeah, we know, so let's get something done, you know, get this guy in
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:37.840]  front of a committee or something.
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:41.760]  Michael Savage has his information doxxed.
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:44.320]  Protesters show up at his secret homes.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:46.920]  So who's doxxing conservatives?
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.560]  You had a conservative teacher get doxxed by the Huffington Post or I don't know if they
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:56.280]  were the original, but it was their first report on the teacher.
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:03.080]  So this teacher has a podcast conservative, just American podcast and they doxxer because
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:04.360]  now she's a white nationalist.
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:09.640]  You see, if you love America, if you like the Second Amendment and if you like free
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:14.240]  speech, see, you're a white nationalist and you can't even have a podcast.
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:20.240]  So she's a teacher at Florida High School, middle school, Florida, Florida, 25 year
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:22.720]  old teacher at a middle school in Florida.
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:23.720]  Hazard conservative podcast.
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.360]  In fact, let me just plug that real quick, you know what, they want, they want to shut
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:27.360]  that down.
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:28.360]  We'll shut that down.
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:31.080]  Let's give it a little more, let's give it a little more momentum.
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.680]  The unapologetic podcast covering the topics others are too afraid to talk about.
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:40.160]  And I'll be honest, I mean, you got to, this is a girl who can host a pretty good podcast.
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:41.160]  It's pretty good stuff.
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:47.600]  I'll listen to some of it before the show, but see, you've got all of these videos online
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:52.840]  where liberal professors are lecturing their class about politics.
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:54.400]  They're lecturing their class about Trump.
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:56.480]  They're lecturing their class about Trump racist.
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:39:59.720]  They're lecturing their class about all the political nonsense.
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:06.760]  They have, you've got videos of professors literally pretending to shoot a gun at Trump
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:08.960]  on the screen.
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:15.880]  So liberal professors have gone totally radical left and then they take their views to the
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.480]  classroom with them and indoctrinate their students.
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:26.320]  This teacher just has a podcast online, doesn't bring it to class with her, doesn't promote
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:28.560]  it in class, doesn't promote her politics.
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:29.800]  She's a social studies teacher.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:35.560]  She's just teaching from the textbook and she's the bad guy.
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:43.040]  I'm trying to get her onto the broadcast, I want to interview her.
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.680]  So Democrat liberal professors are able to espouse their politics in the classroom, indoctrinate
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:56.840]  their students, pretend to shoot Trump on a screen, but a conservative teacher wants
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:02.760]  to just have a podcast on the side, she needs to be shut down.
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:08.200]  She's a white nationalist, you see, yes, that's how that works.
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:13.840]  Meanwhile, Dix is going to stop selling pro-gun patriotic merchandise.
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:16.960]  Real good business decision, Dix.
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:20.320]  Real good business decision, not.
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:26.880]  Yeah, YouTube keeps trying to censor info wars, that story was on Drudge.
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:31.640]  Liberals have now planned a play called Kill Climate Deniers, even though they're the climate
[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:35.520]  deniers, they are the climate deniers.
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.960]  They said global warming, we said climate, now they say climate and then they say we're
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:42.960]  climate deniers.
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:48.840]  This is mental illness, man, I'm sorry, you know, this is just mental illness.
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:52.320]  If this isn't mental illness, I don't know what is, how about this one?
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:58.560]  Facebook asks users, should we allow men to ask children for sexual images?
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:05.280]  Facebook has admitted it was a, quote unquote, mistake to ask users whether pedophiles requesting
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:08.600]  sexual pictures from children should be allowed on its website.
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:13.200]  Why is Facebook asking that?
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.040]  What is wrong with Facebook?
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:21.800]  Why would Facebook even, see think about it, this is how you know it's a mental disorder
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.280]  folks.
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:28.480]  Liberalism has become such a mental disorder, they're going left of Hitler, they're going
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:34.480]  left of Stalin, they're going left of Mao, they're so liberal, let's just do it in the
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:39.680]  road, they're so liberal, a pedophile has the right to be on Facebook too, a pedophile
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:45.200]  has the right to get lewd images of children, or what do you think, I don't know, Facebook
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:49.520]  is just asking, I mean, should we allow pedophiles to be on Facebook and get sexual images and
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:50.520]  ask children?
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:56.480]  I mean, Facebook is just asking, they don't know, they don't know, they need to know.
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:01.160]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:08.240]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:14.880]  formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit and flax
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:16.560]  fiber.
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:21.680]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria which
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:27.320]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:32.200]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic and
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:34.680]  clinically studied ingredients.
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.600]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:46.520]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:49.200]  for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:56.920]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:02.160]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:07.280]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:11.480]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:15.600]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:20.080]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:24.680]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:29.240]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:31.600]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.680]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:40.520]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:45.000]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.360]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:52.560]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today.
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:56.520]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:00.720]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from InfoWarsLife.com, but
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:03.920]  instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.920]  personally.
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:09.640]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:12.320]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:19.360]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works, and there's no way to quantify
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:24.480]  how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:30.320]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:39.480]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:46.400]  he is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:50.680]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsLife.com, what it could do for your family, and again,
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:52.280]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:59.400]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:10.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:32.120]  All right, so think about what it is that we're dealing with here.
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:38.200]  You've got, let's not forget, Hillary Clinton calling out Alex Jones by name during the
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:40.200]  campaign.
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:44.840]  Then you've got congressional hearings going on multiple times where they talk about doing
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:49.440]  something about InfoWars, doing something about InfoWars videos trending, doing something
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:53.120]  about InfoWars videos being at the top of the list for people to click on at the trending
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:54.120]  topics.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.680]  They got to do something about that and like, oh, we're going to take care of it during
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:57.680]  lunch.
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:02.560]  Oh, then you've got Project Veritas videos with the executives at YouTube and Twitter,
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:06.280]  and they talk about banning us, censoring conservatives and all this.
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:13.600]  So we have the consortium of knowledge with actual real-time experience dealing with the
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:20.920]  censorship, dealing with being a conservative and having your free speech attacked.
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:22.080]  But then you have this video.
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:30.760]  Now, this is about a month old, but you have to wonder, is this perjury?
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:35.720]  Ted Cruz questions Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube on censorship of conservatives.
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:44.120]  This is how they respond to Ted Cruz's questions when he's asking about if they view their platform
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:45.200]  as neutral.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:46.360]  Go ahead and roll that clip.
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:48.640]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:50.440]  Welcome to each of the witnesses.
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:56.160]  I'd like to start by asking each of the company representatives a simple question, which is,
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:02.280]  do you consider your companies to be neutral public for?
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:06.360]  Ms. Becker.
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:07.680]  None of them wanted to answer.
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:08.680]  Thank you, Senator.
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:10.960]  The mission of our company is to connect people.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.560]  Oh, and then she goes on with some long legal talk because you can't say yes.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:17.400]  We want people to be able to connect and share who they are.
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:20.960]  So I'm just looking for a yes or no, whether you consider yourself to be a neutral public
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:21.960]  forum.
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:27.920]  We do not have any policy about political ideology that affect our platform.
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:28.920]  Ms. Downs?
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:34.200]  Yes, our goal is to design products for everyone, subject to our policies and the limitations
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.360]  they impose on the types of content that people may share on our products.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:40.400]  So you're saying you do consider YouTube to be a neutral public forum?
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:41.400]  Correct.
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.760]  We enforce our policies in a politically neutral way.
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:47.320]  Certain things are prohibited by our community guidelines, which are spelled out and provided
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:48.480]  publicly to all of our users.
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:50.400]  Now pause it right there.
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.600]  Now Ted Cruz is going to go here later.
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:57.000]  But is that not perjury?
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:08.800]  I mean, you have the tape of the YouTube administrators talking about how they want Alex Jones buried.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:11.480]  How is that neutral?
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:18.600]  How is that neutral when there is a mass purge, a mass censorship of conservatives and Trump
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:22.360]  supporters and Second Amendment activists on YouTube right now?
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:24.640]  How is that neutral?
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:32.720]  So did Ms. Downs just perjure herself there, or was her answer constructed in the right
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:35.320]  fashion to get away with it legally?
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:37.160]  Let's go back to the clip.
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:44.400]  Well, let me focus for a minute, Mr. Monche, as you know, there have been several videos
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:49.000]  that were released in recent weeks that I and a lot of other people find highly troubling.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  And so I want to give you an opportunity to respond to that.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.800]  Yeah, everyone should find them troubling, whether you're conservative or liberal or whatever.
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:51:01.360]  Abneoff, that bad review described as a former Twitter software engineer, was captured on
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:06.480]  video saying the following quote, one strategy is to shadow ban.
[02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:08.720]  So you have ultimate control.
[02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:12.800]  The idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone, but they don't know they've been banned because
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:15.720]  they keep posting and no one sees their content.
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:20.240]  So they just think that no one is engaging with their content when in reality, no one
[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:22.200]  is seeing it.
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:24.920]  Is that a practice that occurs at Twitter?
[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:29.440]  No, sir, we do not shadow ban users.
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:35.600]  Why would this individual described as a former Twitter software engineer say that?
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:38.120]  Thank you for the opportunity to respond, Senator, about this.
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:41.840]  These folks were caught on video, they weren't speaking on behalf of the company, they were
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:43.840]  speaking in their personal capacity.
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:44.840]  Exactly.
[02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:45.840]  It's called candid.
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:46.840]  It's called real.
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:53.720]  What works, what we do is if an account is spammy, meaning engaging in malicious automation,
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:57.040]  we'll hide, make it harder for them to find to be found.
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:00.360]  Okay, so you see how he left himself and out.
[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:01.360]  So that's their out.
[02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:07.920]  Oh, well, if we think maybe there's some Russian bots, or we think maybe some spam, all right,
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:08.920]  right, right.
[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:13.080]  And it's just a mistake that it just so happens to be all the conservatives.
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:18.040]  It's just a mistake that it just happens to be the Trump supporters that you happen to
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:21.040]  think are spammy or Russian bots.
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:22.960]  So that's his legal out.
[02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:24.920]  So that's how they get away with perjuring himself.
[02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:28.680]  Well, you know, it'll shadow ban anybody for their political beliefs.
[02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:29.680]  No, no, no, no.
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:35.720]  But we do engage in practices and we will stop things that we view as spammy or Russian
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:36.920]  botnet activity.
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:39.080]  We will, we will, we will.
[02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:43.640]  And then that's their legal out to say, oh, well, we just thought you were a Russian bot
[02:52:43.640 --> 02:52:47.600]  or we thought you were spammy and it's total bull.
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:54.000]  That's a cover for a political ideology and basing your censorship based on political
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  ideologies.
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:58.240]  To me, this is perjury, but they get away with it because they have the right legal
[02:52:58.240 --> 02:52:59.240]  ad answer.
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:00.240]  Let's go back.
[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:02.080]  Folks were caught on video.
[02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:04.000]  They weren't speaking on behalf of the company.
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.680]  They were speaking in their personal capacity.
[02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:08.320]  But they were speaking and they did say.
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:15.920]  Again, folks, what we do do is if an account is spammy, meaning engaging in malicious automation,
[02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:20.760]  we will hide, make it harder for them to find, to be found on our platform if I, if I could
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.760]  continue sir.
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:26.960]  That was one of the reasons why the efforts that we saw with the Russian missing misinformation
[02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:27.960]  there it is.
[02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:28.960]  As big a mark as they were hoping.
[02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:29.960]  There it is.
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:31.120]  We were able to stop that in real time.
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:32.120]  Another thing.
[02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:33.120]  Another individual.
[02:53:33.120 --> 02:53:38.120]  I didn't pause right there, did you hear what he said he goes, we were able to stop that
[02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:39.120]  in real time.
[02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:41.360]  So then what Russian influence was there?
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:44.360]  He just said they stopped all of it.
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:45.880]  It's ridiculous.
[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:47.680]  Go ahead.
[02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:53.880]  Twitter content review agent was quoted on video as saying on stuff like that, it was
[02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:55.600]  more discretion on your viewpoint.
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:58.240]  I guess how you felt about a particular matter.
[02:53:58.240 --> 02:53:59.240]  Yeah.
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:04.400]  They said this is quote pro Trump, I don't want it because it offends me this, that and
[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:06.040]  I say I banned the whole thing.
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:07.040]  Now pause right there.
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:13.680]  Now keep in mind, you've got, you've got discrimination suits going against Facebook, going against
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:16.720]  Google and so Google owns YouTube.
[02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:20.360]  So, so they're already dealing, they've already been caught.
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:22.240]  Their discrimination is already known.
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:23.240]  They've been caught.
[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:28.560]  And then here they are trying to cover for themselves as Cruz is, is grilling them here.
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:30.320]  Go back to Ted Cruz.
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:32.640]  We're here and they are like, Oh, you know what?
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:33.640]  I don't like it too.
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:34.640]  You know what?
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:35.640]  Mo's right.
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:36.640]  Let's go.
[02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:37.640]  Let's carry on.
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:38.640]  What's next?
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:42.800]  Is that individual describing a practice that occurs at Twitter?
[02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:43.800]  No, sir.
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:46.280]  We, uh, no, he just made it up out of thin air.
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:50.840]  Congress is a way to, if we see an account that is being abusive, uh, that, oh, here's
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:55.040]  their new legal out abusive content targeted abuse against so pause right there.
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:56.680]  So, so, so here's another one.
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:00.080]  So it's abusive content.
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:01.080]  Right.
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:02.080]  Okay.
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:09.680]  So we take a video of David Hogg being interviewed and he, he's, he's struggling to say stuff.
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:11.120]  He's, he's fumbling his words.
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:14.040]  He's, he's messing up and we just play the video.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:16.640]  It's not our original content.
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:20.480]  We just play the content that other people have recorded and we just show you it and
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:22.880]  report on it and say, what is this?
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:25.920]  And then they say that's bullying.
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:29.440]  They say that that's, um, uh, what was the phrase that he used guys?
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:35.720]  I forget the exact phrase, but so that's what they say.
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:36.720]  And then that's their excuse.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:41.880]  So, so he, he, he's basically admitting like, okay, yeah, you caught us red handed.
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:42.880]  We censor people.
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:43.880]  We shadow ban people.
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:46.360]  Um, and it's based on political ideologies.
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:47.360]  Yeah.
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:51.680]  You pretty much caught us red handed here, but I don't want to perjure myself and I also
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:53.800]  don't want to admit that to the public.
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:59.920]  So I'm going to construct a legal answer, deny that I'm actually shadow banning, deny
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:07.360]  that I'm actually censoring, and then on the back end, protect my own hide by saying, but
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:09.740]  we do try to stop malicious behavior.
[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:11.880]  We do try to stop spammy behavior.
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:14.440]  We do try to stop Russian bots behavior.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:17.120]  We try to stop abusive behavior.
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:20.320]  So then you say, how come info wars is always shadow banned?
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:21.600]  How come Alex Jones is getting banned?
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:29.000]  And you know what they say, abusive content, spammy content, Russian bots.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.080]  So they're admitting what they're doing.
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:36.760]  They're admitting the purge, they're admitting the censorship, but they're doing an end around
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:40.400]  and they're saying, we're just censoring abusive behavior.
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:41.920]  And so that's how it gets out of it.
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:43.720]  Let's play the rest of this clip.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:48.200]  If they're being, uh, if, if, if they're consistently violating our terms of service,
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:51.880]  but they haven't crossed the line into being suspended, uh, we'll make it less visible,
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:52.880]  but we won't do.
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:53.880]  Oh yeah.
[02:56:53.880 --> 02:56:54.880]  We'll make you less visible.
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:59.560]  Your followers will always be able to see, uh, and, uh, we are not, uh, we, we ensure
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:03.120]  that if you go on, so bring it down.
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:04.440]  So here's the deal.
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:09.680]  So project Veritas catches the guy candidly talking about what they're actually doing,
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:12.920]  what actually drives it, why it's happening.
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:19.160]  And then in front of Ted Cruz, they won't admit that because they know they're in a,
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:24.440]  a, a legal situation and they are in a public situation and they don't want to admit it.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:27.960]  So behind the scenes privately, the guy might have had a drink or two in him.
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:29.840]  He admits what's actually going on.
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.760]  Then the official legal statement is no, no, no, no, no, that's not what's going on.
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:36.000]  We're just stopping abusive behavior.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.360]  They're very abusive over there.
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:41.120]  Didn't you see, didn't you see, they played, they played a video that's real.
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:42.120]  You can't see that.
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:43.120]  That's abusive.
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:51.800]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:58.200]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:05.440]  or videos or other material from info or store.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:07.640]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.320]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at info or store.com.
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.040]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:18.920]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:21.320]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:25.440]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:31.160]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or triple-A2533139.
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:35.560]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:38.440]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:58:38.440 --> 02:58:39.440]  And that's who they are.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:41.000]  And they know we know who they are.
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:46.540]  And they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:58:46.540 --> 02:58:51.520]  The scientists at infowarslife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:53.240]  and joint support.
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:56.360]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[02:58:56.360 --> 02:59:00.180]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:04.520]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:08.680]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:12.960]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:18.160]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:19.920]  so much more.
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:24.320]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:30.160]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:36.120]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:38.960]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:59:38.960 --> 03:00:08.800]  Buy Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:34.800]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:01:04.640]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:34.640]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:02:03.640]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:33.480]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:03:00.480]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:06.360]  So here's a standard sporting shotgun with double odd buck that you can buy at any hardware
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:09.360]  store and any gun store and you should all around the world.
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:13.760]  And by the way, this range right here is about what the shooters had to deal with because
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:15.160]  no one resisted.
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:18.640]  No one was trained how to fight back or how to deal with a shooter.
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:21.480]  So a shooter with a goose gun could have done this.
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:27.040]  Fire in the hole, it's clear.
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:29.040]  It's really a wallop.
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:31.040]  Man, that sucker kicks.
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:33.040]  It's really a lot of power.
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:39.280]  And I know this is just paper, but it'll show you the terminal ballistics of your standard
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:43.840]  firearms in America, your standard sporting shotguns that we hunt rabbits and pheasants
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:49.680]  and quail and doves and turkeys and it's more deadly than an AR-15.
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:54.680]  This is one trigger squeeze of a 12 gauge shotgun with buck shot.
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.880]  If you really want to crush the left and want to crush freedom haters, not only should
[03:03:59.880 --> 03:04:04.200]  you be a member of the National Rifle Association, but you should give away membership to everybody
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:07.240]  you know at work and church and school, your family.
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:11.320]  The NRA should have 50 million members because I know there's over 100 million gun owners
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:16.040]  in this country and so far five to six million NRA members are doing the hefty lifting for
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:17.040]  freedom.
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  That's right.
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.760]  The Giants only half awake and we're starting to win and we've just got to get the Giants
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:27.120]  fully awake and restore the Republic if people want to go to North Korea or Venezuela and
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  live in hell they can go.
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:30.120]  But here we're going to go back to what makes the country great.
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:31.120]  Dead dudes, you're awesome.
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:32.120]  Thanks for having us here.
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:33.120]  You bet, you bet.
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:34.120]  Glad to have you here, man.
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:35.120]  Awesome.
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:36.120]  Carry on, keep raising hell.
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:52.680]  Remember if you're not pissing off the asshole, you're an asshole.
[03:04:52.680 --> 03:04:55.240]  Dream Full Wars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:57.640]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:05:05.760]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated fibers from
[03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:11.080]  berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your
[03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:13.480]  body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:19.680]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture for a life as well as
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:23.920]  micro ZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses and the gut.
[03:05:23.920 --> 03:05:28.680]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these
[03:05:28.680 --> 03:05:29.680]  other products.
[03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:33.440]  You can get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high
[03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:35.680]  quality products at the same time.
[03:05:35.680 --> 03:05:38.520]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:05:38.520 --> 03:05:44.440]  Bodies sold out in a month, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can come up with.
[03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:46.480]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:49.840]  These sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[03:05:49.840 --> 03:05:52.320]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:54.320]  Get yours today, infowarslife.com.
[03:05:54.320 --> 03:06:11.600]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[03:06:11.600 --> 03:06:15.120]  host, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:19.560]  We're entering the fourth and final hour here at the Alex Jones show today.
[03:06:19.560 --> 03:06:25.120]  And I am about to hand it over to the bullpen where Gerald Salenti is fired up.
[03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:26.640]  He's got all the news to cover.
[03:06:26.640 --> 03:06:30.520]  Again, folks, thank you for your support at infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:30.520 --> 03:06:32.680]  You make all of this possible.
[03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:38.120]  And remember, they are trying to silence people like us, people like Gerald Salenti, and probably
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:39.120]  you yourself.
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:40.240]  They'll come for you next.
[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:46.280]  So in these great times of censorship and the dehumanizing and demonetizing and everything
[03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:49.480]  that we have to deal with as conservatives, it's very important to support us.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:55.000]  So we've got the defeat CNN's attempt to crush info or special right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.440]  So please support us.
[03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:57.440]  All right.
[03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:02.680]  Without further ado, I hand the ball to Gerald Salenti, Gerald, you're in.
[03:07:02.680 --> 03:07:03.680]  Close us off.
[03:07:03.680 --> 03:07:04.680]  Thank you, Owen.
[03:07:04.680 --> 03:07:12.400]  I'm a very wonderful being on Alex Jones, and just so people know that this has been
[03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:19.400]  going on for quite some time with Google taking down those that they don't want.
[03:07:19.400 --> 03:07:25.400]  And there's a site called the world's socialist website, wsws.org.
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:27.280]  I go to it for a lot of information.
[03:07:27.280 --> 03:07:31.400]  I don't, I'm a political atheist, you know, I'm not, I don't call myself a conservative
[03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:35.240]  or a Democrat or Republican, I look at things through the way they are, but I go to their
[03:07:35.240 --> 03:07:43.800]  site because they do a pretty good job of analyzing the data that's put out and they're
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:46.040]  very anti-war.
[03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:51.080]  And they put out a study showing how this is, I'm going back several months now, how
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:58.480]  their algorithms have really been knocked off and how their viewership has really fallen.
[03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:03.520]  And again, I don't subscribe to their belief system, but I search out information.
[03:08:03.520 --> 03:08:07.080]  That's one of the things you do as a trend forecaster.
[03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:12.840]  You don't go to places to where you like, you go to places where you want to be informed.
[03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:17.120]  It's not about building your belief system, it's about finding facts.
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:19.240]  And the facts are there.
[03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:24.240]  And again, this is coming, we're talking Alex Jones on one side and World's Socialist
[03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:29.560]  Website on the other side, and you could just Google it up and you could do the research,
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:34.600]  put it right in there, and they'll show you how Google is taking down those that they
[03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:43.840]  don't want, and one after another, and ours, all the anti-war people, all the people that
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:51.440]  are against globalization and the powers to be are being hit by Google.
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:09:01.600]  And to show you firsthand what arrogant people Google, their operation is, I had to take
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:03.520]  Google to court.
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:04.520]  That's right.
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:12.800]  You could Google it up, Gerald Salenti, Google, Second District Court, Federal Court, New
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:13.800]  York.
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:17.440]  You know that show Law and Order where they show the people walking up the stairs over
[03:09:17.440 --> 03:09:18.440]  there?
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:19.880]  That's the place.
[03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:28.520]  It caused me well into six figures, because some slimy little jerk took out a Gerald Salenti
[03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:36.560]  blog spot, that's right, my name, and kept putting up fake information.
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:44.000]  People were calling me, we were losing subscriptions by the hundreds daily because of the things
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:49.720]  that I wasn't saying, but they appeared there because this guy put up all false information
[03:09:49.720 --> 03:09:50.720]  about me.
[03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:53.200]  Google refused to take it down.
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:10:03.040]  I had a top law firm in New York City, prior cashmen, and it cost me a lot of cash, man.
[03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:13.120]  They lost the case, the arrogance, they brought in their top general counsel from California.
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:16.200]  He argued it was a First Amendment right.
[03:10:16.200 --> 03:10:19.200]  It wasn't a First Amendment.
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:24.960]  The judge, Kathleen Forrest, ruled right there and then that there was a violation of Gerald
[03:10:24.960 --> 03:10:31.920]  Salenti's trademark, and well-known worldwide for many years of an established trademark.
[03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:37.160]  It was a violation, and they were claiming First Amendment rights had nothing to do with
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:38.160]  it.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:41.600]  And the arrogance of this guy, well, guess what?
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:47.480]  The same low-life person, who we don't know where they're doing it from, now has a Gerald
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:50.280]  Salenti's blog spot.
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:55.840]  He's put an S at the end, and Google refuses to take it down.
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:11:06.280]  But boy, oh boy, when CNN calls Google, the cartoon news network, the crap news network,
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:09.000]  boy, did they jump.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.280]  What a joke that thing is.
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:12.280]  CNN.
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:17.320]  Again, I go to all the sites because I need to know what's going on, and we're going to
[03:11:17.320 --> 03:11:21.000]  do some trend forecast thing and show you how it's done.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:22.480]  Current events form future trends.
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:27.360]  I have to see what's going on in the world to see, so I know what I'm talking about.
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:33.120]  And the facts, I just assume from going to different places when I get enough information
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:38.440]  from varied sources, then I see what's BS and what's hard fact.
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:44.800]  When I go to CNN and I go to the other sites in the United States to see the propaganda
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:49.240]  that they're putting out and the stupid stories that they're headlining, and I'm going to give
[03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:53.280]  you an example of the cartoon news network.
[03:11:53.280 --> 03:11:54.280]  That's right.
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:59.600]  You go on this morning, I'm interested in what just happened over there in Italy as a
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:00.600]  Pizzano.
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:01.600]  Ah, more than that.
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:07.280]  I just want to see what's going on because they have a big election they just had, and
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:10.400]  I wanted to see who won.
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:15.600]  And the election was really a good one in the terms that they just overthrew the established
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:16.600]  powers.
[03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:22.200]  And Cinque Stelle, the five-star movement, was the one that got the most amount of votes.
[03:12:22.200 --> 03:12:24.240]  They call it a populist party.
[03:12:24.240 --> 03:12:26.680]  It's bad to be a populist.
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:30.520]  I can't belong to the pro-American party.
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:32.320]  No, no, no.
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:34.360]  I got to be a globalist.
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:37.800]  Things great since globalization, isn't it?
[03:12:37.800 --> 03:12:41.240]  Anyway, so now I want to know what's going on.
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:42.240]  So I look in here.
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:44.080]  I go to Agency France.
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:46.440]  I go to BBC Guardian.
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:49.360]  I go to Global Times, China.
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:52.800]  I want to see what, Al Jazeera, I go to everybody.
[03:12:52.800 --> 03:12:54.360]  Guess what CNN had on?
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:56.960]  Hey, do you hear about the Oscars?
[03:12:56.960 --> 03:12:59.280]  Let me tell you more about the Oscars.
[03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:01.240]  I got a lot to tell you about the Oscars.
[03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:04.040]  Hey, you know about the Oscars?
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:09.720]  And then some stupid anti-Russian propaganda.
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:19.720]  So as I'm watching CNN, all of a sudden, man, up flashes this clown, this Don Lemon.
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:22.440]  Perfect name for the cat, man.
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:27.400]  Squeeze that lemon dry, a nothing but arrogant stupidity.
[03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:30.880]  This isn't news reporting.
[03:13:30.880 --> 03:13:32.920]  It's the arrogance of what they believe.
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:36.680]  The prostitute days, we're talking Italian here.
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:39.000]  That's right.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:42.560]  People get hate to put out.
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:46.640]  Men and women, we got to be equal here.
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:48.000]  Prostitutes.
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:51.840]  I'm doing more looking at other garbage on CNN.
[03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:54.440]  It is and it's in Coupa.
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:55.440]  Yeah.
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:14:02.880]  A nobody, a little boy born on third base and thought he hit a home run.
[03:14:02.880 --> 03:14:09.440]  If his mother wasn't a Vanderbilt, yeah, that's what he'd be doing, driving a van maybe and
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:13.520]  making 62.50 a week.
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:22.000]  That's who's destroying this country, the propaganda media, one after another.
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:25.960]  So do what you can to support Alex Jones.
[03:14:25.960 --> 03:14:31.200]  Do what you can to support the Trends Journal, our publication.
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:37.120]  You'd better put your money where your mind is because all they're going to do is drop
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:42.200]  more filth on it and call it the truth.
[03:14:42.200 --> 03:14:49.480]  One clown show after another, believing in the mainstream media is as stupid as believing
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:15:00.760]  in little Lindsey Graham, Chuck E. Schumer, little Paulie, Munster Ryan, Diane Not-So-Fine-Stein,
[03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:05.200]  one clown after another.
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:08.040]  Don't forget to tune in.
[03:15:08.040 --> 03:15:14.760]  You know, America used to, they still do, they attack countries and they call them out for
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:17.840]  putting on propagandists.
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:22.880]  That's what we have in America, the propaganda stations.
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:27.640]  So support Alex Jones, again, put your money where your mind is.
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:53.760]  We'll be back in a minute.
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:59.160]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.

[03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:03.520]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[03:18:03.520 --> 03:18:07.360]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:11.160]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:13.000]  particles in the gut.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.440]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:19.360]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:22.560]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:27.120]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort

[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:37.840]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:42.400]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so

[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:02.960]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:08.500]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[03:19:08.500 --> 03:19:09.920]  and normal breathing.
[03:19:09.920 --> 03:19:10.920]  This is pollen block.
[03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:16.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:22.320]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[03:19:22.320 --> 03:19:24.000]  and excessive mucus production.
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:28.760]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[03:19:28.760 --> 03:19:34.880]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research of fast-acting chewable tablets, just two tablets
[03:19:34.880 --> 03:19:39.680]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[03:19:39.680 --> 03:19:43.480]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[03:19:58.040 --> 03:20:18.120]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:19.120]  Hi welcome back.
[03:20:19.120 --> 03:20:24.520]  You know today I'm going to do a little bit of trend forecast and show you how we do it.
[03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:31.440]  I've been doing this since 1980, and before we get into that though, again, it's very
[03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:35.600]  important that you support InfoWars.
[03:20:35.600 --> 03:20:45.000]  The way you can do that is by InfoWarsLife operation, Paul Revere 2018, mega special
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  and much, much more.
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:51.800]  Listen, Alex Jones is under attack, InfoWars is under attack.
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:54.280]  People like myself are under attack.
[03:20:54.280 --> 03:20:58.400]  So it's more important than ever that you support the show.
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:04.160]  And for a limited time, they're not only dropping the price on almost all their products by
[03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:07.360]  30% to 80%.

[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:40.080]  the truth.
[03:21:40.080 --> 03:21:46.400]  And I've been around, you know, and I've been to many, many studios and I used to be
[03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:52.040]  on Oprah the Today Show, Good Morning America, and their team has grown and their studios
[03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:58.040]  are top notch and I've been there and it's only with your help that they can reach the
[03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:01.600]  next level.
[03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:11.280]  So some of the products, SuperMail and Super Female Vitality.
[03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:13.960]  I love that SuperMail Vitality.

[03:22:16.520 --> 03:22:19.560]  Real red pill, 50% off.

[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:53.480]  Those are some of the products, just some of them.
[03:22:53.480 --> 03:23:01.080]  Go to the InfoWars site, look at all they have to offer, and again, if you don't support
[03:23:01.080 --> 03:23:05.520]  them, you know what you're going to get.
[03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:10.240]  Get fed more, press the toot news, just like this.
[03:23:10.240 --> 03:23:18.280]  The toilet paper record, the New York Times, this is today's, give you an example of how
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:22.720]  they slant a story.
[03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:27.520]  Populist win in Italian vote, unsettling EU.
[03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:33.520]  Ah, populist bad, globalist good.
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:37.520]  It's wonderful not to have your identity.
[03:23:37.520 --> 03:23:46.440]  Why should Italians be Italians, Germans be Germans, Irish be Irish, Polish be Polish.
[03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:57.600]  You got to be a globalist, yeah, let's melt it down into a multinational, nothing quality
[03:23:57.600 --> 03:24:05.240]  of ancestry country, and be run by the multinationals.
[03:24:05.240 --> 03:24:15.160]  Fury aimed at Brussels and immigrants, ah, and immigrants, aimed at Brussels and immigrants.
[03:24:15.160 --> 03:24:29.400]  Yep, I go to Italy a lot, used to go all the time, not the same place anymore.
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:36.160]  And people don't realize what happened, the unemployment rate there is off the charts.
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:43.000]  So this election, very important, you don't see this happening in the United States, people
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.240]  are still stuck in a two-party system.
[03:24:45.240 --> 03:24:51.160]  If you imagine voting for these jerks, if you don't vote, you get what you deserve.
[03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:54.000]  If you vote, you get what you deserve.
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:58.680]  I'm going to vote for Chuck and Schumer, the other jerk running against them, to be a member
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:04.960]  of the Bloods and the Crips, the Democrats and Republicans, new party, immigrants.
[03:25:04.960 --> 03:25:09.160]  Hey, how did those immigrants happen?
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:19.040]  Can be because Berlusconi, who lost, supported the overthrow of Mo Mar Gaddafi back in 2011,
[03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:26.200]  the leader of Libya, which was the richest country in Africa, that provided its people
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:32.360]  with much more than many other nations do.
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:39.920]  A government overthrown, a sovereign nation by Italy, NATO, another little boy of nothing,
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:52.560]  or three of them, Sarkozy of France, Cameron of the U.K., Obama, and pushed by, if only
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:58.080]  women were in charge, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and Susan Ranks.
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:02.040]  Again, I'm tired of this race creed, gender stuff.
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:09.280]  Even bad comes in all of them, save your trip for somebody else, seen enough of it.
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:14.360]  When Gaddafi was going, Gaddafi had made a deal with Berlusconi, who was running Italy
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:19.560]  at the time, that they wouldn't let anybody coming out of Libya because it's right near
[03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:22.480]  Italy, going into Italy.
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:29.460]  He stopped them, and he warned everyone, when you take me out, you're going to have a refugee
[03:26:29.460 --> 03:26:36.480]  and an immigrant crisis that you'll never be able to control, and there you got it.
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:41.760]  Nobody talks about the why it happens, oh, and you know those terrorists?
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:44.720]  So where do you live?
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:55.720]  Illinois, Alabama, New York, California, Washington State, Oregon, suppose a foreign
[03:26:55.720 --> 03:27:03.360]  nation came in, they don't like Trump, and they're going to bring democracy to America,
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:12.600]  and they invade our country to bring democracy back, and they kill everybody that you love,
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:14.760]  and you have no future.
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:23.960]  Well, if you were going to attack those invaders, you'd be a militant, and then after everybody
[03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:30.680]  you love is dead, and you're out of your mind, and you went to their country and killed people,
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:32.680]  then you're a terrorist.
[03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:40.520]  So you know the story, it's only good for crazy people running government to kill other
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:48.200]  innocent people, but when they retaliate, that's not good, that's terrorism and militancy.
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:54.760]  So now they're going after the Italians, as they did to Germans and others that are now
[03:27:54.760 --> 03:27:58.480]  throwing out the established parties.
[03:27:58.480 --> 03:28:07.800]  And now is the time for a new movement in America, a pro-America party.
[03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:13.640]  America yes first, and that's why I support Trump, I don't support him on a lot of things,
[03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:16.960]  but on trade I'm 100% behind him.
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:24.920]  I know the facts, how Bill Clinton promised 200,000 jobs with NAFTA, and we lost over
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:29.320]  almost a million.
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:37.000]  Back in a little bit, thanks for tuning in, don't forget to put your money there, your
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:47.200]  mind is, buy those Info Wars products, it's extremely important, very important to keep
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:53.040]  Info Wars on the air as others are trying to take them down.
[03:28:53.040 --> 03:29:00.240]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banion Hill, you like freedom, I do, you like money, I do too.
[03:29:00.240 --> 03:29:04.520]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love freedom checks.
[03:29:04.520 --> 03:29:10.280]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who
[03:29:10.280 --> 03:29:15.640]  stakes their claim, yet you heard that right, $34.6 billion.
[03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:22.200]  To get all the details, just go to www.AmericanFreedomChecks.com, thousands of people already
[03:29:22.200 --> 03:29:23.800]  lined up to cash in.
[03:29:23.800 --> 03:29:27.560]  Take Doug for example, he's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a
[03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:33.880]  check for $24,000.00, and if Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too, but here's
[03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:38.960]  the thing, if you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion
[03:29:38.960 --> 03:29:44.120]  payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st, so don't wait.
[03:29:44.120 --> 03:29:55.240]  Get over to www.AmericanFreedomChecks.com before the April 1st deadline, that's www.AmericanFreedomChecks.com.
[03:29:55.240 --> 03:29:59.280]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[03:29:59.280 --> 03:30:04.640]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[03:30:04.640 --> 03:30:09.600]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order

[03:30:11.200 --> 03:30:15.040]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:19.160]  AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:30:19.160 --> 03:30:24.560]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of about $50.00, listeners have
[03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:29.080]  been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products
[03:30:29.080 --> 03:30:30.080]  that you need each month.
[03:30:30.080 --> 03:30:34.680]  Just go to InfoWareShort.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:37.960]  and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:30:37.960 --> 03:30:43.280]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWareShort.com,
[03:30:43.280 --> 03:30:44.480]  this is a sure win.
[03:30:44.480 --> 03:30:50.640]  10% off on AutoShip, win, win, win at InfoWareShort.com, free shipping on orders of about $50.00.
[03:30:50.640 --> 03:30:54.960]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.

[03:31:15.840 --> 03:31:17.280]  charged your oral health.
[03:31:17.280 --> 03:31:22.560]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since Aboriginal
[03:31:22.560 --> 03:31:23.880]  and Biblical times.
[03:31:23.880 --> 03:31:28.960]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is floated with the good halogen iodine
[03:31:28.960 --> 03:31:33.200]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral
[03:31:33.200 --> 03:31:34.200]  health benefits.
[03:31:34.200 --> 03:31:39.520]  Super blue fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these
[03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:43.840]  natural ingredients, xylitol, nano-silver, and iodine.
[03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:47.480]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride-free products.
[03:31:47.480 --> 03:31:52.520]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWareShort.com.
[03:31:52.520 --> 03:31:57.200]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:31:57.200 --> 03:31:59.080]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:31:59.080 --> 03:32:02.920]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:32:02.920 --> 03:32:07.120]  InfoWare's Life Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with
[03:32:07.120 --> 03:32:11.160]  two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:32:11.160 --> 03:32:15.840]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:32:15.840 --> 03:32:20.440]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[03:32:20.440 --> 03:32:21.600]  modern diets.
[03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:27.000]  Secret 12 by InfoWare's Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:29.440]  and support your body's natural systems.
[03:32:29.440 --> 03:32:34.440]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:32:34.440 --> 03:32:38.240]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:43.600]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:32:43.600 --> 03:32:47.240]  Electrify your mind and body, and take your health to the next level.
[03:32:47.240 --> 03:33:15.720]  It's the power of Secret 12 at InfoWare'sLife.com, that's InfoWare'sLife.com.
[03:33:15.720 --> 03:33:22.720]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones.
[03:33:22.720 --> 03:33:31.520]  Hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:38.640]  Don't forget, you're selling propaganda, so they keep selling it and they're getting
[03:33:38.640 --> 03:33:47.120]  everybody off the air that talks truth, freedom, justice, and true equality.
[03:33:47.120 --> 03:33:52.880]  So again, put your money where your mind is and support InfoWare's, their products are
[03:33:52.880 --> 03:33:56.000]  great, I use them myself.
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:02.360]  Give you an example of how they're selling propaganda, some of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:34:02.360 --> 03:34:07.840]  Russians tried to sway U.S. energy debate.
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:16.040]  Of course, they don't provide any facts, only in Uendo, and that's all they do.
[03:34:16.040 --> 03:34:25.320]  And again, look what just happened in Italy, but not in America, you want to talk about
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:38.760]  a democracy, not when you have a two-club of murderers and thieves running the nation,
[03:34:38.760 --> 03:34:40.440]  Democrats and Republicans.
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:45.720]  How many wars do they have to start based on lies, and how much more of our money do
[03:34:45.720 --> 03:34:53.520]  they have to steal in the names of too big to fail, and speaking of too big to fail,
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:56.760]  and capitalism, there's no such thing.
[03:34:56.760 --> 03:35:03.040]  You rise and fall on your own merits, but those days are gone.
[03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:09.800]  Matter of fact, talking about Italy, Mussolini called it fascism, the merger of state and
[03:35:09.800 --> 03:35:12.040]  corporate powers.
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:17.240]  So again, showing you just how propaganda sells and what they do.
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:23.400]  Here's a story in his eternal paper, A Record, The New York Slimes.
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:32.640]  At colleges, protesters are typical voters rare.
[03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:39.680]  And they go on to say, this University of Michigan has a long tradition of politically
[03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:45.400]  active students dating back to the Vietnam War protests.
[03:35:45.400 --> 03:35:52.800]  That is why Eddie Goldenberg, a political science professor there, was shocked to learn
[03:35:52.800 --> 03:35:59.680]  the percentage of students at the school who cast ballots in the last midterm election
[03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:01.680]  just 14%.
[03:36:01.680 --> 03:36:09.360]  Quote, it was a wake-up call, but he realized that so few students were turning out to vote.
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:21.000]  Hey, Goldenberg, why should you turn out to vote for a bunch of slimy little creeps?
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:25.560]  This garbage, if you don't vote, you get what you deserve.
[03:36:25.560 --> 03:36:32.080]  If you vote for a little Chuck E. Schumer, a Paulie Ryan, a Lindsey Graham, a John and
[03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:40.680]  St. McCain, Mitch McConnell, look at these freaks.
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:44.600]  How dare they tell us to vote for them?
[03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:54.440]  We need a new movement in America, in Infowars, the Trends Journal, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:37:00.200]  and others are pushing for that new movement.
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:06.280]  Because if we stay with the same gangsters, we'll get what we deserve.
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:17.840]  Mr. Goldenberg, these stupid little lines.
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:25.920]  It's exciting that colleges are starting to wake up to the role that they should play
[03:37:25.920 --> 03:37:29.560]  to teaching people how to be citizens of democracy.
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:36.760]  Mr. Robert Donahue, associate director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Northwestern
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:46.440]  University, hopefully live up to the charge and start turning out more active citizens.
[03:37:46.440 --> 03:37:47.720]  And not just scholars.
[03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:48.720]  What's scholars?
[03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:55.280]  Yes, we need active citizens, totally agreeing, and this is the time to rise up.
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:37:58.920]  Now, onto some other trends.
[03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:03.000]  On the economy, hey, the market's up again.
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:04.960]  Here's our forecast for the markets.
[03:38:04.960 --> 03:38:11.840]  As you well know, Trends Journal was the first magazine to forecast the Trump rally a week
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:13.640]  after he got elected.
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:14.640]  Why?
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:18.640]  Well, we knew he was going to do the tax, we didn't know, but we knew he was saying
[03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:23.720]  he was going to give tax breaks, and that was going to help the corporations.
[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:26.920]  Again, not in favor, not against.
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:31.120]  I'm not going to do that, what I'm telling you is the why, because I don't agree with
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:34.080]  a lot of them, but I'll tell you the implications.
[03:38:34.080 --> 03:38:38.520]  So, going back to the stock markets.
[03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:45.760]  Price earning ratios of stocks are doing very well, less few years, 15%, excuse me, not
[03:38:45.760 --> 03:38:53.320]  the price earnings ratio, the profits, profits of stocks, S&P 500, doing very well.
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:57.480]  So they had money to reinvest back into the economy, they haven't been doing it.
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:06.880]  Now, going back to the markets, we said in our winter edition, the top 10 trends of 2018,
[03:39:06.880 --> 03:39:14.320]  that be a 10% correction in the markets, and in early February that happened, why?
[03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:18.600]  The markets are overvalued, that's where the price earnings ratio comes in.
[03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:25.720]  They're near historic highs, and they're overleveraged with all these schemes like ETFs and other
[03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:28.600]  things that are driving them up.
[03:39:28.600 --> 03:39:32.440]  Now, where are the markets going?
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:39.080]  The Trump tariffs call last week had nothing to do with bringing down the market.
[03:39:39.080 --> 03:39:43.600]  The markets were down the last two days before that.
[03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:48.560]  They're going down because of fears that the Federal Reserve is going to raise interest
[03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:51.720]  rates, and it's the cheap money that boosted the markets up.
[03:39:51.720 --> 03:39:55.120]  This is a fact, there's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[03:39:55.120 --> 03:40:00.760]  Companies are borrowing money for nothing, and that's what boosted them through stock
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:04.640]  buybacks, they're borrowing money, merges in acquisition activity.
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:10.080]  So now the concern that we can't get that cheap money anymore if interest rates keep
[03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:12.360]  going up.
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:16.520]  They raised interest rates five times since 2015.
[03:40:16.520 --> 03:40:22.600]  The Fed rate is still only 1.25 to 1.5 up, that's nothing.
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:27.200]  When you account for inflation after five years, there's a war against the savers.
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:32.800]  When I was a young guy, people used to put money in a thing called a savings account,
[03:40:32.800 --> 03:40:37.200]  they get enough in a savings account and they retire to Florida.
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:42.320]  So war against the savers, it's only boosted the equity markets.
[03:40:42.320 --> 03:40:47.880]  Now that's what they're concerned about, they can't get that cheap money because interest
[03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:53.760]  rates will go up, it costs more to borrow, to borrow basically for nothing now.
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:58.280]  So where are the markets going to go going back to the Trump plan?
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:06.240]  Already stock buybacks are at an all-time high for this early in the year because of
[03:41:06.240 --> 03:41:12.120]  the tax breaks and allowing them to repatriate that money from overseas at a very low tax
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:13.120]  rate.
[03:41:13.120 --> 03:41:18.080]  They're not putting it into capital improvements, they're not putting it most of it into R&D
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:22.080]  or raising people's wages.
[03:41:22.080 --> 03:41:25.000]  Those are just the headlines that you get.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:32.680]  The fact is most of that dough is going into stock buybacks.
[03:41:32.680 --> 03:41:34.600]  What does that mean?
[03:41:34.600 --> 03:41:38.560]  Less stocks that are out there, it's a supply and demand issue, there's a lot of stocks
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:39.560]  out there.
[03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:44.920]  The price is down, the fewer the stocks, the higher the prices go.
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:49.200]  That's why stock buybacks are so important to the corporations and the executives at
[03:41:49.200 --> 03:41:50.880]  the top.
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:54.720]  So that's what we're looking at.
[03:41:54.720 --> 03:41:58.080]  Where will the stock markets go?
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:04.120]  Well, we believe the Trump rally is nearing its peak or is peaked already.
[03:42:04.120 --> 03:42:11.360]  There's more of a downside risk in an upside gain as we see it at this point and a wild
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:14.200]  card to crash this market.
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:17.640]  The thing to watch are gold prices.
[03:42:17.640 --> 03:42:20.240]  Right now, gold prices are slipping down.
[03:42:20.240 --> 03:42:26.440]  If the market was really in trouble, you'd see gold prices shooting up.
[03:42:26.440 --> 03:42:53.880]  So it's something very important to watch, keep your eye on it, and we'll be right back.
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:57.760]  Introducing Cellforce by Infowars Life.
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:43:01.840]  Cellforce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:43:01.840 --> 03:43:04.600]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:07.600]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:43:07.600 --> 03:43:11.920]  Cellforce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[03:43:11.920 --> 03:43:14.400]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:43:14.400 --> 03:43:18.880]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[03:43:18.880 --> 03:43:21.320]  reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:26.480]  Rep scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[03:43:26.480 --> 03:43:29.360]  these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:29.360 --> 03:43:34.400]  The antioxidants found in Cellforce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:39.240]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen

[03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:10.440]  This is pollen block.
[03:45:10.440 --> 03:45:15.840]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:22.000]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes,
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:23.600]  and excessive mucus production.
[03:45:23.600 --> 03:45:28.360]  They began studying the effects in their public trials.
[03:45:28.360 --> 03:45:34.480]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[03:45:34.480 --> 03:45:39.280]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in

[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:11.600 --> 03:47:17.280]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:21.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.240 --> 03:47:24.640]  Hey, welcome back.
[03:47:24.640 --> 03:47:25.640]  Welcome back.
[03:47:25.640 --> 03:47:28.920]  I was talking about the economy, interest rates.
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:29.920]  So here's the deal.
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:35.080]  What's going to happen with the stock markets, again, it's a very different world in the
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:44.920]  real world because, as I've mentioned on infowars before, 10% of the American population
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:54.880]  owns 90% of all the stocks, which on average is about $350,000 worth of shares they own.
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:47:57.280]  That's 10% each.
[03:47:57.280 --> 03:48:05.720]  Now the rest of the stocks are owned by the rest of us on only on average about $15,000.
[03:48:05.720 --> 03:48:10.960]  So the stock market in the real world are two very different ones.
[03:48:10.960 --> 03:48:17.880]  So going back to raising interest rates, they're only concerned about the big guys so they
[03:48:17.880 --> 03:48:22.280]  could get more cheap dough so they could keep boosting up the markets because there's been
[03:48:22.280 --> 03:48:24.640]  no recovery.
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:33.560]  We're still looking at the labor force participation rate at near all-time highs, or all-time lows,
[03:48:33.560 --> 03:48:34.560]  I should say.
[03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:40.080]  The numbers near all-time high, the people that have given up looking for work.
[03:48:40.080 --> 03:48:45.600]  And when you look at home ownership, it's back to 1960s levels.
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:51.000]  So all tides are not rising.
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:54.120]  Going back to interest rates.
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:49:00.360]  We're already seeing the dangers that are being reported by the FDIC.
[03:49:00.360 --> 03:49:04.960]  Delinquencies are increasing with mortgages.
[03:49:04.960 --> 03:49:07.200]  All those people took out car loans.
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:09.080]  You don't have a job?
[03:49:09.080 --> 03:49:11.880]  Don't have any credit?
[03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:12.880]  Got no money?
[03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:13.960]  Don't worry about it.
[03:49:13.960 --> 03:49:14.960]  Just sign over here.
[03:49:14.960 --> 03:49:18.920]  You get a car, right?
[03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:22.120]  What's going to happen when interest rates go up?
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:24.880]  You can't pay for it now.
[03:49:24.880 --> 03:49:29.480]  How are you going to pay for it when it becomes more expensive?
[03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:35.000]  Now let's forget the individual for a minute and let's look at the nation.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:41.440]  Another $1.5 trillion worth of debt, $20 trillion in debt.
[03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:43.880]  What is it globally?
[03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:46.680]  Almost $50 trillion.
[03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:49.400]  What happens when interest rates go up?
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:54.440]  You can't pay it now and then you've got to pay it with more.
[03:49:54.440 --> 03:50:00.120]  That's why I was saying when we went into the break, watch gold prices.
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:05.760]  When you see gold prices start to take off, and here's our forecast that you have to watch
[03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:06.760]  it again.
[03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:09.760]  Think for yourself as the model of the trends journal.
[03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:17.440]  When you see gold break over $1385 an ounce, tune in tight.
[03:50:17.440 --> 03:50:22.360]  From there it has to go to $1450 an ounce.
[03:50:22.360 --> 03:50:28.760]  When it does, you'll see it skyrocket doing a Bitcoin bounce.
[03:50:28.760 --> 03:50:35.280]  On the other hand, if you see it going down, the markets meet or going to stabilize.
[03:50:35.280 --> 03:50:39.360]  So gold is going to go in the opposite way of the markets.
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:43.080]  The markets go down sharply, watch gold to go up.
[03:50:43.080 --> 03:50:47.720]  If it doesn't go up, the markets are not going to crash, they'll have a correction,
[03:50:47.720 --> 03:50:50.880]  and that's what they're in now, correction territory.
[03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:59.680]  So as the markets have been going down in February, and you didn't see gold go up, you
[03:50:59.680 --> 03:51:01.760]  saw it go down with them.
[03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:03.560]  Very important indicator.
[03:51:03.560 --> 03:51:08.440]  And again, current events form future trends.
[03:51:08.440 --> 03:51:12.560]  Losses from credit cards mount at small banks.
[03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:21.560]  Losses they have to consume hit 7.2% in the fourth quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago, according
[03:51:21.560 --> 03:51:25.120]  to the Federal Reserve data, okay?
[03:51:25.120 --> 03:51:28.400]  Going back to rising interest rates.
[03:51:28.400 --> 03:51:31.000]  Now you can't afford it.
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:34.480]  What else will bring down the markets?
[03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:36.840]  Geopolitical.
[03:51:36.840 --> 03:51:40.320]  Watch what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:51:40.320 --> 03:51:48.080]  Watch the war talk that keeps heating up, because as goes geopolitics, that could be
[03:51:48.080 --> 03:51:52.800]  the black swan event that could bring down the markets.
[03:51:52.800 --> 03:52:01.160]  And again, you got a bunch of sick people out there saying a lot of sick things.
[03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:05.960]  North Korea threatens to counter U.S. over military drill.
[03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:12.320]  Well, the one before that was that we saw little Lindsey Graham shoot his mouth off and
[03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:20.480]  say, you know, it won't be so bad if we go to war basically against North Korea.
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:23.760]  But here's what the North Koreans are saying.
[03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:30.240]  They threatened to counter the U.S. if the United States holds joint military exercises
[03:52:30.240 --> 03:52:32.120]  with South Korea.
[03:52:32.120 --> 03:52:38.240]  If the U.S. finally holds joint military exercises while keeping sanctions on the DPRK,
[03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:45.240]  this is coming from them, the DPRK will continue to counter the United States by its own mode
[03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:52.920]  of counteraction and the U.S. will be made to own all responsibilities for the ensuing
[03:52:52.920 --> 03:52:58.400]  consequences North Korea's official KCNA news agency said.
[03:52:58.400 --> 03:53:04.120]  So, the United States has put sanctions on North Korea.
[03:53:04.120 --> 03:53:06.160]  North Korea has not invaded anyone.
[03:53:06.160 --> 03:53:08.480]  Yeah, they got missiles.
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:11.240]  They, yeah, so.
[03:53:11.240 --> 03:53:12.240]  You got guns.
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:16.960]  You don't use them if nobody uses them against you.
[03:53:16.960 --> 03:53:22.000]  So North Korea made it very clear why they are going nuclear because they saw what the
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:31.680]  United States on the Bush and Obama did to Hussain Qaddafi and what's going on in Syria.
[03:53:31.680 --> 03:53:38.200]  If Syria was nuclear, you think Saudi Arabia and the United States would have started the
[03:53:38.200 --> 03:53:41.600]  war against them?
[03:53:41.600 --> 03:53:45.480]  So they make it, well, North Korea wants to do is to get into the business world.
[03:53:45.480 --> 03:53:47.000]  Look what's going on now.
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:52.200]  The United States is doing deals with Vietnam.
[03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:58.000]  Aircraft carriers going there now as we speak to pay a welcoming visit.
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:53:59.000]  Say hello.
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:00.000]  We're friends now.
[03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:06.320]  Member of the Vietnam War, member of the nearly 4 million Vietnamese were killed and
[03:54:06.320 --> 03:54:13.880]  Agent Orange and 58,000 Americans killed in a war based on lies the Gulf of Tonkin
[03:54:13.880 --> 03:54:14.880]  incident never happened.
[03:54:14.880 --> 03:54:22.480]  So it's the bottom line and the bottom line is North Korea does not want war and we don't
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:29.240]  believe it will happen there because if the United States or anybody invades North Korea,
[03:54:29.240 --> 03:54:35.320]  say goodbye to South Korea and Seoul South Korea is only about, you know, 30 miles or
[03:54:35.320 --> 03:54:41.960]  so away from the DMZ and they have in that area about 24 million people.
[03:54:41.960 --> 03:54:43.680]  So kiss it goodbye.
[03:54:43.680 --> 03:54:45.440]  So we don't see the problems happening there.
[03:54:45.440 --> 03:54:48.520]  We see them happening in the Middle East.
[03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:53.520]  So the toilet paper of record, the New York Times and all the others keep selling the
[03:54:53.520 --> 03:55:02.240]  propaganda of what is going on in Syria and blaming it on Russia.
[03:55:02.240 --> 03:55:10.880]  What they don't put in Saudi airstrike kills 15 civilians in northern Yemen.
[03:55:10.880 --> 03:55:17.680]  The Saudis are slaughtering Yemenis basically on a daily basis with weapons supplied by
[03:55:17.680 --> 03:55:22.720]  the United States, intelligence supplied by the United States under Obama, by the way.
[03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:26.760]  I'll never forget the day the war began.
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:33.480]  The Saudi ambassador out of Washington, DC announced that they were going to war against
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:34.480]  Yemen.
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:39.760]  We've got to get rid of them Houthis, I tell you, because the Iranians are supporting them.
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:45.120]  No truth about that in proof, just as though there's no proof that Russia's hacked into
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:49.480]  our elections.
[03:55:49.480 --> 03:55:57.040]  So that's where we are and that's where we're at.
[03:55:57.040 --> 03:56:06.440]  So the Houthis have been there for over 1,000 years and Yemen was divided in 1990s and they
[03:56:06.440 --> 03:56:11.440]  don't want to be under control of corrupt government, but the United States is also supplying
[03:56:11.440 --> 03:56:16.640]  the military, the intelligence and the equipment to kill those people.
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:22.360]  We're very concerned about what's going on in the Middle East because if the Middle East
[03:56:22.360 --> 03:56:25.680]  goes down, the markets will go down.
[03:56:25.680 --> 03:56:33.120]  You'll see oil prices spiked to $100 a barrel, going back to the debt levels I'm talking
[03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:36.720]  about with consumers, they stretched their ready.
[03:56:36.720 --> 03:56:42.780]  You saw the GDP numbers came out, they brought them down a little bit.
[03:56:42.780 --> 03:56:48.640]  So the consumer can't take a big a hit and it's not only the American consumer, there's
[03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:52.320]  a lot of problems going on over there in China too.
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:59.800]  And now with giving their head of that country over there a supreme commander for life, you
[03:56:59.800 --> 03:57:01.440]  know what's going on.
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:07.640]  Today's greatest fear isn't the United States, it's his own people and 1.3 billion of them.
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:14.320]  They have rights and demonstrations continually over wages and inequality and now the new numbers
[03:57:14.320 --> 03:57:16.320]  just came out.
[03:57:16.320 --> 03:57:44.000]  Not like GDP is sinking back into me.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:50.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[03:57:50.000 --> 03:57:51.600]  probiotic.
[03:57:51.600 --> 03:57:58.320]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[03:57:58.320 --> 03:58:06.000]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:10.960]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
