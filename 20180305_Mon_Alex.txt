[00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:16.261]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:42.351]  Well this morning, President Trump took to Twitter and says, Why did the Obama administration start an investigation into the Trump campaign long before the election in November, wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win unprecedented bigger than Watergate, plus Obama did nothing about Russian meddling?
[00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:52.015]  Yet here is Robert Mueller continuing his investigation into Trump and collusion, moving on from Russia to Saudi Arabia.
[00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:53.556]  Here's Alex Jones breaking it down.
[00:00:55.151 --> 00:01:03.115]  We could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudi side in this dispute.
[00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:07.457]  They're 80% of Islam, Mecca's based there, they run the whole thing, they're running it.
[00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:13.160]  So you go to who is in charge to stop it.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.822]  Robert Mueller has moved on from Russiagate.
[00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:21.430]  To now investigating Saudi influence and Chinese influence.
[00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.073]  And I'm going to play the part about Saudi influence.
[00:01:23.073 --> 00:01:26.197]  And they go, and Trump's under criminal investigation.
[00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:27.579]  I thought it was about Russians.
[00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.084]  Why did Trump go to Saudi Arabia instead of Qatar or the UAE?
[00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:35.968]  Because Saudi Arabia runs the whole Middle East except for Iran.
[00:01:35.968 --> 00:01:38.891]  It runs 80% of Islam, the Sunnis.
[00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.733]  They were the ones funding ISIS and funding the Democrats.
[00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:46.657]  They arrested thousands of the ruling class who were funding the deep state here.
[00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:51.141]  Trump went there to cut the funding off, short of having a war with Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:59.949]  And the king was so blown away with the president there knowing everything, of his briefings with General Flynn and other generals that sent Flynn, whose names I'm not supposed to say.
[00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:04.937]  Some of the former heads of the, and presidents and advisors.
[00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:08.763]  I'm just letting the deep state know I know all of it.
[00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:11.848]  That was brought, and then ISIS crumbled!
[00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:14.878]  And it helped Russia defeat ISIS in the U.S.
[00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:15.338]  military.
[00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:16.119]  That's how you do it.
[00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:21.242]  Why have a war if you can go to the Saudi king and go, I know you're threatened by internal groups using ISIS to control you.
[00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:23.563]  The Saudis, some of them don't like this either.
[00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:26.405]  They want to just, you know, be successful and not be radical Islam.
[00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.266]  Now they're reforming.
[00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.166]  Women can drive cars.
[00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.247]  Women can have jobs.
[00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:31.308]  Hijabs may come off.
[00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:34.190]  Trump went and said, you know, I can overthrow you right now.
[00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:36.436]  Stop it!
[00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:38.279]  And they made a deal!
[00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.122]  That isn't spun into being anti-American!
[00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:42.864]  You know we're Saudi agents?
[00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.348]  We're all, we're anyone's agents but us.
[00:02:51.275 --> 00:03:07.781]  The businessman George Nader, the Times reports, was a frequent visitor to the Trump White House in 2017, advised top Trump aides on Middle East policy ahead of the president's visit to Saudi Arabia last year, and Nader has been a sort of advisor to one of the leaders of the UAE.
[00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:16.425]  Now the special counsel is interviewing witnesses about Emirati influence and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner's family business ties to the Middle East.
[00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.906]  Like if you wanted to end World War II before it started, you'd go to Hitler.
[00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.402]  Owen, this is Twilight Zone now.
[00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.162]  Well, think about it.
[00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:26.263]  Just like Russia, who was it that was- No, no, no.
[00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:27.023]  It was never Russia.
[00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:28.043]  It was Saudi collusion.
[00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:30.344]  But it was- No, we're gonna arrest Trump for Saudi collusion.
[00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.505]  But who actually colluded with the Saudis?
[00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:33.345]  Okay, you're- Hillary.
[00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:33.985]  Exactly.
[00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:37.886]  So they take everything that Hillary- He was there cutting off their funding.
[00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:41.788]  So does this, once again, though, but does this show, I mean, what does this show about Mueller?
[00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.708]  Does this show that Mueller is covering for Hillary?
[00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.529]  I mean, what, because that is just so weird.
[00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.749]  I mean, why all of a sudden is Mueller looking into Saudi Arabia?
[00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:48.710]  Like, what's going on with that?
[00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.211]  Why did he go to Saudi Arabia?
[00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:54.332]  It's only the most powerful country in the Middle East, not Israel.
[00:03:54.332 --> 00:03:57.254]  Israel has nukes, but financially, Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:58.534]  Here's another incredible angle.
[00:03:58.534 --> 00:03:59.795]  This wasn't even news.
[00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:02.356]  People have been colluding with Russia and Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.777]  Well, they call me.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.978]  The president, under the Constitution, can make any deal he wants.
[00:04:06.978 --> 00:04:09.400]  Then if you want to impeach him, that's fine, but he has that power.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.240]  I can imagine what he's going through behind the scenes.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.961]  I can just imagine.
[00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.864]  There's evidence of Russian collusion with Hillary.
[00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:17.025]  Well, we know that.
[00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:18.226]  It's confirmed.
[00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:27.354]  Mueller and Comey separately ordered stand-downs when she was Secretary of State under Obama and when she was co-president back in the 90s of Bill Clinton.
[00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:33.259]  These witnesses have already left the department, which means the Inspector General does not have jurisdiction.
[00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:39.264]  And there are other agencies, like the State Department, where Michael Horowitz at DOJ has no jurisdiction whatsoever.
[00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:50.214]  Maria, over the weekend, I've counted up almost two dozen witnesses that the Inspector General would not have access to were he alone conducting this investigation.
[00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:59.517]  I think we're trending perhaps towards another special counsel because of this unique fact pattern and the fact that there are witnesses outside the region.
[00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:01.736]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:11.879]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:20.402]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:20.402 --> 00:05:29.185]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:50.863]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:53.544]  It is amazing!
[00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:58.506]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:06:05.663 --> 00:06:07.586]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:14.438]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:17.563]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:36.324]  Fire from all cylinders!
[00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:36.865]  Fire!
[00:06:36.865 --> 00:06:37.945]  Blast away!
[00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:39.245]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:40.625]  Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:43.706]  We're going to be hearing from Alex at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:48.227]  Stacks of news coming in, reports coming in, specials breaking.
[00:06:48.227 --> 00:06:55.329]  A huge, huge interview with Ted Nugent that InfoWars is going to have the exclusive on here soon.
[00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:56.429]  We've got some clips of that.
[00:06:58.325 --> 00:07:10.729]  But, I'm not sure what the biggest news is right now, because you've got the tech left trying to censor free speech, censor conservatives.
[00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:18.331]  On top of that now, you have conservatives being doxxed by, we can only estimate what is the radical left.
[00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:26.094]  Michael Savage has all of his secret homes, quote unquote, visited by political operatives in the last three days.
[00:07:26.094 --> 00:07:27.294]  How did they get that information?
[00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:37.538]  You had the Huffington Post dox a Florida teacher who has a podcast that she's just, you know, a conservative free thinker.
[00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:38.418]  I went and I listened to it.
[00:07:38.418 --> 00:07:39.980]  Very libertarian ideas.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.745]  But she's a white nationalist, so the HuffPost doxes her, and now her job is probably in jeopardy.
[00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.873]  And then we've got all these video clips that we're going to play today.
[00:07:48.873 --> 00:07:56.737]  Whenever Infowars goes out in the streets, whether it's myself or Jake Lloyd or Millie Weaver, we get spit at, we get assaulted, we get shoved.
[00:07:56.737 --> 00:08:02.560]  There's this one weird tactic that the left does where they just like come up to you and they kind of just like shove their butt into you.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.900]  I don't know.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.901]  It's really weird.
[00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:04.881]  And so this is what we deal with.
[00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.423]  But this is why they're trying to censor our channel.
[00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:14.046]  So you've got that huge story, the censorship, attacking free speech, attacking the Second Amendment.
[00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:25.345]  But then you've got President Trump this morning tweeting out about the Obama administration's illegal spying, saying it's bigger than Watergate.
[00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:27.605]  Now, this is true.
[00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:28.646]  It is bigger than Watergate.
[00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:29.766]  We've got all the evidence.
[00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:31.846]  We know who colluded with Russia.
[00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:45.289]  And so now Mueller is taking his investigation into a different direction, and looking at Saudi Arabia, looking in that direction, and there's nothing there except more Hillary crimes to cover up.
[00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:57.229]  So you see this from President Trump, and his base scratches their heads and says, well, why aren't we doing something?
[00:08:57.229 --> 00:08:58.589]  Why aren't people being arrested?
[00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:06.311]  Why isn't Obama being hauled in front of a committee for a hearing right now?
[00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:07.371]  Why isn't that going on?
[00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:11.792]  Why aren't people hauling in these FISA judges, asking them questions?
[00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:15.993]  Did they try to hide the fact this was opposition research paid for by Hillary Clinton?
[00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:20.160]  Think about it.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.624]  The left gets to start violence at Trump rallies.
[00:09:25.624 --> 00:09:27.525]  They get caught by Project Veritas.
[00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.546]  Bob Kramer gets fired.
[00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:31.088]  Aaron Black gets exposed.
[00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:40.315]  The left gets to censor you on social media, whether it be Facebook or YouTube or Twitter or Google, rigging up their algorithms.
[00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:46.260]  The left gets to collude with Russia to make up opposition research
[00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:51.248]  That's then used to slander and libel President Trump.
[00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:56.892]  And this is all being done by the political left right now.
[00:09:56.892 --> 00:10:05.757]  But a conservative is a Nazi or a white nationalist if they want a border.
[00:10:05.757 --> 00:10:06.738]  This is madness.
[00:10:06.738 --> 00:10:07.698]  This is chaos.
[00:10:07.698 --> 00:10:08.539]  This is 1984.
[00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:11.300]  This is mental illness is what it is.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.482]  I mean, you want to talk about mental illness,
[00:10:15.063 --> 00:10:17.625]  You've got leading stories.
[00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:26.912]  If feces on the streets of San Francisco isn't enough for you, you go over to the East Coast in New York City, and there's going to be some pervert on the subway jacking off.
[00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:32.936]  So that's a story now out of New York, while you've got piles of feces in San Francisco.
[00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:36.039]  Democrat-run cities.
[00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:39.181]  It's mental illness.
[00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.703]  And it just all happens to be on the political left right now.
[00:10:44.818 --> 00:10:56.705]  So, YouTube has... We've gone from one strike, to two strikes, to three strikes, to two strikes, to one strike, basically in the last 24 or 48 hours.
[00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:58.646]  Drudge is still covering it.
[00:10:58.646 --> 00:11:01.928]  YouTube hits InfoWars with third strike, his fight goes nuclear.
[00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:07.852]  Links to our story at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:09.533]  Then you've got Dicks.
[00:11:10.655 --> 00:11:15.218]  Is now purging pro-gun patriotic merchandise.
[00:11:15.218 --> 00:11:24.123]  So I guess, I guess if you want to, you know, buy a t-shirt that has a American flag on it, you know, don't go to Dick's because that's patriotic merchandise.
[00:11:24.123 --> 00:11:25.964]  You can't, you can't have that.
[00:11:25.964 --> 00:11:32.368]  Or I don't know, maybe there's like a flag t-shirt with like a Moan Labe or like a rifle on it or something.
[00:11:32.368 --> 00:11:33.548]  Nope, you can't do that either.
[00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:34.529]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:43.444]  Like I said earlier, you've got a Florida teacher accused of having a white nationalist podcast.
[00:11:43.444 --> 00:11:45.105]  It's just a conservative podcast.
[00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:48.368]  She gets doxed by the Huffington Post.
[00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:52.771]  The Huffing Puffington Post over there doxes a Florida teacher for having a conservative podcast.
[00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:56.874]  Because, you know, you're not allowed to have a free speech if you're a conservative.
[00:11:56.874 --> 00:11:58.555]  If you're a liberal, if you're a good liberal.
[00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:08.459]  And you are making death threats to conservatives and making death threats to the president and having death threats in your music videos and your plays and everything.
[00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:11.262]  That's just a good liberal.
[00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:17.568]  See, it's a good liberal to have a play called Kill Climate Deniers.
[00:12:17.568 --> 00:12:22.112]  You see, this is the hatred of the left.
[00:12:23.686 --> 00:12:25.707]  The left is honestly a death cult.
[00:12:25.707 --> 00:12:28.047]  That's not just rhetoric.
[00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:32.829]  There's a reason why they pretend to kill Donald Trump in their music videos, in their art, in their plays.
[00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:40.452]  There's a reason why they have a play called Kill Climate Deniers.
[00:12:40.452 --> 00:12:41.612]  That's what they want to do.
[00:12:41.612 --> 00:12:43.513]  They want to kill you.
[00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:44.873]  But even this is a misnomer.
[00:12:44.873 --> 00:12:47.074]  See, do you see how they twist things?
[00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:48.614]  This is 1984.
[00:12:48.614 --> 00:12:50.075]  They are the climate deniers.
[00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:53.774]  They are the ones that deny science.
[00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:57.917]  They make up formulas and then say that proves global warming.
[00:12:57.917 --> 00:12:59.679]  There is no science.
[00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:06.645]  From the very beginning, who they dub a climate denier were the ones that said, no, no, no, no, no, this is climate.
[00:13:07.622 --> 00:13:08.843]  This is climate change.
[00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:09.964]  This is what happens.
[00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:13.887]  So we say climate change, they say man-made global warming.
[00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:25.095]  Now you've got record snowfall, record cold temperatures, nor'easters everywhere, and so they have to take a step back from saying man-made global warming because that's obviously fake news.
[00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:26.496]  Now they look like idiots on that.
[00:13:26.496 --> 00:13:28.417]  They get exposed rigging the temperatures.
[00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:29.238]  So now they just say,
[00:13:29.998 --> 00:13:32.179]  Man-made climate change.
[00:13:32.179 --> 00:13:35.860]  And if you don't think it's man-made, then you're a climate denier.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.882]  And if you are a climate denier, well, then we have to kill you!
[00:13:40.882 --> 00:13:41.743]  And it doesn't stop there.
[00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:43.683]  They're going to want to kill you if you're a Christian.
[00:13:43.683 --> 00:13:46.004]  They're going to kill you if you're a nationalist, a conservative.
[00:13:46.004 --> 00:13:47.165]  I mean, this is what it's all about.
[00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.842]  That's why they want us to censor everything.
[00:13:49.842 --> 00:13:54.044]  They say they're about free speech and then they censor everything that opposes their views.
[00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:57.026]  They say that they're for life and love and life.
[00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:57.706]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.427]  But then they abort babies.
[00:13:59.427 --> 00:14:01.848]  They hate you.
[00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:04.609]  Another big story that's on Infowars.com from Leo Zagami.
[00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:06.150]  We're reaching out to him right now.
[00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.472]  Italy's 2018 rigged elections.
[00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:15.555]  Italy will most likely remain in the hands of the left-wing Mondialists sponsored and manipulated by George Soros.
[00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:35.257]  Trying to get Leo on to talk about that, not to mention you've got this breaking news where the Vatican is essentially being blackmailed by a escort who's saying that there's at least 40 gay priests in the Vatican and drugs, prostitution, blackmail.
[00:14:35.257 --> 00:14:38.537]  So that's all developing right now as well.
[00:14:38.537 --> 00:14:40.778]  Leo Zagami is the expert to talk about on all that.
[00:14:42.776 --> 00:14:50.402]  Like I said, I'm gonna have the clips, we're gonna have some clips of videos that they want banned, but folks, we are truly all under attack here.
[00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:53.664]  And if they can take down InfoWars, they can take down everybody.
[00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:55.245]  And CNN is behind a lot of this.
[00:14:55.245 --> 00:15:01.070]  And I theorize that CNN is going and flagging our videos, or, you know, the Brian Stelters at CNN have nothing better to do.
[00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:07.872]  So we have just extended the Paul Revere special to the Defeat CNN to Crush InfoWars special.
[00:15:07.872 --> 00:15:10.853]  So the Defeat CNN to Crush InfoWars special.
[00:15:10.853 --> 00:15:20.157]  So if you want to defeat CNN, go to InfoWarsStore.com, take advantage of our huge specials, free shipping storewide, free shipping storewide, and then 50% off

[00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:52.999]  Alright, on the other side, we're going to go to some of these viral videos on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:55.060]  This is the reason why they want us banned.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.921]  Nobody else will do what we do.
[00:15:59.738 --> 00:16:00.538]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:02.359]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:04.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[00:16:09.122 --> 00:16:13.624]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.923]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:39.626]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:16:39.626 --> 00:16:44.829]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.770]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.152]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:16:49.152 --> 00:16:50.112]  See guidelines.
[00:16:50.112 --> 00:16:53.394]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:55.335]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.

[00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.921]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:06.245]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:06.245 --> 00:17:07.827]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:16.194]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:23.861]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:26.143]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:17:26.143 --> 00:17:30.526]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:09.315]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:17.721]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:22.604]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:29.009]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:36.556]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.556 --> 00:18:38.458]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:43.583]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:47.927]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:48.047 --> 00:18:51.429]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[00:18:57.732 --> 00:18:59.433]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:19:01.311 --> 00:19:02.792]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:04.354]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:04.814]  Go ahead.
[00:19:04.814 --> 00:19:05.555]  Yes.
[00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:06.415]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:06.415 --> 00:19:13.021]  First, I just want to mention if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:17.345]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:19.226]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:26.192]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:19:26.192 --> 00:19:29.055]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:33.237]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:19:33.237 --> 00:19:34.918]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:43.003]  It's people like you that didn't fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:43.003 --> 00:19:49.127]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:49.127 --> 00:19:54.690]  It is our highest reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.752]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:11.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:12.684]  Take.
[00:20:24.827 --> 00:20:26.769]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:28.370]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex today.
[00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.573]  We're going to be hearing from Alex at the bottom of the hour.
[00:20:31.573 --> 00:20:34.375]  He's got some breaking news to cover.
[00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:47.606]  Now, what I want to do in this segment and the next is to play some of the videos that we feature on the Alex Jones Channel here that you're just not going to get anywhere else.
[00:20:47.606 --> 00:20:49.928]  We go out on the street and
[00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:58.769]  We offer the Trump protesters, the liberals, the protesters, the women marchers, a platform.
[00:20:58.769 --> 00:21:02.392]  And we give them a microphone and we say, hey, what's on your mind?
[00:21:02.392 --> 00:21:03.852]  Why are you out here protesting?
[00:21:03.852 --> 00:21:05.133]  What do you think about this issue?
[00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:05.994]  What do you think about this?
[00:21:07.296 --> 00:21:09.958]  And we experience pretty much the same thing every time.
[00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:18.223]  Either they're completely clueless, they're ignorant, they have no idea what they're doing there, or they're hateful, they're violent, and they're disgusting.
[00:21:18.223 --> 00:21:32.913]  So this first video that we're going to go to, Jake Lloyd goes to UT to file a man on the street, where I'm convinced now, it used to be we could go out and actually do a report and not just be harassed the whole time.
[00:21:32.913 --> 00:21:35.275]  We've kind of passed that threshold now.
[00:21:35.275 --> 00:21:37.016]  And I think that UT has like
[00:21:37.816 --> 00:22:03.795]  Lookouts or something and whenever we go to UT's campus now they have like an email chain or something and they and they inform people and then they go out and they seek us out so that they can try to disrupt our videos but that's fine because please it's great content so please please let let the crazy liberals know when we go to UT and please come come embarrass yourself so that we can get videos like this so these are the types of videos that they want
[00:22:04.775 --> 00:22:07.036]  Oh my gosh, why are you wearing a mask?
[00:22:07.036 --> 00:22:08.317]  Why are you wearing a mask?
[00:22:08.317 --> 00:22:09.958]  You know who wears masks?
[00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:10.478]  Criminals wear masks.
[00:22:10.478 --> 00:22:12.939]  People about ready to commit a crime, that's who wears masks.
[00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:13.339]  That's right.
[00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:13.459]  Okay.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.663]  The Democrat Party is the party of criminals.
[00:22:33.663 --> 00:22:37.627]  Still being run by Hillary Clinton, one of the biggest of all time.
[00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:41.791]  You're blocking the wrong side of the phone there.
[00:22:41.791 --> 00:22:43.853]  Let's go guys.
[00:22:43.853 --> 00:22:44.454]  Let's go.
[00:22:44.454 --> 00:22:45.415]  So here's Jake Lloyd.
[00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:47.657]  He can't even film this or report.
[00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:48.938]  His cameraman is getting shoved.
[00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.852]  Oh yeah, then they run away.
[00:22:54.852 --> 00:22:56.073]  Please stop touching us.
[00:22:56.073 --> 00:22:57.273]  Can you not though?
[00:22:57.273 --> 00:22:58.114]  This is what they do.
[00:22:58.114 --> 00:23:05.837]  They get up in your face, and they either rub their body on you like some weird fetish, or they shove their sign in your face, and then you fight back.
[00:23:05.837 --> 00:23:06.577]  You're like, hey, get off me.
[00:23:06.577 --> 00:23:08.178]  And they're like, whoa, what are you doing?
[00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:08.658]  You're out of control.
[00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:10.779]  Do you know how much losers like to assault people?
[00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:15.361]  OK, I understand, but this is also a school environment and from no one.
[00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:19.402]  Yeah, we're trying to engage in political discourse, and we have people like this guy coming up and assaulting people.
[00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:19.942]  School environment.
[00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:20.783]  You're not allowed to have free speech.
[00:23:21.536 --> 00:23:22.457]  School environment.
[00:23:22.457 --> 00:23:23.058]  No free speech here.
[00:23:23.058 --> 00:23:23.498]  School environment.
[00:23:23.498 --> 00:23:24.219]  That's a lie.
[00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:25.040]  School environment.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.460]  I shoved him.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.421]  He grabbed the f***ing wire.
[00:23:26.421 --> 00:23:27.482]  He tried to pull it out of my hand.
[00:23:27.482 --> 00:23:27.762]  Oh, yeah.
[00:23:27.762 --> 00:23:28.483]  I shoved him off.
[00:23:28.483 --> 00:23:31.586]  Yeah, that's the tactic they always try to do is they rip our wires.
[00:23:31.586 --> 00:23:32.688]  We started it, but that's fine.
[00:23:32.688 --> 00:23:34.850]  Like the chicken man.
[00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:35.631]  Oh, yeah.
[00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:35.911]  Yeah.
[00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:39.835]  So, anyways, until the police can get here, we're going to describe this.
[00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:43.298]  We're going to keep trying to talk to people and see if anybody wants to talk to us.
[00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:43.338]  Oh.
[00:23:46.724 --> 00:23:47.365]  Oh, okay.
[00:23:47.365 --> 00:23:49.106]  I just heard them plug Supermeal Vitality.
[00:23:49.106 --> 00:23:50.346]  We were having so much fun.
[00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.828]  50% off right now.
[00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:59.492]  We were actually like kind of had like a little cute thing going on here and then people want to come up and have an issue.
[00:23:59.492 --> 00:24:02.434]  So, Jake Lloyd back again for Infowars.com.
[00:24:02.434 --> 00:24:04.235]  We had to take a little break there for just a moment.
[00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:04.795]  So there you go.
[00:24:04.795 --> 00:24:05.916]  So there's one example.
[00:24:05.916 --> 00:24:07.317]  Again, Jake just goes out.
[00:24:07.317 --> 00:24:13.461]  He's trying to shoot a man on the street saying, hey, I think he was trying to talk about gun control in this one or Trump or something.
[00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:13.841]  I don't remember.
[00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:19.819]  And they just show up, they shove their signs, and then... You know what?
[00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:21.819]  We might have to pull this video.
[00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:27.801]  If you've ever heard of Fleckus Talks, all of these protesters, he asks them if they vote, none of them even vote.
[00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:28.882]  They don't even vote!
[00:24:28.882 --> 00:24:32.563]  I guarantee you those people out there carrying those signs don't even vote.
[00:24:32.563 --> 00:24:35.224]  They probably don't even know anything about those candidates.
[00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:37.404]  But regardless, that's what happens.
[00:24:37.404 --> 00:24:42.086]  Jake Lord just goes out, and because he has an Infowars Mike flag, he's the bad guy.
[00:24:44.229 --> 00:24:45.890]  Jake Lloyd, oh!
[00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.011]  It's an InfoWars reporter!
[00:24:47.011 --> 00:24:48.092]  Get him!
[00:24:48.092 --> 00:24:48.313]  Get him!
[00:24:48.313 --> 00:24:50.414]  Go shove a sign in his face!
[00:24:50.414 --> 00:24:51.355]  We're for free speech!
[00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:53.377]  Go stop his right to free speech!
[00:24:53.377 --> 00:24:55.419]  We're loving and tolerant!
[00:24:55.419 --> 00:24:57.761]  Let's go like weird fetishly rub our butt on him!
[00:24:57.761 --> 00:24:59.582]  I'm telling you, it's the weirdest thing.
[00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:00.903]  Ask anybody who goes to these things.
[00:25:00.903 --> 00:25:02.044]  They all do the same thing.
[00:25:03.797 --> 00:25:09.939]  There was another, well this was a march for Trump in Austin, Texas this weekend that I attended.
[00:25:09.939 --> 00:25:13.900]  And there were, again, some radical commies that showed up to try to disrupt things.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.001]  Here's a video of one of them getting arrested.
[00:25:16.001 --> 00:25:18.382]  Look at this lady.
[00:25:18.382 --> 00:25:18.722]  No, no, no.
[00:25:18.722 --> 00:25:19.462]  You know this lady.
[00:25:19.462 --> 00:25:19.922]  You know her.
[00:25:19.922 --> 00:25:20.242]  You know her.
[00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:21.603]  Oh my gosh, yes!
[00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:23.443]  How are you today, ma'am?
[00:25:23.443 --> 00:25:24.024]  Oh my gosh.
[00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:24.764]  Well, you have a sign.
[00:25:24.764 --> 00:25:26.544]  Why don't you execute your free speech?
[00:25:26.544 --> 00:25:27.405]  I feel bad for that woman.
[00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:28.025]  Hey, how's your day been?
[00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:31.343]  You may recognize her from other viral videos.
[00:25:31.343 --> 00:25:33.005]  Hey, how's your day been?
[00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:34.126]  How's your pirate radio show?
[00:25:34.126 --> 00:25:34.846]  This is the guy!
[00:25:34.846 --> 00:25:36.107]  Hey, were you the one that took it down?
[00:25:36.107 --> 00:25:39.170]  Did you destroy that tower?
[00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.631]  Wait, was that you?
[00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:42.092]  Tower wasn't destroyed, dude.
[00:25:42.092 --> 00:25:43.313]  Oh, okay.
[00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:45.255]  Here's some other... That guy got in a fight earlier, he got his butt kicked.
[00:25:45.255 --> 00:25:47.136]  Did you guys hear that protest in Trump today?
[00:25:47.136 --> 00:25:49.378]  Dwight has glass on, he had a huge black eye.
[00:25:49.378 --> 00:25:50.739]  Alt, right, delete.
[00:25:50.739 --> 00:25:51.720]  Alright.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.400]  Don't wanna talk.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.222]  I think that's pretty much it, though.
[00:25:55.103 --> 00:25:56.303]  Here, hold on.
[00:25:56.303 --> 00:25:57.844]  That lady was swinging them out.
[00:25:57.844 --> 00:25:58.924]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:00.885]  We've got another Trump protester here.
[00:26:00.885 --> 00:26:02.205]  Here, sir, sir, Trump protester.
[00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:04.366]  Look at all the Trump protesters on the street.
[00:26:04.366 --> 00:26:05.407]  We got a Trump protester.
[00:26:05.407 --> 00:26:05.967]  Anything, sir?
[00:26:05.967 --> 00:26:06.307]  Anything?
[00:26:06.307 --> 00:26:07.027]  No?
[00:26:07.027 --> 00:26:08.088]  Trump protester, sir.
[00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:09.108]  No, no, nothing.
[00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:12.009]  No, nothing from the Trump protesters.
[00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:14.710]  I thought the Trump protesters would want to talk.
[00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.930]  They never do.
[00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.071]  That's funny.
[00:26:17.071 --> 00:26:19.251]  That's funny.
[00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:20.352]  All right.
[00:26:20.352 --> 00:26:21.932]  Let's speed up the pace here.
[00:26:21.932 --> 00:26:22.833]  I didn't follow that.
[00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:22.913]  Huh?
[00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:25.588]  Well, that's true.
[00:26:25.588 --> 00:26:28.069]  They're right in front of you.
[00:26:28.069 --> 00:26:29.390]  They're right over there.
[00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.670]  Okay, okay.
[00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.653]  We got some communist Antifa protesters here.
[00:26:32.653 --> 00:26:34.814]  We saw that guy back there.
[00:26:34.814 --> 00:26:37.096]  You see the rainbow flag up there?
[00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:38.236]  Rainbow flag?
[00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:39.257]  I see a sign.
[00:26:39.257 --> 00:26:40.278]  Oh, there they are.
[00:26:40.278 --> 00:26:41.138]  Okay.
[00:26:41.138 --> 00:26:41.639]  Oh, wow.
[00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:43.200]  We've got some wild ones.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.940]  Yeah.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.521]  Oh, wow.
[00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:46.482]  Yeah, they all had their faces covered, as usual.
[00:26:46.482 --> 00:26:47.343]  Okay, let's check this out.
[00:26:47.343 --> 00:26:52.146]  Alright, so here's the police here maintaining a line between the protesters and the marchers.
[00:26:52.146 --> 00:26:53.387]  Did you see those Trump protesters in the street, though?
[00:26:55.769 --> 00:26:58.630]  Hey, this is what you call keep Austin weird.
[00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.731]  No, no.
[00:27:00.731 --> 00:27:04.312]  This is what you call keep Austin weird right here.
[00:27:04.312 --> 00:27:06.213]  I can't believe I'm reliving this right now.
[00:27:06.213 --> 00:27:09.354]  This is like weird for me.
[00:27:09.354 --> 00:27:15.316]  Look at this, this is what I had to deal with.
[00:27:15.316 --> 00:27:18.397]  One's getting arrested here, come here, come here, come here.
[00:27:18.397 --> 00:27:20.018]  We got a protester getting arrested now.
[00:27:21.081 --> 00:27:22.702]  See if you can get a shot of this.
[00:27:22.702 --> 00:27:24.762]  Oh, we're getting blocked here, we're getting blocked here.
[00:27:24.762 --> 00:27:33.025]  Yeah, yeah, I'm on you, I'm on you.
[00:27:33.025 --> 00:27:38.427]  I do believe that this was the only arrest from the march.
[00:27:38.427 --> 00:27:39.127]  There he is.
[00:27:39.127 --> 00:27:40.568]  He's got his face covered.
[00:27:40.568 --> 00:27:41.668]  Face covered, helmet on.
[00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:44.845]  Wearing all black.
[00:27:44.845 --> 00:27:48.067]  Black Lives Matter shirt, I think.
[00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:49.227]  What does it all race?
[00:27:49.227 --> 00:27:50.808]  What does his shirt say?
[00:27:50.808 --> 00:27:52.629]  Nah, he doesn't know.
[00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:54.969]  If you've got a whole paragraph on the front of your shirt, good luck.
[00:27:54.969 --> 00:27:56.250]  Alright, so there's an example of some of the stuff.
[00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:20.524]  Oh my gosh, if you follow our videos, and we're going to play more of these later, we're actually about to be joined by Leo Zegami here, coming up in the next segment for half an hour to talk about his newest article on the Italian elections, as well as the blackmail, supposedly, that's being sent to the Vatican right now.
[00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:25.288]  But we're going to have more of those videos, but there's this, I'm telling you, actually having to watch that and relive it,
[00:28:26.254 --> 00:28:27.235]  It's like eerie, man.
[00:28:27.235 --> 00:28:31.537]  I mean, those people are really just sad.
[00:28:31.537 --> 00:28:32.217]  The one woman.
[00:28:32.217 --> 00:28:33.958]  You'll recognize the one woman.
[00:28:33.958 --> 00:28:35.019]  She's been in a viral video.
[00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:36.480]  She's like totally soul-sucked.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.161]  You feel bad for her.
[00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:42.383]  And then you've got this other woman, the famous woman who makes fart noises with her mouth.
[00:28:42.383 --> 00:28:44.064]  She was back out on Saturday.
[00:28:44.064 --> 00:28:47.826]  She was still making fart noises with her mouth, but she added the clown costume this time.
[00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:51.669]  You see, she wasn't crazy enough with just making the fart noises.
[00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:53.710]  Now she wants to be a clown that makes fart noises.
[00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.892]  I mean, they're really, they're really ratcheting it up.
[00:28:55.892 --> 00:28:57.894]  When they go high, I mean, they go high, baby.
[00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.942]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:29:01.942 --> 00:29:03.043]  Get back to nature.

[00:29:29.628 --> 00:29:30.829]  Hear that?
[00:29:30.829 --> 00:29:36.213]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:29:36.213 --> 00:29:39.116]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[00:29:57.311 --> 00:29:58.472]  Faketv.com
[00:30:00.387 --> 00:30:08.951]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:13.513]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:30:13.513 --> 00:30:16.614]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:19.756]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:30:21.283 --> 00:30:34.108]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:30:34.108 --> 00:30:49.173]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[00:32:56.228 --> 00:32:57.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.122 --> 00:33:22.571]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[00:33:22.571 --> 00:33:24.934]  It's Owen Schreier.
[00:33:24.934 --> 00:33:27.537]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.773 --> 00:33:32.694]  We'll be hearing from Alex in the next segment.
[00:33:32.694 --> 00:33:35.916]  In this segment, though, I'm joined by Leo Zagami.
[00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:42.498]  He has just published the article on Infowars.com, Italy's 2018 rigged elections.
[00:33:42.498 --> 00:33:45.160]  He's going to be breaking this down with us right now.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.521]  Leo, thank you so much for joining us on short notice today.
[00:33:48.521 --> 00:33:49.321]  Hello, everybody.
[00:33:49.321 --> 00:33:52.883]  It's actually my birthday, so I guess... Oh, well, happy birthday!
[00:33:54.114 --> 00:33:56.355]  A pleasant surprise on both sides.
[00:33:56.355 --> 00:34:04.158]  And I hope to give you the latest information on what apparently is a rigged election from the start.
[00:34:04.158 --> 00:34:14.403]  I mean, they worked for over a year on placing this new voting system called Rosatellum.
[00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:21.446]  And basically they have done something that is only facilitating the possibility to maintain the same positions.
[00:34:22.186 --> 00:34:39.061]  Maybe activating some new alliances in the process, because there is a limit of 40% that is required to each party or coalition for having the governability of Italy and establishing a new government.
[00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:50.095]  As 40% in a proportional system with many parties is almost impossible, these elections are basically rigged.
[00:34:50.095 --> 00:34:57.824]  And they have also, part of this electoral system has been built in a way that you're not really
[00:34:58.945 --> 00:35:02.907]  And they don't have to necessarily be from the same party.
[00:35:19.894 --> 00:35:36.126]  In fact, in communist Bologna, in left-wing Bologna, an ex-Christian Democrat like Ferdinando Casini, who is the favorite politician of Pope Francis, was re-elected thanks to a left-wing party.
[00:35:36.126 --> 00:35:46.094]  That would be impossible to even imagine 40 or 50 years ago when the Christian Democrats and the Communists were fighting against each other.
[00:35:46.835 --> 00:36:03.310]  Then we had also the re-election, for example, of an old Berlusconi politician called Lorenzini, who was then minister for Matteo Renzi, and she was also re-elected by rigging the system in Modena.
[00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:11.057]  So we have also in Milan, for example, a whole area of Milan,
[00:36:11.497 --> 00:36:11.918]  We're good.
[00:36:30.415 --> 00:36:48.181]  Revolutionaries of these elections, the Five Star Movement, who have become the first party in Italy with 30% of the votes, have actually already chosen a minister for their economy who works for the open democracy and for the open society of George Soros.
[00:36:48.981 --> 00:37:04.996]  So they might now force a sort of coalition between all the factions that are under George Soros in the left wing and come up with probably another
[00:37:06.137 --> 00:37:09.079]  Government by the same people, more or less.
[00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:17.723]  There is even the possibility that the present Prime Minister, who is Paolo Gentiloni, will stay in his place for a second mandate.
[00:37:17.723 --> 00:37:32.550]  So these elections, which of course have seen a rise in the populist vote, because the Northern League has risen so high in the coalition that was led by Berlusconi,
[00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:40.425]  Basically, Berlusconi now is not anymore the leader of this coalition, but is Matteo Salvini.
[00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:51.594]  And Matteo Salvini has just gone a few minutes ago to visit Silvio Berlusconi in his villa, apparently staying only for a little while.
[00:37:52.635 --> 00:38:09.513]  And this is a sign of a very tense situation, because behind the scenes, like I wrote also in a recent article, Matteo Sardini, of course, is a typical far-right populist that is working for the sovereignty of Italy.
[00:38:10.113 --> 00:38:15.575]  One said Berlusconi behind the scenes might have struck a secret deal with Matteo Renzi.
[00:38:15.575 --> 00:38:30.579]  However, now the Democrat leader in Italy, which is Matteo Renzi, which is of course a tool of the Clinton Foundation, of George Soros, he is about to be kicked out of his own party.
[00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:35.280]  But they have been waiting now for his resignation for hours.
[00:38:36.244 --> 00:38:46.928]  And this resignation, of course, has been delayed and delayed longer and longer times for giving this resignation, which, of course, is inevitable.
[00:38:46.928 --> 00:38:58.673]  But because behind the scenes, apparently, there is the possibility that the Five Star Movement strikes a deal with the left wing of George Soros and part of the Democrat Party.
[00:38:59.413 --> 00:39:17.409]  And in that case they will have the majority of the House and they will be able to establish this new government that in any case is ruled by George Soros, who will continue to flood Italy with immigrants, who will continue with these demented policies.
[00:39:17.409 --> 00:39:20.331]  So in the end nothing will really change.
[00:39:20.331 --> 00:39:24.535]  What I think is very sad out of these Italian elections is that the Italians
[00:39:25.135 --> 00:39:29.597]  Well, it seems to me that the Rosatellum system that you're talking about is really just
[00:39:48.214 --> 00:39:48.394]  Yeah.
[00:40:06.525 --> 00:40:18.990]  I'm sure that you've heard about the blackmail scandal that is enveloping the Vatican right now with a male escort who's saying that at least 40 gay priests were sent to the Vatican.
[00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.390]  What can you tell us about this?
[00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.371]  What do you know about this?
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:34.956]  This story is very important because apparently this male escort has saved around 50 screenshots of all his partners in the Catholic Church.
[00:40:34.956 --> 00:40:37.840]  So he has evidence with these screenshots
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.362]  of all the requests that he was getting.
[00:40:41.362 --> 00:40:43.724]  Some of the requests are outrageous.
[00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:54.531]  I mean, a group of monks invited him to their monastery in the middle of a forest so he could be a passive partner to their sexual exploitations.
[00:40:54.531 --> 00:40:56.612]  And he said, well, I hope you're passive.
[00:40:56.612 --> 00:40:57.612]  We are free monks.
[00:40:57.612 --> 00:41:00.674]  We want to invite you for this gay orgy.
[00:41:00.674 --> 00:41:07.539]  And this is only one of the many things that comes out of this scandal involving this male escort.
[00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:26.326]  So, I mean, the situation is very tense because there is a possibility that this male escort might really need a few bodyguards to stay alive, because with the amount of information that he could bring out, he could definitely put in trouble a lot of people.
[00:41:26.326 --> 00:41:36.710]  Here we're not talking only about Catholic priests, but also cardinals, bishops, and the hierarchy of the Vatican, of course, is very scared of all this.
[00:41:37.458 --> 00:41:45.524]  And of course, this is all kind of right on the heels of the number two to the Pope, who is also enveloped in a scandal as well.
[00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:47.285]  I mean, how does the Vatican deal with this?
[00:41:47.285 --> 00:41:49.186]  How is the Vatican dealing with this?
[00:41:49.186 --> 00:41:52.148]  I mean, this is serious stuff, serious allegations.
[00:41:52.148 --> 00:41:53.810]  I'm not hearing about any reform.
[00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.171]  I'm not hearing the Pope address this.
[00:41:56.171 --> 00:41:58.253]  Are they just trying to brush it under the rug?
[00:42:00.234 --> 00:42:01.394]  Absolutely, Owen.
[00:42:01.394 --> 00:42:17.840]  And there is even another scandal that has come out in the last few days regarding a priest who was condemned by the Italian authorities, but the Vatican, since last week, reinstalled him so he could preach Mass, he could celebrate Mass.
[00:42:18.792 --> 00:42:33.155]  So this is really scandalous and of course all this is in the Italian media is being cited, is being put cleverly on the side during these elections which of course are taking the majority of the space.
[00:42:33.155 --> 00:42:37.876]  Even if they are completely rigged and we know that nothing will change.
[00:42:37.876 --> 00:42:40.057]  All right, Leo Zagami, thank you so much for your time.
[00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:45.598]  Again, the story Italy's 2018 rigged elections by Leo Zagami is on Infowars.com right now.
[00:42:46.977 --> 00:42:50.782]  I say the Vatican, I mean, we need serious reformation.
[00:42:50.782 --> 00:42:52.604]  The Pope is a joke.
[00:42:52.604 --> 00:42:56.208]  The halls and the basements and the dwellings of the Vatican need to be investigated.
[00:42:56.208 --> 00:42:59.492]  What kind of secret history does the Vatican know?
[00:42:59.492 --> 00:43:01.835]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:43:01.835 --> 00:43:03.997]  We're really, really proud of it.

[00:45:20.271 --> 00:45:22.391]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:45:22.391 --> 00:45:26.353]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:45:26.353 --> 00:45:27.413]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[00:46:00.555 --> 00:46:05.700]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.464]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:46:10.464 --> 00:46:19.151]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:22.534]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:27.897]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:46:27.897 --> 00:46:35.202]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:46:35.202 --> 00:46:39.104]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:46:39.104 --> 00:46:43.847]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:46:43.847 --> 00:46:47.410]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.572]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:16.513 --> 00:47:18.494]  Many people think, oh, the president was just joking.
[00:47:18.494 --> 00:47:23.696]  I could give you a list of a thousand things where they claim the president was joking afterwards.
[00:47:23.696 --> 00:47:28.658]  And if there was laughter, there was laughter, people made uncomfortable.
[00:47:28.658 --> 00:47:33.160]  But there are statements in the past that Donald Trump has made where he has
[00:47:34.278 --> 00:47:37.700]  He praised Xi for consolidating power.
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:42.604]  China has become more and more autocratic over the past six months to a year.
[00:47:42.604 --> 00:47:46.787]  He's made conscious moves to become more and more autocratic.
[00:47:46.787 --> 00:47:51.310]  You have Donald Trump praising Irwan when he consolidates power.
[00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.151]  Duterte.
[00:47:52.151 --> 00:48:00.416]  Duterte when he goes out and drags extra judicial... This is important though, when Republicans, Gene,
[00:48:01.417 --> 00:48:03.699]  Or just saying it's just a joke?
[00:48:03.699 --> 00:48:13.985]  Or when Republicans ignore the fact that this man is talking about being president for life, if they think that Donald Trump is joking, then they're fools.
[00:48:13.985 --> 00:48:18.849]  Alex Jones here on the road with two really important points I want to make.
[00:48:18.849 --> 00:48:28.235]  In a moment I'll get into CNN's claim, and now MSNBC's claim, via Joe Scarborough, that President Trump wants to be a dictator.
[00:48:29.292 --> 00:48:31.253]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:48:31.253 --> 00:48:57.869]  First off, I just really want to up front thank all the listeners and viewers and supporters and activists and pro-liberty people out there that have taken action the last two weeks while Infowars has been under massive boycotts, massive hack attacks, massive disinformation campaigns, false EEOC complaints filed via Hillary Clinton's former lawyer,
[00:48:58.809 --> 00:49:22.436]  The list goes on and on and because of your steadfastness and your support and standing beside us and standing with us in full wars is moving forward through this unprecedented barrage and attack and are maintaining our current trajectory to expand in the face of the globalists but your support has just come in right at where we needed it so I want to thank you all
[00:49:23.703 --> 00:49:27.206]  I want to thank the local radio stations, the TV stations, everybody.
[00:49:27.206 --> 00:49:34.631]  One area that has expanded under the attack is the number of TV stations and radio stations contacting us to pick up the broadcast.
[00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:48.582]  We have been deluged the last few months, but now it has reached really an amazing deluge with the crew that we've got, two great men working on taking all your calls and signing all the affiliate relations agreements.
[00:49:48.582 --> 00:49:49.703]  I want to make it clear.
[00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:51.144]  For television, we are free to air.
[00:49:51.144 --> 00:49:52.465]  You can play over all the ads.
[00:49:54.138 --> 00:49:55.238]  You name it.
[00:49:55.238 --> 00:49:57.319]  UHF, VHF cable, you name it.
[00:49:57.319 --> 00:49:58.640]  We are here for you.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:05.022]  InfoWars.com forward slash show has links to the affiliate page and the contact information.
[00:50:05.022 --> 00:50:06.422]  Now that's it.
[00:50:06.422 --> 00:50:13.725]  We've had Hillary Clinton's former, not just lawyer, but her former assistant lawyer when he got out of Georgetown and then worked for the State Department.
[00:50:15.427 --> 00:50:36.925]  He is quarterbacking the complete fiction filings that we are completely confident will be disintegrated in court and that we will be totally vindicated and then take action after that because we have to set the precedent that you can't just absolutely, you know, tell unbelievable lies about us and get away with it.
[00:50:36.925 --> 00:50:37.706]  That sets a precedent.
[00:50:38.945 --> 00:50:41.447]  For not just us to be defamed for political purposes, but others.
[00:50:41.447 --> 00:50:44.188]  So again, that's a serious fight coming up and that takes major funds.
[00:50:44.188 --> 00:50:46.230]  So we appreciate all of you supporting us.
[00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:50.832]  We've got the biggest sales ever extended right through this week that we had last week.
[00:50:50.832 --> 00:50:58.377]  The Paul Revere defend free speech, defend the Internet, defend the Second Amendment broadcast.
[00:50:58.377 --> 00:50:59.558]  That's going to extend those sales.
[00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:05.363]  You'll just hear my sweet little daughter back there, 10 months old now.
[00:51:05.363 --> 00:51:07.645]  Didn't she just turn 10 months a few days ago, baby?
[00:51:07.645 --> 00:51:10.689]  So, uh, I don't know if she does, yeah.
[00:51:10.689 --> 00:51:13.472]  So, so we've got all that going- It's today.
[00:51:13.472 --> 00:51:13.972]  It's today, see?
[00:51:13.972 --> 00:51:15.013]  Told you.
[00:51:15.013 --> 00:51:22.962]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, where was I before we had some, my little sweetheart chiming in?
[00:51:22.962 --> 00:51:23.802]  Oh, I was getting into
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:31.201]  We're having these big sales in defense of the Second Amendment, defense of free speech, defense of the Internet.
[00:51:31.201 --> 00:51:33.802]  And you can see how it is going on big time.
[00:51:33.802 --> 00:51:44.584]  And I can't stand the fact that you continue to support us, that you continue to pray for us, that you continue to take action.
[00:51:44.584 --> 00:51:47.385]  That said, let's get to the latest in this info.
[00:51:47.385 --> 00:51:49.225]  Not against us, but against Trump.
[00:51:49.225 --> 00:51:52.086]  Oh, but let me add one other point on that issue.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.041]  It's incredible.
[00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:57.783]  I'm not even going to give these so-called journalists any attention.
[00:51:57.783 --> 00:52:06.812]  But without looking, I saw three different publications last night and this morning.
[00:52:06.812 --> 00:52:08.534]  Three different publications.
[00:52:10.154 --> 00:52:13.876]  That said that I totally made it up.
[00:52:13.876 --> 00:52:16.537]  YouTube isn't trying to bring me down.
[00:52:16.537 --> 00:52:18.558]  Nobody's filing false complaints.
[00:52:18.558 --> 00:52:20.319]  There are no strikes.
[00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.520]  There have been five strikes in 10 days.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.122]  Now, they've removed all but one of them, but three of those would bring us down.
[00:52:26.122 --> 00:52:29.384]  We had three strikes as of Saturday, but the account was still there.
[00:52:29.384 --> 00:52:35.727]  I called some of our sources inside YouTube, and they went and looked at it, and they said, yeah, this is really weird.
[00:52:36.974 --> 00:52:42.438]  There's like some of your strikes have disappeared, but it doesn't even say that they accepted your appeal.
[00:52:42.438 --> 00:52:43.479]  This is very unusual.
[00:52:43.479 --> 00:52:45.981]  There's three strikes sitting here.
[00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:54.568]  Maybe it's under review, but a lot of times it'll just roll over in a few hours, and it hasn't rolled over yet, and then you'll be deleted.
[00:52:54.568 --> 00:52:55.689]  Last night I saw two articles.
[00:52:55.689 --> 00:52:57.931]  This morning I saw another one saying I made it up.
[00:53:00.126 --> 00:53:04.570]  CNN 10 days ago didn't say they were filing complaints to get us taken down.
[00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:09.054]  There weren't thousands of news articles saying that the last 10 days.
[00:53:09.054 --> 00:53:15.900]  There's not CNN going out and trying to stop Neil Strauss from working with me to publish a book on CNN money.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:24.709]  There's not CNN contacting a bunch of so-called sponsors on YouTube that really weren't even sponsors and getting them to pull advertising to create this precedent that I'm collapsing.
[00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:35.732]  None of that happened because a particular BuzzFeed writer says so, and he talked to somebody that hasn't worked at our office in two years!
[00:53:35.732 --> 00:53:37.693]  Now, that's journalism.
[00:53:37.693 --> 00:53:44.294]  We talked to someone that worked there two years ago, and they say YouTube didn't talk to Jones.
[00:53:44.294 --> 00:53:45.775]  That's funny.
[00:53:45.775 --> 00:53:46.535]  That's really, really funny.
[00:53:46.535 --> 00:53:48.995]  That person never had any contact with any of our YouTube accounts.
[00:53:48.995 --> 00:53:49.596]  Had nothing to do with it.
[00:53:49.596 --> 00:53:50.936]  I mean, that is next level.
[00:53:50.936 --> 00:53:54.977]  I saw two other articles just saying, so see, they haven't succeeded in taking us down.
[00:53:56.021 --> 00:53:56.942]  You know, they're fighting hard.
[00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:59.023]  They're all over the news.
[00:53:59.023 --> 00:54:05.106]  And so now they're just saying that it's all made up.
[00:54:05.106 --> 00:54:05.727]  It's all a hoax.
[00:54:05.727 --> 00:54:08.408]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[00:54:08.408 --> 00:54:10.550]  Now, continuing.
[00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:15.252]  They were always saying that President Trump wasn't really running for president.
[00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:16.613]  It was all a stunt.
[00:54:16.613 --> 00:54:19.175]  Well, that's why he's announced he's running for a second term.
[00:54:19.175 --> 00:54:20.075]  Because it's all a stunt.
[00:54:20.075 --> 00:54:20.936]  He never wanted to be president.
[00:54:20.936 --> 00:54:21.316]  Yeah, right.
[00:54:22.336 --> 00:54:23.836]  Alright, finishing this transmission.
[00:54:23.836 --> 00:54:26.017]  I got a call that interrupted me.
[00:54:26.017 --> 00:54:31.438]  The point is, is that they always said that President Trump didn't want to run for president and it was all a big hoax.
[00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:33.999]  Despite all the money he spent, the time, the energy.
[00:54:33.999 --> 00:54:35.659]  They said his wife didn't want to do it.
[00:54:35.659 --> 00:54:37.220]  I've talked to people behind the scenes.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.360]  Trump's been totally committed from the beginning.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.721]  Really believes in what he's doing.
[00:54:40.721 --> 00:54:45.722]  Now that said, remember they all said CNN, you name it, that he never wanted to be president.
[00:54:45.722 --> 00:54:50.243]  Well now he announces 980 something days out that he wants to be president.
[00:54:52.304 --> 00:54:55.106]  And he wants to run for a second term.
[00:54:55.106 --> 00:54:58.868]  And then, he's speaking at Mar-a-Lago a few days ago.
[00:54:58.868 --> 00:55:04.871]  I remember seeing the CNN article about it, but I actually went and looked at some of the other articles about folks that were actually there.
[00:55:04.871 --> 00:55:13.897]  And he was joking about the Chinese president getting rid of term limits and basically becoming a dictator because he's already elected by the Communist Party.
[00:55:13.897 --> 00:55:16.858]  And in other accounts, they said that everybody laughed.
[00:55:16.858 --> 00:55:18.499]  He was telling jokes.
[00:55:18.499 --> 00:55:21.321]  Even the CNN report says he was telling jokes.
[00:55:22.824 --> 00:55:25.327]  But they still acted like it was serious.
[00:55:25.327 --> 00:55:39.922]  Now, people like Scarborough, Mr. Disinformation, who said he never wanted to be president, who said Trump was a fraud, he comes out and says Trump's serious and wants to be a dictator.
[00:55:40.939 --> 00:55:46.402]  Well, if Trump did get rid of term limits, and then he was elected by U.S.
[00:55:46.402 --> 00:55:51.705]  citizens, that would mean we got rid of term limits for the presidency, like we don't have for the Congress.
[00:55:51.705 --> 00:55:53.105]  He wouldn't be a dictator, he'd be elected.
[00:55:53.105 --> 00:55:54.066]  But here's the key.
[00:55:54.066 --> 00:55:59.469]  Trump has said he wants to do it in one term if he could, and fix the country and leave.
[00:55:59.469 --> 00:56:05.532]  Or he'd do it in two, but he'll be 79 years old when he leaves office if he gets a second term.
[00:56:07.173 --> 00:56:07.213]  79.
[00:56:07.213 --> 00:56:09.575]  He got into office at 71.
[00:56:09.575 --> 00:56:11.776]  Okay?
[00:56:11.776 --> 00:56:16.318]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, this is a complete fraud.
[00:56:16.318 --> 00:56:23.683]  He was joking, and that shows how you can't even joke with these people because they spin everything.
[00:56:23.683 --> 00:56:31.567]  Bill Clinton said things would be a lot easier if I was a dictator, just so long as I'm the dictator, and so did Obama, so did a bunch of Bush.
[00:56:31.567 --> 00:56:32.608]  A bunch of them said that.
[00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:42.735]  But with Trump, he's transferring power back to the people, taking it away from the globalists, taking it away from the dictatorial TPP, taking it away from the dictatorial EU that's unelected.
[00:56:42.735 --> 00:56:44.777]  China is run by a communist dictatorship.
[00:56:44.777 --> 00:56:47.099]  The EU is an unelected dictatorship.
[00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:50.501]  The Democrats are the ones that want to bring in total tyranny and ban free speech.
[00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:52.343]  They're the authoritarians.
[00:56:52.343 --> 00:56:57.748]  And so their claims of pushing all this are total and complete abject fraud.
[00:56:58.507 --> 00:57:00.227]  All right, again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:57:00.227 --> 00:57:01.888]  I want to salute you.
[00:57:01.888 --> 00:57:05.689]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:14.892]  And please understand the fight to censor us is ongoing, but they're censoring everybody.
[00:57:14.892 --> 00:57:22.294]  And they backed down the last few days, but then SPLC operatives that run YouTube now are coming back in and still doing the strikes.
[00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:24.934]  So this ongoing saga is going to be ongoing.
[00:57:24.934 --> 00:57:26.635]  They're just hoping to confuse everybody.
[00:57:27.435 --> 00:57:32.880]  And keep manipulating things until you guys just give up and stop paying attention.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.061]  And that's how freedom dies, is in the dark.
[00:57:35.061 --> 00:57:37.123]  So there's an information war going on.
[00:57:37.123 --> 00:57:39.885]  It's who wants to fight the distance, who wants to go the 12 rounds.
[00:57:39.885 --> 00:57:42.768]  We're winning right now in round 7, but it's a close one.
[00:57:42.768 --> 00:57:43.728]  Thank you for your prayers.
[00:57:43.728 --> 00:57:44.449]  Thank you for your support.

[00:58:58.855 --> 00:59:03.420]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.564]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:59:06.564 --> 00:59:09.667]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:59:11.178 --> 00:59:24.002]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:53.353]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[00:59:53.353 --> 00:59:55.954]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.159 --> 01:00:10.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:17.342]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:00:17.342 --> 01:00:20.483]  So the Oscars were last night.
[01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:24.724]  Nobody knew, but they did happen.
[01:00:24.724 --> 01:00:26.504]  And Jimmy Kimmel, he blew it.
[01:00:26.504 --> 01:00:28.165]  He sucked again.
[01:00:28.165 --> 01:00:32.606]  He had to push his political agenda during his monologues.
[01:00:32.606 --> 01:00:36.087]  Of course, pushing gun control, bashing Trump.
[01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:41.800]  Lying about the misnomer of unequal pay.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.961]  Says penis-free Oscar statue is Hollywood's ideal man.
[01:00:45.961 --> 01:00:59.665]  How did a guy, Jimmy Kimmel, go from hosting the man show that featured women on trampolines to the human knish that you see in front of you that is now just a mouthpiece for the Democrat Party?
[01:00:59.665 --> 01:01:04.206]  What a pathetic sack!
[01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:05.787]  But nobody watched.
[01:01:07.128 --> 01:01:09.110]  As the Oscars hit ratings low.
[01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:22.122]  Meanwhile, Black Panther continues to surge in the box office, while what used to be a popular actress, Jennifer Lawrence, Red Sparrow, flops.
[01:01:22.122 --> 01:01:26.946]  Yeah, that's what happens, Jennifer, when you try to shove your political agenda down people's throats.
[01:01:26.946 --> 01:01:30.029]  Ryan Seacrest is under attack with accusations he's fighting them.
[01:01:30.925 --> 01:01:39.748]  It's just a dangerous precedent that these people are setting where you just can accuse somebody of sexual harassment and then they're guilty without due process.
[01:01:39.748 --> 01:01:56.534]  And one of the nimrods over at the Oscars last night, Emma Watson, first of all, she has a haircut straight out of Dumb and Dumber, and then she goes dumbest and she puts a tattoo on her arm, times up, and misspells time.
[01:01:58.599 --> 01:01:59.940]  Ouch.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:00.860]  But you know what's funny?
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.400]  Time is up.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.641]  Time is up on you.
[01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:04.961]  Time is up on Hollywood.
[01:02:04.961 --> 01:02:07.942]  Time is up on being bullied by the left.
[01:02:07.942 --> 01:02:09.503]  Time is up on the deep state.
[01:02:09.503 --> 01:02:11.364]  Time is up on globalism.
[01:02:11.364 --> 01:02:13.304]  So time is up.
[01:02:13.304 --> 01:02:17.226]  Can you imagine though if we had the schools guarded like the Oscars were guarded last night?
[01:02:17.226 --> 01:02:19.527]  Can you imagine if we had the same type of security?
[01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:23.662]  At our schools that we had at the Oscars last night.
[01:02:23.662 --> 01:02:24.662]  But this is Hollywood.
[01:02:24.662 --> 01:02:27.502]  These are the gods and goddesses.
[01:02:27.502 --> 01:02:28.883]  So we have to have armed security for them.
[01:02:28.883 --> 01:02:33.583]  But the children, you know, we just push gun control when something bad happens to them.
[01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:40.045]  But here's a little montage of some of the highlights from last night's Oscars that everybody missed.
[01:02:40.045 --> 01:02:44.386]  Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood.
[01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:45.466]  And there's a very good reason why.
[01:02:45.466 --> 01:02:46.586]  I thought that was Harvey Weinstein.
[01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:48.811]  Wasn't that Weinstein?
[01:02:58.766 --> 01:03:02.328]  He is literally a statue of limitations.
[01:03:02.328 --> 01:03:06.110]  And that's the kind of men we need more of in this town.
[01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:14.495]  What happened with Harvey and what's happening all over... Says the guy who used to host the show that was all about men objectifying women.
[01:03:14.495 --> 01:03:19.698]  We are so happy to be here but a little nervous too because a few years ago... Turn this off.
[01:03:19.698 --> 01:03:21.079]  I can't deal with this crap.
[01:03:21.079 --> 01:03:21.439]  I'm done.
[01:03:21.439 --> 01:03:22.580]  Thank you.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.701]  Thank you.
[01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:25.142]  That's why nobody watches.
[01:03:25.142 --> 01:03:25.602]  You know what?
[01:03:26.994 --> 01:03:30.075]  I'm glad that they go with the theme, Time's Up.
[01:03:30.075 --> 01:03:32.776]  I'm telling you, time is up for them.
[01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:35.397]  Their time is up.
[01:03:35.397 --> 01:03:37.158]  Yeah, there's the old, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:37.158 --> 01:03:37.958]  No, no, pull that back up.
[01:03:37.958 --> 01:03:40.139]  There's the old logo for The Man Show.
[01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:40.919]  The Man Show.
[01:03:40.919 --> 01:03:44.760]  It was called The Man Show.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:51.283]  And then, I mean, so this is actually Art from Sabo, who we have on, who's gonna come on today.
[01:03:52.188 --> 01:03:55.590]  Actually, at one o'clock here Central, Sabo is going to come on.
[01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:10.600]  Now this guy's become famous for some of his street art, where he just uses art and creativity to call out the double standards in Hollywood and to call out the double standards of liberalism.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.941]  So Sabo's going to be joining us.
[01:04:13.379 --> 01:04:14.020]  It's just nuts.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.801]  I mean, these people are such frauds.
[01:04:15.801 --> 01:04:17.582]  Ooh, man-made global warming!
[01:04:17.582 --> 01:04:23.007]  How much gasoline do you think all of them burnt flying on their jets to get to the Oscars last night?
[01:04:23.007 --> 01:04:29.572]  How much energy do you think was spent lighting the Oscars so that all the prima donnas could be properly lit?
[01:04:29.572 --> 01:04:33.355]  How about all the money spent on security and arms to secure that event?
[01:04:33.355 --> 01:04:34.656]  But don't have that at schools!
[01:04:35.296 --> 01:04:36.897]  No, no, no.
[01:04:36.897 --> 01:04:40.398]  If there's a threat of a gun at a school, the answer is gun control.
[01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:47.361]  But if there's a threat on the celebrities at the Oscars, the answer is armed security, lots of guns, heavy security.
[01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:48.182]  That makes sense.
[01:04:48.182 --> 01:04:51.163]  You see, Hollywood stars are all that matters.
[01:04:51.163 --> 01:04:52.504]  They're the most important thing on Earth.
[01:04:52.504 --> 01:04:53.224]  Just ask them.
[01:04:58.393 --> 01:05:04.776]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:16.400]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.662]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:31.550]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:40.077]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:05:41.718 --> 01:05:50.762]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:49.995]  And Time's Up on fake news, lying about current events and politics to properly shape their agenda, which is all part of the same agenda as the rest, to destroy America.
[01:06:51.514 --> 01:07:04.376]  And right now, you've heard it, it's been all over the internet, all over the news, how they're trying to ban InfoWars on YouTube, we've gotten strikes, more strikes, strikes removed, new strikes, it's like they're just playing games with us.
[01:07:04.376 --> 01:07:18.999]  And of course, CNN is behind a lot of this now, so we are extending our Paul Revere specials, and it's the Defeat CNN's Attempt to Crush InfoWars special, because if you are sick of CNN, if you want to thumb your nose at CNN,

[01:07:40.743 --> 01:07:41.123]  I don't know.
[01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:04.211]  Now is the time to take advantage because we've got free shipping store wide.

[01:08:12.432 --> 01:08:13.192]  Keep your television.
[01:08:13.192 --> 01:08:14.653]  It's probably watching you.

[01:08:26.015 --> 01:08:26.635]  My next...
[01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:30.022]  There's a nice picture of Lemonhead.
[01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:31.363]  Don Lemonhead.
[01:08:31.363 --> 01:08:35.707]  My next guest is Brandon Tatum at the Officer Tatum.
[01:08:35.707 --> 01:08:39.070]  You can find his YouTube channel, BTCruiser34.
[01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:41.011]  You probably recognize him.
[01:08:41.011 --> 01:08:42.132]  He's been on with us before.
[01:08:42.132 --> 01:08:47.277]  We're going to talk a little bit about gun control, a little bit about some of the other issues going on right now.
[01:08:47.277 --> 01:08:50.559]  You know, Brandon, it's just amazing to me how
[01:08:51.607 --> 01:08:55.368]  Here we are in the middle of being lectured by all of the liberals.
[01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:56.648]  You can't have guns.
[01:08:56.648 --> 01:09:00.369]  We need to, you know, stop ARs.
[01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:02.889]  We need to do something about this Second Amendment and all this stuff.
[01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.510]  And then you have the Oscars last night.
[01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:05.150]  Oh, and what do you have?
[01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:10.311]  Armed security, heavily secured, you know, lots of, you know, security detail with guns.
[01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:14.111]  I mean, it's weird how they want to be protected by guns.
[01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:17.152]  But if you want to protect a school with guns, the answer is no guns.
[01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:28.736]  Yeah, I think it's just we're being influenced or run, not you and I, but the masses are being influenced and run by people who are ignorant, that just have a platform.
[01:09:28.736 --> 01:09:35.379]  So ignorant people with a platform, they spew out all of these things that sound politically correct, that sounds, I guess, conducive to their cause.
[01:09:36.019 --> 01:09:37.441]  It's absolutely ignorant, man.
[01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:57.282]  There's no way, form, or fashion that people that can sit in a room and feel comfortable, safe, and protected by others would then reject the idea that our students and our schools, our young people, and even citizens walking around with the Second Amendment, you know, constitutional right, should be somehow robbed of their rights to defend themselves.
[01:09:58.308 --> 01:10:09.551]  Yeah, and it's just a very dangerous slippery slope, even to ban bump stocks, in my opinion, because they want to use this terminology where they say anything that increases the rate of fire, so what are they going to come after next?
[01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:10.271]  A new trigger?
[01:10:10.271 --> 01:10:11.812]  A new scope?
[01:10:11.812 --> 01:10:13.912]  I mean, so there's all kinds of things there.
[01:10:13.912 --> 01:10:17.353]  But, you know, going back, you're a former police officer.
[01:10:17.353 --> 01:10:27.216]  When you looked at the event that happened in Florida, just from a scenario situation, and you hear about the officers not going in, you hear about the stand-down,
[01:10:28.036 --> 01:10:34.963]  You hear about them telling medical teams not to go in, and then the medical teams saying, we wanted to go in, we were told not to go in.
[01:10:34.963 --> 01:10:37.905]  I mean, what kind of tactics were they using there?
[01:10:37.905 --> 01:10:41.489]  I mean, did this sound like normal police tactics, or did it sound like something else was going on?
[01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:45.708]  Well, this is a complete disgrace from the top all the way down.
[01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:02.245]  Yeah.
[01:11:20.846 --> 01:11:26.928]  I mean, you may have two or three seconds to figure out how you're going to go and assess the issue and take down the threat.
[01:11:26.928 --> 01:11:27.728]  That's it.
[01:11:27.728 --> 01:11:28.688]  There is no waiting.
[01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:30.769]  There is no coming up with ideas.
[01:11:30.769 --> 01:11:32.669]  There's no, I'm waiting for my commander.
[01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:41.652]  And I'll tell you what, as a police officer, a former police officer, if I was in that situation, if the chief came and told me, stand down, I'll tell him to screw himself.
[01:11:41.652 --> 01:11:43.573]  And I'll go in there and save those children's lives.
[01:11:43.573 --> 01:11:46.473]  Because I look at it as if, what if those were my children?
[01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:48.714]  What if my kids were in that school getting shot to death?
[01:11:48.934 --> 01:11:52.902]  Would I sit outside and wait, or would I go in there and risk my life to save those children?
[01:11:53.666 --> 01:12:08.718]  Well, and it sounds to me that the officer that is being called a coward, that didn't go into the situation, it sounds to me like he was trying to use some sort of tactical excuse and say, well, I didn't know where the shooter was, so I was trying to hold my place.
[01:12:08.718 --> 01:12:15.504]  Okay, maybe that's true, maybe it's not, but according to the way that they train you, that's not how it was supposed to go down.
[01:12:15.504 --> 01:12:19.987]  And then on the back end, though, it's almost as if they're trying to protect this officer
[01:12:20.808 --> 01:12:23.712]  And then they let him walk away with his pension and retire?
[01:12:23.712 --> 01:12:25.755]  I mean, how do they allow this to happen?
[01:12:25.755 --> 01:12:33.665]  First the guy, dereliction of duty, doesn't go in to save children's lives, and then they're gonna give him a nice severance package on top of it?
[01:12:35.109 --> 01:12:36.631]  Yeah, it's disgraceful, man.
[01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:39.173]  I'm not sure what the heck is going on in that county.
[01:12:39.173 --> 01:12:40.575]  I don't understand.
[01:12:40.575 --> 01:12:46.541]  Listen, our general orders in my former police department is cowardice is actually against the general order.
[01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:56.191]  Like, if you cower in any situation that's presented to you and that caused other people to get hurt or, you know, you pretty much failed in your assignment, you can be terminated.
[01:12:56.531 --> 01:13:00.412]  And when I say terminated, terminated doesn't mean give you an early retirement.
[01:13:00.412 --> 01:13:05.694]  Terminated means that you have not, you know, accomplished what you've sworn to do.
[01:13:05.694 --> 01:13:07.934]  Therefore, you can no longer do this job.
[01:13:07.934 --> 01:13:12.316]  If you can no longer do this job before your retirement date, then that means you're fired.
[01:13:12.316 --> 01:13:13.656]  No pension or nothing.
[01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:18.937]  I honestly believe that I know that man probably worked his whole, his whole career, worked for 20 years.
[01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:20.718]  But when you end your career,
[01:13:21.338 --> 01:13:26.040]  Being a coward, not saving lives, you don't deserve a pension.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.863]  You deserve to keep working until you figure out what's going on in your inner man that you will let people die.
[01:13:31.863 --> 01:13:33.364]  There's no tactical advantage.
[01:13:33.364 --> 01:13:34.864]  There's no tactical scheme.
[01:13:34.864 --> 01:13:41.487]  Listen, when you see people getting shot while everybody's running and screaming, you need to be tracking the person who's shooting people.
[01:13:41.487 --> 01:13:46.930]  Because if he's on the other side of the school and you're sitting at a post, he's going to kill people before you run into him.
[01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:49.171]  So, I don't like his excuse.
[01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:52.253]  I understand the hard work and dedication it takes to be a police officer.
[01:13:52.253 --> 01:13:57.297]  But at the end of the day, when you do something that egregious, you shouldn't have your pension.
[01:13:57.297 --> 01:14:03.861]  Well, and it sounds to me like you could have yourself sit this down if you're the officer and you can say, look, I was a coward that day.
[01:14:03.861 --> 01:14:05.522]  I blew it.
[01:14:05.522 --> 01:14:07.284]  And so I'm going to quit.
[01:14:08.186 --> 01:14:10.789]  You know, I can no longer fulfill my duties.
[01:14:10.789 --> 01:14:11.410]  I just can't do it.
[01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:13.792]  I don't have the spine anymore, whatever, so he quits.
[01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:18.398]  And then you have the sheriff, you know, who lambast him, saying, yeah, he's a coward, he blew it.
[01:14:18.398 --> 01:14:20.100]  But then they give him his retirement.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.222]  I mean, it just sounds very strange.
[01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:27.288]  I mean, if this went on in a department that you worked for, what would you be thinking about the sheriff that allowed this to happen?
[01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:32.112]  Oh man, I mean, I don't understand how he still have his job.
[01:14:32.112 --> 01:14:34.435]  Because it starts from the top down.
[01:14:34.435 --> 01:14:43.889]  When your officers are not responding properly, you have to wait for an outside agency to come and take responsibility for a situation that you were initially responding to.
[01:14:44.469 --> 01:14:48.112]  Then that means that the chief is not, or the sheriff is not doing his job.
[01:14:48.112 --> 01:14:49.733]  That person is voted in.
[01:14:49.733 --> 01:14:51.534]  That person can be voted out.
[01:14:51.534 --> 01:14:57.878]  And I don't understand how this man still has his job after he gets on TV and says some of the dumbest things that I've ever heard.
[01:14:57.878 --> 01:15:01.461]  He failed to take accountability for anything that happened.
[01:15:01.461 --> 01:15:03.662]  I don't think I heard him say it was his fault.
[01:15:03.662 --> 01:15:07.905]  He keeps pointing the finger, blaming the NRA and everybody else from the things that I've heard.
[01:15:07.905 --> 01:15:13.228]  But at the end of the day, man, what it comes down to is that this man needs to take accountability for his actions.
[01:15:13.228 --> 01:15:14.129]  When his troops
[01:15:14.529 --> 01:15:22.213]  Don't do what they're supposed to do, causing people to lose their lives unnecessarily, even when it comes to reporting or even the actions during that day.
[01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:24.054]  That man need to step down.
[01:15:24.054 --> 01:15:25.834]  He need to walk away from the job.
[01:15:25.834 --> 01:15:27.875]  He don't need to pander to anybody else.
[01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:33.338]  And I think that that was a failed part on everybody's end for that man to keep his job and for them officers to not act.
[01:15:33.698 --> 01:15:47.842]  Yeah, there were about 10 to 20 mistakes that should have prevented that shooting from happening long before Cruz ever decided to grab that gun, hop in an Uber, and show up at school that day.
[01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:55.084]  It's really sad, but we need to talk about the real issues here, and there's about 20 of them before we even get to gun control.
[01:15:57.395 --> 01:15:59.296]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:15:59.296 --> 01:16:02.517]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[01:16:04.117 --> 01:16:06.958]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:07.618]  Awesome.

[01:16:58.012 --> 01:17:05.714]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID blocking wallet technology over 10 years ago, major designer brands have tried to create their own versions.
[01:17:05.714 --> 01:17:07.095]  But do they really work?
[01:17:07.095 --> 01:17:13.957]  We let real people test designer brand RFID blocking wallets using the same rigorous testing ID Stronghold wallets go through.
[01:17:13.957 --> 01:17:15.397]  So how did the designer brands do?
[01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:21.283]  I expected notable brands to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protected.
[01:17:21.283 --> 01:17:26.729]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising that they do.
[01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:31.714]  Get a stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with ID Stronghold Wallets.
[01:17:31.934 --> 01:17:34.675]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[01:17:34.675 --> 01:17:36.996]  ID Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[01:17:36.996 --> 01:17:40.737]  I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold wallets to my friends and family.
[01:17:40.737 --> 01:17:41.517]  Check the label.
[01:17:41.517 --> 01:17:44.518]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:46.979]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold wallet.

[01:20:01.524 --> 01:20:04.165]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:44.832]  So Kim Jong-un is going to be meeting with South Korean officials, and this is the first time since he became leader in 2011 he's going to be meeting face-to-face with South Korean officials.
[01:20:44.832 --> 01:20:48.093]  Now, how much credit does Trump get for that?
[01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:53.115]  Well, you can have that conversation, but certainly you would think some
[01:20:54.107 --> 01:21:01.629]  You would say that President Trump has certainly influenced Kim Jong-un some, and the South Koreans some.
[01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:03.810]  So he deserves some credit.
[01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:12.813]  Now, CNN covered this story in like five different articles and hardly gave Trump any credit for it at all.
[01:21:12.813 --> 01:21:12.953]  So...
[01:21:14.062 --> 01:21:30.388]  Trump, it's Trump's fault when North Korea threatens to blow us all up, then it's Trump's fault when North Korea actually might be getting diplomatic with South Korea for the first time in almost a decade, though, you know, Trump is nowhere to be found in a CNN article.
[01:21:30.388 --> 01:21:33.229]  So that's just how the Communist News Network
[01:21:34.108 --> 01:21:40.112]  Operates that is if they can find time From praising Kim Jong-un's sister all day long.
[01:21:40.112 --> 01:21:55.861]  My guest is Brandon Tatum foreign police officer You can find him on Twitter at the officer Tatum his YouTube channel BT cruiser 34 and his patreon account patreon slash Brandon Tatum is how you can support him check out all of his work Let's go.
[01:21:55.861 --> 01:21:57.382]  Let's let's get into the Oscars now Brandon.
[01:21:57.382 --> 01:21:58.963]  I'm pretty sure that we're about the same age.
[01:21:58.963 --> 01:22:00.524]  I'm 28 years old I remember
[01:22:01.636 --> 01:22:17.721]  Growing up, I think it was on, actually I think it was on like the original expansion of Fox Sports, it was like Fox Sports West or something, or it was featured on I think the first Fox Sports expansion when they launched all these other syndicates, and it was the Man Show!
[01:22:17.721 --> 01:22:24.823]  And it was on late nights and I would always watch it, you know, when my parents went to bed and, you know, I'm enjoying the fact that there's these, you know,
[01:22:26.084 --> 01:22:31.029]  How did we go from that Jimmy Kimmel to the Jimmy Kimmel we see today that's a mouthpiece for the Democrat Party?
[01:22:42.521 --> 01:22:49.323]  And beyond that, I guess he could understand how that happens, but how is it that he actually gets to fill this throne?
[01:22:49.323 --> 01:22:54.885]  He is the heir of the liberals to tell us how to think on late night television and at the Oscars.
[01:22:54.885 --> 01:23:00.187]  It's like, how does he make that transition and get away with it?
[01:23:00.187 --> 01:23:02.167]  Yeah, man, I have no idea.
[01:23:02.167 --> 01:23:05.028]  That's probably the million dollar question, man.
[01:23:05.028 --> 01:23:06.469]  It's really interesting to me.
[01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:07.517]  That's right.
[01:23:24.361 --> 01:23:28.246]  Losing his mind, and they have no shame in what they're saying.
[01:23:28.246 --> 01:23:30.929]  Even as ridiculous as it is, they have no shame.
[01:23:30.929 --> 01:23:31.930]  I don't understand.
[01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:41.782]  Maybe because he, you know, taking the syndrome pill or something, and he's gone crazy, and he's adopted the principles, so they want to continue to use him moving forward.
[01:23:41.782 --> 01:23:44.445]  Other than that, I have no idea why this guy is acting like this.
[01:23:45.154 --> 01:23:49.200]  No, I think when the, we're on, are we on the DSM-5 now, guys?
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.847]  When the DSM-6 comes out, Trump derangement syndrome honestly needs to be in it.
[01:23:53.847 --> 01:23:55.490]  No, I think that that's a real thing.
[01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:58.013]  Now, I doubt, I doubt that would happen, but it should.
[01:23:58.013 --> 01:23:58.955]  I mean, this is a real thing.
[01:23:58.955 --> 01:24:00.217]  We're actually dealing with this.
[01:24:00.217 --> 01:24:00.718]  I mean, look at this.
[01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:08.544]  Twitter suspends user for calling Maxine Waters crazy old lying lunatic in a bad wig.
[01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.265]  That's just the truth!
[01:24:10.265 --> 01:24:12.326]  I mean, that's just the truth!
[01:24:12.326 --> 01:24:18.629]  And then Maxine Waters says, Maxine Waters says that Trump is racist for questioning her IQ.
[01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:22.190]  If that isn't Trump derangement syndrome, I don't know what is.
[01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:24.731]  Maxine Waters has Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:25.672]  How else do you explain it?
[01:24:27.284 --> 01:24:28.265]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:28.265 --> 01:24:30.506]  I mean, I'm telling you what, man.
[01:24:30.506 --> 01:24:35.289]  It's not even just the people who are in these political positions, people with a lot of fame.
[01:24:35.289 --> 01:24:39.652]  I mean, everyday people that I run into are completely losing their minds.
[01:24:39.652 --> 01:24:42.434]  I mean, with no kind of articulable facts,
[01:24:42.774 --> 01:24:42.854]  Yes.
[01:25:03.988 --> 01:25:09.851]  Grown adults who supposedly have a functioning brain that are saying things like this.
[01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:13.893]  And not only are they saying these things, they actually believe these things.
[01:25:13.893 --> 01:25:15.553]  That is the huge problem.
[01:25:15.553 --> 01:25:18.155]  And I think that that's where we come into play.
[01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:19.976]  That we continue to push the message.
[01:25:19.976 --> 01:25:24.378]  We continue to tell the truth, no matter what cost it is.
[01:25:24.378 --> 01:25:30.300]  And for people who support us to continue to show support so we can have a platform to pass this message on.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.321]  Because if we do not,
[01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:43.725]  If we fail to do this at this crucial time, then these leftist lunatics with Trump derangement syndrome are going to influence our children, not mine and yours, but they're going to influence the young people of this country.
[01:25:43.725 --> 01:25:46.185]  And before you know it, we're not going to have a country anymore.
[01:25:46.185 --> 01:25:54.288]  So I think it's invaluable for us to continue the path that we're doing and for people who are really a part of this movement and message to continue to support and keep us moving forward.
[01:25:54.784 --> 01:25:56.146]  And they really are already doing that.
[01:25:56.146 --> 01:25:59.913]  I mean, this is what we're seeing in the public education system, at the universities.
[01:25:59.913 --> 01:26:01.375]  It's really sad.
[01:26:01.375 --> 01:26:02.837]  But it's like a gut blow.
[01:26:02.837 --> 01:26:05.101]  I mean, it's like you talk to an individual...
[01:26:05.919 --> 01:26:07.980]  You say, all right, you know, why don't you like Trump?
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.782]  But Trump hasn't done anything for America!
[01:26:10.782 --> 01:26:12.143]  He puts Russia before America!
[01:26:12.143 --> 01:26:14.265]  And it's just like, it's like you just got kicked in the gut.
[01:26:14.265 --> 01:26:15.545]  You're like, oh, like what?
[01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:16.866]  Like, what in the?
[01:26:16.866 --> 01:26:17.667]  You can't even believe it.
[01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:18.648]  It's like you lose your air.
[01:26:18.648 --> 01:26:19.368]  It's like, how do you?
[01:26:19.368 --> 01:26:20.289]  What?
[01:26:20.289 --> 01:26:21.009]  All right.
[01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:21.770]  You know what?
[01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:25.472]  Mental, the mental institution is two blocks that way.
[01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.353]  I think you'll find where you belong.
[01:26:27.353 --> 01:26:30.215]  All right, Brandon, I wanted to bring this story up today.
[01:26:30.215 --> 01:26:32.897]  And you used to play football at the University of Arizona.
[01:26:32.897 --> 01:26:35.379]  So I wanted to bring up this story because I find it very inspiring.
[01:26:36.579 --> 01:26:40.903]  One-handed linebacker makes statement with combine performance.
[01:26:40.903 --> 01:26:52.190]  Shaquem Griffin, I'm not sure if you know this guy, but he's a linebacker from Central Florida University and he's missing a hand and part of his arm and he's doing well in the combine.
[01:26:52.190 --> 01:26:53.671]  He's trying to become an NFL linebacker.
[01:26:53.671 --> 01:26:55.793]  But the reason I wanted to bring this up, and you can talk about
[01:26:55.933 --> 01:27:00.675]  You know, obviously the difficulty it would be for a linebacker to play with one hand.
[01:27:00.675 --> 01:27:01.595]  I mean, that's the biggest thing.
[01:27:01.595 --> 01:27:02.935]  You've got to wrap people up and tackle them.
[01:27:02.935 --> 01:27:14.239]  But to me, this is a great story of perseverance, of not letting the status quo keep you down, of just pounding through whatever obstacles you have to get through to accomplish your dream.
[01:27:14.239 --> 01:27:18.701]  I mean, what do you think about this one-handed linebacker trying to make the NFL right now?
[01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:19.521]  Pretty inspiring to me.
[01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:23.828]  Yeah, it's pretty inspiring, but this is the American spirit.
[01:27:23.828 --> 01:27:26.370]  This is what I feel America is all about.
[01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:32.754]  It's people who overcome adversities with minimal excuses, because this is a perfect example.
[01:27:32.754 --> 01:27:36.717]  That man can lay down, say, I don't have a hand or a missing part of my arm,
[01:27:37.057 --> 01:27:40.579]  So maybe I can't tackle, or I'm not good enough, or I shouldn't give it a try.
[01:27:40.579 --> 01:27:49.385]  But with the spirit, the American spirit that I feel like is in me and you, is that you don't have time to waste making excuses.
[01:27:49.385 --> 01:27:52.988]  If you want to get it done, then you get it done at all costs.
[01:27:52.988 --> 01:27:59.632]  And because he's not using these excuses of, I don't know, that he was held down when he was young, he probably got bullied when he was young.
[01:27:59.632 --> 01:28:04.255]  All of these things, he's putting that aside and saying, you know what, I'm going to pursue my dreams with all I have.
[01:28:04.615 --> 01:28:04.956]  I think so.
[01:28:20.865 --> 01:28:21.566]  Exactly.
[01:28:21.566 --> 01:28:22.726]  That is so well said.
[01:28:22.726 --> 01:28:24.488]  And that is the American Dream.
[01:28:24.488 --> 01:28:25.208]  And you know what?
[01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:30.331]  It probably is a lot harder for Shaq Griffin to make the NFL than people with two hands.
[01:28:30.331 --> 01:28:32.793]  But he's not going to let that stop him.
[01:28:32.793 --> 01:28:34.154]  That's what America's all about.
[01:28:34.154 --> 01:28:35.175]  That's the American Dream.
[01:28:35.175 --> 01:28:37.276]  That's inspirational to me.

[01:29:27.809 --> 01:29:29.030]  Hear that?
[01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:34.412]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:37.313]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.313 --> 01:29:40.894]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:29:58.795 --> 01:30:03.960]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.744]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:30:08.744 --> 01:30:17.431]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:20.654]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:30:20.914 --> 01:30:26.157]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:30:26.157 --> 01:30:33.461]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:37.364]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:30:37.364 --> 01:30:42.107]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:30:42.107 --> 01:30:45.669]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:30:46.329 --> 01:30:47.310]  We're good to go.
[01:30:58.467 --> 01:31:06.731]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.

[01:32:01.747 --> 01:32:13.254]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[01:32:13.254 --> 01:32:14.155]  This is pollen blood.
[01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:27.800]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:31.662]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[01:32:32.122 --> 01:32:36.605]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[01:32:36.605 --> 01:32:46.691]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:49.833]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.

[01:33:00.979 --> 01:33:09.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.605 --> 01:33:15.229]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:20.853]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:20.853 --> 01:33:23.775]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:37.365]  Jones here, about to take off on a family vacation here.
[01:33:37.365 --> 01:33:38.586]  It will be a working vacation.
[01:33:38.586 --> 01:33:39.887]  There will be live reports.
[01:33:39.887 --> 01:33:41.228]  There will be tape reports coming in.
[01:33:41.228 --> 01:33:43.831]  Owen Schroer has done a great job hosting live right now.
[01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:58.423]  But before they close the cockpit door and I take off, I wanted to call in with a couple of key tidbits of very, very exciting, positive news that the globalists do not want us to celebrate or be aware of because it is a roadmap
[01:33:59.571 --> 01:33:59.691]  It's
[01:34:17.907 --> 01:34:21.810]  Normally, a populist party or other side parties might get 5% of the vote.
[01:34:21.810 --> 01:34:29.095]  They got right above 50% and the Democratic Party of Italy just was swept from power and their leader just resigned.
[01:34:29.095 --> 01:34:34.839]  This is happening in every nation across the world, so the demographic numbers, so the facts, the voting blocks.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:46.366]  Paul showed that despite the fact that the globalists have tried to flood the first world, the third world populations and brainwash them into globalist minions, it has not been successful at all.
[01:34:46.366 --> 01:34:49.508]  So there is that really, really exciting news that that happened.
[01:34:49.508 --> 01:34:51.709]  And then of course, in the history of...
[01:34:59.754 --> 01:35:00.454]  Okay, there you go.
[01:35:00.454 --> 01:35:03.435]  We've been sitting on a tarmac for an hour and a half, but they're letting us take off now.
[01:35:03.435 --> 01:35:05.356]  Let me just get back to what I was saying.
[01:35:05.356 --> 01:35:14.138]  The other big news is, in the history of Kim Jong-un being the third-generational dictator of North Korea, he's never met with any delegation from the South.
[01:35:14.138 --> 01:35:16.779]  But he invited the intelligence minister and others.
[01:35:17.844 --> 01:35:22.906]  There was an emergency meeting and that just shows you how Trump has gotten them to come to the table.
[01:35:22.906 --> 01:35:26.507]  And in the history before that, there's only been three other such meetings.
[01:35:26.507 --> 01:35:32.570]  So since 1949, when the whole communist invasion happened out of China,
[01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:35.312]  They try to take over more than South Korea.
[01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:37.753]  This is the fourth such meeting of this type.
[01:35:37.753 --> 01:35:52.203]  It proves that Trump is right by not going along with the strategic patience and letting them build their nuclear arsenal and threaten their neighbors, but by standing up to them and building up force and being serious about doing something, they have been now forced to back off and come to the table.
[01:35:52.203 --> 01:35:54.524]  So yet again, ladies and gentlemen, things are really changing.
[01:35:54.524 --> 01:35:55.745]  It's a big deal.
[01:35:55.745 --> 01:35:57.166]  Now, here's the negative news.
[01:35:57.166 --> 01:36:00.268]  I saw the reports on early voting here in Texas.
[01:36:00.268 --> 01:36:02.430]  The AP reported that Democrats have
[01:36:04.167 --> 01:36:10.390]  Doubled their turnout in early voting that they did in the major election in 2016.
[01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:16.533]  Normally you've got about 20% more that vote during a general election, not a midterm election.
[01:36:16.533 --> 01:36:19.514]  So the fact that the Democrats are doubling in their turnout in
[01:36:19.514 --> 01:36:23.675]  In the early voting in Texas shows it's going to be absolutely massive.
[01:36:23.675 --> 01:36:28.577]  And in many other states, like California and Illinois, they let illegal aliens get a driver's license and then vote.
[01:36:28.577 --> 01:36:42.261]  So that tells you that there's major election fraud going on everywhere and that they're voting repeatedly and voting often, as Obama told illegal aliens to do, and folks voting on the names of dead people.
[01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:45.622]  So if your father or mother or brother or sister died and they're on the
[01:36:46.282 --> 01:36:49.665]  You gotta go check the voting roll and make sure they're taken off the voting roll.
[01:36:49.665 --> 01:36:55.389]  Or you can believe, for many decades, there's some folks voting that are 150 years old in Illinois.
[01:36:55.389 --> 01:37:02.455]  They will be voting for the next few decades at least, unless you don't let the Democrats vote in their stead.
[01:37:02.455 --> 01:37:03.856]  People tend to blame illegal aliens.
[01:37:03.856 --> 01:37:07.619]  They're just people they put on buses and take around to vote ten times off the voting roll.
[01:37:07.619 --> 01:37:09.220]  It's really the Democratic Party caught on video.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.921]  Orchestrating the entire situation, as you know.
[01:37:11.921 --> 01:37:13.362]  Project Veritas caught them.
[01:37:13.362 --> 01:37:14.282]  So, good news.
[01:37:14.282 --> 01:37:15.122]  Humanity's waking up.
[01:37:15.122 --> 01:37:16.603]  Populism's exploding.
[01:37:16.603 --> 01:37:19.484]  But the globalists are engaged in more crime than ever.
[01:37:19.484 --> 01:37:21.985]  Back to Owens Freud on the live transmission from the ATX.
[01:37:21.985 --> 01:37:22.626]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:37:23.356 --> 01:37:40.705]  You know, this really is an interesting story that I've kind of been monitoring, and it just actually keeps getting worse, where now, as Alex was just reporting, they have the numbers in, where it looks like they're actually getting double the amount of early voting registration for Democrats that they have in the past.
[01:37:40.705 --> 01:37:45.387]  And you actually break it down by numbers, specifically if you look at the state of Texas.
[01:37:45.387 --> 01:37:51.591]  And it's very strange, because you say, at one angle you could understand, okay,
[01:37:53.035 --> 01:37:54.917]  The liberals are foaming at the mouth right now.
[01:37:54.917 --> 01:37:58.460]  They are going around doing all these voting registration activities.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.341]  They do it outside of Black Panther movies.
[01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:01.602]  They do it outside of events.
[01:38:01.602 --> 01:38:03.844]  They do it anytime they can.
[01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:10.030]  You've got cities like Chicago where they're trying to get basically illegal non-citizens to vote.
[01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:11.271]  They're giving them the right to vote.
[01:38:11.271 --> 01:38:15.434]  You've got states like California where you know that's going on.
[01:38:16.707 --> 01:38:24.072]  And then they use their dirty tactics of just finding out who's still on the voter roll that shouldn't be there, like dead people or what have you.
[01:38:24.072 --> 01:38:33.578]  And it's funny because I was thinking about this, and you've got elections coming up here, and actually, I'm actually registered to vote in St.
[01:38:33.578 --> 01:38:34.179]  Louis, Missouri.
[01:38:34.179 --> 01:38:35.320]  That's how I voted for Trump.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.062]  I did a, I forget what it's called, an absentee ballot.
[01:38:39.062 --> 01:38:41.324]  But I still need to register to vote here in Texas.
[01:38:41.324 --> 01:38:42.084]  I need to take care of that.
[01:38:42.084 --> 01:38:43.805]  I'll probably take care of that this week.
[01:38:43.805 --> 01:38:44.606]  But I was thinking
[01:38:46.161 --> 01:38:53.328]  I was like, you know, so, so, it's like, I don't, how do you explain this?
[01:38:53.328 --> 01:39:01.855]  Do you do what James O'Keefe of Project Veritas has done and other people have done, and do you expose what the Democrats are doing to get votes?
[01:39:01.855 --> 01:39:07.300]  Like, should I, do I, do I intentionally try to vote multiple times like I'm a Democrat?
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:12.565]  Like, do I intentionally try to rig the system and cheat like the Democrats do just to prove you can do it?
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:20.986]  Just to prove how Democrats have basically zero security for elections anymore?
[01:39:20.986 --> 01:39:25.709]  So they want to complain, oh my gosh, Russian meddling in the election!
[01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:31.874]  They're looking around every corner, looking around under the desk, what, Russian meddling everywhere?
[01:39:31.874 --> 01:39:37.038]  But then they don't even want voter ID at the booth.
[01:39:37.038 --> 01:39:38.099]  Now how do you explain that?
[01:39:39.178 --> 01:39:59.504]  How do you explain the Democrat Party crying, spending millions of dollars, weeping every day, preaching every day, Russian collusion, Russian collusion, Russian collusion, Russian meddling in the election, Russian influence in the election, the elections, they're screaming at the top, the elections null and void!
[01:39:59.904 --> 01:40:03.047]  The election's null and void, it was Russia!
[01:40:03.047 --> 01:40:05.629]  Russia tampered with the elections!
[01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:08.292]  Trump is not the president, it was Russia!
[01:40:08.292 --> 01:40:12.416]  And then the same Democratic Party says, you don't need a voter ID.
[01:40:12.416 --> 01:40:13.977]  What's that?
[01:40:13.977 --> 01:40:17.540]  Oh, you just came across the border from Mexico?
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.102]  You wanna vote?
[01:40:19.102 --> 01:40:20.443]  Come on down, baby!
[01:40:20.443 --> 01:40:21.464]  Democrat, baby!
[01:40:21.464 --> 01:40:24.647]  We got you!
[01:40:24.647 --> 01:40:25.548]  How do you explain that?
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.941]  Well, it's pretty simple, actually.
[01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:34.362]  Surprisingly, it's actually very simple.
[01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:37.844]  Democrats thrive off the illegal vote.
[01:40:37.844 --> 01:40:48.907]  Why do you think people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters take more time and energy to acquire a vote from a non-citizen?
[01:40:48.907 --> 01:40:50.348]  Why do you think they campaign
[01:40:52.372 --> 01:41:00.378]  And take up the pulpit on issues that don't actually affect Americans, but non-citizens.
[01:41:00.378 --> 01:41:01.119]  Well, think about it.
[01:41:01.119 --> 01:41:06.283]  What does a political candidate do as soon as they get into office?
[01:41:06.283 --> 01:41:09.485]  They are running for re-election.
[01:41:09.485 --> 01:41:11.747]  That is the Democrat platform.
[01:41:11.747 --> 01:41:16.051]  Non-citizens, open borders, anyone can vote.
[01:41:16.051 --> 01:41:21.395]  However, if the results of the election determined by the American people
[01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:27.725]  Go against the Democrats, then it must have been Russian meddling.
[01:41:27.725 --> 01:41:29.947]  Why don't we just, you know what though?
[01:41:29.947 --> 01:41:36.952]  Why doesn't Russia, see if Russia really wanted to meddle in the elections, all they would have to do is just send a tanker of people over.
[01:41:36.952 --> 01:41:45.038]  Just send mass loads of planes and boats, just send over all these Russians and just have them go vote in California.
[01:41:46.391 --> 01:41:50.173]  I mean, that's all they would have to do, just send in... They don't need to speak English!
[01:41:50.173 --> 01:41:51.614]  Just send them on in!
[01:41:51.614 --> 01:41:52.334]  Send them on in!
[01:41:52.334 --> 01:41:53.635]  Tell them they'll vote Democrat!
[01:41:53.635 --> 01:41:55.676]  Oh yeah, the Democrats will sign you up real quick!
[01:41:55.676 --> 01:42:04.300]  They'll, you know, they'll either find a way to get you a vote, get you an ID, get you a driver's license, or they'll find some dead schlep, and then you can just vote in place of them.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:09.702]  I mean, it's insane!
[01:42:09.702 --> 01:42:11.984]  This is the Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:42:11.984 --> 01:42:12.664]  It's that real.
[01:42:15.106 --> 01:42:26.309]  But you do have President Trump calling out the Obama administration today, saying their crimes, the illegal spying, bigger than Watergate.
[01:42:26.309 --> 01:42:27.730]  And it is bigger than Watergate.
[01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:29.690]  And everybody knows it's bigger than Watergate.
[01:42:29.690 --> 01:42:35.312]  And that's why Trump's base is growing impatient as we are
[01:42:37.122 --> 01:42:41.206]  Approaching a year and a half into Trump's first term.
[01:42:41.206 --> 01:42:43.349]  Hillary still walks free.
[01:42:43.349 --> 01:42:51.637]  Obama gets to walk free and just desecrate all over the portrait museum with that trash that he sends out there.
[01:42:51.637 --> 01:42:55.562]  Let's get these people in front of a House committee and give a testimony, Trump.
[01:42:55.562 --> 01:42:56.663]  Please, that's what we want.

[01:44:45.564 --> 01:44:48.785]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[01:44:58.052 --> 01:45:01.475]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:01.475 --> 01:45:05.438]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:05.438 --> 01:45:08.780]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:11.322]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.322 --> 01:45:16.046]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:45:16.046 --> 01:45:18.388]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:45:18.388 --> 01:45:24.793]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.393 --> 01:45:33.597]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.597 --> 01:45:38.659]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.659 --> 01:45:45.623]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.283 --> 01:45:51.210]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:45:51.210 --> 01:45:54.114]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:59.588 --> 01:46:17.980]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:24.264]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:46:24.264 --> 01:46:25.045]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:28.227]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[01:46:28.867 --> 01:46:30.388]  And so much more.
[01:46:30.388 --> 01:46:31.529]  It is concentrated.
[01:46:31.529 --> 01:46:33.570]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:46:33.570 --> 01:46:39.294]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:46:39.294 --> 01:46:40.515]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:46:40.515 --> 01:46:42.516]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:46:42.516 --> 01:46:45.118]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:46:45.118 --> 01:46:46.539]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:46:46.539 --> 01:46:48.921]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:49.621]  Immune Wall.

[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:14.968]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.968 --> 01:47:18.550]  So there's still a lot of news that I need to get to today.
[01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:21.152]  And we will get to it.
[01:47:21.152 --> 01:47:21.392]  But...
[01:47:22.808 --> 01:47:27.491]  Before I get to that, I want to play these videos that we have on the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:47:27.491 --> 01:47:48.445]  They always go viral, and this is the type of content they want stopped from getting out there into the public hemisphere, into the public domain, where the street minions of the left are the most vile, disgusting, hateful, ignorant people that you can meet.
[01:47:49.426 --> 01:48:04.794]  And the average individual that isn't politically active or informed or what have you, is just neutral, sees that video and immediately wants to be removed from whatever that is.
[01:48:04.794 --> 01:48:07.416]  They see that hate, they see that disgust.
[01:48:08.772 --> 01:48:27.777]  And they just want to separate themselves from that, so they, you know, maybe they become a conservative, or maybe they watch Infowars now, or maybe they like Trump, whatever it is, but that's always the instinctual reaction, is when you see something so disgusting, as the average Trump protester, you just want to get away from that, as far away from that as possible.
[01:48:27.777 --> 01:48:30.697]  So that's why they want videos like this censored.
[01:48:30.697 --> 01:48:33.238]  So Trump comes to Austin, Texas,
[01:48:34.963 --> 01:48:40.786]  To deal with Hurricane Harvey because the Emergency Management Center is here in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:40.786 --> 01:48:48.689]  So we go out to cover that, and sure enough, Trump protesters show up and they want Trump impeached, but they can't tell us why.
[01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:49.510]  Here is that video.
[01:48:53.971 --> 01:48:58.855]  In a few minutes, we're going to have a moment of silence.
[01:48:58.855 --> 01:49:00.636]  This is not the right video.
[01:49:00.636 --> 01:49:02.898]  This is the ultimate highlights video.
[01:49:02.898 --> 01:49:05.020]  I'm looking for the epic fail video.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.962]  Let's play that video.
[01:49:06.962 --> 01:49:09.023]  These people want to impeach the president.
[01:49:09.023 --> 01:49:13.647]  Let's see if they can figure out why.
[01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:19.492]  Why is Infowars filming this part of the collection of people?
[01:49:19.492 --> 01:49:21.193]  Why wouldn't we?
[01:49:21.193 --> 01:49:22.094]  Why would you?
[01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:27.178]  Do these people, do these people, well because it makes no sense, don't these people want attention?
[01:49:27.178 --> 01:49:28.858]  Don't they want their message out?
[01:49:28.858 --> 01:49:33.841]  I think that everybody's working on getting their message out and we can do it pretty good without InfoWars.
[01:49:33.841 --> 01:49:37.362]  So here's a platform with millions of people, why not have our platform?
[01:49:37.362 --> 01:49:39.583]  Because your platform is fake news.
[01:49:39.983 --> 01:49:41.704]  What did we report that's fake?
[01:49:41.704 --> 01:49:45.147]  Uh, just about 90% of what... So just name one or two things.
[01:49:45.147 --> 01:49:46.468]  It should be easy.
[01:49:46.468 --> 01:49:48.810]  I'm really not interested in... So nothing?
[01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:52.012]  So you've proved... So see, but here's the problem, ma'am.
[01:49:52.012 --> 01:49:53.113]  No, no you're not.
[01:49:53.113 --> 01:49:54.133]  You're young and beautiful.
[01:49:54.133 --> 01:49:55.054]  No, you're young and beautiful.
[01:49:55.054 --> 01:49:56.015]  Listen, though.
[01:49:56.015 --> 01:49:57.676]  We don't report fake news.
[01:49:57.676 --> 01:50:00.018]  I'm curious about why you all would even dare be here.
[01:50:00.018 --> 01:50:02.640]  Well, because I want to hear from people like you to figure out what you're doing.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:03.400]  Why would I dare?
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.561]  I mean, come on.
[01:50:04.561 --> 01:50:05.061]  How dare I?
[01:50:06.659 --> 01:50:08.601]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:08.961]  Here we go.
[01:50:08.961 --> 01:50:13.064]  Give them their platform.
[01:50:13.064 --> 01:50:14.766]  This is such a glorious moment for me.
[01:50:14.766 --> 01:50:16.527]  I got a chant going!
[01:50:16.527 --> 01:50:18.649]  What about gay frogs?
[01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:20.891]  Hey, who behind their sign mentioned gay frogs?
[01:50:20.891 --> 01:50:22.052]  That's actually a real issue.
[01:50:22.052 --> 01:50:23.913]  That's the funny thing about it.
[01:50:23.913 --> 01:50:27.556]  Is InfoWars fake news?
[01:50:27.556 --> 01:50:29.118]  What is InfoWars report that's fake?
[01:50:29.118 --> 01:50:29.398]  You, sir?
[01:50:31.556 --> 01:50:32.357]  I got nothing to say to you.
[01:50:32.357 --> 01:50:33.857]  He's got nothing?
[01:50:33.857 --> 01:50:35.538]  Let's see, are you like InfoWars, sir?
[01:50:35.538 --> 01:50:39.561]  I really don't like InfoWars, and I'm ashamed that Alex Jones is from Austin.
[01:50:39.561 --> 01:50:39.861]  Why?
[01:50:39.861 --> 01:50:41.122]  He's from Dallas, actually.
[01:50:41.122 --> 01:50:42.062]  He's based in Austin, right?
[01:50:42.062 --> 01:50:42.683]  You guys are based in Austin.
[01:50:42.683 --> 01:50:44.024]  Yeah, yeah, what's wrong with that?
[01:50:44.024 --> 01:50:44.944]  You're disgusting.
[01:50:44.944 --> 01:50:46.985]  We bring a lot of money to the commerce here.
[01:50:46.985 --> 01:50:47.606]  You should like that.
[01:50:48.504 --> 01:50:49.485]  We pay taxes.
[01:50:49.485 --> 01:50:53.908]  Based on conspiracy theories and fear-mongering and hatred, it's pretty f***ing disgusting.
[01:50:53.908 --> 01:50:55.349]  What do we do that's hate-mongering?
[01:50:55.349 --> 01:50:56.870]  You're a smarmy little prick.
[01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:57.950]  What did I say that's smarmy?
[01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:58.871]  What are you talking about?
[01:50:58.871 --> 01:51:00.852]  I'm doing an awards mic here.
[01:51:00.852 --> 01:51:02.794]  Get the f*** out of my city, you prick.
[01:51:03.587 --> 01:51:05.449]  You gotta spread love, y'all.
[01:51:05.449 --> 01:51:06.930]  Is this spreading love, do you think?
[01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:08.332]  Are you spreading love?
[01:51:08.332 --> 01:51:09.613]  I'm just asking questions.
[01:51:09.613 --> 01:51:11.915]  I haven't... Excuse me.
[01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:16.379]  I showed up here and you're the one that started hating me, so that's not... You approached me and asked me my opinion and I gave it to you.
[01:51:16.379 --> 01:51:19.002]  Actually, I was trying to talk to her and you stepped in front of me.
[01:51:19.002 --> 01:51:21.384]  What am I?
[01:51:21.384 --> 01:51:22.585]  What am I?
[01:51:22.585 --> 01:51:23.726]  You're really f***ing tough, aren't you?
[01:51:25.127 --> 01:51:29.008]  Dude, I'm literally standing here asking, I've never been in a fraternity.
[01:51:29.008 --> 01:51:30.069]  I'm cowardly?
[01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:33.890]  Hold on, I'm cowardly for stepping into a crowd of people that hate me.
[01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:35.370]  You're being provocative.
[01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:36.351]  I'm being provocative.
[01:51:36.351 --> 01:51:37.371]  Okay, I'm being provocative.
[01:51:37.371 --> 01:51:40.492]  Just by being here, just by being here, I'm provocative.
[01:51:40.492 --> 01:51:41.672]  I'm not welcome here.
[01:51:41.672 --> 01:51:42.873]  You guys are so tolerant.
[01:51:42.873 --> 01:51:44.453]  Look at this guy.
[01:51:44.453 --> 01:51:49.195]  They, none of them, hey look, I asked one of you to have an educated conversation with me, just one.
[01:51:50.155 --> 01:51:51.016]  Just one!
[01:51:51.016 --> 01:51:52.316]  Because you're too stupid!
[01:51:52.316 --> 01:51:54.397]  Climate change is real, says this guy.
[01:51:54.397 --> 01:51:56.238]  Because you're not smart enough!
[01:51:56.238 --> 01:51:57.698]  Nah, it's called climate.
[01:51:57.698 --> 01:51:59.799]  I have every right to be here, folks.
[01:51:59.799 --> 01:52:01.980]  This is the attack on free speech.
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:04.201]  They're all allowed to have their message.
[01:52:04.201 --> 01:52:06.302]  I'm not allowed to have mine.
[01:52:06.302 --> 01:52:11.584]  Hey, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached?
[01:52:11.584 --> 01:52:13.165]  Okay.
[01:52:13.165 --> 01:52:15.766]  I'm gonna ask everyone here why Trump should be impeached, one by one.
[01:52:16.346 --> 01:52:18.226]  I've already asked these two.
[01:52:18.226 --> 01:52:22.127]  Hey, why should Trump be impeached?
[01:52:22.127 --> 01:52:23.687]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[01:52:23.687 --> 01:52:24.688]  Hey, why should Trump be impeached?
[01:52:24.688 --> 01:52:25.388]  See, this is what they do.
[01:52:25.388 --> 01:52:26.348]  I told you, I don't make this up.
[01:52:26.348 --> 01:52:27.608]  They come up and they rub against you.
[01:52:27.608 --> 01:52:29.808]  It's some weird fetish of theirs.
[01:52:29.808 --> 01:52:34.029]  They weren't hugged enough as children or something.
[01:52:34.029 --> 01:52:36.930]  Do you believe Trump should be impeached?
[01:52:36.930 --> 01:52:37.850]  Look at this one.
[01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:38.570]  This one was out.
[01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:39.630]  This one was out Saturday.
[01:52:39.630 --> 01:52:40.390]  Pause it right here.
[01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.830]  This lunatic.
[01:52:44.838 --> 01:52:49.042]  It's about to be featured here making fart noises with her mouth.
[01:52:49.042 --> 01:52:51.305]  Was that from like Anchorman or something when he's drunk?
[01:52:51.305 --> 01:52:58.652]  This lunatic was back on the streets on Saturday, still making fart noises with her mouth, but now dressed as a clown.
[01:52:58.652 --> 01:53:01.575]  You can find that video on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:53:01.575 --> 01:53:03.297]  Let's go back to this crazy.
[01:53:03.297 --> 01:53:04.919]  Do you make fart noises with your mouth?
[01:53:07.523 --> 01:53:08.103]  I'd say yes.
[01:53:08.103 --> 01:53:10.444]  That's the first answer we've gotten out here.
[01:53:10.444 --> 01:53:10.985]  What?
[01:53:10.985 --> 01:53:12.205]  Do you believe Trump should be impeached?
[01:53:12.205 --> 01:53:13.166]  Look at this.
[01:53:13.166 --> 01:53:15.427]  This is lunatic!
[01:53:15.427 --> 01:53:17.648]  Because of a lot of things that he's done.
[01:53:17.648 --> 01:53:18.328]  Like, name a couple.
[01:53:18.328 --> 01:53:20.429]  Has not united the country.
[01:53:20.429 --> 01:53:23.170]  Well, how has he not united the country?
[01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:26.011]  You're the ones that are out here dividing it.
[01:53:26.011 --> 01:53:27.792]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[01:53:27.792 --> 01:53:28.753]  Give me the legal reasons.
[01:53:28.753 --> 01:53:29.453]  Would you like a whistle?
[01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:34.233]  Well, yeah, it's a lot easier to make fart noises with your mouth than answer questions, isn't it?
[01:53:34.233 --> 01:53:36.354]  It's a lot more fun, too.
[01:53:36.354 --> 01:53:39.637]  You have a flag that you have something to say?
[01:53:39.637 --> 01:53:45.421]  No, man, I'm just here asking people, I'm asking people why they want Trump impeached and nobody can answer the question.
[01:53:45.421 --> 01:53:48.043]  Only fart whistles does this woman have.
[01:53:48.043 --> 01:53:49.244]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[01:53:49.244 --> 01:53:50.745]  It's been fake news for 15 years.
[01:53:50.745 --> 01:53:52.346]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[01:53:52.346 --> 01:53:55.448]  Hey, we found- Everything we report on comes true.
[01:53:55.448 --> 01:53:57.870]  Because he's lied a thousand times on record.
[01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:58.591]  What does he lie about?
[01:53:59.873 --> 01:54:01.514]  Should we look it up on his phone?
[01:54:01.514 --> 01:54:03.735]  No, he's recording right now.
[01:54:03.735 --> 01:54:05.596]  But you're the one saying impeach the president.
[01:54:05.596 --> 01:54:08.698]  Yeah, yeah, because you're the one who wants to impeach him.
[01:54:08.698 --> 01:54:11.079]  I mean, I can impeach him myself.
[01:54:11.079 --> 01:54:14.581]  But you're out here with the impeach Trump crowd.
[01:54:14.581 --> 01:54:20.844]  Yeah, I would love to advance an impeachment agenda.
[01:54:20.844 --> 01:54:22.225]  Why?
[01:54:22.225 --> 01:54:23.246]  Because we've got a liar.
[01:54:23.246 --> 01:54:24.747]  I know, so it keeps coming back.
[01:54:24.747 --> 01:54:27.268]  So what did he lie about?
[01:54:27.268 --> 01:54:27.828]  Let's look this up.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:31.702]  But you're out here protesting, you shouldn't have to look it up.
[01:54:31.702 --> 01:54:33.925]  You know, you should already know your cause, don't you think?
[01:54:33.925 --> 01:54:36.408]  You're probably, you know, right in some way, Shapiro.
[01:54:36.408 --> 01:54:39.131]  I mean, if you have to look it up, it must not be that important to you, you know?
[01:54:41.986 --> 01:54:43.207]  This sounds like a leading question.
[01:54:43.207 --> 01:54:45.388]  I'll tell you what, I'll let you do some research and we'll come back.
[01:54:45.388 --> 01:54:45.989]  How about that?
[01:54:45.989 --> 01:54:46.769]  Thank you.
[01:54:46.769 --> 01:54:47.029]  No problem.
[01:54:47.029 --> 01:54:47.830]  Hey, thank you for talking.
[01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:48.851]  Thank you, yeah.
[01:54:48.851 --> 01:54:49.771]  America first.
[01:54:49.771 --> 01:54:51.913]  Well, I salute you.
[01:54:51.913 --> 01:54:54.975]  It must take some courage to come out here with all these crazy protesters.
[01:54:54.975 --> 01:54:57.036]  Hey, watch out.
[01:54:57.036 --> 01:54:58.257]  This is my interview.
[01:54:58.257 --> 01:54:59.998]  Respect my interview, please.
[01:54:59.998 --> 01:55:00.678]  Like, seriously, please.
[01:55:00.678 --> 01:55:03.240]  Tell these people about the hate they're showing.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.942]  I'm just saying, like, anyway.
[01:55:05.942 --> 01:55:08.423]  Yeah, I can't even interview this young man without them interrupting me.
[01:55:09.384 --> 01:55:12.667]  I'm just, I'm just curious, what's it like to be a Trump supporter out here with all the Trump haters?
[01:55:12.667 --> 01:55:14.408]  Are they, you know, are they... It's annoying.
[01:55:14.408 --> 01:55:14.849]  It's annoying.
[01:55:14.849 --> 01:55:15.269]  It's harder.
[01:55:15.269 --> 01:55:16.290]  Especially that one.
[01:55:16.290 --> 01:55:18.852]  Are they, are they telling you to leave like they're telling me to?
[01:55:18.852 --> 01:55:19.452]  No.
[01:55:19.452 --> 01:55:20.413]  They're not telling you to leave?
[01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:22.055]  No.
[01:55:22.055 --> 01:55:24.657]  Okay.
[01:55:24.657 --> 01:55:28.600]  Actually, I'm having a pleasant conversation with this young man right now.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.421]  Did you hear that?
[01:55:30.421 --> 01:55:31.442]  That's what they do.
[01:55:31.442 --> 01:55:33.104]  Hey, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached, man?
[01:55:34.364 --> 01:55:34.724]  Go away.
[01:55:34.724 --> 01:55:36.946]  It's still over.
[01:55:36.946 --> 01:55:39.008]  Ma'am, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached?
[01:55:39.008 --> 01:55:41.230]  Please go sell your supplements somewhere else.
[01:55:41.230 --> 01:55:42.210]  We make great supplements.
[01:55:42.210 --> 01:55:43.111]  Would you like some?
[01:55:43.111 --> 01:55:43.552]  No.
[01:55:43.552 --> 01:55:44.412]  Please go away.
[01:55:44.412 --> 01:55:44.793]  Okay.

[01:55:50.097 --> 01:55:56.582]  And now here's another little highlight video of just a compilation of all the other events we go to with these crazies.
[01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:58.583]  A few minutes.
[01:56:00.602 --> 01:56:03.163]  This is one of the most glorious moments of my career right here.
[01:56:03.163 --> 01:56:06.265]  Please go first.
[01:56:06.265 --> 01:56:12.448]  Not just to be sad, but to ground ourselves in our resistance.
[01:56:12.448 --> 01:56:14.629]  To ground ourselves in our resistance.
[01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:16.010]  What does that even mean?
[01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:17.050]  Look around you.
[01:56:17.050 --> 01:56:18.091]  Look around you.
[01:56:18.091 --> 01:56:19.211]  We are the people we've been waiting for.
[01:56:19.211 --> 01:56:21.913]  I'm the Keebler Elf out here leading this Trump protest.
[01:56:21.913 --> 01:56:22.553]  The Keebler Elf.
[01:56:26.184 --> 01:56:30.046]  Make America great again!
[01:56:30.046 --> 01:56:33.308]  Yeah, this kind of feels fascist to me, yet they're out here protesting fascism.
[01:56:33.308 --> 01:56:34.269]  But it's not even beyond that.
[01:56:34.269 --> 01:56:35.350]  I mean, these are all semantics.
[01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:38.091]  I'm just talking about the feeling that I have in my bones.
[01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:40.773]  I'm just talking about my instinct and my spirit.
[01:56:40.773 --> 01:56:42.354]  That's just what it feels like.
[01:56:42.354 --> 01:56:49.838]  I mean, I feel like I'm being lectured up here by these radicals who really just don't like the results of the election, so they're trying to do anything.
[01:56:49.838 --> 01:56:50.519]  Yeah, F me.
[01:56:50.519 --> 01:56:51.940]  Here we go.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:52.440]  What up?
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:53.441]  Go f*** yourself.
[01:56:54.833 --> 01:56:55.934]  Hey, why?
[01:56:55.934 --> 01:56:56.174]  Why?
[01:56:56.174 --> 01:56:56.975]  What's wrong with me?
[01:56:56.975 --> 01:56:59.638]  Because assault is not boy talk, mother****er.
[01:56:59.638 --> 01:57:01.540]  I didn't- who did I assault?
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:03.962]  My words don't matter.
[01:57:03.962 --> 01:57:06.064]  My words don't matter.
[01:57:06.064 --> 01:57:06.865]  Did you catch that?
[01:57:06.865 --> 01:57:07.866]  I just got assaulted.
[01:57:07.866 --> 01:57:09.007]  And she slaps me in the face.
[01:57:09.007 --> 01:57:12.791]  Right after she says, assault is not boy talk, she then slaps me in the face.
[01:57:13.491 --> 01:57:17.093]  So there you go, I just literally got hit in the face.
[01:57:17.093 --> 01:57:18.354]  You know what?
[01:57:18.354 --> 01:57:20.615]  You guys are fascists!
[01:57:20.615 --> 01:57:25.678]  You have to go through these videos and you have to edit like every time these people talk.
[01:57:25.678 --> 01:57:30.320]  They can't even talk without saying F you, F that, F this.
[01:57:31.801 --> 01:57:34.622]  It's like, you know, read a book or something, man.
[01:57:34.622 --> 01:57:38.744]  You can figure out another way to insult me without just the F-word, can't you?
[01:57:38.744 --> 01:57:40.465]  But those are the videos they want banned, folks.
[01:57:40.465 --> 01:57:41.645]  It's all on the Alex Jones Channel.

[01:59:51.484 --> 01:59:54.126]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:12.907]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.907 --> 02:00:16.190]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:22.597 --> 02:00:44.862]  Well Alex Jones was kicking it with Ted Nugent over the weekend and we had a full film crew there and they shot some unbelievable footage some great clips with Ted Nugent as well I mean this guy this guy is just 1776 to the core but but the thing about it that's so great to me is that the things that Nugent says
[02:00:46.232 --> 02:00:48.153]  It just resonates with the average person.
[02:00:48.153 --> 02:00:50.574]  I mean, this is what the average person is thinking.
[02:00:50.574 --> 02:00:53.695]  It makes sense to the average person.
[02:00:53.695 --> 02:01:01.318]  And he says it in such a clairvoyant fashion that the average individual just hears it and just says, wow, that makes sense to me.
[02:01:01.318 --> 02:01:02.358]  Wow, that's cool.
[02:01:02.358 --> 02:01:05.219]  That guy, that guy's making sense.
[02:01:05.219 --> 02:01:06.400]  So we've got some clips.
[02:01:07.455 --> 02:01:11.678]  The full Ted Nugent interview slash special, whatever you want to call it.
[02:01:11.678 --> 02:01:13.179]  Again, they're shooting guns.
[02:01:13.179 --> 02:01:15.120]  They're talking about 1776.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.061]  They're talking about Trump.
[02:01:16.061 --> 02:01:17.822]  They're talking about history.
[02:01:17.822 --> 02:01:19.563]  He's playing the guitar.
[02:01:19.563 --> 02:01:21.784]  So just really cool stuff that's going to come from that video.
[02:01:21.784 --> 02:01:25.407]  But we've got some clips we're going to roll here today before we release the full
[02:01:26.047 --> 02:01:31.349]  Full Ted Nugent exclusive special here with Alex Jones.
[02:01:31.349 --> 02:01:37.752]  But here is Ted Nugent talking about what it means to be an American and the tradition of Americana.
[02:01:39.309 --> 02:01:41.550]  I just wanted to play Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley music.
[02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:46.172]  I just wanted to practice my guitar and outdo the Ventures and Lonnie Mack and Dwayne Eddy.
[02:01:46.172 --> 02:01:58.497]  So I had bands in Detroit, in the shadow of Motown, and when I was born in Detroit, everybody knows Detroit was the global epicenter of work ethic and productivity.
[02:01:58.497 --> 02:02:01.619]  Neighborliness, goodwill, a work ethic that was
[02:02:02.890 --> 02:02:12.195]  Unprecedented maybe in the history of our species, except for maybe Glore in the year six when he finally made fire.
[02:02:12.195 --> 02:02:19.719]  So I was in such a positive environment where America had proven to the globe that if you have freedom, you are
[02:02:20.659 --> 02:02:26.282]  More dedicated to good over evil, and that's how we defeated the Japs and the Nazis.
[02:02:26.282 --> 02:02:30.543]  And the whole world looked to America and went, boy, they're some bad motherf***er, man.
[02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:40.688]  They climbed that Iwo Jima and they went to Boot Hill and they kicked ass on the maniac bonsais and the brainwashed Nazis.
[02:02:41.468 --> 02:02:54.951]  So the whole world looked to America and identified that what we're doing is an experiment in self-government where the Constitution and Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence might be something they might want to look into.
[02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:57.111]  So my positive spirit was untouchable.
[02:02:57.111 --> 02:03:09.294]  I just wanted to play this new uppity soundtrack that the Emancipation Proclamation gave to Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and Little Richard to go ahead and express their musical dreams in defiance of all cultural controls of the time.
[02:03:09.294 --> 02:03:10.834]  I mean, Little Richard, are you kidding me?
[02:03:11.474 --> 02:03:12.255]  What?
[02:03:12.255 --> 02:03:14.257]  The punk's got nothing on Little Richard.
[02:03:14.257 --> 02:03:17.601]  I mean, there's a black gay guy singing about whacking your daughter.
[02:03:17.601 --> 02:03:18.302]  Tooty-fruity.
[02:03:18.302 --> 02:03:19.663]  I mean, what?
[02:03:19.663 --> 02:03:22.046]  You can't out-punk Little Richard.
[02:03:22.046 --> 02:03:29.574]  So, I'm talking about inspiring in defiance of acceptable status quo music.
[02:03:29.574 --> 02:03:31.316]  My dad was a big Lawrence Walk fan.
[02:03:31.316 --> 02:03:32.036]  God bless him.
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:42.344]  So as I'm making my music and expressing myself in absolutism, never was I inhibited by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:03:42.344 --> 02:03:49.467]  And I started doing these interviews on radio stations, started having rock and roll radio, and they'd always ask me where I get all this energy.
[02:03:49.467 --> 02:03:57.310]  A lot of people thought I was on some kind of drugs because of the energy that I was influenced by Little Richard and James Brown and my black heroes.
[02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:59.971]  And I went, no, I just had a great weekend with my dad up north.
[02:03:59.971 --> 02:04:01.132]  We were deer hunting.
[02:04:01.132 --> 02:04:02.913]  And they're a hippie disc jockey.
[02:04:04.088 --> 02:04:05.609]  You're like, kill deer, man?
[02:04:05.609 --> 02:04:08.750]  And I go, no, we eat them alive.
[02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:12.112]  What kind of question is that?
[02:04:12.112 --> 02:04:22.716]  And I hit this brick wall of insanity that I found someone who found fault with this perfect weekend with my family hunting deer!
[02:04:22.716 --> 02:04:26.658]  And now he's not just questioning it, he's angry.
[02:04:26.658 --> 02:04:30.320]  They're condemning me for murdering innocent animals.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:34.481]  Are you kidding me?
[02:04:34.481 --> 02:04:35.702]  What are you talking about?
[02:04:35.702 --> 02:04:38.884]  So that's the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent.
[02:04:38.884 --> 02:04:41.746]  Again, Alex Jones went up to hang out with him over the weekend.
[02:04:41.746 --> 02:04:44.788]  They got a ton of cool footage, shooting guns, talking history.
[02:04:44.788 --> 02:04:47.830]  That full exclusive content is going to be on the Alex Jones Channel soon.
[02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:49.852]  We're going to have more clips later on in the show.
[02:04:49.852 --> 02:04:55.576]  But our next guest, Sabo, also embellishes and shows you the spirit of rebellion and defiance.
[02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:58.070]  I'm so excited.
[02:04:58.070 --> 02:05:08.214]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:08.214 --> 02:05:13.717]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:05:13.717 --> 02:05:16.718]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:05:16.718 --> 02:05:25.501]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:05:27.608 --> 02:05:37.851]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:05:37.851 --> 02:05:47.194]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:47.194 --> 02:05:49.855]  It is amazing!
[02:05:49.855 --> 02:05:54.837]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:06:04.224 --> 02:06:05.465]  You found it.
[02:06:05.465 --> 02:06:07.527]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.527 --> 02:06:11.830]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:17.898 --> 02:06:20.281]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:20.281 --> 02:06:35.638]  My next guest, Sabo, is a street artist, a provocateur, a right-wing rebel, the badass behind unsavoryagent.com, and just like Ted Nugent, he embodies that defiant spirit of rebellion
[02:06:36.218 --> 02:06:43.006]  And that punk rock nature of pushing back against the establishment and Sabo does it with his street art.
[02:06:43.006 --> 02:06:45.769]  You've probably seen it before.
[02:06:45.769 --> 02:06:49.594]  It makes its way on the internet of things.
[02:06:49.594 --> 02:06:51.175]  It makes its way on Twitter and everywhere.
[02:06:51.175 --> 02:06:52.998]  You can find it.
[02:06:52.998 --> 02:06:54.219]  There's one of their most recent.
[02:06:56.277 --> 02:06:58.118]  Thank you for having me, man.
[02:06:58.118 --> 02:06:58.738]  I finally arrived.
[02:06:58.738 --> 02:06:59.159]  I'm on InfoWars.
[02:07:12.836 --> 02:07:25.723]  Well, you know, it is the tip of the spear, no doubt, but it really is just a confluence of patriots that use this platform to share ideas and to try to start brush fires of liberty.
[02:07:25.723 --> 02:07:26.644]  And that's what you're doing.
[02:07:26.644 --> 02:07:28.765]  That's what you do with your street art.
[02:07:28.765 --> 02:07:36.889]  And, you know, we're going to have the crew rolling some of the stuff that you've put out, but what got you started into this?
[02:07:36.889 --> 02:07:40.611]  What was the process that made you think, OK, I can influence people.
[02:07:40.611 --> 02:07:41.872]  I can kind of be defiant.
[02:07:42.392 --> 02:07:54.540]  And I can use my creativity by just putting out artwork that challenges the thought of liberalism, that challenges the established view or belief of Hollywood.
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:57.342]  How did you get started?
[02:07:57.342 --> 02:08:01.225]  Well, what pushed me over the edge was getting old and not caring anymore.
[02:08:01.225 --> 02:08:10.151]  I had acquired creative skills, technical skills, and I got tired of working for other people and I just said, you know what, I want to apply my skills to something that I love.
[02:08:12.188 --> 02:08:14.571]  And I love politics.
[02:08:14.571 --> 02:08:17.154]  So, and I've been doing this for quite some time.
[02:08:17.154 --> 02:08:18.917]  I believe that was around 2000.
[02:08:18.917 --> 02:08:30.992]  So, where were you before, and are you saying that where you were expressing yourself before with your art, you know, it wasn't really welcome to conservatives, and that's why you kind of had to go rogue, if you will?
[02:08:33.063 --> 02:08:37.544]  You know, at the time we were just like the redheaded stepchildren just getting beat all the time.
[02:08:37.544 --> 02:08:40.125]  It wasn't even a thought.
[02:08:40.125 --> 02:08:46.827]  But it became a thought to me because I would look around, listen to the radio, watch television.
[02:08:46.827 --> 02:08:51.108]  And I remember one night I was in Los Feliz and I was looking for a Larry Elder book.
[02:08:51.688 --> 02:08:57.694]  And it was tucked away in the back of the store to where you couldn't find it and all the liberal books were in the front.
[02:08:57.694 --> 02:09:03.741]  And I was like, why are all our creative writers and all these people treated in such a way?
[02:09:03.741 --> 02:09:06.824]  And by the way, where are all the political artists out there?
[02:09:06.824 --> 02:09:09.066]  And I didn't really see any.
[02:09:09.066 --> 02:09:11.629]  And at that point, I just said, you know what, this is what I'm going to do.
[02:09:12.728 --> 02:09:13.829]  Well, you know, it's amazing, too.
[02:09:13.829 --> 02:09:20.632]  You bring up that you were looking for that conservative book at, say, a local Barnes and Noble or your local bookstore.
[02:09:20.632 --> 02:09:23.754]  That's actually something that these bookstores are doing.
[02:09:23.754 --> 02:09:34.320]  And if you know how it works, basically, you can pay extra money to have your books laid out in the front of the store or to have like a centerfold section there.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.923]  And conservative authors will actually pay that fee.
[02:09:38.923 --> 02:09:40.204]  Michael Savage is a good example.
[02:09:41.124 --> 02:09:48.865]  He pays the fee to get his book, God, Faith and Reason, on a centerpiece in the front of the store.
[02:09:48.865 --> 02:09:55.126]  And then they bury it, like you said, they bury it in the back and they put it in a, I think, religion and culture section or whatever.
[02:09:55.126 --> 02:09:57.487]  He wanted it in politics, he paid for it to be in the front.
[02:09:57.487 --> 02:09:59.307]  So that's another thing they do.
[02:09:59.307 --> 02:10:01.248]  I mean, but isn't that amazing?
[02:10:01.248 --> 02:10:02.488]  I mean, how is that even legal?
[02:10:02.488 --> 02:10:03.368]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:10:03.368 --> 02:10:04.648]  They don't care.
[02:10:04.648 --> 02:10:05.708]  They don't care.
[02:10:05.708 --> 02:10:06.708]  So that's kind of what you're feeling.
[02:10:06.708 --> 02:10:07.789]  It's like, okay, they don't care.
[02:10:07.789 --> 02:10:08.909]  They're going to shove us to the side.
[02:10:08.909 --> 02:10:09.629]  Why should I care?
[02:10:11.361 --> 02:10:11.961]  You know what?
[02:10:11.961 --> 02:10:13.442]  They're not going to care.
[02:10:13.442 --> 02:10:17.464]  It's like, God forbid they have to like look on their computer to see if they even have it.
[02:10:17.464 --> 02:10:19.445]  They'll just flat out lie to you.
[02:10:19.445 --> 02:10:25.247]  And you know, if anything, that just means to me we just have to be that much more vigilant.
[02:10:25.247 --> 02:10:29.729]  So what do you think has been the artwork that you've made that's gotten the most buzz?
[02:10:29.729 --> 02:10:35.792]  Is there anything that you've designed that's been by far the most popular, by far gotten the most attention?
[02:10:37.432 --> 02:10:40.295]  Yeah, I would say, you know, the Ted Cruz wasn't bad.
[02:10:40.295 --> 02:10:43.417]  And that had everything to do with the election cycle.
[02:10:43.417 --> 02:10:45.739]  I mean, it lasted as long as it did.
[02:10:45.739 --> 02:10:47.221]  And I was shocked that
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.662]  Cruz even ran with it.
[02:10:51.662 --> 02:10:55.644]  There was actually a time when I was like, OK, dude, enough.
[02:10:55.644 --> 02:10:57.085]  But he's gracious enough.
[02:10:57.085 --> 02:10:58.126]  He kept pushing it.
[02:10:58.126 --> 02:11:08.593]  And but I mean, the past couple of months have been good with the whole Al Franken billboard and this last billboard in the Meryl Streep hit that we did recently.
[02:11:08.593 --> 02:11:12.496]  So it's just been going good in terms of traction.
[02:11:13.243 --> 02:11:16.064]  Now you're essentially going up against the beast.
[02:11:16.064 --> 02:11:21.626]  I mean, a lot of the stuff that you do does feature, you know, Hollywood.
[02:11:21.626 --> 02:11:25.067]  There's some of the work right there with Meryl Streep.
[02:11:25.067 --> 02:11:26.787]  You know, she knew about Harvey Weinstein.
[02:11:26.787 --> 02:11:28.748]  They all knew about Harvey Weinstein.
[02:11:28.748 --> 02:11:30.329]  And you designed those things.
[02:11:30.329 --> 02:11:31.849]  And there's another one with Al Franken.
[02:11:31.849 --> 02:11:33.950]  I mean, this is some of the work that you're doing.
[02:11:34.770 --> 02:11:38.352]  But I mean, I would imagine, I mean, there's got to be some pushback on you.
[02:11:38.352 --> 02:11:40.294]  I mean, there has to be.
[02:11:40.294 --> 02:11:41.755]  Do people threaten you?
[02:11:41.755 --> 02:11:42.855]  Are they trying to stop you?
[02:11:42.855 --> 02:11:47.218]  I mean, what do you what do you deal with just to get your work out there?
[02:11:47.218 --> 02:11:59.466]  Man, you know, I don't even really want to think that much about it because I kind of have the feeling that they're doing their opposition research on me right now and they're going to find every goat I've ever screwed.
[02:11:59.466 --> 02:12:01.287]  I don't know if I could cuss on this show.
[02:12:01.287 --> 02:12:02.128]  No, you cannot.
[02:12:03.444 --> 02:12:04.545]  Okay, then I won't.
[02:12:04.545 --> 02:12:08.428]  But I mean, they're gonna like, dig into my past, I'm sure.
[02:12:08.428 --> 02:12:16.074]  When I left yesterday morning, I saw someone standing across the street looking over at my place, and he just seemed weird.
[02:12:16.074 --> 02:12:16.274]  And so,
[02:12:18.417 --> 02:12:19.197]  I don't really.
[02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:20.798]  I like the fight.
[02:12:20.798 --> 02:12:21.358]  I don't mind.
[02:12:21.358 --> 02:12:23.739]  I like being on the field fighting.
[02:12:23.739 --> 02:12:25.559]  I get nervous when it gets quiet.
[02:12:25.559 --> 02:12:29.921]  And right now it's a little quiet, but it wouldn't surprise me.
[02:12:29.921 --> 02:12:32.782]  Anything that's super illegal is gone.
[02:12:32.782 --> 02:12:34.142]  I've taken out of the apartment.
[02:12:34.142 --> 02:12:35.863]  It's gone wherever.
[02:12:35.863 --> 02:12:40.084]  And so they're more than welcome to raid the apartment at two o'clock in the morning whenever they like.
[02:12:41.328 --> 02:12:52.615]  Well, I would think, again, just knowing how these Hollywood liberals work, you know, I would think they see some of your street art out there, and then they see it making its way on social media.
[02:12:52.615 --> 02:12:54.797]  I would think they're doing everything to try to shut you down.
[02:12:54.797 --> 02:12:56.658]  I mean, that's how these people operate.
[02:12:56.658 --> 02:13:02.342]  They send out the dogs to try to stop people from calling them out, calling their truth out.
[02:13:04.898 --> 02:13:12.463]  So I would imagine, I mean, obviously, you know, you deal with the politics, but you're probably, I mean, honestly, on a Maxine Waters radar, I don't really know if she cares that much.
[02:13:12.463 --> 02:13:13.464]  She's dealing with her own stuff.
[02:13:13.464 --> 02:13:20.269]  But I would imagine that Hollywood, Hollywood is really the group of people that hate you.
[02:13:20.269 --> 02:13:24.792]  Have you heard from anyone in Hollywood, maybe a conservative, that happens to hear about stuff in Hollywood?
[02:13:24.792 --> 02:13:25.252]  Do you know it?
[02:13:25.252 --> 02:13:28.915]  I mean, are you angering the Hollywood liberals as much as you'd like to be?
[02:13:30.104 --> 02:13:32.005]  You know, from what I understand, I am.
[02:13:32.005 --> 02:13:38.607]  I love it when someone says, oh, I was at the studio the other day and I mentioned your name, and a top exec just rolled their eyes.
[02:13:38.607 --> 02:13:42.509]  I'm like, oh my God, a top exec knew who I was or who I am?
[02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:45.410]  And so I find it flattering.
[02:13:45.410 --> 02:13:53.693]  But hell, I was supposed to go to the Oscars, but the individual that was supposed to take me, she kind of disappeared.
[02:13:54.547 --> 02:14:00.240]  And, uh, I made a few phone calls and they're like, you know, man, her agent said if she takes you, she'll never work again.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:01.965]  And not only that, she fell off a ladder.
[02:14:02.589 --> 02:14:06.713]  So I gave her a call and she says I broke both my knees falling off of a ladder.
[02:14:06.713 --> 02:14:08.874]  So there went my ticket to the Oscars.
[02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:14.219]  So I don't know what all that was about, but I hope her knees get better.
[02:14:14.219 --> 02:14:17.242]  Boy, that is certainly a strange story there.
[02:14:17.242 --> 02:14:18.242]  I'm not surprised though.
[02:14:18.242 --> 02:14:24.508]  I mean, boy, if you would have been sitting at the Oscars, you can only imagine the type of looks you would have been getting there.
[02:14:24.508 --> 02:14:26.730]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:14:27.446 --> 02:14:32.349]  I was going for plan B. I was hoping Milo had the juice to get tickets.
[02:14:32.349 --> 02:14:34.610]  And I was like, I'd be more than happy to take Milo.
[02:14:34.610 --> 02:14:36.732]  I'm sure he'd have a fabulous dress.
[02:14:36.732 --> 02:14:39.854]  I'd have to wear a top hat because he's a full foot taller than I am.
[02:14:39.854 --> 02:14:42.395]  So it would have been great.
[02:14:42.395 --> 02:14:47.198]  Well, and now Milo, actually, he just had to cancel his last event because of a credible death threat.
[02:14:47.198 --> 02:14:48.979]  I think we had the story at Infowars.com.
[02:14:48.979 --> 02:14:51.100]  So, I mean, they're getting crazier.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.261]  I mean, that is the truth.
[02:14:52.261 --> 02:14:53.242]  They are getting crazier.
[02:14:54.161 --> 02:14:58.322]  But you know, these are the people that say that they appreciate art and they appreciate culture.
[02:14:58.322 --> 02:15:06.945]  So I think that there's a little silver lining to what you do because you actually are an artist and it is creative stuff that you're doing.
[02:15:06.945 --> 02:15:09.746]  I think that they actually enjoy it a little bit.
[02:15:09.746 --> 02:15:12.587]  I think they actually enjoy it a little bit and they just cannot admit it.
[02:15:14.048 --> 02:15:16.671]  Yeah, you know, I get some compliments every now and then.
[02:15:16.671 --> 02:15:17.933]  They're like, you know, I'm a liberal.
[02:15:17.933 --> 02:15:22.359]  I don't exactly believe in what you're doing, but I like that's how you're doing it.
[02:15:22.359 --> 02:15:26.804]  There's something about it going on the street that kind of turns people on.
[02:15:26.804 --> 02:15:30.389]  I mean, if I were to just do it and put it online, it wouldn't get nearly the traction.
[02:15:31.676 --> 02:15:38.278]  Yeah, the fact that you actually put it out on the street is great, too, and that's how it gets even more eyes because, you know, not everybody is on social media.
[02:15:38.278 --> 02:15:47.740]  In fact, more people are driving on the street past, you know, one of your billboards or one of the, you know, benches that you put your art on, probably, than would see it on social media.
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:51.501]  And that was kind of the rebellious, rogue thing that you really did.
[02:15:51.501 --> 02:15:52.281]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:52.281 --> 02:15:53.882]  We've got another segment with Sabo.
[02:15:53.882 --> 02:15:54.342]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:15:55.916 --> 02:15:58.458]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banyan Hill.
[02:15:58.458 --> 02:15:59.639]  You like freedom?
[02:15:59.639 --> 02:16:00.360]  I do.
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:01.360]  You like money?
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:01.861]  I do too.
[02:16:01.861 --> 02:16:06.264]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love Freedom Checks.
[02:16:06.264 --> 02:16:12.950]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:14.590]  Yep, you heard that right.
[02:16:14.590 --> 02:16:16.091]  $34.6 billion.
[02:16:16.091 --> 02:16:22.854]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[02:16:22.854 --> 02:16:25.435]  Thousands of people are already lined up to cash in.
[02:16:25.435 --> 02:16:26.795]  Take Doug, for example.
[02:16:26.795 --> 02:16:29.776]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[02:16:32.077 --> 02:16:35.358]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[02:16:35.358 --> 02:16:36.538]  But here's the thing.
[02:16:36.538 --> 02:16:44.801]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.

[02:17:01.708 --> 02:17:04.531]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:17:04.531 --> 02:17:05.211]  Awesome!

[02:17:08.294 --> 02:17:09.855]  NASA PAC Technology.

[02:17:14.639 --> 02:17:16.080]  Or warm and served.

[02:17:24.844 --> 02:17:29.965]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[02:17:29.965 --> 02:17:35.666]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[02:17:35.666 --> 02:17:40.867]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[02:17:40.867 --> 02:17:42.808]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[02:17:42.808 --> 02:17:45.188]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[02:17:45.188 --> 02:17:46.128]  See guidelines.
[02:17:46.128 --> 02:17:49.429]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[02:17:56.684 --> 02:18:05.248]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:18:05.248 --> 02:18:09.810]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:18:09.810 --> 02:18:12.951]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:16.053]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:30.419]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:18:30.419 --> 02:18:45.489]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:50.753]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what it can do for your family.
[02:18:50.753 --> 02:18:52.474]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:18:52.474 --> 02:18:55.236]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[02:18:55.236 --> 02:19:00.040]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:11.550]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:12.450]  This is pollen blood.
[02:19:13.451 --> 02:19:26.115]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[02:19:26.115 --> 02:19:30.437]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[02:19:30.437 --> 02:19:34.438]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[02:19:34.898 --> 02:19:44.983]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[02:19:44.983 --> 02:19:48.125]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[02:20:33.123 --> 02:20:39.269]  And the rest of the hosts over there at the Communist News Network want us shut down.
[02:20:39.269 --> 02:20:49.580]  You see, CNN is collapsing right now and InfoWars is blasting skyward and it just, it's just, it's killing CNN.
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:50.301]  Yep.
[02:20:50.301 --> 02:20:54.125]  There's Don Lemon when he just saw the last rating cycle.
[02:20:54.125 --> 02:20:54.225]  Yep.

[02:22:01.845 --> 02:22:02.765]  This is how we do it.
[02:22:02.765 --> 02:22:03.645]  We're independent.
[02:22:03.645 --> 02:22:04.726]  We're funded by you.
[02:22:04.726 --> 02:22:06.366]  No one controls what we say.
[02:22:06.366 --> 02:22:08.227]  No one tells us what we can or cannot report.
[02:22:09.363 --> 02:22:13.425]  And that's because we remain independent with your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:22:13.425 --> 02:22:24.091]  My guest is Sabo, the street artist who is famous for depicting Hollywood in a more realistic light with his art as well as politics.
[02:22:24.091 --> 02:22:37.978]  I want to go to this real quick clip and then get Sabo's take on how this one individual, Jimmy Kimmel, ends up being the mouthpiece for the Democrat Party now and the Time's Up, Me Too movement as far as the men are concerned.
[02:22:37.978 --> 02:22:38.479]  He's the voice.
[02:22:39.699 --> 02:22:44.302]  Here's just a quick clip of Jimmy Kimmel last night at the Oscars.
[02:22:44.302 --> 02:22:48.624]  Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood.
[02:22:48.624 --> 02:22:50.424]  And there's a very good reason why.
[02:22:50.424 --> 02:22:52.746]  Just look at him.
[02:22:52.746 --> 02:22:56.808]  Keeps his hands where you can see them.
[02:22:56.808 --> 02:22:58.688]  Never says a rude word.
[02:22:58.688 --> 02:23:03.031]  And most importantly, no penis at all.
[02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:05.772]  He is literally a statue of limitations.
[02:23:06.454 --> 02:23:09.255]  Now see, this is funny.
[02:23:09.255 --> 02:23:11.316]  So this is funny though, because think about this.
[02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:14.496]  Talking about Harvey.
[02:23:14.496 --> 02:23:16.937]  But think about the reality of the situation, Sabo.
[02:23:16.937 --> 02:23:20.498]  So the actual, I mean, he was called a god.
[02:23:20.498 --> 02:23:27.340]  Harvey Weinstein, praised by Hollywood, praised by the Obamas, worked to help get Clinton elected.
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:28.561]  Harvey Weinstein!
[02:23:29.778 --> 02:23:32.620]  He was the idol in Hollywood.
[02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:35.561]  He was the most admired man in Hollywood.
[02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:36.902]  He was the pervert.
[02:23:36.902 --> 02:23:38.703]  He was the man accused of rape.
[02:23:38.703 --> 02:23:41.465]  He was the man where the Me Too movement started.
[02:23:41.465 --> 02:23:48.729]  And then Jimmy Kimmel makes some joke about how the most admired man in Hollywood is the Oscar because he doesn't have a penis, he doesn't grope you.
[02:23:49.409 --> 02:23:51.070]  Well, it's like he said himself.
[02:24:09.155 --> 02:24:11.796]  He doesn't have a penis.
[02:24:11.796 --> 02:24:18.638]  He's one of these neutered males that Hollywood just loves, like Jimmy Fallon and the whole bunch of them.
[02:24:18.638 --> 02:24:21.299]  They're squeaky clean to some degree.
[02:24:21.299 --> 02:24:26.540]  How he gets away with the whole trampoline bit, I have no idea.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:32.362]  He was walking around asking young girls to touch his crotch for a skit.
[02:24:33.314 --> 02:24:37.877]  Well hey man, Kobe Bryant got in a ward last night and I think he was accused of rape.
[02:24:37.877 --> 02:24:43.341]  Now to be fair, Kobe Bryant was accused of rape and he went through the legal system and beat the charges.
[02:24:43.341 --> 02:24:47.264]  I think that that was fair.
[02:24:47.264 --> 02:24:49.606]  But that's a whole other element of this issue.
[02:24:49.606 --> 02:24:50.647]  Now you're watching the man show.
[02:24:52.827 --> 02:25:06.834]  You know, that's a whole other element of this talking about due process where you can just accuse someone of touching you wrong and then all of a sudden they're a rapist, which, you know, is something that is going on right now too, but... I just don't understand this.
[02:25:06.834 --> 02:25:08.856]  It's like they want... Hollywood just wants you to forget.
[02:25:08.856 --> 02:25:09.656]  That's what it is, Salvo.
[02:25:09.656 --> 02:25:13.298]  That's why your art is so important, because Hollywood just wants you to forget about their past.
[02:25:14.461 --> 02:25:17.663]  They do, and you know, I don't know how Bill Maher even has a job.
[02:25:17.663 --> 02:25:22.827]  I think that guy, it's my opinion, that guy's probably one of the most disgusting people in Hollywood.
[02:25:22.827 --> 02:25:25.609]  And I haven't seen any flak go his way.
[02:25:25.609 --> 02:25:29.831]  I mean, you could have done a laundry list of people that have gotten away with murder.
[02:25:29.831 --> 02:25:35.275]  The only reason Weinstein's getting the heat that he's getting is he got caught.
[02:25:35.275 --> 02:25:36.996]  I don't know what it is.
[02:25:36.996 --> 02:25:40.058]  Well, you know, that's actually interesting because you think about it.
[02:25:40.058 --> 02:25:42.200]  Here's Hollywood lecturing us.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.240]  Time's up.
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:43.821]  Me too.
[02:25:45.664 --> 02:25:47.308]  You were the problem!
[02:25:47.308 --> 02:25:48.852]  Why are you lecturing us?
[02:25:48.852 --> 02:25:50.215]  You need to be looking in the mirror!
[02:25:50.215 --> 02:25:52.279]  Hollywood needs to be lecturing Hollywood!
[02:25:53.191 --> 02:26:02.974]  You know, 20 years ago, they could have pulled that Sololinsky stuff, like hold people to the fire with their morals and values.
[02:26:02.974 --> 02:26:08.416]  But when you yourself have no morals and values or virtues, who are you to point the finger?
[02:26:08.416 --> 02:26:16.699]  So I like that America's starting to wake up and realize Hollywood's not the arbiter of these things, and they can go away.
[02:26:17.318 --> 02:26:23.322]  Yeah, and I guess that's why you're seeing the people going to the cinema, people going to the movies, way down.
[02:26:23.322 --> 02:26:30.426]  You're not seeing these big box office hits like you used to, where, I mean, Jennifer Lawrence can barely even sell a movie anymore.
[02:26:30.426 --> 02:26:32.407]  She used to be uber popular.
[02:26:32.407 --> 02:26:36.410]  I mean, remember, Jennifer Lawrence was the star of the Hunger Games.
[02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:38.111]  I mean, that was a huge series.
[02:26:38.111 --> 02:26:39.612]  She was a huge hit.
[02:26:39.612 --> 02:26:42.954]  Then she goes out and espouses her radical political views.
[02:26:42.954 --> 02:26:44.475]  No one wants to see her movies anymore.
[02:26:44.876 --> 02:26:48.311]  Does Hollywood even understand that they're hurting themselves?
[02:26:49.212 --> 02:26:49.832]  They don't.
[02:26:49.832 --> 02:26:52.413]  From what I understand, she was like filming some movie in Russia.
[02:26:52.413 --> 02:26:54.634]  It was probably the last movie she came out with.
[02:26:54.634 --> 02:26:58.096]  And some guy sheepishly walked up to her and said, hey, can you get an autograph?
[02:26:58.096 --> 02:26:59.877]  Can I get an autograph for my girlfriend?
[02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:01.357]  And she punched him.
[02:27:01.357 --> 02:27:03.698]  And she was all drunk and she assaulted him.
[02:27:03.698 --> 02:27:08.660]  I'm like, you know, sweetheart, you have a big house in the hill, a fat bank account and fame.
[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:11.782]  It's like, for God's sakes, just sign the man's paper.
[02:27:11.782 --> 02:27:14.683]  And it was at that point I said, this woman just doesn't get it.
[02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:17.811]  Well, that's the understatement of the century.
[02:27:17.811 --> 02:27:27.619]  This is the same woman who lectures us about global warming, and then films a movie in Russia, and you know that they had to fly jets out there.
[02:27:27.619 --> 02:27:34.825]  You know, they had to fly very expensive jets, they had to burn a lot of fuel, a lot of carbon emissions coming from filming those fancy movies, Jennifer Lawrence.
[02:27:34.825 --> 02:27:36.286]  You don't seem to compare about that.
[02:27:36.286 --> 02:27:37.067]  You got to complain about that.
[02:27:37.067 --> 02:27:37.367]  And then,
[02:27:38.548 --> 02:27:39.629]  Oh!
[02:27:39.629 --> 02:27:46.775]  I don't know how we're going to survive, Sabo, but Jennifer Lawrence is going to take a break from acting to try to fix the American politics.
[02:27:46.775 --> 02:27:47.916]  You know what that is?
[02:27:47.916 --> 02:27:55.402]  That's Jennifer Lawrence realizing that she's failing now as an actress, so she's trying to get publicity around her failing acting career.
[02:27:55.402 --> 02:27:56.904]  She's doing us a favor, man.
[02:27:56.904 --> 02:27:58.645]  Keep resisting.
[02:27:58.645 --> 02:27:59.906]  Keep it up.
[02:27:59.906 --> 02:28:01.748]  You're only showing your butts even more.
[02:28:02.475 --> 02:28:08.777]  And I love that they're doing it so early because we have another, what, seven years, six and a half years for this to go?
[02:28:08.777 --> 02:28:11.557]  So 2020 is going to be a circus and I can't wait.
[02:28:11.557 --> 02:28:12.757]  Oh my gosh.
[02:28:12.757 --> 02:28:13.338]  Oh my gosh.
[02:28:13.338 --> 02:28:14.178]  Can you imagine?
[02:28:14.178 --> 02:28:17.799]  You look at Trump derangement syndrome where it is now.
[02:28:17.799 --> 02:28:18.539]  Oh my God.
[02:28:18.539 --> 02:28:20.839]  Can you imagine in six years?
[02:28:20.839 --> 02:28:22.580]  We'd be lucky to have a platform.
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:26.021]  I'm off of a live streaming on YouTube till late April.
[02:28:26.021 --> 02:28:27.581]  Oh, you've been banned on YouTube too?
[02:28:28.655 --> 02:28:32.739]  I've been banned on YouTube and they took away my Facebook.
[02:28:32.739 --> 02:28:33.940]  What's your YouTube channel?
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:36.122]  Plug your YouTube channel.
[02:28:36.122 --> 02:28:41.947]  My YouTube channel is unsavoryagents.com forward slash unsavoryagents.
[02:28:41.947 --> 02:28:44.810]  Or it's youtube.com forward slash unsavoryagents.
[02:28:44.810 --> 02:28:53.418]  Alright, so there's Sabo, a famous street artist, the right-wing rebel who uses his art and creativity to put a mirror to Hollywood and Democrat politics.
[02:28:53.418 --> 02:28:54.279]  Thank you for your time, Sabo.
[02:28:55.947 --> 02:28:58.509]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banyan Hill.
[02:28:58.509 --> 02:28:59.690]  You like freedom?
[02:28:59.690 --> 02:29:00.411]  I do.
[02:29:00.411 --> 02:29:01.411]  You like money?
[02:29:01.411 --> 02:29:01.912]  I do too.
[02:29:01.912 --> 02:29:06.315]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love Freedom Checks.
[02:29:06.315 --> 02:29:12.981]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[02:29:13.621 --> 02:29:14.622]  Yep, you heard that right.
[02:29:14.622 --> 02:29:17.443]  $34.6 billion.
[02:29:17.443 --> 02:29:22.886]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[02:29:22.886 --> 02:29:25.468]  Thousands of people are already lined up to cash in.
[02:29:25.468 --> 02:29:26.848]  Take Doug, for example.
[02:29:26.848 --> 02:29:30.851]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[02:29:30.851 --> 02:29:34.893]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[02:29:35.393 --> 02:29:36.574]  But here's the thing.
[02:29:36.574 --> 02:29:44.837]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[02:29:44.837 --> 02:29:45.857]  So don't wait.
[02:29:45.857 --> 02:29:51.139]  Get over to www.americanfreedomchecks.com before the April 1st deadline.
[02:29:51.139 --> 02:29:54.481]  That's www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[02:29:57.722 --> 02:29:59.263]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:29:59.263 --> 02:30:00.805]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:30:00.805 --> 02:30:01.285]  Go ahead.
[02:30:01.285 --> 02:30:02.026]  Yes.
[02:30:02.026 --> 02:30:02.886]  Hi, Alex.
[02:30:02.886 --> 02:30:09.492]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:30:09.492 --> 02:30:13.816]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:30:13.816 --> 02:30:15.678]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:30:15.678 --> 02:30:22.664]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:30:22.664 --> 02:30:25.306]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last.
[02:30:25.566 --> 02:30:31.390]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:30:31.390 --> 02:30:39.457]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:30:39.457 --> 02:30:45.581]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:30:45.581 --> 02:30:51.145]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:30:51.145 --> 02:30:54.228]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:30:56.306 --> 02:31:08.409]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:31:08.409 --> 02:31:09.789]  So what do we do about it?
[02:31:09.789 --> 02:31:13.110]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:19.211]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush
[02:31:19.611 --> 02:31:20.872]  Without the crash!
[02:31:20.872 --> 02:31:27.497]  RainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[02:31:27.497 --> 02:31:35.022]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract that gives you an added kick!
[02:31:35.782 --> 02:31:36.643]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:31:36.643 --> 02:31:38.044]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:38.044 --> 02:31:38.424]  Go ahead.
[02:31:59.330 --> 02:32:01.252]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:32:01.252 --> 02:32:11.782]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:32:11.782 --> 02:32:15.146]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:32:15.606 --> 02:32:15.866]  Absolutely.
[02:32:38.358 --> 02:32:59.656]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:59.656 --> 02:33:02.338]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.050 --> 02:33:23.633]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.633 --> 02:33:28.194]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:28.194 --> 02:33:29.315]  So I didn't even know.
[02:33:29.315 --> 02:33:33.856]  I didn't even know that our last guest, Sabo, was also being banned on YouTube.
[02:33:33.856 --> 02:33:37.657]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:33:37.657 --> 02:33:39.978]  So, we report on this.
[02:33:41.579 --> 02:33:54.067]  Not just InfoWars and the Alex Jones Channel getting hit with the strikes, and then them trying to strike the David Knight Show, they try to strike the War Room Show, they try to shut those down.
[02:33:54.067 --> 02:33:58.650]  I mean, the War Room Show that I usually host from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:58.650 --> 02:34:00.871]  with Roger Stone.
[02:34:00.871 --> 02:34:06.195]  We haven't even been able to go live for like over a month, and they don't even tell us
[02:34:07.389 --> 02:34:28.747]  It's just, nope, you know, you can't go live, and it's over some video that's already, like, everywhere, and it's just like, nope, you can't go live, which hurts the subscribers, and so then now on the Alex Jones Channel, they say, oh, nope, you can't go live, you can't even upload a video, and that's where we were for about a 12-hour to 24-hour period over the weekend.
[02:34:30.444 --> 02:34:37.730]  And then they removed the strike, and then they gave the strike back, and then they removed the strike, and then there's three strikes, and then there's two strikes, now I think we're down to one strike again.
[02:34:37.730 --> 02:34:40.633]  So it's like they're playing this game of tiddlywinks.
[02:34:40.633 --> 02:34:49.600]  Or my theory is, the Southern Poverty Law Center and CNN has minions, or even just the Brian Stelters.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:51.442]  I wouldn't be shocked if Stelter was behind this.
[02:34:51.442 --> 02:34:53.664]  I mean, Brian Stelter, that guy?
[02:34:53.664 --> 02:34:54.845]  You think that guy has a life?
[02:34:57.478 --> 02:35:08.343]  So he goes and he flags, or let's say, anyone, Southern Poverty Law Center, or anybody, even just some idiot liberal that just goes on YouTube.
[02:35:08.343 --> 02:35:14.486]  They flag an InfoWars video, they say, InfoWars reports,
[02:35:17.145 --> 02:35:23.469]  All of the students that are activists from the Florida High School are crisis actors.
[02:35:23.469 --> 02:35:31.855]  And so they report the video, they flag the video, and then, you know, YouTube probably has some algorithm built in where it's just, if InfoWars gets flagged, or if Alex Jones gets flagged, it's just boom.
[02:35:31.855 --> 02:35:34.577]  They just, oh yeah, of course, I'm sure it's real.
[02:35:34.577 --> 02:35:42.482]  You know, we know that Alex is bad, InfoWars is bad, so yes, it must be real, whatever you're reporting, so we'll go ahead and initiate that strike.
[02:35:44.392 --> 02:36:00.631]  Then, we appeal it, they review the video, they find out that we didn't say what we were flagged for saying, and then they remove the strike.
[02:36:00.631 --> 02:36:03.855]  So then they create this whole buzz about it.
[02:36:05.109 --> 02:36:07.311]  InfoWars banned.
[02:36:07.311 --> 02:36:09.893]  InfoWars losing advertisers.
[02:36:09.893 --> 02:36:11.175]  Alex Jones not banned.
[02:36:11.175 --> 02:36:12.336]  He lied about being banned.
[02:36:12.336 --> 02:36:13.076]  No, he is banned.
[02:36:13.076 --> 02:36:13.897]  No, he's not banned.
[02:36:13.897 --> 02:36:15.939]  And then the advertisers have confusion.
[02:36:15.939 --> 02:36:23.406]  And then you have fake ad buys, where they just buy an advertisement to just say, we're pulling our advertisements.
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:26.761]  That's like CNN.
[02:36:26.761 --> 02:36:29.141]  CNN hires me just to fire me.
[02:36:29.141 --> 02:36:31.062]  It's like CNN hires Owen Troyer.
[02:36:31.062 --> 02:36:32.303]  CNN FIRES Owen Troyer!
[02:36:32.303 --> 02:36:36.364]  And then they make some huge story about it, like they fired me.
[02:36:36.364 --> 02:36:40.445]  And the whole thing was just a stunt.
[02:36:40.445 --> 02:36:42.086]  So, that's what we're dealing with.
[02:36:42.086 --> 02:36:48.668]  And then, again, you've got all these other channels, conservatives being censored, conservatives being banned.
[02:36:48.668 --> 02:36:50.089]  If you tweet, you get shadowbanned.
[02:36:50.089 --> 02:36:50.509]  You know what?
[02:36:50.509 --> 02:36:50.789]  You know what?
[02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:53.070]  You know what?
[02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:53.850]  I already blew it.
[02:36:53.850 --> 02:36:55.011]  I already blew it this segment.
[02:36:55.011 --> 02:36:56.191]  We're going to do it next segment.
[02:36:56.191 --> 02:36:57.972]  We're going to go to this video.
[02:36:57.972 --> 02:36:58.772]  For next segment, guys.
[02:36:58.772 --> 02:36:59.212]  Have the trade.
[02:36:59.212 --> 02:37:03.634]  Ted Cruz... So, look.
[02:37:03.634 --> 02:37:08.156]  Project Veritas has already caught these people admitting what they do.
[02:37:09.721 --> 02:37:24.047]  Project Veritas caught these people admitting they want Alex Jones censored, admitting they want YouTube to stop letting InfoWars videos trend, Twitter admitting they want to stop InfoWars videos from trending.
[02:37:24.047 --> 02:37:29.569]  Now, this video of Ted Cruz is from back in January.
[02:37:29.569 --> 02:37:36.171]  Now, I pride myself on trying to not miss anything, and I missed this one.
[02:37:36.171 --> 02:37:37.612]  But Ted Cruz asks
[02:37:39.265 --> 02:37:45.794]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:37:45.794 --> 02:37:49.760]  I'm sitting and I'm watching this and I'm thinking, do we have a case of perjury against these people?
[02:37:51.837 --> 02:37:56.941]  But you'll notice that they don't answer Ted Cruz's questions about censorship.
[02:37:56.941 --> 02:38:00.403]  So I just want to make sure that I have the proper due diligence to cover that video.
[02:38:00.403 --> 02:38:03.165]  So I'm going to do that in the next segment because we're running out of time here.
[02:38:03.165 --> 02:38:05.707]  Meanwhile, let me just blast through some news.
[02:38:05.707 --> 02:38:15.194]  Kim Jong-un is set to meet with the leaders from South Korea for the first time since he has become the dictator there in North Carolina.
[02:38:15.194 --> 02:38:17.896]  So that's interesting news, big news.
[02:38:19.144 --> 02:38:30.511]  You've got President Trump calling out Barack Obama for crimes with the illegal spying, bigger than Watergate, rigging the election for Hillary, not doing anything about the Russian meddling.
[02:38:30.511 --> 02:38:35.514]  I mean, okay, yeah, we know, so let's get something done, you know.
[02:38:35.514 --> 02:38:37.876]  Get this guy in front of a committee or something.
[02:38:37.876 --> 02:38:40.478]  Michael Savage has his information doxxed.
[02:38:41.274 --> 02:38:44.281]  Protesters show up at his secret homes.
[02:38:44.281 --> 02:38:46.887]  So who's doxing conservatives?
[02:38:46.887 --> 02:38:50.495]  You had a conservative teacher get doxed by the Huffington Post.
[02:38:51.914 --> 02:38:56.218]  Or I don't know if they were the original, but it was their first report on the teacher.
[02:38:56.218 --> 02:39:04.345]  So this teacher has a podcast, conservative, just American podcast, and they dox her because now she's a white nationalist.
[02:39:04.345 --> 02:39:14.194]  You see, if you love America, if you like the Second Amendment, and if you like free speech, see, you're a white nationalist and you can't even have a podcast.
[02:39:14.194 --> 02:39:16.496]  So she's a teacher at Florida High School.
[02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:22.564]  Middle school, Florida, Florida, 25-year-old teacher at a middle school in Florida.
[02:39:22.564 --> 02:39:23.845]  Has her conservative podcast.
[02:39:23.845 --> 02:39:25.326]  In fact, let me just plug that real quick.
[02:39:25.326 --> 02:39:27.448]  You know what, they want to shut that down?
[02:39:27.448 --> 02:39:29.349]  They want to shut that down?
[02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:31.051]  Let's give it a little more momentum.
[02:39:31.051 --> 02:39:33.353]  The Unapologetic Podcast.
[02:39:33.353 --> 02:39:36.155]  Covering the topics others are too afraid to talk about.
[02:39:36.155 --> 02:39:40.138]  And I'll be honest, I mean, this is a girl who can host a pretty good podcast.
[02:39:40.138 --> 02:39:41.099]  It's pretty good stuff.
[02:39:41.099 --> 02:39:42.180]  I listened to some of it before the show.
[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:46.724]  But see, you've got all of these videos online.
[02:39:47.679 --> 02:39:52.720]  Where liberal professors are lecturing their class about politics.
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:54.301]  They're lecturing their class about Trump.
[02:39:54.301 --> 02:39:56.361]  They're lecturing their class about Trump racists.
[02:39:56.361 --> 02:40:00.182]  They're lecturing their class about all the political nonsense.
[02:40:00.182 --> 02:40:08.904]  You've got videos of professors literally pretending to shoot a gun at Trump on the screen.
[02:40:08.904 --> 02:40:11.645]  So liberal professors have gone totally radical left.
[02:40:13.547 --> 02:40:20.331]  And then they take their views to the classroom with them and indoctrinate their students.
[02:40:20.331 --> 02:40:28.475]  This teacher just has a podcast online, doesn't bring it to class with her, doesn't promote it in class, doesn't promote her politics.
[02:40:28.475 --> 02:40:29.756]  She's a social studies teacher.
[02:40:29.756 --> 02:40:34.139]  She's just teaching from the textbook, and she's the bad guy.
[02:40:34.139 --> 02:40:39.061]  I'm trying to get her onto the broadcast.
[02:40:39.061 --> 02:40:39.782]  I want to interview her.
[02:40:42.492 --> 02:41:00.009]  So Democrat-Liberal professors are able to espouse their politics in the classroom, indoctrinate their students, pretend to shoot Trump on a screen, but a conservative teacher wants to just have a podcast on the side.
[02:41:00.009 --> 02:41:02.611]  She needs to be shut down.
[02:41:02.611 --> 02:41:04.373]  She's a white nationalist, you see?
[02:41:05.836 --> 02:41:06.657]  Yes.
[02:41:06.657 --> 02:41:08.418]  That's how that works.
[02:41:08.418 --> 02:41:13.641]  Meanwhile, Dix is going to stop selling pro-gun patriotic merchandise.
[02:41:13.641 --> 02:41:16.882]  Real good business decision, Dix.
[02:41:16.882 --> 02:41:18.984]  Real good business decision.
[02:41:18.984 --> 02:41:21.205]  Not.
[02:41:21.205 --> 02:41:23.806]  Yeah, YouTube keeps trying to censor InfoWars.
[02:41:23.806 --> 02:41:26.528]  That story was on Drudge.
[02:41:26.528 --> 02:41:33.532]  Liberals have now planned a play called Kill Climate Deniers, even though they're the climate deniers.
[02:41:33.532 --> 02:41:34.613]  They are the climate deniers.
[02:41:35.484 --> 02:41:36.986]  They said global warming.
[02:41:36.986 --> 02:41:38.848]  We said climate.
[02:41:38.848 --> 02:41:42.873]  Now they say climate, and then they say we're climate deniers.
[02:41:42.873 --> 02:41:45.016]  This is mental illness, man.
[02:41:45.016 --> 02:41:47.158]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:47.158 --> 02:41:48.821]  This is just mental illness.
[02:41:48.821 --> 02:41:50.422]  If this isn't mental illness, I don't know what is.
[02:41:50.422 --> 02:41:51.063]  How about this one?
[02:41:51.832 --> 02:41:58.236]  Facebook asks users, should we allow men to ask children for sexual images?
[02:41:58.236 --> 02:42:08.543]  Facebook has admitted it was a quote-unquote mistake to ask users whether pedophiles requesting sexual pictures from children should be allowed on its website.
[02:42:08.543 --> 02:42:13.107]  Why is Facebook asking that?
[02:42:13.107 --> 02:42:17.009]  What is wrong with Facebook?
[02:42:17.009 --> 02:42:19.011]  Why would Facebook even... See, think about it.
[02:42:20.055 --> 02:42:24.858]  This is how you know it's a mental disorder, folks.
[02:42:24.858 --> 02:42:26.859]  Liberalism has become such a mental disorder.
[02:42:26.859 --> 02:42:28.219]  They're going left of Hitler.
[02:42:28.219 --> 02:42:29.960]  They're going left of Stalin.
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:31.161]  They're going left of Mao.
[02:42:32.711 --> 02:42:33.732]  They're so liberal.
[02:42:33.732 --> 02:42:34.892]  Let's just do it in the road.
[02:42:34.892 --> 02:42:36.233]  They're so liberal.
[02:42:36.233 --> 02:42:39.075]  A pedophile has the right to be on Facebook, too.
[02:42:39.075 --> 02:42:43.457]  A pedophile has a right to get lewd images of children.
[02:42:43.457 --> 02:42:44.418]  Or what do you think?
[02:42:44.418 --> 02:42:44.818]  I don't know.
[02:42:44.818 --> 02:42:46.038]  Facebook is just asking.
[02:42:46.038 --> 02:42:50.181]  I mean, should we allow pedophiles to be on Facebook and get sexual images and ask children?
[02:42:50.181 --> 02:42:51.942]  I mean, Facebook is just asking.
[02:42:51.942 --> 02:42:52.602]  They don't know.
[02:42:52.602 --> 02:42:53.342]  They don't know.
[02:42:53.342 --> 02:42:53.983]  They need to know.
[02:42:56.385 --> 02:43:01.088]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:44:15.991 --> 02:44:26.477]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:34.442]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[02:44:34.442 --> 02:44:49.092]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:44:49.092 --> 02:44:51.774]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:44:56.870 --> 02:45:02.014]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:45:02.014 --> 02:45:06.778]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:45:06.778 --> 02:45:15.485]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:45:15.485 --> 02:45:18.828]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[02:45:18.968 --> 02:45:24.209]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:45:24.209 --> 02:45:31.512]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:45:31.512 --> 02:45:35.433]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:45:35.433 --> 02:45:40.154]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:45:40.154 --> 02:45:43.735]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[02:45:44.395 --> 02:45:48.240]  Get a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.445]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[02:45:52.445 --> 02:45:53.747]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:56.428 --> 02:46:00.352]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com.
[02:46:00.352 --> 02:46:04.997]  But instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:46:04.997 --> 02:46:09.562]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:46:09.562 --> 02:46:12.705]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:46:12.705 --> 02:46:15.829]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:46:17.321 --> 02:46:30.146]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:46:30.146 --> 02:46:45.211]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:46:46.211 --> 02:46:49.912]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what to do for your family.
[02:46:49.912 --> 02:46:52.213]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:46:52.213 --> 02:46:59.195]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:46:59.195 --> 02:47:01.816]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:08.295 --> 02:47:12.859]  Alright, so think about what it is that we're dealing with here.
[02:47:12.859 --> 02:47:13.319]  You've got
[02:47:34.401 --> 02:47:38.525]  Let's not forget Hillary Clinton calling out Alex Jones by name during the campaign.
[02:47:40.069 --> 02:47:53.676]  Then you've got congressional hearings going on multiple times where they talk about doing something about InfoWars, doing something about InfoWars videos trending, doing something about InfoWars videos being at the top of the list for people to click on with the trending topics.
[02:47:53.676 --> 02:47:54.817]  They got to do something about that.
[02:47:54.817 --> 02:47:57.858]  Then like, oh, we're going to take care of it during lunch.
[02:47:57.858 --> 02:48:06.203]  Then you've got Project Veritas videos with the executives at YouTube and Twitter, and they talk about banning us, censoring conservatives and all this.
[02:48:06.203 --> 02:48:08.104]  So we have the consortium of knowledge
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:20.829]  With actual real-time experience dealing with the censorship, dealing with being a conservative, and having your free speech attacked.
[02:48:20.829 --> 02:48:21.990]  But then you have this video.
[02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:30.597]  Now, this is about a month old, but you have to wonder, is this perjury?
[02:48:30.597 --> 02:48:35.481]  Ted Cruz questions Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube on censorship of conservatives.
[02:48:35.481 --> 02:48:37.743]  Notice how they respond to Ted Cruz's questions
[02:48:40.715 --> 02:48:47.178]  When he's asking about if they view their platform as neutral, go ahead and roll that clip.
[02:48:47.178 --> 02:48:48.378]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[02:48:48.378 --> 02:48:50.459]  Welcome to each of the witnesses.
[02:48:50.459 --> 02:49:04.545]  I'd like to start by asking each of the company representatives a simple question, which is, do you consider your companies to be neutral public fora?
[02:49:04.545 --> 02:49:04.705]  Ms.
[02:49:04.705 --> 02:49:04.925]  Beckert?
[02:49:06.337 --> 02:49:07.558]  None of them wanted to answer.
[02:49:07.558 --> 02:49:07.918]  Oh!
[02:49:07.918 --> 02:49:11.599]  And then she goes on with some long legal talk because she can't say yes.
[02:49:11.599 --> 02:49:12.020]  Can't say yes.
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:12.180]  Ms.
[02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:12.560]  Downs?
[02:49:29.758 --> 02:49:37.322]  Yes, our goal is to design products for everyone, subject to our policies and the limitations they impose on the types of content that people may share on our products.
[02:49:37.322 --> 02:49:40.384]  So you're saying you do consider YouTube to be a neutral public forum?
[02:49:40.384 --> 02:49:40.824]  Correct.
[02:49:40.824 --> 02:49:43.605]  We enforce our policies in a politically neutral way.
[02:49:43.605 --> 02:49:48.428]  Certain things are prohibited by our community guidelines, which are spelled out and provided publicly to all of our users.
[02:49:48.428 --> 02:49:50.389]  Now, pause it right there.
[02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:55.571]  Now, Ted Cruz is going to go here later.
[02:49:55.571 --> 02:49:56.572]  But is that not perjury?
[02:49:58.686 --> 02:50:08.748]  I mean, you have the tape of the YouTube administrators talking about how they want Alex Jones buried.
[02:50:08.748 --> 02:50:11.468]  How is that neutral?
[02:50:11.468 --> 02:50:22.330]  How is that neutral when there is a mass purge, a mass censorship of conservatives and Trump supporters and Second Amendment activists on YouTube right now?
[02:50:22.330 --> 02:50:24.630]  How is that neutral?
[02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:25.651]  So did Ms.
[02:50:25.651 --> 02:50:27.691]  Downs just perjure herself there?
[02:50:28.795 --> 02:50:35.226]  Or was her answer constructed in the right fashion to get away with it legally?
[02:50:35.226 --> 02:50:36.127]  Let's go back to the clip.
[02:50:43.721 --> 02:50:48.906]  Several videos that were released in recent weeks that I and a lot of other people find highly troubling.
[02:50:48.906 --> 02:50:50.507]  And so I want to give you an opportunity to respond to that.
[02:50:50.507 --> 02:50:52.949]  Yeah, everyone should find them troubling, whether you're conservative or liberal or whatever.
[02:50:52.949 --> 02:51:07.743]  One individual, Abneov Vajravu, described as a former Twitter software engineer, was captured on video saying the following, quote, One strategy is to shadow ban, so you have ultimate control.
[02:51:08.675 --> 02:51:12.618]  The idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone but they don't know they've been banned.
[02:51:12.618 --> 02:51:15.660]  Because they keep posting and no one sees their content.
[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:18.462]  So they just think that no one is engaging with their content.
[02:51:18.462 --> 02:51:22.165]  When in reality, no one is seeing it.
[02:51:22.165 --> 02:51:25.447]  Is that a practice that occurs at Twitter?
[02:51:25.447 --> 02:51:29.370]  No sir, we do not shadow ban users.
[02:51:29.370 --> 02:51:33.833]  Why would this individual described as a former Twitter software engineer say that?
[02:51:35.484 --> 02:51:37.785]  Thank you for the opportunity to respond, Senator, about this.
[02:51:37.785 --> 02:51:39.806]  These folks were caught on video.
[02:51:39.806 --> 02:51:41.726]  They weren't speaking on behalf of the company.
[02:51:41.726 --> 02:51:43.387]  They were speaking in their personal capacity.
[02:51:43.387 --> 02:51:43.927]  Exactly.
[02:51:43.927 --> 02:51:44.927]  It's called candid.
[02:51:44.927 --> 02:51:45.648]  It's called real.
[02:51:45.648 --> 02:51:46.968]  We do not shadow ban folks.
[02:51:46.968 --> 02:51:56.992]  What we do do is, if an account is spammy, meaning engaging in malicious automation, we will hide, make it harder for them to find, to be found.
[02:51:56.992 --> 02:51:57.192]  Spammy.
[02:51:57.192 --> 02:51:58.152]  Okay, so pause right there.
[02:51:58.152 --> 02:51:59.873]  So you see how he left himself an out?
[02:52:00.313 --> 02:52:01.354]  So that's their out.
[02:52:01.354 --> 02:52:06.118]  Oh, well, if we think maybe there's some Russian bots or we think maybe some spam.
[02:52:06.118 --> 02:52:08.560]  Oh, right, right, right.
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:13.004]  And it's just a mistake that it just so happens to be all the conservatives.
[02:52:13.004 --> 02:52:20.972]  It's just a mistake that it just happens to be the Trump supporters that you happen to think are spammy or Russian bots.
[02:52:20.972 --> 02:52:22.893]  So that's his legal out.
[02:52:22.893 --> 02:52:24.395]  So that's how they get away with perjuring himself.
[02:52:25.353 --> 02:52:28.575]  Well, you know, we don't shadow ban anybody for their political beliefs.
[02:52:28.575 --> 02:52:29.236]  No, no, no, no.
[02:52:29.236 --> 02:52:36.861]  But we do engage in practices and we will stop things that we view as spammy or Russian botnet activity.
[02:52:36.861 --> 02:52:37.541]  We will.
[02:52:37.541 --> 02:52:38.142]  We will.
[02:52:38.142 --> 02:52:38.982]  We will.
[02:52:38.982 --> 02:52:45.407]  And then that's their legal out to say, oh, well, we just thought you were a Russian bot or we thought you were spammy.
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:47.442]  And it's total bull!
[02:52:47.442 --> 02:52:54.974]  That's a cover for a political ideology and basing your censorship based on political ideologies.
[02:52:54.974 --> 02:52:58.980]  To me, this is perjury, but they get away with it because they have the right legal answer.
[02:52:58.980 --> 02:52:59.421]  Let's go back.
[02:53:00.578 --> 02:53:02.000]  Folks were caught on video.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.942]  They weren't speaking on behalf of the company.
[02:53:03.942 --> 02:53:06.565]  They were speaking in their personal capacity.
[02:53:06.565 --> 02:53:08.046]  But they were speaking and they did say it.
[02:53:08.046 --> 02:53:09.188]  We do not shadow ban folks.
[02:53:09.188 --> 02:53:19.840]  What we do do is if an account is spammy, meaning engaging in malicious automation, we will hide, make it harder for them to find, to be found on our platform.
[02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:21.581]  If I could continue, sir.
[02:53:21.581 --> 02:53:27.463]  That was one of the reasons why the efforts that we saw with the Russian misinformation... There it is!
[02:53:27.463 --> 02:53:28.683]  ...didn't hit as big a mark as they were hoping.
[02:53:28.683 --> 02:53:29.243]  There it is!
[02:53:29.243 --> 02:53:30.864]  We were able to stop that in real time.
[02:53:30.864 --> 02:53:34.985]  The other thing, sir... Another individual named... Whoa!
[02:53:34.985 --> 02:53:35.945]  Pause right there!
[02:53:35.945 --> 02:53:36.506]  Did you hear what he said?
[02:53:36.506 --> 02:53:39.747]  He goes, we were able to stop that in real time.
[02:53:39.747 --> 02:53:41.367]  So then what Russian influence was there?
[02:53:41.367 --> 02:53:44.928]  He just said they stopped all of it!
[02:53:44.928 --> 02:53:45.829]  It's ridiculous.
[02:53:45.829 --> 02:53:47.509]  Go ahead.
[02:53:47.509 --> 02:53:49.090]  Twitter content review agent.
[02:53:50.049 --> 02:53:55.692]  Was quoted on video as saying, on stuff like that it was more discretion on your viewpoint.
[02:53:55.692 --> 02:53:58.574]  I guess how you felt about a particular matter.
[02:53:58.574 --> 02:54:04.297]  Yeah, if they said this is, quote, pro-Trump, I don't want it because it offends me, this, that.
[02:54:04.297 --> 02:54:05.678]  And I say I ban the whole thing.
[02:54:07.919 --> 02:54:17.026]  You've got discrimination suits going against Facebook, going against Google, and so Google owns YouTube.
[02:54:17.026 --> 02:54:18.307]  So they're already dealing.
[02:54:18.307 --> 02:54:20.208]  They've already been caught.
[02:54:20.208 --> 02:54:22.130]  Their discrimination is already known.
[02:54:22.130 --> 02:54:23.071]  They've been caught.
[02:54:23.071 --> 02:54:28.535]  And then here they are trying to cover for themselves as Cruz is grilling them here.
[02:54:28.535 --> 02:54:30.256]  Go back to Ted Cruz.
[02:54:30.256 --> 02:54:32.698]  We're here and they're like, oh, you know what?
[02:54:32.698 --> 02:54:33.559]  I don't like it too.
[02:54:33.559 --> 02:54:34.099]  You know what?
[02:54:34.099 --> 02:54:34.599]  Mo's right.
[02:54:34.599 --> 02:54:35.080]  Let's go.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:35.860]  Let's carry on.
[02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:36.381]  What's next?
[02:54:38.183 --> 02:54:42.786]  Is that individual describing a practice that occurs at Twitter?
[02:54:42.786 --> 02:54:43.647]  No, sir.
[02:54:43.647 --> 02:54:47.349]  We... No, he just made it up out of thin air.
[02:54:47.349 --> 02:54:51.712]  If we see an account that is being abusive... Oh, here's their new legal out.
[02:54:51.712 --> 02:54:52.873]  Abusive content.
[02:54:52.873 --> 02:54:55.114]  So pause it right there.
[02:54:55.114 --> 02:54:56.615]  So here's another one.
[02:54:56.615 --> 02:55:00.598]  So it's abusive content.
[02:55:00.598 --> 02:55:01.338]  Right, okay.
[02:55:01.338 --> 02:55:04.861]  So we take a video of David Hogg
[02:55:06.089 --> 02:55:09.612]  Being interviewed and he's struggling to say stuff.
[02:55:09.612 --> 02:55:10.953]  He's fumbling his words.
[02:55:10.953 --> 02:55:12.774]  He's messing up.
[02:55:12.774 --> 02:55:13.975]  And we just play the video.
[02:55:13.975 --> 02:55:16.377]  It's not our original content.
[02:55:16.377 --> 02:55:22.762]  We just play the content that other people have recorded and we just show you it and report on it and say, what is this?
[02:55:22.762 --> 02:55:25.905]  And then they say, that's bullying.
[02:55:25.905 --> 02:55:29.568]  They say that that's... What was the phrase that he used, guys?
[02:55:29.568 --> 02:55:31.649]  I forget the exact phrase.
[02:55:31.649 --> 02:55:34.432]  But... So that's what they say.
[02:55:35.632 --> 02:55:36.953]  And then that's their excuse.
[02:55:36.953 --> 02:55:46.539]  So he's basically admitting, like, okay, yeah, you caught us red-handed, we censor people, we shadow-ban people, and it's based on political ideologies.
[02:55:46.539 --> 02:55:56.345]  Yeah, you pretty much caught us red-handed here, but I don't want to perjure myself, and I also don't want to admit that to the public, so I'm going to construct a legal answer
[02:55:57.325 --> 02:55:59.666]  Deny that I'm actually shadow banning.
[02:55:59.666 --> 02:56:01.686]  Deny that I'm actually censoring.
[02:56:01.686 --> 02:56:09.709]  And then on the back end, protect my own hide by saying, but we do try to stop malicious behavior.
[02:56:09.709 --> 02:56:11.869]  We do try to stop spammy behavior.
[02:56:11.869 --> 02:56:14.410]  We do try to stop Russian bots behavior.
[02:56:14.410 --> 02:56:16.571]  We try to stop abusive behavior.
[02:56:17.071 --> 02:56:20.252]  So then you say, how come InfoWars is always shadow banned?
[02:56:20.252 --> 02:56:21.693]  How come Alex Jones is getting banned?
[02:56:21.693 --> 02:56:22.913]  And you know what they say?
[02:56:22.913 --> 02:56:25.034]  Abusive content.
[02:56:25.034 --> 02:56:26.995]  Spammy content.
[02:56:26.995 --> 02:56:28.976]  Russian bots.
[02:56:28.976 --> 02:56:31.997]  So they're admitting what they're doing.
[02:56:31.997 --> 02:56:33.137]  They're admitting the purge.
[02:56:33.137 --> 02:56:35.498]  They're admitting the censorship.
[02:56:35.498 --> 02:56:40.340]  But they're doing an end around and they're saying, we're just censoring abusive behavior.
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:41.520]  And so that's how he gets out of it.
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:42.741]  Let's play the rest of this clip.
[02:56:43.706 --> 02:56:51.854]  If they're being, if they're consistently violating our terms of service, but they haven't crossed the line into being suspended, we'll make it less visible.
[02:56:51.854 --> 02:56:54.136]  But what we won't do... Oh yeah, we'll make you less visible.
[02:56:54.136 --> 02:56:57.159]  Your followers will always be able to see you.
[02:56:57.159 --> 02:57:02.343]  And we are not, we ensure that if you go on... Alright, so here's the deal.
[02:57:02.343 --> 02:57:03.064]  So bring it down.
[02:57:03.064 --> 02:57:03.585]  So here's the deal.
[02:57:04.386 --> 02:57:14.613]  So Project Veritas catches the guy candidly talking about what they're actually doing, what actually drives it, why it's happening, and then in front of Ted Cruz...
[02:57:15.734 --> 02:57:24.359]  They won't admit that because they know they're in a legal situation and they are in a public situation and they don't want to admit it.
[02:57:24.359 --> 02:57:27.901]  So behind the scenes, privately, the guy may have had a drink or two in him.
[02:57:27.901 --> 02:57:29.722]  He admits what's actually going on.
[02:57:29.722 --> 02:57:33.644]  Then the official legal statement is, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what's going on.
[02:57:33.644 --> 02:57:35.905]  We're just stopping abusive behavior.
[02:57:35.905 --> 02:57:37.246]  They're very abusive over there.
[02:57:37.246 --> 02:57:38.186]  Didn't you see?
[02:57:38.186 --> 02:57:38.647]  Didn't you see?
[02:57:38.647 --> 02:57:41.068]  They played a video that's real.
[02:57:41.068 --> 02:57:41.908]  You can't see that.
[02:57:41.908 --> 02:57:42.689]  That's abusive.
[02:57:45.509 --> 02:58:04.342]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[02:58:04.682 --> 02:58:05.482]  The revolution.
[02:58:05.482 --> 02:58:07.583]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:58:07.583 --> 02:58:11.585]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:11.585 --> 02:58:18.848]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:58:18.848 --> 02:58:21.228]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:58:21.228 --> 02:58:23.870]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:26.671]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:58:26.671 --> 02:58:28.251]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[02:58:28.251 --> 02:58:29.752]  And you're purchasing the products
[02:58:32.913 --> 02:58:38.346]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:58:38.346 --> 02:58:42.816]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:52.863]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:58:52.863 --> 02:58:56.084]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:58:56.084 --> 02:58:59.785]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:58:59.785 --> 02:59:04.486]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:59:04.486 --> 02:59:07.747]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:59:08.647 --> 02:59:19.638]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:59:19.638 --> 02:59:28.186]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[02:59:29.807 --> 02:59:38.851]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:59:43.153 --> 02:59:44.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.183 --> 03:00:14.035]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:14.035 --> 03:00:20.262]  Ted Nugent is an all-American badass patriot to the core.
[03:00:21.340 --> 03:00:22.980]  And an American hero.
[03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:28.302]  Alex Jones went up to his ranch over the weekend, and they shot some incredible footage.
[03:00:28.302 --> 03:00:31.243]  That full, exclusive video will be released soon.
[03:00:31.243 --> 03:00:34.844]  But here's another snippet of Ted Nugent with Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.844 --> 03:00:46.487]  The timing of every one of these shootings, if they were using a bird gun with buckshot, they could have killed more people per shot fired than with any AR-15, because nobody's resisting.
[03:00:46.487 --> 03:00:50.628]  Three and a half inch triple-aught buck literally is a cinder block wall destroyer.
[03:00:51.088 --> 03:00:53.931]  You can be behind a cinder block wall, and I can take five of these.
[03:00:53.931 --> 03:00:56.473]  The first two will take out the wall, the rest of them will cut you in half.
[03:00:56.473 --> 03:00:56.813]  Wow.
[03:00:56.813 --> 03:01:01.277]  These are what we use when we back up bear and lion hunters.
[03:01:01.277 --> 03:01:04.700]  These are three and a half inch magnum double-aught bucks.
[03:01:04.700 --> 03:01:08.563]  And each round shoots over 30 pellets.
[03:01:08.563 --> 03:01:14.328]  So it's like, every time I pull the trigger once with that round, it's 30 people shooting.
[03:01:14.328 --> 03:01:15.389]  30 bullets come out of there.
[03:01:15.389 --> 03:01:16.870]  30 rounds come out of this.
[03:01:17.270 --> 03:01:22.793]  So this is a standard AR-15 that Eugene Stoner invented in the 1950s.
[03:01:22.793 --> 03:01:26.735]  It's a semi-automatic sporting rifle.
[03:01:26.735 --> 03:01:28.116]  It is not a weapon of war.
[03:01:28.116 --> 03:01:35.059]  No society would be so irresponsible to send heroes of the military into war with a semi-automatic weapon.
[03:01:35.059 --> 03:01:38.861]  It is not an assault rifle and it is not a weapon of war.
[03:01:38.861 --> 03:01:44.024]  It is a standard American family modern sporting rifle that shoots one bullet per trigger pull.
[03:01:44.884 --> 03:01:47.066]  One trigger pull, one bullet.
[03:01:47.066 --> 03:01:58.994]  It shoots a .22 caliber bullet, and it's available everywhere because it's such an effective, wonderful home defense, hunting, competition, family weekends.
[03:01:58.994 --> 03:02:04.818]  You know, families in America, millions of them every weekend shoot their guns.
[03:02:04.818 --> 03:02:06.500]  Problems in society?
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:07.240]  Zero.
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:08.301]  Here goes a couple shots.
[03:02:12.873 --> 03:02:23.017]  So you can see it makes a little .22 caliber hole in the target.
[03:02:23.017 --> 03:02:25.818]  And then you would have to ask an honest person.
[03:02:25.818 --> 03:02:28.799]  So you would feel okay if your kids were killed with a goose gun.
[03:02:29.733 --> 03:02:34.876]  Because you're afraid of an AR because who can't get a goose gun or a pheasant gun or a dove gun?
[03:02:34.876 --> 03:02:35.657]  This is a goose gun.
[03:02:35.657 --> 03:02:36.398]  This is a dove gun.
[03:02:36.398 --> 03:02:37.919]  This is a pheasant gun.
[03:02:37.919 --> 03:02:41.341]  And loaded with standard ammunition that's available everywhere.
[03:02:41.341 --> 03:02:48.105]  The first fully automatic rifles go back to the deck guns because they were shooting out a bunch of grape.
[03:02:48.105 --> 03:02:50.227]  I mean, that's what this is.
[03:02:50.227 --> 03:02:52.008]  This is the original assault rifle.
[03:02:52.008 --> 03:02:59.433]  Well, again, my sheriff buddy showed me his pen the other day that if he wanted to it would be an assault pen because I could assault you with it.
[03:03:00.354 --> 03:03:09.461]  So here's a standard sporting shotgun with double-aught buck that you can buy at any hardware store and any gun store and you should, all around the world.
[03:03:09.461 --> 03:03:15.085]  And by the way, this range right here is about what the shooters had to deal with because no one resisted.
[03:03:15.085 --> 03:03:18.588]  No one was trained how to fight back or how to deal with a shooter.
[03:03:18.588 --> 03:03:21.470]  So a shooter with a goose gun could have done this.
[03:03:21.470 --> 03:03:27.034]  Fire in the hole, you clear?
[03:03:27.034 --> 03:03:27.875]  It's really a walloper.
[03:03:29.980 --> 03:03:31.681]  Man, that sucker kicks!
[03:03:31.681 --> 03:03:32.981]  It's really a lot of power.
[03:03:32.981 --> 03:03:40.463]  And I know this is just paper, but it'll show you the terminal ballistics of your standard firearms in America.
[03:03:40.463 --> 03:03:46.725]  Your standard sporting shotguns that we hunt rabbits and pheasants and quail and doves and turkeys.
[03:03:46.725 --> 03:03:49.566]  And it's more deadly than an AR-15.
[03:03:49.566 --> 03:03:53.227]  This is one trigger squeeze of a 12-gauge shotgun with buckshot.
[03:03:54.651 --> 03:04:07.216]  If you really want to crush the left, and want to crush freedom haters, not only should you be a member of the National Rifle Association, but you should give away memberships to everybody you know at work, and church, and school, your family.
[03:04:07.216 --> 03:04:17.040]  The NRA should have 50 million members, because I know there's over 100 million gun owners in this country, and so far 5 to 6 million NRA members are doing the heavy lifting for freedom.
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:19.061]  That's right, the Giants only have
[03:04:19.281 --> 03:04:21.564]  Half awake and we're starting to win.
[03:04:21.564 --> 03:04:24.667]  And we've just got to get the giant fully awake and restore the republic.
[03:04:24.667 --> 03:04:27.991]  If people want to go to North Korea or Venezuela and live in hell, they can go.
[03:04:27.991 --> 03:04:30.314]  But here we're going to go back to what made the country great.
[03:04:30.314 --> 03:04:31.335]  Yeah, dude, dude, you're awesome.
[03:04:31.335 --> 03:04:32.216]  Thanks for having me.
[03:04:32.216 --> 03:04:32.636]  You bet.
[03:04:32.636 --> 03:04:33.778]  Glad to have you here, man.
[03:04:33.778 --> 03:04:34.138]  Awesome.
[03:04:34.138 --> 03:04:34.599]  Carry on.
[03:04:34.599 --> 03:04:35.319]  Keep raising hell.
[03:04:35.319 --> 03:04:37.402]  Remember, if you're not fisting off the assholes, you're an asshole.
[03:04:52.631 --> 03:04:55.196]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:04:55.196 --> 03:04:57.541]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:04:57.541 --> 03:05:00.487]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[03:05:35.596 --> 03:05:38.058]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:05:38.058 --> 03:05:40.080]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:05:41.079 --> 03:05:44.364]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:05:44.364 --> 03:05:46.387]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:05:46.387 --> 03:05:49.691]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:05:49.691 --> 03:05:52.235]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:05:52.235 --> 03:05:54.478]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[03:06:03.538 --> 03:06:13.657]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:15.043 --> 03:06:25.011]  We're entering the fourth and final hour here of the Alex Jones Show today, and I am about to hand it over to the bullpen where Gerald Cilenti is fired up.
[03:06:25.011 --> 03:06:26.933]  He's got all the news to cover.
[03:06:26.933 --> 03:06:30.435]  Again, folks, thank you for your support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:06:30.435 --> 03:06:32.617]  You make all of this possible.
[03:06:32.617 --> 03:06:38.962]  And remember, they are trying to silence people like us, people like Gerald Cilenti, and probably you, yourself.
[03:06:38.962 --> 03:06:40.203]  They'll come for you next.
[03:06:40.203 --> 03:06:42.445]  So, in these great times of censorship,
[03:06:43.025 --> 03:06:49.411]  And the dehumanizing and demonetizing and everything that we have to deal with as conservatives, it's very important to support us.
[03:06:49.411 --> 03:06:54.955]  So we've got the Defeat CNN's Attempt to Crush InfoWars special right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:54.955 --> 03:06:56.297]  So please support us.
[03:06:56.297 --> 03:07:01.201]  All right, without further ado, I hand the ball to Gerald Cilenti.
[03:07:01.201 --> 03:07:02.502]  Gerald, you're in.
[03:07:02.502 --> 03:07:03.423]  Close us off.
[03:07:03.423 --> 03:07:04.584]  Thank you, Owen.
[03:07:04.584 --> 03:07:08.787]  And very wonderful being on Alex Jones.
[03:07:08.787 --> 03:07:10.889]  And just so people know that
[03:07:11.925 --> 03:07:19.813]  This has been going on for quite some time with Google taking down those that they don't want.
[03:07:19.813 --> 03:07:25.458]  There's a site called the World Socialist Website, wsws.org.
[03:07:25.458 --> 03:07:27.359]  I go to it for a lot of information.
[03:07:27.359 --> 03:07:29.822]  I'm a political atheist.
[03:07:29.822 --> 03:07:33.425]  I don't call myself a conservative, a democrat, a republican.
[03:07:33.425 --> 03:07:34.726]  I look at things the way they are.
[03:07:34.726 --> 03:07:35.747]  But I go to their site.
[03:07:36.274 --> 03:07:44.941]  Because they do a pretty good job of analyzing the data that's put out, and they're very anti-war.
[03:07:44.941 --> 03:07:57.050]  And they put out a study showing how, I'm going back several months now, how their algorithms have really been knocked off, and how their viewership has really fallen.
[03:07:58.201 --> 03:08:03.363]  And again, I don't subscribe to their belief system, but I search out information.
[03:08:03.363 --> 03:08:06.984]  That's one of the things you do as a trend forecaster.
[03:08:06.984 --> 03:08:09.725]  You don't go to places to where you like.
[03:08:09.725 --> 03:08:12.746]  You go to places where you want to be informed.
[03:08:12.746 --> 03:08:14.847]  It's not about building your belief system.
[03:08:14.847 --> 03:08:17.008]  It's about finding facts.
[03:08:17.008 --> 03:08:19.068]  And the facts are there.
[03:08:19.068 --> 03:08:20.749]  And again, this is coming.
[03:08:20.749 --> 03:08:26.291]  We're talking Alex Jones on one side and World Socialist website on the other side.
[03:08:27.031 --> 03:08:36.513]  And you could just Google it up and you could do the research, put it right in there, and they'll show you how Google is taking down those that they don't want.
[03:08:36.513 --> 03:08:51.377]  And one after another, and ours, all the anti-war people, all the people that are against globalization and the powers to be are being hit by Google.
[03:08:51.377 --> 03:08:53.978]  And to show you firsthand
[03:08:54.861 --> 03:09:00.946]  What arrogant people Google their operation is.
[03:09:00.946 --> 03:09:03.348]  I had to take Google to court.
[03:09:03.348 --> 03:09:04.149]  That's right.
[03:09:04.149 --> 03:09:05.890]  You could Google it up.
[03:09:05.890 --> 03:09:09.493]  Gerald Cilenti, Google.
[03:09:09.493 --> 03:09:13.937]  Second District Court, Federal Court, New York.
[03:09:13.937 --> 03:09:17.680]  You know that show, Law and Order, where they show the people walking up the stairs over there?
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:19.862]  That's the place.
[03:09:19.862 --> 03:09:21.944]  It cost me well into six figures.
[03:09:22.958 --> 03:09:29.861]  Because some slimy little jerk took out a Gerald Cilenti blog spot.
[03:09:29.861 --> 03:09:32.282]  That's right, my name.
[03:09:32.282 --> 03:09:36.304]  And kept putting up fake information.
[03:09:36.304 --> 03:09:41.287]  People were calling, we were losing subscriptions by the hundreds.
[03:09:41.287 --> 03:09:43.028]  Daily.
[03:09:43.028 --> 03:09:50.711]  Because of the things that I wasn't saying, but they appeared there because this guy put up all false information about me.
[03:09:50.711 --> 03:09:52.212]  Google refused to take it down.
[03:09:53.243 --> 03:09:57.224]  I had to hire a top law firm in New York City.
[03:09:57.224 --> 03:09:59.404]  Prior Cashman.
[03:09:59.404 --> 03:10:02.985]  And it cost me a lot of cash, man.
[03:10:02.985 --> 03:10:05.586]  They lost the case.
[03:10:05.586 --> 03:10:06.546]  The arrogance.
[03:10:06.546 --> 03:10:13.088]  They brought in their top general counsel from California.
[03:10:13.088 --> 03:10:16.729]  He argued it was a First Amendment right.
[03:10:16.729 --> 03:10:19.149]  It wasn't a First Amendment.
[03:10:19.149 --> 03:10:22.450]  The judge, Kathleen Forrest, ruled right there and then.
[03:10:23.208 --> 03:10:27.270]  That there was a violation of Gerald Cilenti's trademark.
[03:10:27.270 --> 03:10:32.093]  A well-known, worldwide, for many years, an established trademark.
[03:10:32.093 --> 03:10:36.316]  It was a violation, and they were claiming First Amendment rights.
[03:10:36.316 --> 03:10:37.737]  Had nothing to do with it.
[03:10:37.737 --> 03:10:39.878]  And the arrogance of this guy.
[03:10:39.878 --> 03:10:41.599]  Well, guess what?
[03:10:41.599 --> 03:10:50.184]  The same low-life person, who we don't know where they're doing it from, now has a Gerald Cilenti's blog spot.
[03:10:50.184 --> 03:10:51.325]  He's put an S at the end.
[03:10:53.041 --> 03:10:56.405]  And Google refuses to take it down.
[03:10:56.405 --> 03:11:08.839]  But boy oh boy, when CNN calls Google the Cartoon News Network, the Crap News Network, boy do they jump.
[03:11:08.839 --> 03:11:11.922]  What a joke that thing is, CNN.
[03:11:12.895 --> 03:11:16.957]  You know, again, I go to all the sites because I need to know what's going on.
[03:11:16.957 --> 03:11:20.758]  And we're going to do some trend forecasting and show you how it's done.
[03:11:20.758 --> 03:11:22.479]  Current events form future trends.
[03:11:22.479 --> 03:11:28.001]  I have to see what's going on in the world to see so I know what I'm talking about and the facts.
[03:11:28.001 --> 03:11:38.345]  I just assume from going to different places when I get enough information from varied sources, then I see what's BS and what's hard fact.
[03:11:38.345 --> 03:11:40.386]  But I go to CNN and I go to the other
[03:11:40.971 --> 03:11:46.235]  Uh, sites in the United States to see the propaganda that they're putting out.
[03:11:46.235 --> 03:11:48.757]  And the stupid stories that they're headlining.
[03:11:48.757 --> 03:11:53.120]  And I'm going to give you an example of the Cartoon News Network.
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:54.541]  That's right.
[03:11:54.541 --> 03:11:58.764]  You go on this morning, I'm interested in what just happened over there in Italy.
[03:11:58.764 --> 03:12:00.705]  There's a Paisano.
[03:12:00.705 --> 03:12:01.526]  Ah, more than that.
[03:12:01.526 --> 03:12:03.707]  I just want to see what's going on.
[03:12:03.707 --> 03:12:06.689]  Because they have a big election they just had.
[03:12:06.689 --> 03:12:08.451]  And I wanted to see who won.
[03:12:10.325 --> 03:12:16.806]  And the election was really a good one in the terms that they just overthrew the established powers.
[03:12:16.806 --> 03:12:22.107]  And Cinque Stelle, the five-star movement, was the one that got the most amount of votes.
[03:12:22.107 --> 03:12:24.127]  They call it a populist party.
[03:12:24.127 --> 03:12:26.768]  It's bad to be a populist!
[03:12:26.768 --> 03:12:30.469]  I can't belong to the pro-American party!
[03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:32.409]  No, no, no!
[03:12:32.409 --> 03:12:34.029]  I gotta be a globalist!
[03:12:34.029 --> 03:12:36.490]  Everything's great since globalization, isn't it?
[03:12:36.490 --> 03:12:38.350]  Well, anyway...
[03:12:39.622 --> 03:12:41.163]  So now I want to know what's going on.
[03:12:41.163 --> 03:12:44.166]  So I look at, I go to Agency France.
[03:12:44.166 --> 03:12:46.528]  I go to BBC, Guardian.
[03:12:46.528 --> 03:12:49.410]  I go to, I go to Global Times, China.
[03:12:49.410 --> 03:12:50.971]  I want to see what every, Al Jazeera.
[03:12:50.971 --> 03:12:52.653]  I go to everybody.
[03:12:52.653 --> 03:12:53.613]  Guess what CNN had on?
[03:12:53.613 --> 03:12:56.876]  Hey, do you hear about the Oscars?
[03:12:56.876 --> 03:12:59.338]  Let me tell you more about the Oscars.
[03:12:59.338 --> 03:13:01.760]  I got a lot to tell you about the Oscars.
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:03.942]  Hey, you know about the Oscars?
[03:13:03.942 --> 03:13:06.604]  And then some stupid anti-Russian propaganda.
[03:13:09.648 --> 03:13:15.012]  So, as I'm watching CNN, all of a sudden, BAM!
[03:13:15.012 --> 03:13:19.195]  Up flashes this clown, this Don Lemon.
[03:13:19.195 --> 03:13:22.017]  Perfect name for the cat, man!
[03:13:22.017 --> 03:13:24.038]  Squeeze that lemon dry!
[03:13:24.038 --> 03:13:27.240]  A nothing but arrogant stupidity.
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:30.803]  This isn't news reporting.
[03:13:30.803 --> 03:13:32.804]  It's the arrogance of what they believe.
[03:13:32.804 --> 03:13:34.365]  El Prestitute!
[03:13:34.365 --> 03:13:36.527]  So we're talking Italian, yeah?
[03:13:36.527 --> 03:13:37.047]  That's right.
[03:13:38.772 --> 03:13:42.415]  People get paid to put out.
[03:13:42.415 --> 03:13:43.776]  Men and women.
[03:13:43.776 --> 03:13:46.098]  We gotta be equal here.
[03:13:46.098 --> 03:13:48.119]  Prestitutes.
[03:13:48.119 --> 03:13:54.784]  I'm doing more looking at other garbage on CNN than Anderson Cooper.
[03:13:54.784 --> 03:13:55.545]  Yeah.
[03:13:55.545 --> 03:14:02.870]  A nobody, a little boy born on third base and thought he hit a home run.
[03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:05.212]  If his mother wasn't a Vanderbilt,
[03:14:06.235 --> 03:14:13.242]  Yeah, that's what he'd be doing, driving a van maybe, and making $62.50 a week.
[03:14:13.242 --> 03:14:16.525]  That's who's destroying this country.
[03:14:16.525 --> 03:14:21.950]  The propaganda media, one after another.
[03:14:21.950 --> 03:14:25.894]  So do what you can to support Alex Jones.
[03:14:25.894 --> 03:14:28.617]  Do what you can to support the Trends Journal.
[03:14:29.631 --> 03:14:31.091]  Our publication.
[03:14:31.091 --> 03:14:42.155]  You better put your money where your mind is, because all they're gonna do is drop more filth on it and call it a truth.
[03:14:42.155 --> 03:14:45.295]  One clown show after another.
[03:14:45.295 --> 03:14:57.399]  Believing in the mainstream media is as stupid as believing in little Lindsey Graham, Chuckie Schumer, little Paulie Munster Ryan,
[03:14:58.365 --> 03:15:02.227]  Diane Notso Feinstein.
[03:15:02.227 --> 03:15:04.988]  One clown after another.
[03:15:04.988 --> 03:15:06.528]  Don't forget to tune in.
[03:15:06.528 --> 03:15:13.031]  You know, America used to, they still do, they attack countries.
[03:15:13.031 --> 03:15:17.632]  And they call them out for putting on propagandists.
[03:15:17.632 --> 03:15:19.973]  That's what we have in America.
[03:15:19.973 --> 03:15:22.794]  The propaganda stations.
[03:15:22.794 --> 03:15:25.135]  So support Alex Jones.
[03:15:25.135 --> 03:15:26.896]  Again, put your money where your mind is.
[03:15:28.404 --> 03:15:29.296]  We'll be back in a minute.
[03:15:53.735 --> 03:15:58.857]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:15:58.857 --> 03:16:04.559]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:16:04.559 --> 03:16:09.761]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:16:09.761 --> 03:16:11.702]  Choose from three health sharing programs.

[03:16:30.294 --> 03:16:33.116]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:16:33.116 --> 03:16:33.796]  Awesome!
[03:16:33.796 --> 03:16:36.878]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[03:17:59.201 --> 03:18:07.306]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:18:07.306 --> 03:18:12.590]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:15.111]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:15.111 --> 03:18:19.334]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:19.334 --> 03:18:21.776]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:18:22.456 --> 03:18:29.700]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:18:29.700 --> 03:18:37.764]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:18:37.764 --> 03:18:44.947]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:18:44.947 --> 03:18:46.408]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:18:58.297 --> 03:19:09.807]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[03:19:09.807 --> 03:19:10.727]  This is pollen blood.
[03:19:11.708 --> 03:19:24.374]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:19:24.374 --> 03:19:28.696]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[03:19:28.696 --> 03:19:32.698]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet.
[03:19:33.178 --> 03:19:43.244]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:19:43.244 --> 03:19:46.406]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[03:19:50.509 --> 03:19:52.310]  888-253-3139 You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.246 --> 03:20:19.086]  Hi, welcome back.
[03:20:19.086 --> 03:20:24.568]  You know, today I'm going to do a little bit of trend forecasting, show you how we do it.
[03:20:24.568 --> 03:20:27.068]  We've been doing this since 1980.
[03:20:27.068 --> 03:20:35.510]  And before we get into that though, again, it's very important that you support InfoWars.
[03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:37.811]  And the way you can do that is by
[03:20:38.732 --> 03:20:47.076]  InfoWars, Life Operation, Paul Revere, 2018, Mega Special, and much, much more.
[03:20:47.076 --> 03:20:49.157]  Listen, Alex Jones is under attack.
[03:20:49.157 --> 03:20:51.598]  InfoWars is under attack.
[03:20:51.598 --> 03:20:54.199]  People like myself are under attack.
[03:20:54.199 --> 03:20:58.321]  So it's more important than ever that you support the show.
[03:20:58.321 --> 03:21:04.464]  And for a limited time, they're not only dropping the price on almost all their products by 30, 80 percent,
[03:21:07.140 --> 03:21:23.909]  Make sure you support the InfoWars and get out and buy their incredible products now before the sales go back down at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:23.909 --> 03:21:31.153]  Their store is only one of the options for supporting InfoWars.
[03:21:31.153 --> 03:21:32.794]  They also accept donations.
[03:21:33.703 --> 03:21:40.907]  From fellow patriots and info warriors to grow in the fight for the truth.
[03:21:40.907 --> 03:21:53.555]  And you know, I've been around, you know, and I've been to many, many studios and I used to be on Oprah, The Today Show, Good Morning America, and their team has grown and their studios are top notch.
[03:21:53.555 --> 03:21:54.756]  And I've been there.
[03:21:54.756 --> 03:22:01.580]  And it's only with your help that they can reach the next level.
[03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:01.740]  So.
[03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:05.771]  Some of the products.
[03:22:05.771 --> 03:22:11.432]  Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:22:11.432 --> 03:22:14.073]  I love that Super Male Vitality.
[03:22:14.073 --> 03:22:16.334]  I get it myself.
[03:22:16.334 --> 03:22:19.395]  Real Red Pill, 50% off.
[03:22:19.395 --> 03:22:23.536]  Same thing with Super Male and Female Vitality, 50% off.
[03:22:23.536 --> 03:22:24.336]  True Whey, 50% off.
[03:22:32.136 --> 03:22:38.138]  InfoWars Life Select Products, 40% off.
[03:22:38.138 --> 03:22:42.259]  Clearance Apparel, 80% off.

[03:22:47.120 --> 03:22:49.001]  So there you got it.
[03:22:49.001 --> 03:22:53.422]  Those are some of the products, just some of them.
[03:22:53.422 --> 03:22:58.703]  Go to the InfoWars site, look at all they have to offer.
[03:22:58.703 --> 03:23:01.364]  And again, if you don't support them,
[03:23:03.507 --> 03:23:04.367]  You know what you're going to get?
[03:23:04.367 --> 03:23:08.208]  You're going to get Fedmore Prestitute News.
[03:23:08.208 --> 03:23:10.229]  Just like this.
[03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:11.569]  The Toilet Paper Record.
[03:23:11.569 --> 03:23:13.030]  The New York Times.
[03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.790]  This is today's.
[03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:22.052]  I'll give you an example of how they slant a story.
[03:23:22.052 --> 03:23:25.353]  Populist win in Italian vote.
[03:23:25.353 --> 03:23:28.754]  Unsettling EU.
[03:23:28.754 --> 03:23:29.655]  Populist?
[03:23:29.655 --> 03:23:30.315]  Bad!
[03:23:31.107 --> 03:23:32.127]  Globalist?
[03:23:32.127 --> 03:23:33.407]  Good!
[03:23:33.407 --> 03:23:37.388]  It's wonderful not to have your identity.
[03:23:37.388 --> 03:23:40.209]  Why should Italians be Italians?
[03:23:40.209 --> 03:23:42.289]  Germans be Germans.
[03:23:42.289 --> 03:23:44.250]  Irish be Irish.
[03:23:44.250 --> 03:23:46.330]  Polish be Polish.
[03:23:46.330 --> 03:23:49.671]  You gotta be a globalist!
[03:23:49.671 --> 03:23:50.651]  Yeah!
[03:23:50.651 --> 03:24:00.253]  Let's melt it down into a multi-national, nothing quality of ancestry country.
[03:24:01.567 --> 03:24:04.908]  Be run by the multinationals.
[03:24:04.908 --> 03:24:08.749]  Fury aimed at Brussels and immigrants.
[03:24:08.749 --> 03:24:10.409]  Ah.
[03:24:10.409 --> 03:24:11.930]  And immigrants.
[03:24:11.930 --> 03:24:16.131]  Aimed at Brussels and immigrants.
[03:24:16.131 --> 03:24:18.932]  Yep.
[03:24:18.932 --> 03:24:20.212]  I go to Italy a lot.
[03:24:20.212 --> 03:24:24.913]  Used to go all the time.
[03:24:24.913 --> 03:24:29.335]  Not the same place anymore.
[03:24:29.335 --> 03:24:30.895]  And people don't realize what happened.
[03:24:31.755 --> 03:24:35.357]  The unemployment rate there is off the charts.
[03:24:35.357 --> 03:24:40.619]  So this election, very important.
[03:24:40.619 --> 03:24:42.780]  You don't see this happening in the United States.
[03:24:42.780 --> 03:24:45.441]  People are still stuck in a two-party system.
[03:24:45.441 --> 03:24:47.762]  Can you imagine voting for these jerks?
[03:24:47.762 --> 03:24:51.103]  Oh, you don't vote, you get what you deserve.
[03:24:51.103 --> 03:24:54.045]  If you vote, you get what you deserve.
[03:24:54.045 --> 03:24:57.306]  I'm going to vote for Chuckie Shum or the other jerk running against them?
[03:24:58.143 --> 03:25:02.665]  To be a member of the Bloods in the Crypts, the Democrats and Republicans?
[03:25:02.665 --> 03:25:04.365]  New party.
[03:25:04.365 --> 03:25:05.166]  Immigrants.
[03:25:05.166 --> 03:25:08.927]  Hey, how did those immigrants happen?
[03:25:08.927 --> 03:25:23.753]  Couldn't be because Berlusconi, who lost, supported the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi back in 2011, the leader of Libya, which was the richest country in Africa,
[03:25:25.089 --> 03:25:32.413]  That provided its people with much more than many other nations do.
[03:25:32.413 --> 03:25:54.183]  A government overthrown, a sovereign nation by Italy, NATO, another little boy of nothing, or three of them, Sarkozy of France, Cameron of the UK, Obama, and pushed by, if only women were in charge,
[03:25:54.918 --> 03:25:58.481]  Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice.
[03:25:58.481 --> 03:26:01.883]  Again, I'm tired of this race, creed, gender stuff.
[03:26:01.883 --> 03:26:03.865]  Good and bad comes in all of them.
[03:26:03.865 --> 03:26:06.027]  Save your trip for somebody else.
[03:26:06.027 --> 03:26:09.189]  I've seen enough of it.
[03:26:09.189 --> 03:26:22.459]  When Gaddafi was going... Gaddafi had made a deal with Berlusconi, who was running Italy at the time, that they wouldn't let anybody coming out of Libya, because it's right near Italy, going into Italy.
[03:26:22.459 --> 03:26:23.120]  He stopped it.
[03:26:24.187 --> 03:26:26.788]  And he warned everyone.
[03:26:26.788 --> 03:26:33.969]  When you take me out, you're going to have a refugee and an immigrant crisis that you'll never be able to control.
[03:26:33.969 --> 03:26:36.050]  And there you got it.
[03:26:36.050 --> 03:26:38.891]  Nobody talks about the why it happens.
[03:26:38.891 --> 03:26:41.671]  Oh, and you know those terrorists?
[03:26:41.671 --> 03:26:44.612]  So where do you live?
[03:26:44.612 --> 03:26:46.753]  Illinois?
[03:26:46.753 --> 03:26:48.353]  Alabama?
[03:26:48.353 --> 03:26:49.593]  New York?
[03:26:49.593 --> 03:26:51.374]  California?
[03:26:51.374 --> 03:26:52.454]  Washington State?
[03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:54.731]  Oregon?
[03:26:54.731 --> 03:26:58.334]  Suppose a foreign nation came in.
[03:26:58.334 --> 03:27:00.116]  They don't like Trump.
[03:27:00.116 --> 03:27:03.278]  And they're going to bring democracy to America.
[03:27:03.278 --> 03:27:07.202]  And they invade our country.
[03:27:07.202 --> 03:27:10.024]  To bring democracy back.
[03:27:10.024 --> 03:27:12.526]  And they kill everybody that you love.
[03:27:12.526 --> 03:27:15.869]  And you have no future.
[03:27:15.869 --> 03:27:21.154]  Well, if you were going to attack those invaders, you'd be a militant.
[03:27:22.685 --> 03:27:32.614]  And then after everybody you love is dead, and you're out of your mind, and you went to their country and killed people, then you're a terrorist.
[03:27:32.614 --> 03:27:35.176]  So you know the story.
[03:27:35.176 --> 03:27:42.182]  It's only good for crazy people running government to kill other innocent people.
[03:27:42.182 --> 03:27:45.585]  But when they retaliate, that's not good.
[03:27:45.585 --> 03:27:48.167]  That's terrorism and militancy.
[03:27:48.167 --> 03:27:50.389]  So now they're going after the Italians.
[03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:58.392]  As they did the Germans and others that are now throwing out the established parties.
[03:27:58.392 --> 03:28:07.357]  And now is the time for a new movement in America, a pro-America party.
[03:28:07.357 --> 03:28:09.538]  America, yes, first.
[03:28:09.538 --> 03:28:11.379]  And that's why I support Trump.
[03:28:11.379 --> 03:28:15.180]  I don't support him on a lot of things, but on trade, I'm 100% behind him.
[03:28:17.071 --> 03:28:29.194]  I know the facts how Bill Clinton promised 200,000 jobs with NAFTA and we lost over almost, almost a million.
[03:28:29.194 --> 03:28:30.954]  Back in a little bit.
[03:28:30.954 --> 03:28:32.595]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:28:32.595 --> 03:28:38.756]  Don't forget, put your money where your mind is.
[03:28:38.756 --> 03:28:42.337]  Buy those Infowars products.
[03:28:42.337 --> 03:28:43.677]  It's extremely important.
[03:28:45.529 --> 03:28:46.933]  Very important.
[03:28:46.933 --> 03:28:51.744]  Keep Infowars on the air as others are trying to take them down.
[03:28:54.107 --> 03:28:56.668]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banyan Hill.
[03:28:56.668 --> 03:28:57.849]  You like freedom?
[03:28:57.849 --> 03:28:58.569]  I do.
[03:28:58.569 --> 03:28:59.570]  You like money?
[03:28:59.570 --> 03:29:00.070]  I do, too.
[03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:04.472]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love Freedom Checks.
[03:29:04.472 --> 03:29:11.775]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[03:29:11.775 --> 03:29:12.796]  Yep, you heard that right.
[03:29:12.796 --> 03:29:15.617]  $34.6 billion.
[03:29:15.617 --> 03:29:21.060]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[03:29:21.060 --> 03:29:23.241]  Thousands of people are already lined up to cash in.
[03:29:23.641 --> 03:29:25.002]  Take Doug, for example.
[03:29:25.002 --> 03:29:28.103]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[03:29:28.103 --> 03:29:33.565]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can, too.
[03:29:33.565 --> 03:29:34.745]  But here's the thing.
[03:29:34.745 --> 03:29:42.988]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[03:29:42.988 --> 03:29:44.029]  So don't wait.

[03:32:21.624 --> 03:32:29.413]  Zika 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.

[03:32:34.099 --> 03:32:39.983]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[03:32:39.983 --> 03:32:43.125]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:32:43.125 --> 03:32:46.687]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[03:32:50.589 --> 03:32:57.874]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:32:57.874 --> 03:33:00.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.777 --> 03:33:26.306]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.306 --> 03:33:31.330]  Hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:33:31.330 --> 03:33:44.100]  Don't forget, you're selling propaganda so they can keep selling it and they're getting everybody off the air that talks truth, freedom, justice,
[03:33:45.006 --> 03:33:47.047]  And true equality.
[03:33:47.047 --> 03:33:51.990]  So again, put your money where your mind is and support InfoWars.
[03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:53.411]  Their products are great.
[03:33:53.411 --> 03:33:54.372]  I use them myself.
[03:33:54.372 --> 03:33:58.755]  I'll give you an example of how they're selling propaganda.
[03:33:58.755 --> 03:34:02.277]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[03:34:02.277 --> 03:34:06.239]  Russians tried to sway U.S.
[03:34:06.239 --> 03:34:07.840]  energy debate.
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:11.082]  Of course, they don't provide any facts.
[03:34:11.082 --> 03:34:13.163]  Only innuendo.
[03:34:13.163 --> 03:34:14.104]  And that's all they do.
[03:34:15.990 --> 03:34:22.713]  And again, look what just happened in Italy.
[03:34:22.713 --> 03:34:23.794]  But not in America.
[03:34:23.794 --> 03:34:26.375]  You want to talk about a democracy?
[03:34:26.375 --> 03:34:37.721]  Not when you have a two club of murderers and thieves running the nation.
[03:34:38.191 --> 03:34:40.353]  Democrats and Republicans.
[03:34:40.353 --> 03:34:44.036]  How many wars do they have to start based on lies?
[03:34:44.036 --> 03:34:49.360]  And how much more of our money do they have to steal in the names of too big to fail?
[03:34:49.360 --> 03:34:56.666]  And speaking of too big to fail, in capitalism there's no such thing.
[03:34:56.666 --> 03:34:59.948]  You rise and fall on your own merits.
[03:34:59.948 --> 03:35:02.830]  Those days are gone.
[03:35:02.830 --> 03:35:04.732]  Matter of fact, talking about Italy,
[03:35:05.816 --> 03:35:11.939]  Mussolini called it fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:35:11.939 --> 03:35:23.344]  So again, showing you just how propaganda sells and what they do, here's a story in his eternity paper record, the New York Slimes.
[03:35:23.344 --> 03:35:32.368]  At colleges, protesters are typical, voters rare.
[03:35:32.368 --> 03:35:34.809]  And they go on to say, there's
[03:35:35.686 --> 03:35:45.268]  University of Michigan has a long tradition of politically active students, dating back to the Vietnam War protests.
[03:35:45.268 --> 03:36:00.092]  That is why Eddie Goldenberg, a political science professor there, was shocked to learn the percentage of students at the school who cast ballots in the last midterm election, just 14%.
[03:36:02.794 --> 03:36:03.814]  It was a wake-up call.
[03:36:03.814 --> 03:36:09.416]  Nobody realized that so few students were turning out to vote.
[03:36:09.416 --> 03:36:20.840]  Hey, Goldenberg, why should you turn out to vote for a bunch of slimy little creeps?
[03:36:20.840 --> 03:36:21.981]  This garbage!
[03:36:22.771 --> 03:36:25.512]  If you don't vote, you get what you deserve.
[03:36:25.512 --> 03:36:40.574]  If you vote for a little Chuckie Schumer, a Pauli Ryan, a Lindsey Graham, a John and Shane McCain, Mitch McConnell, look at these freaks!
[03:36:40.574 --> 03:36:44.535]  How dare they tell us to vote for them!
[03:36:44.535 --> 03:36:48.196]  We need a new movement in America.
[03:36:48.196 --> 03:36:50.476]  An InfoWars, the Trends Journal,
[03:36:51.556 --> 03:36:59.902]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others are pushing for that new movement.
[03:36:59.902 --> 03:37:11.830]  Because if we stay with the same gangsters, we'll get what we deserve, Mr. Goldenberg.
[03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:17.734]  Stupid little lines.
[03:37:17.734 --> 03:37:20.276]  It's exciting that colleges are starting to wake up
[03:37:21.786 --> 03:37:38.333]  To the role that they should play to teaching people how to be citizens of democracy, said Robert Donoghue, Associate Director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Northwestern University.
[03:37:38.333 --> 03:37:47.577]  Hopefully, we'll live up to the charge and start turning out more active citizens and not just scholars.
[03:37:47.577 --> 03:37:48.497]  What scholars?
[03:37:49.542 --> 03:37:51.683]  Yes, we need active citizens.
[03:37:51.683 --> 03:37:55.784]  Totally agree, and this is the time to rise up.
[03:37:55.784 --> 03:37:58.784]  Now, on to some other trends.
[03:37:58.784 --> 03:38:02.805]  On the economy, hey, markets up again.
[03:38:02.805 --> 03:38:04.886]  Here's our forecast for the markets.
[03:38:04.886 --> 03:38:13.028]  As you well know, Trends Journal was the first magazine to forecast the Trump rally a week after he got elected.
[03:38:14.315 --> 03:38:14.835]  Why?
[03:38:14.835 --> 03:38:16.556]  Well, we knew he was going to do the tax.
[03:38:16.556 --> 03:38:21.837]  We didn't know, but we knew he was saying he was going to give tax breaks.
[03:38:21.837 --> 03:38:23.578]  And that was going to help the corporations.
[03:38:23.578 --> 03:38:27.499]  Again, not in favor, not against.
[03:38:27.499 --> 03:38:28.699]  I'm not going to do that.
[03:38:28.699 --> 03:38:29.979]  What I'm telling you is the why.
[03:38:29.979 --> 03:38:32.220]  Because I don't agree with a lot of them.
[03:38:32.220 --> 03:38:34.901]  But I'll tell you the implications.
[03:38:34.901 --> 03:38:38.342]  So, going back to the stock markets.
[03:38:38.342 --> 03:38:41.543]  Price-earning ratios of stocks are doing very well.
[03:38:41.543 --> 03:38:42.243]  Last few years, 15%.
[03:38:45.288 --> 03:38:48.829]  Excuse me, not the price-earnings ratio, the profits.
[03:38:48.829 --> 03:38:50.810]  Profits of stocks.
[03:38:50.810 --> 03:38:51.650]  S&P 500.
[03:38:51.650 --> 03:38:53.210]  Doing very well.
[03:38:53.210 --> 03:38:55.691]  So they had money to reinvest back into the economy.
[03:38:55.691 --> 03:38:58.252]  They haven't been doing it.
[03:38:58.252 --> 03:39:10.735]  Now, going back to the markets, we said in our winter edition, Top 10 Trends of 2018, that there'd be a 10% correction in the markets.
[03:39:10.735 --> 03:39:13.036]  And in early February that happened.
[03:39:13.036 --> 03:39:13.276]  Why?
[03:39:14.289 --> 03:39:16.290]  The markets are overvalued.
[03:39:16.290 --> 03:39:18.992]  That's where the price-earnings ratio comes in.
[03:39:18.992 --> 03:39:21.834]  They're near historic highs.
[03:39:21.834 --> 03:39:28.798]  And they're overleveraged with all these schemes like ETFs and other things that are driving them up.
[03:39:28.798 --> 03:39:32.440]  Now, where are the markets going?
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:39.104]  The Trump tariffs call last week had nothing to do with bringing down the market.
[03:39:39.104 --> 03:39:42.326]  The markets were down the last two days before that.
[03:39:43.519 --> 03:39:49.122]  They're going down because of fears that the Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates.
[03:39:49.122 --> 03:39:51.623]  And it's the cheap money that boosted the markets up.
[03:39:51.623 --> 03:39:53.004]  This is a fact.
[03:39:53.004 --> 03:39:54.824]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[03:39:54.824 --> 03:39:58.206]  Companies are borrowing money for nothing.
[03:39:58.206 --> 03:40:01.388]  And that's what boosted them through stock buybacks.
[03:40:01.388 --> 03:40:04.549]  They're borrowing money, mergers and acquisition activity.
[03:40:04.549 --> 03:40:10.472]  So now the concern that we can't get that cheap money anymore if interest rates keep going up.
[03:40:12.267 --> 03:40:15.028]  They raised interest rates five times since 2015.
[03:40:15.028 --> 03:40:18.309]  The Fed rate is still only 1.25 to 1.50.
[03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:25.532]  That's nothing, when you account for inflation after five years.
[03:40:25.532 --> 03:40:28.053]  This is a war against the savers.
[03:40:28.053 --> 03:40:37.056]  When I was a young guy, people used to put money in a thing called a savings account and they get enough in their savings account and they retire to Florida.
[03:40:37.056 --> 03:40:38.677]  It's a war against the savers.
[03:40:38.677 --> 03:40:40.798]  It's only boosted the equity markets.
[03:40:42.262 --> 03:40:45.344]  Now, that's what they're concerned about.
[03:40:45.344 --> 03:40:48.685]  They can't get that cheap money because interest rates will go up.
[03:40:48.685 --> 03:40:50.726]  It costs more to borrow.
[03:40:50.726 --> 03:40:53.668]  They're borrowing basically for nothing now.
[03:40:53.668 --> 03:40:55.429]  So where are the markets going to go?
[03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:57.970]  Going back to the Trump plan.
[03:40:57.970 --> 03:41:05.794]  Already stock buybacks are at an all-time high for this early in the year.
[03:41:05.794 --> 03:41:09.976]  Because of the tax breaks and allowing them to repatriate that money
[03:41:10.458 --> 03:41:13.460]  from overseas at a very low tax rate.
[03:41:13.460 --> 03:41:15.701]  They're not putting it into capital improvements.
[03:41:15.701 --> 03:41:21.945]  They're not putting most of it into R&D or raising people's wages.
[03:41:21.945 --> 03:41:24.967]  Those are just the headlines that you're getting.
[03:41:24.967 --> 03:41:32.612]  The fact is, most of that dough is going into stock buybacks.
[03:41:32.612 --> 03:41:33.313]  What does that mean?
[03:41:34.349 --> 03:41:37.510]  The less stocks that are out there, it's a supply and demand issue.
[03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:41.371]  If there's a lot of stocks out there, the price is down.
[03:41:41.371 --> 03:41:44.792]  The fewer the stocks, the higher the prices go.
[03:41:44.792 --> 03:41:50.834]  That's why stock buybacks are so important to the corporations and the executives at the top.
[03:41:50.834 --> 03:41:54.414]  So, that's what we're looking at.
[03:41:54.414 --> 03:41:58.676]  Where will the stock markets go?
[03:41:58.676 --> 03:42:03.517]  Well, we believe the Trump rally is nearing its peak or has peaked already.
[03:42:04.881 --> 03:42:10.745]  There's more of a downside risk than an upside gain, as we see it at this point.
[03:42:10.745 --> 03:42:14.147]  And a wild card could crash this market.
[03:42:14.147 --> 03:42:17.510]  The thing to watch are gold prices.
[03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:20.192]  Right now, gold prices are slipping down.
[03:42:20.192 --> 03:42:26.356]  If the market was really in trouble, you'd see gold prices shooting up.
[03:42:26.356 --> 03:42:30.278]  So, something very important to watch.
[03:42:30.278 --> 03:42:32.220]  Keep your eye on it, and we'll be right back.
[03:42:53.817 --> 03:42:57.238]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:42:57.238 --> 03:43:01.200]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:04.541]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:43:04.541 --> 03:43:07.082]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:43:07.082 --> 03:43:11.444]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:43:11.804 --> 03:43:14.147]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:43:14.147 --> 03:43:21.175]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:21.175 --> 03:43:28.343]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:29.344 --> 03:43:34.405]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:43:34.405 --> 03:43:42.047]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:43:42.047 --> 03:43:46.968]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.

[03:44:20.055 --> 03:44:21.415]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:44:21.415 --> 03:44:23.997]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:44:24.657 --> 03:44:26.198]  And so much more.
[03:44:26.198 --> 03:44:27.539]  It is concentrated.
[03:44:27.539 --> 03:44:29.281]  You need to go read what is in here.

[03:44:38.308 --> 03:44:40.910]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:42.351]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:44:42.351 --> 03:44:44.713]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:44:44.713 --> 03:44:45.414]  Immune Wall.

[03:45:09.380 --> 03:45:10.301]  This is pollen blood.
[03:45:11.301 --> 03:45:23.955]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:45:23.955 --> 03:45:27.820]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[03:45:28.280 --> 03:45:32.764]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[03:45:32.764 --> 03:45:42.854]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:45:42.854 --> 03:45:45.996]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.

[03:47:21.124 --> 03:47:25.247]  Hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:47:25.247 --> 03:47:28.870]  I was talking about the economy, interest rates.
[03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:30.892]  So here's the deal.
[03:47:30.892 --> 03:47:36.576]  What's going to happen with the stock markets, again, it's a very different world than the real world.
[03:47:36.576 --> 03:47:39.959]  Because, as I've mentioned on Infowars before,
[03:47:41.745 --> 03:47:47.830]  10% of the American population owns 90% of all the stocks.
[03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:55.296]  Which on average is about $350,000 worth of shares they own.
[03:47:55.296 --> 03:47:57.277]  That 10% each.
[03:47:57.277 --> 03:48:03.822]  Now, the rest of the stocks are owned by the rest of us on only on average about $15,000.
[03:48:03.822 --> 03:48:09.567]  So, the stock market and the real world are two very different ones.
[03:48:10.896 --> 03:48:21.705]  So, going back to raising interest rates, they're only concerned about the big guys, so they can get more cheap dough, so they can keep boosting up the markets.
[03:48:21.705 --> 03:48:24.548]  Because there's been no recovery.
[03:48:24.548 --> 03:48:34.516]  You're still looking at the labor force participation rate at near all-time highs, or all-time lows, I should say.
[03:48:34.516 --> 03:48:36.718]  The numbers are near all-time high.
[03:48:36.718 --> 03:48:38.540]  The people have given up looking for work.
[03:48:39.884 --> 03:48:45.508]  And when you look at home ownership, back to 1960s levels.
[03:48:45.508 --> 03:48:50.791]  So, all tides are not rising.
[03:48:50.791 --> 03:48:54.014]  Going back to interest rates.
[03:48:54.014 --> 03:49:00.238]  We're already seeing the dangers that are being reported by the FDIC.
[03:49:00.238 --> 03:49:04.901]  Delinquencies are increasing with mortgages.
[03:49:04.901 --> 03:49:07.102]  All those people took out car loans.
[03:49:07.102 --> 03:49:07.883]  You don't have a job?
[03:49:10.097 --> 03:49:11.697]  Don't have any credit?
[03:49:11.697 --> 03:49:12.617]  Got no money?
[03:49:12.617 --> 03:49:13.798]  Don't worry about it.
[03:49:13.798 --> 03:49:14.878]  Just sign over here.
[03:49:14.878 --> 03:49:16.698]  You get a car.
[03:49:16.698 --> 03:49:18.738]  Right?
[03:49:18.738 --> 03:49:21.999]  What's going to happen when interest rates go up?
[03:49:21.999 --> 03:49:23.319]  You can't pay for it now.
[03:49:23.319 --> 03:49:29.380]  How are you going to pay for it when it becomes more expensive?
[03:49:29.380 --> 03:49:32.961]  Now, let's forget the individual for a minute.
[03:49:32.961 --> 03:49:34.781]  And let's look at the nation.
[03:49:34.781 --> 03:49:38.542]  Another $1.5 trillion worth of debt.
[03:49:38.542 --> 03:49:39.422]  $20 trillion in debt.
[03:49:41.207 --> 03:49:43.588]  On what is it globally?
[03:49:43.588 --> 03:49:46.528]  Almost 50 trillion.
[03:49:46.528 --> 03:49:49.329]  What happens when interest rates go up?
[03:49:49.329 --> 03:49:51.709]  You can't pay it now.
[03:49:51.709 --> 03:49:54.210]  Then you got to pay it with more.
[03:49:54.210 --> 03:50:00.011]  That's why I was saying when we went into the break, watch gold prices.
[03:50:00.011 --> 03:50:03.492]  When you see gold prices start to take off.
[03:50:03.492 --> 03:50:06.392]  And here's our forecast that you have to watch.
[03:50:06.392 --> 03:50:09.533]  Again, think for yourself as the model with the Trends Journal.
[03:50:10.245 --> 03:50:12.286]  You see gold break over $1,385 an ounce.
[03:50:12.286 --> 03:50:17.328]  Tune in tight.
[03:50:17.328 --> 03:50:22.249]  From there it has to go to $1,450 an ounce.
[03:50:22.249 --> 03:50:28.752]  When it does, you'll see it skyrocket doing a Bitcoin bounce.
[03:50:28.752 --> 03:50:35.254]  On the other hand, if you see it going down, the markets are going to stabilize.
[03:50:35.254 --> 03:50:38.575]  So gold is going to go in the opposite way of the markets.
[03:50:39.343 --> 03:50:43.086]  If the markets go down sharply, watch gold to go up.
[03:50:43.086 --> 03:50:49.272]  If it doesn't go up, the markets are not going to crash, they'll have a correction, and that's what they're in now.
[03:50:49.272 --> 03:50:51.674]  Correction territory.
[03:50:51.674 --> 03:51:01.603]  So as the markets have been going down in February, and you didn't see gold go up, you saw it go down with them.
[03:51:01.603 --> 03:51:03.544]  Very important indicator.
[03:51:03.544 --> 03:51:06.427]  And again, current events form future trends.
[03:51:07.981 --> 03:51:12.263]  Losses from credit cards mount at small banks.
[03:51:12.263 --> 03:51:23.927]  Losses after consumer hit 7.2% in the fourth quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve data.
[03:51:23.927 --> 03:51:24.847]  Okay?
[03:51:24.847 --> 03:51:28.348]  Going back to rising interest rates.
[03:51:28.348 --> 03:51:30.889]  Now, you can't afford it.
[03:51:30.889 --> 03:51:34.531]  What else will bring down the markets?
[03:51:34.531 --> 03:51:35.531]  Geopolitical.
[03:51:36.676 --> 03:51:40.138]  Watch what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:51:40.138 --> 03:51:43.859]  Watch the war talk that keeps heating up.
[03:51:43.859 --> 03:51:52.743]  Because as goes geopolitics, that could be the black swan event that could bring down the markets.
[03:51:52.743 --> 03:52:01.007]  And again, you got a bunch of sick people out there saying a lot of sick things.
[03:52:01.007 --> 03:52:04.248]  North Korea threatens to counter U.S.
[03:52:04.248 --> 03:52:05.449]  over military drill.
[03:52:06.343 --> 03:52:20.406]  Well, the one before that was that we saw little Lindsey Graham shoot his mouth off and say, eh, you know, it won't be so bad if we go to war basically against North Korea.
[03:52:20.406 --> 03:52:23.706]  But here's what the North Koreans are saying.
[03:52:23.706 --> 03:52:26.547]  They threatened to counter the U.S.
[03:52:26.547 --> 03:52:31.088]  if the United States holds joint military exercises with South Korea.
[03:52:32.088 --> 03:52:32.568]  If the U.S.
[03:52:32.568 --> 03:52:38.151]  finally holds joint military exercises while keeping sanctions on the D.P.R.K.
[03:52:38.151 --> 03:52:39.572]  This is coming from them.
[03:52:39.572 --> 03:52:40.833]  The D.P.R.K.
[03:52:40.833 --> 03:52:48.276]  will continue to counter the United States by its own mode of counteraction, and the U.S.
[03:52:48.276 --> 03:52:57.261]  will be made to own all responsibilities for the ensuing consequences, North Korea's official KCNA News Agency said.
[03:52:59.486 --> 03:53:03.987]  So, the United States has put sanctions on North Korea.
[03:53:03.987 --> 03:53:06.967]  North Korea has not invaded anyone.
[03:53:06.967 --> 03:53:09.388]  Yeah, they got missiles.
[03:53:09.388 --> 03:53:11.188]  Yes, so?
[03:53:11.188 --> 03:53:12.368]  You got guns?
[03:53:12.368 --> 03:53:16.889]  You don't use them if nobody uses them against you.
[03:53:16.889 --> 03:53:20.770]  So, North Korea made it very clear why they're going nuclear.
[03:53:20.770 --> 03:53:27.971]  Because they saw what the United States under Bush and Obama did to Hussein Gaddafi.
[03:53:29.215 --> 03:53:31.616]  And what's going on in Syria?
[03:53:31.616 --> 03:53:41.518]  If Syria was nuclear, you think Saudi Arabia and the United States would have started the war against them?
[03:53:41.518 --> 03:53:45.799]  So they're making... All North Korea wants to do is to get into the business world.
[03:53:45.799 --> 03:53:46.980]  Look what's going on now.
[03:53:46.980 --> 03:53:51.801]  The United States is doing deals with Vietnam.
[03:53:51.801 --> 03:53:55.682]  Aircraft carriers going there now, as we speak, to pay it.
[03:53:56.607 --> 03:53:57.928]  Welcoming visit.
[03:53:57.928 --> 03:54:00.169]  Say hello, we're friends now.
[03:54:00.169 --> 03:54:01.450]  Remember the Vietnam War?
[03:54:01.450 --> 03:54:09.195]  Remember the nearly 4 million Vietnamese were killed and Agent Orange?
[03:54:09.195 --> 03:54:11.497]  And 58,000 Americans killed?
[03:54:11.497 --> 03:54:15.600]  And a war based on lies, the Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened?
[03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:17.261]  So it's the bottom line.
[03:54:17.261 --> 03:54:22.084]  And the bottom line is North Korea does not want war.
[03:54:22.084 --> 03:54:24.366]  And we don't believe it'll happen there.
[03:54:24.366 --> 03:54:26.427]  Because if the United States or anybody
[03:54:27.270 --> 03:54:31.551]  Invades North Korea, say goodbye to South Korea.
[03:54:31.551 --> 03:54:38.394]  Seoul, South Korea is only about, you know, 30 miles or so away from the DMZ.
[03:54:38.394 --> 03:54:41.855]  And they have in that area about 24 million people.
[03:54:41.855 --> 03:54:43.595]  So I guess it goodbye.
[03:54:43.595 --> 03:54:45.396]  So we don't see the problems happening there.
[03:54:45.396 --> 03:54:48.437]  We see them happening in the Middle East.
[03:54:48.437 --> 03:54:50.017]  So it's a toilet paper record.
[03:54:50.017 --> 03:54:55.779]  The New York Times and all the others keep selling the propaganda of what
[03:54:56.158 --> 03:55:02.140]  is going on in Syria and blaming it on Russia.
[03:55:02.140 --> 03:55:10.824]  What they don't put in, Saudi airstrike kills 15 civilians in northern Yemen.
[03:55:10.824 --> 03:55:16.426]  The Saudis are slaughtering Yemenis basically on a daily basis.
[03:55:16.426 --> 03:55:24.669]  With weapons supplied by the United States, intelligence supplied by the United States, under Obama by the way, I'll never forget the day the war began,
[03:55:26.681 --> 03:55:30.823]  The Saudi ambassador out of Washington, D.C.
[03:55:30.823 --> 03:55:35.346]  announced that they were going to war against Yemen.
[03:55:35.346 --> 03:55:39.728]  We gotta get rid of them Houthis, I tell ya, because the Iranians are supporting them.
[03:55:39.728 --> 03:55:49.434]  No truth about that, in proof, just as though there's no proof that Russia's hacked into our elections.
[03:55:49.434 --> 03:55:53.756]  So, that's who we are, and that's where we're at.
[03:55:56.986 --> 03:56:03.171]  So, the Houthis have been there for over a thousand years.
[03:56:03.171 --> 03:56:06.313]  And Yemen was divided in the 1990s.
[03:56:06.313 --> 03:56:09.595]  And they don't want to be under control of a corrupt government.
[03:56:09.595 --> 03:56:16.540]  But the United States is also supplying the military, the intelligence, and the equipment to kill those people.
[03:56:16.540 --> 03:56:20.563]  We're very concerned about what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:56:20.563 --> 03:56:25.307]  Because if the Middle East goes down, the markets will go down.
[03:56:26.038 --> 03:56:30.959]  You'll see oil prices spike to $100 a barrel.
[03:56:30.959 --> 03:56:36.261]  Going back to the debt levels I'm talking about with consumers, they're stretched already.
[03:56:36.261 --> 03:56:42.703]  You saw the GDP numbers came out, they brought them down a little bit.
[03:56:42.703 --> 03:56:44.663]  So the consumer can't take a bigger hit.
[03:56:44.663 --> 03:56:52.226]  And it's not only the American consumer, there's a lot of problems going on over there in China too.
[03:56:52.226 --> 03:56:53.446]  And now with giving their
[03:56:54.215 --> 03:56:59.698]  Head of that country over there, supreme commander for life.
[03:56:59.698 --> 03:57:01.199]  You know what's going on.
[03:57:01.199 --> 03:57:03.581]  China's greatest fear isn't the United States.
[03:57:03.581 --> 03:57:05.722]  It's his own people.
[03:57:05.722 --> 03:57:08.103]  And 1.3 billion of them.
[03:57:08.103 --> 03:57:13.386]  They have riots and demonstrations continually over wages and inequality.
[03:57:13.386 --> 03:57:16.448]  And now the new numbers just came out.
[03:57:16.448 --> 03:57:18.009]  It's not good.
[03:57:18.009 --> 03:57:18.749]  GDP is sinking.
[03:57:18.749 --> 03:57:22.652]  Be back in a minute.
[03:57:44.053 --> 03:57:51.515]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[03:57:51.515 --> 03:58:04.738]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[03:58:05.678 --> 03:58:17.564]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[03:58:17.564 --> 03:58:23.527]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[03:58:44.639 --> 03:58:49.423]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com.
[03:58:49.423 --> 03:58:53.207]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:58:53.207 --> 03:58:57.771]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:58:57.771 --> 03:59:00.914]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:59:00.914 --> 03:59:04.017]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:59:05.532 --> 03:59:18.358]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:59:18.358 --> 03:59:33.425]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
