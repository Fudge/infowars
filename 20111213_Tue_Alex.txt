[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:34.320]  ladies and gentlemen this is going to be a syndicated radio transmission today that
[00:34.320 --> 00:37.640]  you are not going to want to miss every day is very important obviously as the
[00:37.640 --> 00:42.440]  world gets crazier by the minute as the New World Order comes in the full view
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.360]  tyrannical eugenics death cult based system of psychopathic control freaks
[00:48.360 --> 00:54.800]  setting up a global technocracy to carry out their dreams of Godhood but
[00:54.800 --> 00:59.880]  today is gonna be power-packed I had one of the most powerful interviews I've
[00:59.880 --> 01:03.440]  ever done with Ron Paul and I've only interviewed him at once or twice tape
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.640]  before but he's so busy he kept having a reschedule and I said look I'll just come
[01:07.640 --> 01:12.360]  in anytime for a tape interview and so I interviewed him right before we went on
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.840]  air today because he had to catch an airplane so I interviewed Ron Paul right
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.040]  before the show and we're gonna have that video and audio video for prison
[01:22.040 --> 01:26.840]  planet dot TV viewers audio for the syndicated radio audience coming up at
[01:26.840 --> 01:40.120]  the bottom of the hour 18 minutes now that said I really learned about human
[01:40.120 --> 01:46.680]  psychology on the drive in to work this morning they're doing construction for a
[01:46.680 --> 01:50.000]  mile and then not construction for a mile and they've got the two-lane road
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.800]  blocked down to one lane and it took me an hour to get here normally takes about
[01:55.800 --> 01:59.240]  30 minutes because a fog and rain I was coming in early barely made it I got here
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.800]  two minutes before we were set to interview Ron Paul put my jacket on put
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.240]  the earpiece in walked in they dialed him boom Ron Paul's right on to the
[02:07.240 --> 02:15.040]  interview and driving here I mean I've observed this before but you learned so
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.000]  much about human psychology when people are in cars because studies show they
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.480]  feel more secure more empowered same thing with emails people send things in
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.360]  emails that they would never say in person or even in a written letter it's
[02:26.360 --> 02:33.280]  it's just they it becomes so second nature they just do it and I noticed that
[02:33.280 --> 02:41.400]  I was driving in the fast lane and not in the slow lane in the air in the mile
[02:41.400 --> 02:45.080]  stretches where the road was two lanes we get up to about 25 30 miles an hour
[02:45.080 --> 02:50.640]  and then when you got up to the the next lane it was closed I guess for
[02:50.640 --> 02:58.240]  expansion cars would all just get over in the slow lane go to the head of the
[02:58.240 --> 03:02.520]  line and then everybody was in the fast lane would politely sit there and wait
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.080]  while they all got in front I'm not gonna say I went ahead and just drove down
[03:07.080 --> 03:11.160]  the middle lane where they're out there expanding it to get here a doctor on Paul
[03:11.160 --> 03:14.920]  I'm not gonna say I drove a little fast once I got up on the main highway or
[03:14.920 --> 03:18.080]  anything I mean I've got a car goes 200 miles an hour I mean it's only I'm
[03:18.080 --> 03:26.400]  driving fast I got here though it was like that son put your foot down on the
[03:26.400 --> 03:33.440]  pedal never mind them brakes but it all hang out cuz we got a run to make the
[03:33.440 --> 03:40.240]  boys a thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana I'm just joking hey
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.200]  I don't speed or drive fast anymore unless it's for a major Republican party
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.880]  contender who's in second place nationwide right now to do that interview
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.520]  one of the biggest interviews we ever did with Ron Paul and I drove like a bat
[03:53.520 --> 03:58.600]  out of hell once I got around that traffic I'm just okay side issue hey I
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.200]  can't help but tell the complete truth about everything I was honest on radio
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.040]  yesterday I said I don't want to go down and try to confront the Attorney
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.120]  General when he gives a speech at UT in the main conference hall at the LBJ
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.400]  Center and then I went ahead and said to the crew I'm gonna go I gotta go it's
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.920]  not that I'm even afraid of the guy I'm disgusted it's like I hate looking at him
[04:19.920 --> 04:22.520]  I mean I know he was involved in Oklahoma City I know he shipped the guns
[04:22.520 --> 04:27.880]  into Mexico killed a bunch of people I know he's evil and it's upsetting but
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.880]  actually I should go down there because every time I'm around that evil it just
[04:30.880 --> 04:36.160]  absolutely I get woken up to an even higher level in my disgust for them we're
[04:36.160 --> 04:39.760]  gonna leave it up in the air though what's gonna happen with Holder today
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.400]  anyways that'll get him running around in circles I'm not going down there

[07:41.960 --> 07:47.520]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[08:19.800 --> 08:33.760]  Alex Jones. Here we are my friends Tuesday the 13th day of December 2011
[08:33.760 --> 08:47.560]  2011 very long in the tooth the vaunted fabled 2012 is about to be here and right
[08:47.560 --> 08:51.600]  on time as we reported yesterday now Reuters and others are running around in
[08:51.600 --> 08:56.200]  circles covering it. The Iranian government is saying they're about to do
[08:56.200 --> 09:03.040]  a drill to shut down the straight of Hormuz and since yesterday's announcement
[09:03.040 --> 09:11.560]  Iran's army has declined comment on government's Hormuz exercise remarks a
[09:11.560 --> 09:15.560]  member of Iranian Parliament's National Security Committee said on money that
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.080]  the military was set to practice its ability to close the Gulf to shipping
[09:20.080 --> 09:24.280]  at the narrow Strait of Hormuz the most important oil transit channel in the
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.760]  world 40% of it goes through it daily but there was no official confirmation
[09:28.760 --> 09:36.240]  the legislature Perez Sarvari told the student news agency soon we will hold a
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.600]  military maneuver on how to close the Strait of Hormuz if the world wants to
[09:40.600 --> 09:45.000]  make the region insecure we will make the world insecure now let's stop right
[09:45.000 --> 09:52.040]  there every security analyst not even worth their salt knows it's like every
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.440]  economist knows unemployment spent above 22% for about three years not 9% like
[09:56.440 --> 10:01.680]  Obama says and he's gonna have it down to 8 by Christmas it's fairy tales anyone
[10:01.680 --> 10:05.280]  who knows anything about geopolitical systems knows the first thing the
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.720]  Iranians are gonna do is blow up some of their own derelict ships they've got all
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.520]  tied up along those cliffs there and sink them and mine that and nothing is
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.040]  going through there and anybody does they've got massive troops hidden
[10:19.040 --> 10:22.740]  missiles special forces there they're gonna be able to attack the ships it's
[10:22.740 --> 10:27.120]  gonna be a real war something the globalist army never really faces they're
[10:27.120 --> 10:30.680]  normally just murdering and killing and stomping on dirt farmers to take
[10:30.680 --> 10:36.040]  control their opium supplies now continuing regardless of what you think
[10:36.040 --> 10:45.520]  of Iran the facts are for five years it's been admitted that five different
[10:45.520 --> 10:48.760]  groups what in 2007 he made the announcement so yeah just about five
[10:48.760 --> 10:52.640]  years Bush put out a press release saying five groups four of them known
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.840]  al-Qaeda real al-Qaeda same folks they ship into Libya now into Syria very same
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.640]  names same groups same commanders on record who say they're al-Qaeda and fly
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.320]  the flags real al-Qaeda that's killed us troops they use them against Iran see
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.760]  this is real war but the al-Qaeda they hire is simulated it's real US troops
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.440]  dying real Iranians dying people are like but why they've got to have an
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.720]  enemy attacking our troops if we're gonna be there there's got to be a fight
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.640]  see the British today if Gandhi would have tried to let him hit him and they
[11:26.640 --> 11:30.000]  have with Billy clubs over in India and gone along with all that and let people
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.640]  see it and witness that the British were the ones out of control less than a
[11:33.640 --> 11:36.720]  hundred thousand of them controlling four hundred million Indians at the time
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.480]  now it's over a billion hundred thousand people controlling four hundred plus
[11:42.480 --> 11:49.160]  million nowadays they would just have some of their own people dressed up like
[11:49.160 --> 11:52.680]  Hindus shoot some British troops and the British troops would just mow
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.600]  everybody down and the Brits would get behind it because well somebody shot our
[11:56.600 --> 12:04.080]  troops how do you deal with people that don't fight you the old days you just
[12:04.080 --> 12:08.240]  had very corrupt imperial troops who loved raping and killing and slaughtering
[12:08.240 --> 12:11.720]  they called it booty they got to rape got to kill got to steal whatever they
[12:11.720 --> 12:16.600]  got and it was a culture of death and destruction and so you could do that so
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.520]  people didn't have a choice they had to fight back but in the Christian Western
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.680]  cultures in the last few hundred years especially it's been seen as immoral and
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.960]  the morals got raised higher and higher in England and the morals got raised
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.000]  higher and higher in Europe and the United States to where hey it's wrong to
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.280]  have slaves it's wrong to have white indentured servants it's wrong and they
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.440]  were the minority at first but they had the moral high ground so then new ideas
[12:42.440 --> 12:48.400]  of speaking to the heart and soul of enemy soldiers and to imperial enforcers
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.600]  and minions of what you're doing is wrong to me I'm a human being have some
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.160]  empathy this is my country it's wrong what you're doing well today the British
[12:58.160 --> 13:01.320]  would just send in terrorist and they do do this they have manuals on at the
[13:01.320 --> 13:04.880]  Republic that have been declassified from the 60s and 70s they would stage terror
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.880]  attacks against themselves against their own troops to get the troops hopping mad
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.160]  where they don't care and they'll kill any Indian they are told to so Al Qaeda is
[13:14.160 --> 13:17.880]  a simulated army they were used against the Russians the Serbs they're used
[13:17.880 --> 13:22.160]  against America to take our liberties they're used against Muammar Qaddafi and
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.640]  it's in the news today mainstream news the videos and photos of the Arab Al Qaeda
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.320]  lining blacks up and shooting them and hacking them up with machetes including
[13:30.320 --> 13:34.280]  women and children and the media is like well it's the price to get rid of Qaddafi
[13:34.280 --> 13:39.080]  flying the Al Qaeda flag and now being shipped into Syria US special forces
[13:39.080 --> 13:42.800]  massing along people say special forces don't mass oh really when they're
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.040]  training and about to command guerrilla forces that go in for street fighting
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.120]  as they do that's confirmed to be going on in Jordan I mean the whole world is
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.600]  moving right now towards regional and multi-regional war was with different
[13:57.600 --> 14:04.760]  proxy armies fighting China Russia US Europe all involved a resource war but
[14:04.760 --> 14:08.200]  the larger enemy is the people of Europe England the United States Canada
[14:08.200 --> 14:12.200]  Australia New Zealand the bankers have seized us and they know that if they've
[14:12.200 --> 14:15.920]  got wars going on will tend to circle the wagons and do what they say and let
[14:15.920 --> 14:22.040]  them have our pension funds and let them set up checkpoints and martial law if
[14:22.040 --> 14:25.600]  they do that if they have a war going so right as the world government's
[14:25.600 --> 14:28.360]  announced right as the international treaties were signed right as the new
[14:28.360 --> 14:32.280]  VAT taxes are going in right as the new world order is announced they want
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.160]  something that could turn into a program as big as World War two in ran
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.720]  corporations own words so I digress I got a lot of other news I've got a head
[14:40.720 --> 14:44.360]  here but Ron Paul's coming up here and most incredible interview I've ever done
[14:44.360 --> 14:55.360]  with him we just take it before the show but I began 14 minutes ago the point I'm
[14:55.360 --> 15:01.440]  trying to get at here with you today is this I ran has four al-Qaeda groups
[15:01.440 --> 15:05.400]  attacking them they've got military bases blown up with giant craters on the
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.800]  ground obviously those drones aren't just surveilling there's obviously be two
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.680]  bombers dropping 2,000 pound bombs on them or bigger they've got missile bases
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.680]  getting blown up police-headquarter training centers blown up general staff
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.560]  military headquarters blown up all the last year it's accelerating and Iran
[15:23.560 --> 15:30.640]  knows the plan is to get them to attack so what Iran is doing is saying okay
[15:30.640 --> 15:33.720]  you're gonna do that we've got our proxy armies ready to attack Israel on
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.000]  all sides not with missiles from Iran but through Hezbollah in Lebanon through
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.720]  other systems all of this is happening that's why Netanyahu had to fire the
[15:44.720 --> 15:48.680]  former head of the massage who told him don't do it because they understand
[15:48.680 --> 15:51.480]  what this is going to turn into and it's going to be a bloodbath and a
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.840]  disaster but the mega banks it's going to be good when the oil gets shot off to
[15:55.840 --> 16:00.360]  Europe it's going to implode even faster the globalist want to implode Europe so
[16:00.360 --> 16:04.920]  that they'll accept the banking dictatorship in their own words before
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.400]  they fully implode us and Asia Europe's next on the chopping block they've
[16:09.400 --> 16:12.800]  already destroyed Latin America they've already destroyed much of the poor
[16:12.800 --> 16:18.680]  areas of Asia they've annihilated Africa now they're moving into Western Europe
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.640]  they've already annihilated Eastern Europe now they're moving into this area
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.640]  Russia's run by corrupt thugs but they have breeding programs they don't want
[16:27.640 --> 16:32.920]  their population to go away they're not eugenicist and and Russia is not under
[16:32.920 --> 16:36.240]  the New World Order's control that's why it's the enemy and I've done a deep
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.600]  analysis of it that's the case it's its own little crime syndicate and Putin
[16:40.600 --> 16:45.280]  and others the old hardline KGB people throughout the Rothschild bankers who had
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.240]  taken control of the oligarchs and now have control of it China is in deep with
[16:49.240 --> 16:54.160]  the New World Order for my research planning a double-cross against Russia
[16:54.160 --> 16:57.840]  and Russia discovered that in the 60s when they came to the US government with
[16:57.840 --> 17:02.240]  a plan for Russia and the US to jointly nuke China and the United States said
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.640]  no and it turned out had secret envoys the whole time that's now been
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.160]  declassified turn there back and on 49 on Shanghai check y'all you always heard
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.280]  the stories about guns that didn't have bolts and ammo that didn't have powder in
[17:14.280 --> 17:21.080]  them it's now been released at our government put mouse a tongue in a guy
[17:21.080 --> 17:27.160]  killed the most people in history just like they came out five years ago with
[17:27.160 --> 17:31.000]  the KGB files in the headline the New York Times McCarthy was right it was the
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  US military at the top it was the bankers they funded Hitler they funded
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.160]  linen they funded all of it the Russians double-crossed the bankers got their
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.720]  country back and is now basically a military state with Putin as a front
[17:44.720 --> 17:50.200]  guy and they've got nuclear weapons and they will use them it was a ruse the
[17:50.200 --> 17:54.920]  Cold War was a ruse and was staged he was called Uncle Joe Stalin during World
[17:54.920 --> 17:58.400]  War two when our government knew he'd killed 20 million people before World
[17:58.400 --> 18:06.760]  War two even started but Russia is not Papa Rothschilds anymore and boy what so
[18:06.760 --> 18:11.320]  you can see how things turn around on America has been fully captured by this
[18:11.320 --> 18:16.160]  and so here's Iran under military attack under all of this putting up with it and
[18:16.160 --> 18:19.600]  they're saying now Obama says you better give our drone back or we may do
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.760]  something under the rules of war common sense you don't give back a drone you
[18:23.760 --> 18:27.640]  shoot down that's illegally over your country imagine if I ran had a drone over
[18:27.640 --> 18:32.840]  here and it got shot down and Iran said give it back so they're now trying they
[18:32.840 --> 18:37.240]  finagled that fake thing that the used car salesman was gonna stage stuff by
[18:37.240 --> 18:40.880]  the way I didn't plug this I tend to not hype things Ron Paul is gonna talk about

[18:46.960 --> 18:52.760]  talk about martial law basically being legalized in America I have a tendency

[24:14.960 --> 24:19.360]  last 30 minutes today because I know all of you out there wanted to have the
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.440]  biggest effect we bring these giant guests on and then never even really
[24:23.440 --> 24:27.920]  promo that they're coming on because I don't like to really plug something
[24:27.920 --> 24:33.600]  until the fish is in the boat it's kind of like you know dating girls in high
[24:33.600 --> 24:37.840]  school and college I don't kiss and tell and I got a little popular that way I'll
[24:37.840 --> 24:44.080]  just say you know leave it like that I always under promise over deliver in the
[24:44.080 --> 24:48.280]  fight against tyranny and this Ron Paul interview let me just give you an idea
[24:48.280 --> 24:52.480]  what's coming up and I didn't even prompting for this he was very
[24:52.480 --> 24:57.520]  friendly jovial he's normally a pretty robotic because he's so focused when we
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.480]  first talked before we taped it he seemed very upbeat because he can see the
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.200]  major inroads we're making in liberty I brought up Eric Holder and how he's
[25:07.200 --> 25:10.420]  getting away with fast and furious he said yes it's clearly criminal and over
[25:10.420 --> 25:14.880]  the top and it's a false flag I said is it a false flag in second movie goes
[25:14.880 --> 25:21.200]  yeah it's false flag so that's important because the local Republicans won't even
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.520]  go after him today had a protest on the real issues it's all you know he didn't
[25:25.520 --> 25:31.120]  play patty cake ride or whatever so all of that is coming up Ron Paul said the
[25:31.120 --> 25:38.040]  NDAA puts America under martial law as his chief campaign adviser on policy
[25:38.040 --> 25:43.160]  also constitutional lawyer where his fine is broken down that's what it does
[25:43.160 --> 25:48.880]  I brought the fact that Obama is the real political enemy and that he should
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.120]  run against Obama and point out that Newt Gennrich and others are basically
[25:52.120 --> 25:56.200]  clones of Obama with just different political camouflage he said you're
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.760]  absolutely right we should do more of that we talk strategy on air it's an
[26:00.760 --> 26:03.760]  incredible interview and I think it's better that I didn't have 30 minutes like
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.200]  I usually do because he's so busy I had like 15 we went about 16 or 17 because I
[26:08.200 --> 26:14.560]  was just firing questions bam bam bam bam and he was firing back and it was
[26:14.560 --> 26:21.400]  amazing so that interview is coming up at the bottom of the third hour today so
[26:21.400 --> 26:24.960]  you can put that on your own Twitter your own Facebook I'm gonna get Watson
[26:24.960 --> 26:30.080]  others on the horn here I just went back and told Kurt I'm gonna get him to do an
[26:30.080 --> 26:35.560]  article on the fast and furious issue with Ron Paul talking about it and I'm
[26:35.560 --> 26:41.240]  gonna get him to I'm gonna get the Watson brothers to write about the martial
[26:41.240 --> 26:47.640]  law the NDA puts America under martial law and we've got to get these out to
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.160]  people and it's another big issue he said yes I should run against Obama
[26:51.160 --> 26:54.560]  because the polls show the ones they've done that he beats Obama handily better
[26:54.560 --> 26:59.200]  than all the other Republicans and that they should focus more on pointing that
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.760]  out to people I mean Newt Gennrich is a ringer folks as the day is long Mitt
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.480]  Romney is as well now here's two articles that are up at drudge report
[27:08.480 --> 27:16.040]  dot com right now both of these a double header a double barrel blast of
[27:16.040 --> 27:23.280]  massive awakening via drudge report dot com from info wars dot com Paul Joseph
[27:23.280 --> 27:27.200]  Watson and his political scientist brother Steve Watson unannounced
[27:27.200 --> 27:34.280]  Verizon emergency alert causes panic in New Jersey scared citizens flood 911
[27:34.280 --> 27:38.920]  boards 911 boards with anxious calls it was just an accident from Homeland
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.560]  Security but no mention the mainstream media that it was the government doing
[27:43.560 --> 27:49.800]  continues Russian protesters encountered surveillance UAV thank goodness this sort
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.800]  of thing doesn't happen in the land of the free oh wait it does we're gonna be
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.800]  breaking that down as well now one thing I ran out of time with Ron Paul to get
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.080]  into is Google chairman says online privacy bill would criminalize the
[28:06.080 --> 28:11.360]  internet that's actually what it does you just says there's no freedom no
[28:11.360 --> 28:14.760]  nothing no due process they can just shut you down ban you from the internet
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.920]  it's an internet ID system we got a log in to go online anywhere total
[28:18.920 --> 28:25.360]  surveillance overkill on internet privacy Washington Post says it is an
[28:25.360 --> 28:31.000]  internet kill switch but a selective one ah who's been saying that for years who's
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.600]  been saying this for five years who I'm not bragging I want to just show you I
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.480]  live this stuff I eat drink and sleep and I dream it I know what they're doing
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.960]  I'm inside their mind you can do it too if you get into reality and study the
[28:44.960 --> 28:48.160]  enemy like any good general you will become them in your mind you will look
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.720]  through their eyes how many times how many article headlines for five years

[28:56.960 --> 29:03.200]  weekly standard MPAA head Chris Dodd on online censorship bill China's the model
[29:03.200 --> 29:10.280]  they go on to break down that it is the Chinese model you know why it's the
[29:10.280 --> 29:18.360]  Chinese model Yahoo Microsoft and others and now Google capitulated all
[29:18.360 --> 29:23.480]  built for China their internet censorship system of course it's the
[29:23.480 --> 29:30.160]  Chinese model we wrote an article seven eight years ago titled Facebook the
[29:30.160 --> 29:34.040]  trojan horse for internet censorship and we explained not this model but
[29:34.040 --> 29:38.000]  future ones where everything is big giant conglomerate sites like Facebook
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.440]  Twitter Google and then you simply get delisted off of those Congress says

[33:12.160 --> 33:18.680]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live and the wrong whole interview I did was
[33:18.680 --> 33:22.840]  so powerful you know normally I don't get up here and say oh my gosh it's the
[33:22.840 --> 33:26.160]  best one ever oh my gosh we're gonna wait till the end of the show to air this
[33:26.160 --> 33:30.040]  I mean this is a powerful interview it's gotten me on the edge of my seat right
[33:30.040 --> 33:35.760]  now running around like a Tasmanian devil with its head cut off yeah that's
[33:35.760 --> 33:39.320]  that's pretty wild isn't it they're in the breaks here but we're getting the
[33:39.320 --> 33:44.480]  mp3 of it done of the video and audio interview I'm getting it to my riders
[33:44.480 --> 33:48.120]  right now I was just gonna air it for the riders everybody here at the first
[33:48.120 --> 33:51.560]  time but then they always miss notes and stuff and then have to wait to get an
[33:51.560 --> 33:54.120]  article out so that's another reason I've decided to air it in the last 30
[33:54.120 --> 33:56.800]  minutes of the show today the interview we did just about an hour and a half
[33:56.800 --> 34:02.280]  ago because it is so powerful as I just said that way we my riders can have
[34:02.280 --> 34:06.840]  their articles ready we can air the interview then the articles go live with
[34:06.840 --> 34:15.080]  the mp3 of the audio and so believe me this has got the strategy to win in
[34:15.080 --> 34:20.200]  Iowa Ron Paul says we can win it's true he talks about the hoax of the media
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.400]  imploding saying he can't win he talks about dirty tricks boomeranging on them
[34:24.400 --> 34:30.640]  he talks about Iran he talks about all of it but he says that the NDA national
[34:30.640 --> 34:35.200]  defense authorization act establishes martial law in America we know that does
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.640]  but the fact that he's talking about it that puts a lot of light on it and he
[34:39.640 --> 34:45.040]  said it should be the number one story in America right now he's right man talking
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.080]  to Ron Paul's like talking to an 76 year old Alex Jones it's like when Bruce
[34:49.080 --> 34:52.760]  Fein was on it's like talking to myself or something he said when it's him and
[34:52.760 --> 34:56.400]  Ron Paul it's like a Vulcan mind meld they're just like on the same page it's
[34:56.400 --> 35:00.200]  freedom it's common sense it's right there Ron Paul is just a
[35:00.200 --> 35:05.240]  constitutionalist he's an American he's what the world used to love and now this
[35:05.240 --> 35:11.320]  whore New World Order devilish sold-out den of vipers globalist decepticon
[35:11.320 --> 35:18.200]  media sits there and says he's the weirdo he's the bad guy well you hadn't read
[35:18.200 --> 35:22.520]  Thomas Jefferson you hadn't read George Washington you don't know Thomas Payne
[35:22.520 --> 35:28.120]  or Patrick Henry you don't know what it is to be an American I'm sick of people
[35:28.120 --> 35:32.240]  attacking real Americans I'm tired of the homeland security and state police
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.680]  training manuals that read like a comic book if you'd have given somebody 30
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.120]  years ago these training manuals they would have laughed at you five years
[35:40.120 --> 35:44.160]  ago people couldn't believe where the founding fathers are bad and gun owners
[35:44.160 --> 35:51.080]  are bad and private property and due process and sovereignty is bad all the
[35:51.080 --> 35:55.440]  things that are good they say are bad all the things that are common sense
[35:55.440 --> 35:59.880]  they say are bad and they just try to sell it with this trendy population that
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.640]  dresses and talks like whatever the media says the mainstream media is an
[36:04.640 --> 36:13.400]  alien plastic oid manufactured counterfeit garbage that's why it
[36:13.400 --> 36:17.760]  doesn't fill you up it's why it doesn't satisfy the soul it's why you're so
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.280]  unhappy and people then burrow deeper into the system thinking it's going to
[36:22.280 --> 36:27.080]  make them happy only the challenge of liberty the animating contest of liberty
[36:27.080 --> 36:33.800]  that's the only thing that's going to fulfill you only facing danger that is
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.600]  the only thing that's going to fulfill you only helping the average person and
[36:38.600 --> 36:45.920]  being aware and focused and wise is going to fulfill you no amount of liquor
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.280]  no amount of sex no amount of entertainment is going to fulfill you
[36:51.280 --> 36:57.240]  life is about struggle and there's an old saying pain is weakness leaving the
[36:57.240 --> 37:03.080]  body but not just physical pain having people make fun of you having people
[37:03.080 --> 37:10.340]  laugh at you that may hurt some people but over time you will learn to enjoy it
[37:10.340 --> 37:18.800]  in not in a masochistic way you will learn to enjoy it in a sad way like it
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.160]  has to be done and too bad for these poor people that are attacking you but
[37:23.160 --> 37:25.920]  the fact that they're attacking you means you're getting to them so there's
[37:25.920 --> 37:32.520]  enjoyment in you know it's not enjoyable to lance a boil on your dog it's kind of
[37:32.520 --> 37:36.400]  gross to stick the needle in and watch the pus pour out at an old dog I had to
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.800]  do that a few times for and the vet I worked for you taught me how to do it
[37:40.800 --> 37:47.640]  and but it but there was still at a certain level a satisfied feeling after
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.360]  you've done it after you put alcohol on it and cleaned it you didn't like it you
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.400]  didn't like looking at it you didn't like having to deal with it but at a
[37:55.400 --> 38:04.160]  spiritual level you were helping that animal you were lancing the boil it's
[38:04.160 --> 38:08.200]  the same thing doctors get when people that aren't used to it see chopped open
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.160]  bodies little kids faces blown off they get freaked out doctors are focused
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.680]  helping them trying to save them and so it actually becomes just a blur and they
[38:18.680 --> 38:24.000]  can focus and do things that are horrible but to the eyes and to the nose
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.280]  into the and to the psyche but it's good in the final equation because you're
[38:29.280 --> 38:36.880]  helping someone I'm starting to preach here and I've just got so much news I
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.080]  want to get to here's what I want to do I want to open the phones up about all
[38:41.080 --> 38:43.960]  the things happening in the world the Iranians threatening to close the
[38:43.960 --> 38:52.520]  trade of Hormuzh which is a provocation they're looking for the middle way
[38:52.520 --> 38:57.080]  they're allowing the West to bomb them blow stuff up destabilize them put
[38:57.080 --> 39:00.440]  sanctions on them to shut them down China has said they'll come to their aid
[39:00.440 --> 39:03.640]  China has said prepare for war with the United States that's back in the news
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.160]  their president has said that not just some general because it's cutting off
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.760]  their oil but that's a double game they'll probably abandon them in the
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.560]  final equation Iran thinks that it can just threaten to block the straight or
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.560]  do it if if the covert bombings continue and the West is just going to hike that
[39:21.560 --> 39:28.120]  up the West may even attack them because they're not giving the spy plane back if
[39:28.120 --> 39:34.320]  Iran fires back when the West bombs them in a major aerosol it will be called
[39:34.320 --> 39:38.920]  terrorism to fire back again it's bad when other governments torture good one
[39:38.920 --> 39:46.080]  ours does it it's all part of this mentally ill soft-brained craziness of
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.960]  all the good old boys I mean I see it in every movie I watch now that's an action
[39:50.960 --> 39:58.680]  film I watched X men first class on the treadmill mindless join the military
[39:58.680 --> 40:08.960]  brainwashing targeting young people all sorts of programming in it and in it the
[40:08.960 --> 40:14.040]  good guys torture though the woman to get the answers and it's good that they
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.200]  torture her and they get the answers and it's in every movie torture gets
[40:18.200 --> 40:26.360]  results no it doesn't it gets fake confessions and if you've got a government
[40:26.360 --> 40:32.640]  torturing people look out the Nazis knew to hide it only in America when they
[40:32.640 --> 40:38.760]  come out and meant they're doing it you get rid of those protections it's all
[40:38.760 --> 40:45.080]  gone why do they want to hear any people say well I'm a good person I'm a good
[40:45.080 --> 40:49.520]  person I don't do anything wrong why do they want to be they're bad they want you
[40:49.520 --> 40:58.440]  to be their slave don't you get it's called slavery it's called tyranny the
[40:58.440 --> 41:01.880]  global is at the top do want to dominate everything because they like to be in
[41:01.880 --> 41:09.480]  control I saw an article in Reuters earlier in fact let me just pull it up
[41:09.480 --> 41:20.600]  right here squeezed Britons avoid hotel and car trips there's such massive taxes
[41:20.600 --> 41:27.840]  on cars tracker chips taxes gas taxes VAT hotels that they're just avoiding
[41:27.840 --> 41:33.240]  hotel and car trips and they say because they're angry about all of it no it's
[41:33.240 --> 41:36.920]  because they they're being bankrupted and the media will act like oh how do we
[41:36.920 --> 41:39.720]  fix this and they'll have some government program where they cut some
[41:39.720 --> 41:45.720]  little small tax to act like they want to incentivize it you think the TSA is
[41:45.720 --> 41:51.640]  upset we lose 40 billion a year in tourism you think the TSA is upset
[41:51.640 --> 41:56.600]  that tourism shutting down on this country they love it it's called a post
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.480]  industrial world they want to get rid of all the middle class wealth they want to
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.360]  get rid of even the higher level fortune 500 where there's only the fortune
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.360]  100 they're waging war against the free market and wealth because wealth makes
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.600]  you free and uppity you know I've got articles here and I'm looking for the
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.720]  clip because I heard it on 590 radio this morning the speech of the San Antonio
[42:22.720 --> 42:32.160]  bishop and I've got the letter here arch diocese of San Antonio all 33 Roman
[42:32.160 --> 42:39.120]  Catholic bishops were leased on Monday a strongly worded letter to immigrants
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.520]  saying illegal immigrants deserve to be Americans and calling for denunciation
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.600]  of the forces which oppressed them now this is sedition within the country and
[42:48.600 --> 42:54.960]  actually heard the the speech of the of the San Antonio bishop saying that
[42:54.960 --> 42:58.560]  Catholics that didn't support open borders and total amnesty were bad
[42:58.560 --> 43:05.440]  Catholics and then they got some of that language in the letter and saying
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.240]  legalize everyone there's no such thing as an immigrant that is or a migrant that
[43:09.240 --> 43:13.240]  that is and that Jesus was a migrant and that you've got to do it's pure Ford
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.640]  Foundation liberation theology let me explain to folks how the real world
[43:17.640 --> 43:23.960]  works here I've walked into gas stations here and stores and I've had
[43:23.960 --> 43:27.480]  Hispanic people behind the counter say Alex I've always liked your show but
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.080]  you're supporting what Arizona is doing they're gonna arrest all the Hispanics
[43:31.080 --> 43:34.960]  in America and and and they hate us and all the stuff and I look at them and I
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.920]  say that may be the case with some black people or white people but a very
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.040]  small percentage I look at them and I say do you understand that the people
[43:44.040 --> 43:48.320]  looting the banks going after our guns private property do you understand that
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.680]  they are for open borders you understand the UN is you understand the UN
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.000]  murders people all over the world you understand the UN is pushing with
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.680]  taxpayer money to inoculate every Hispanic child in Mexico starting with
[44:00.680 --> 44:05.920]  girls do you know it's been linked to cancer and infertility and they go oh
[44:05.920 --> 44:11.040]  and I go yeah the people patting you on the head and telling you that they care
[44:11.040 --> 44:15.080]  about you and that they want to take good care of you and that oh my gosh
[44:15.080 --> 44:18.840]  America's evil let's have open borders they're not telling you about the
[44:18.840 --> 44:22.800]  Gardasil shot are they you know about that and they're like yeah I actually did
[44:22.800 --> 44:25.520]  hear about people die from that and that's right oh but you're not going to
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.560]  hear Lulac or La Raza which means the race let me go one further can I have
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.280]  an organization called the white race why can you have an organization called
[44:33.280 --> 44:36.480]  the race oh I know because you're downtrodden listen I don't care what
[44:36.480 --> 44:40.760]  color you are but let me ask you this next question this is an enemy people
[44:40.760 --> 44:43.640]  backing up behind me let me ask you this next question because you said that
[44:43.640 --> 44:49.440]  kind of accusatory okay let me ask you another question here you know the
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.000]  illegal aliens oh I know you don't like that term but that's what it's called in
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.800]  Mexico if I go down there who has some of the most draconian immigration laws they
[44:55.800 --> 45:00.320]  start laughing well that's true yeah oh yeah you know about that good well let's
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.580]  go one further it's hypocritical but but let's go even further let's expand on
[45:05.580 --> 45:12.160]  that you know how 90 plus percent of these illegals end up voting illegally
[45:12.160 --> 45:14.920]  and once they become citizens you know because they the Democratic Party is
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.880]  their friend by then it's like hey come on buddy I'm like hold on I'm sorry or go
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.120]  ahead start paying here but I'm gonna talk to him you buy that I'm usually
[45:22.120 --> 45:26.200]  being interrupted I've probably done this 50 times with just on the streets
[45:26.200 --> 45:33.560]  and in malls in Los Angeles you name it let me go one even further for you hey
[45:33.560 --> 45:37.640]  let me expand on this for you how the 90 plus percent of them vote hard core
[45:37.640 --> 45:46.480]  liberal Democratic total gun ban total private property ban now I am 100%
[45:46.480 --> 45:52.920]  just on that issue have to be against the giant Latin American the surge into
[45:52.920 --> 45:58.440]  this country because of the minds and the hearts the big banks have taught for
[45:58.440 --> 46:04.080]  decades in Latin America and through the Ford Foundation with billions of
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.720]  dollars a year on record billions a year Bill and Linda Gates Foundation all
[46:08.720 --> 46:11.800]  of it but Ford Foundation alone billions a year they got something like 50
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.240]  billion in their foundation invested in things tax-free and they use it against
[46:16.240 --> 46:24.160]  this country the Ford Foundation is all down there all over Latin America saying
[46:24.160 --> 46:27.720]  America is yours the US is yours you're gonna take it you're gonna take it over
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.200]  and communism is the answer to the evil of America when the mega banks want
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.640]  communism to destroy the middle class they want to make the United States just
[46:36.640 --> 46:43.600]  like Nigeria just like Romania just like Mexico and they've got people so
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.600]  feeling like they've been persecuted and treated wrong that all over the United
[46:48.600 --> 46:51.680]  States you can't wear American flags in public schools you were sent home
[46:51.680 --> 46:56.240]  because that's an offensive symbol MSNBC Associated Press pull it up Texas
[46:56.240 --> 47:01.440]  Arizona California American flags on businesses are pulled down American
[47:01.440 --> 47:07.000]  flags on government buildings on post offices are pulled down and the Mexican
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.360]  flag is run up I mean you would be beaten to death if you did that in Mexico
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.840]  because again even US schools came out in Texas all over the state they
[47:15.840 --> 47:20.880]  pledge allegiance to the Mexican flag every day they even told the Latin
[47:20.880 --> 47:24.200]  American kids well it a matter of you're from other Latin American countries you
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.480]  have to pledge allegiance Mexico is so nationalistic and America's been taught
[47:28.480 --> 47:34.120]  our nationalism is bad that they tell people from Puerto Rico from Venezuela
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.640]  from Brazil I've talked to you are a Mexican now and you're gonna pledge
[47:39.640 --> 47:44.120]  allegiance to the Mexican flag I mean it's cuckoo you don't wear American flags
[47:44.120 --> 47:47.440]  of the school and you pledge allegiance to the Mexican flag I mean just type in
[47:47.440 --> 47:50.200]  school pledges allegiance to the Mexican flag folks they were doing that when I
[47:50.200 --> 47:53.080]  was going to Anderson High
[47:54.760 --> 48:00.560]  this is what goes on in this country I was in art class and the Ford Foundation
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.640]  white art teacher taught me America was evil white people were evil and Texas
[48:04.640 --> 48:09.240]  was Mexico and we were taken to UT to be brainwashed at the Art Center by La
[48:09.240 --> 48:12.520]  Reconquista guy that America was evil and I was like Santa Anna was a
[48:12.520 --> 48:15.480]  dictator there were six flags over you know there were all these flags over
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.960]  Texas Mexico couldn't hold this area Mexico lost Guatemala because they
[48:19.960 --> 48:24.000]  couldn't hold it what is Mexico was a Spanish deal don't sit there and say
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.480]  that oh this belonged to Mexico there was nothing here
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.560]  Mexico couldn't kick out all the Indians who by the way they were hunting
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.880]  down and exterminating that was the way of the old world and so they called in
[48:37.880 --> 48:43.360]  the Tennesseans who were known to go head up to three to up three to one if
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.120]  they had to that's the stuff they don't all the all the westerns are set the
[48:46.120 --> 48:52.160]  1718 I mean in 1770 1780 or so out west that was nothing I'm talking about wars
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.120]  with you know 20,000 Tennesseans against a hundred thousand natives I'm talking
[48:58.120 --> 49:02.440]  about whole cities burned tens of thousands dead mass wars that you don't
[49:02.440 --> 49:06.320]  even know about in your history and Mexico said we said we can't hold this
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.000]  come in here and they said by the way now that you've kicked all the Indians
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.560]  out we want your guns and we're kicking you out and they said you know what we
[49:13.560 --> 49:18.000]  just told King George 50 something years ago 60 years ago to take a hike my
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.880]  granddaddy kicked George the third's butt come and take it you want some of
[49:22.880 --> 49:26.840]  this you're gonna get it and they don't tell you that a Hispanic wrote the
[49:26.840 --> 49:30.640]  Constitution they don't tell you about 45% of the fighters were spanning or a
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.280]  third of the signers they steal your heritage as a Texan they steal your
[49:35.280 --> 49:38.800]  heritage of liberty they play everybody off against each other they make it all
[49:38.800 --> 49:44.080]  about how it's race in this country I mean if I was a Hispanic from Texas I
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.080]  would be proud and let me tell you there's 6,700,000,000 people that want to
[49:49.080 --> 49:52.120]  come here and when they get here the Democrats and Republicans put them on
[49:52.120 --> 49:57.360]  welfare they they get left alone by the police because there's an incentive now
[49:57.360 --> 50:00.520]  once you're a citizen they throw the book at you and being a citizen in the
[50:00.520 --> 50:06.040]  US is known as being a moron but the point is is that we could probably take
[50:06.040 --> 50:08.840]  30 million illegals here you know they've driven down the wages and all
[50:08.840 --> 50:12.640]  the rest of it I'd say okay if you start buying machine guns and getting into
[50:12.640 --> 50:16.440]  freedom and talking bad about the New World Order and defeating the New World
[50:16.440 --> 50:19.920]  Order I'd say you know what 30 million it's gonna drive the wages down and hurt
[50:19.920 --> 50:26.080]  a lot of stuff but it'll work no then the SPP North American Union documents
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.320]  the immigrant plan is the plan to bring us down and to outvote people that want
[50:30.320 --> 50:36.000]  liberty I don't care what color your skin is or what color your hair is okay
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.600]  the point is it's what's in your mind and this is a New World Order program and
[50:40.600 --> 50:45.440]  now they got the Catholic Church here involved in our internal operations in
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.480]  involved in sedition and the Catholic Church is involved in sedition in our
[50:50.480 --> 50:55.200]  country and it's a foreign power and I and people that I draw the line here

[53:57.120 --> 54:13.480]  for MDS forte a diabetes breakthrough you know you notice that when some
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.240]  Baptist church calls for a anti-gun bill to be struck down a state level the
[54:18.240 --> 54:23.560]  fed swoop in and threaten to take their 501c3 Congress shall make no law
[54:23.560 --> 54:26.920]  respecting an establishment religion of prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[54:26.920 --> 54:30.760]  and the government has taken that and twisted to say that churches don't have
[54:30.760 --> 54:36.840]  free speech churches do have total free speech but you see it's turned around
[54:36.840 --> 54:47.680]  now by the modern interpretation of this you have the 30th plus of the 33 of the
[54:47.680 --> 54:53.240]  Hispanic Roman Catholic bishops it totally racial saying that you've got
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.560]  to legalize all the illegals okay legalize this 30 million and then I
[54:57.560 --> 55:01.280]  guess the next 30 million and the next 30 million and the next 30 million and
[55:01.280 --> 55:04.960]  when they get here the government is there trying to put them on welfare the
[55:04.960 --> 55:11.400]  country is going bankrupt and then the very same churches teach liberation
[55:11.400 --> 55:16.800]  theology and demonize this country and I'm sick of it I'm tired of it and it
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.280]  goes on at the Methodist Church here in Austin I mean I've been to a major
[55:23.280 --> 55:26.640]  Methodist church that had a different preacher before and I went back there
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.480]  because I go there with family sometimes and it was all Miller Melinda Gates and
[55:30.480 --> 55:36.720]  open the borders up and everything else I mean it's just everywhere everywhere
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.680]  and it was preachers that led the war for independence in 1776 and now it's in
[55:42.680 --> 55:46.520]  the case of the Vatican though it is a foreign sovereign power and I don't get
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.240]  into Catholic bashing Mormon bashing any of it here folks I know a lot of great
[55:50.240 --> 55:54.680]  Catholics Mormons whatever I just love God I'm not involved in any of this you
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.200]  know in fighting and stuff but come on I mean if you heard the clips I heard we
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.400]  found some of them we haven't found the exact clips of the San Antonio bishop
[56:02.400 --> 56:09.560]  that I heard on 590 this morning on the morning show they played a bunch of it
[56:09.560 --> 56:17.720]  and I mean it's just unbelievable but here's the letter I mean do I have a
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.760]  right to migrate to Mexico no I don't Mexico has some of the most draconian
[56:21.760 --> 56:29.000]  laws in the world on immigration and it's always about the heart have a heart
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.920]  and there's all these programs but have a heart have a heart obviously immigrant
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.960]  workers help this country in many respects but in many respects politically
[56:39.960 --> 56:46.840]  they're voting for gun control they're voting for socialism I mean look at
[56:46.840 --> 56:51.040]  what's happened in California because they see the Democratic Party as their
[56:51.040 --> 56:55.720]  friends and again I'm gonna say it I know it's fun to get racially upset and
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.560]  fight with each other I know it feels good at a primitive level for whites
[56:58.560 --> 57:02.640]  Hispanics everybody but where's the Hispanic group talking about Gardasil
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.960]  to be given to every Mexican school child see I actually that was a globalist
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.680]  I'd act liberal and oh I love you take this shot then you can't have kids see
[57:11.680 --> 57:17.160]  I actually want everybody to live I love black children white children
[57:17.160 --> 57:22.200]  Hispanic children everybody I'm into life I don't want women to wonder why
[57:22.200 --> 57:26.520]  they're sterilized or wonder why they have autoimmune diseases or cancer but

[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.320]  probably well undoubtedly the most powerful Ron Paul interview I've ever
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.360]  done I had to do it tape today because he's so busy I did it right before I
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:44.280]  finished it up before the show aired live today and so I've got that crunched
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.680]  down into an MP3 to get out to everybody you know once we launch it an
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.200]  articles that are coming out at 1 30 central today or about an hour and a
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.440]  half from now and we're also gonna air it with the audio in the video here so
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.600]  coming up it was amazing talk about false flag terror shipping the guns into
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:07.920]  Mexico he talked about well he just opened up on Obama and he also got into
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.960]  how he can win he got into the NDAA being martial law it's all there I mean
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:20.360]  it's big and so we got two drudge lengths today Russian drones watching
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.360]  people and we've also got this report here that I'm gonna get to after we take
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.760]  some calls dealing with all this internet censorship the incredible
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.680]  admissions of it and also unauthorized Verizon emergency alert causes panic in
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:44.840]  New Jersey that's only part of it it's just gonna get crazier from here on out
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:50.040]  how you got the Catholic bishops coming out and basically saying there is no
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.360]  such thing as a migrant no such thing as an immigrant open all borders to 6
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:01.400]  billion 700 million people I mean it's it's it's incredible the US has the most
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.600]  lenient immigration policies in the world and the criminals that run the
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.040]  government have done everything they can to turn the immigrants against this
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:14.240]  country and the brainwashing and tournament of political tools and now
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.560]  that's happened and we're gonna fall like the Roman Empire because of it God
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:27.440]  helped this country God helped this country where it's going because the
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.560]  globalists know how to use divide and conquer that's what they did on Libya we've
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.320]  got to rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution across racial religious
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.600]  grounds and we've got to get into liberty it's our only hope freedom is
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:48.600]  what gives our children a future freedom is what gives us dignity freedom and
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.720]  Mexico is a completely failed state we talk about Mexico all day because 81
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.320]  percent of the immigrants in this country are from Mexico Mexico is a failed
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.800]  darko terror state allied with Wall Street that's helped enslave that country
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.760]  and they're now going to the same thing here and it's the same thing they're
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.760]  going to jack up the taxes socialism is going to be brought in just like a Latin
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.000]  American country or an African country or a country in Eastern Europe and there's
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.480]  going to be no voting against the immigrants period 10 to vote from all
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.320]  over the world even when they come from Eastern Europe and communism and hate
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.240]  it pretty soon the handouts get them to vote for it and they're going to vote

[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.680]  up with that news report where the Catholic Church says no one's any legal
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.200]  legalize everybody you got Newt Gennrich supporting it the big mega banks the
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.880]  fortune 500 the whole system supports it why because it will drive down the
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:32.920]  wages it will implode the United States the globalist want to use low wages and
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.440]  and economic tyranny in their own words their own post-industrial system to
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.040]  destroy any middle class that's what I want I want everybody to be prosperous
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.720]  and a strong middle class for every race color and creed I know what comes around
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.840]  goes around I want to develop civilization I want humanity to work
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.200]  together but the globalists are in control only a few thousand of them
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.440]  because they know how to play different grips off against each other and you
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.320]  look at Eric Holder last year saying he wants the UN to oversee US elections the
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.680]  UN runs mass murder all over the world they line up Latin Americans and
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.160]  Africans and shoot them even the New York Times admits to take their property
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.920]  they inject people all over the world with sterilants and cancer viruses on
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.120]  record and you tell that to one of these la reconquista people they go shut up

[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.760]  you are and it'll be like you know rich Hispanic and white kids kind of swaggering
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.840]  around trust fund kids going shut up fascist pig and I'm like but it's a
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.320]  eugenics program they're killing everyone it's soft kill weapons you know
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.880]  you need to be against it shut up pig racist I'm like oh you don't want to
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.240]  hear about the UN plan to cut off the food and actually kill the brown people
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:51.120]  no it's just about hating American liberty it's like let's get the gringo burn
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:58.600]  the Constitution it's a psychological warfare program and only by being aware

[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.840]  children's genitals grabbed the ban would be put in place until the scanners
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.920]  have successfully been proven safe and of course they block that information
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:34.280]  the fact that it's dangerous okay then I'll get into the incredible I mean

[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.880]  told you their plan they added an international treaty years ago to do
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.920]  this you see they were going to cover up fast and furious the internet and
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.800]  alternative news got the documents that came out in court cases and forced the
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.480]  mainstream media to cover it they can't continue to operate if we've got the
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.680]  internet do you understand that folks so they're going to selectively start
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:39.200]  shutting everybody down and they admit it and the Pentagon runs it the Pentagon
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:44.800]  runs the new rural affairs system over all the states the TSA is announcing and
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.640]  doing highway checkpoints Ron Paul coming up taped the interview before the
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.360]  show said the NDAA is martial law and the Eric Holder what he's done is
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.360]  criminal of course it is and he can get away with it now they've dropped the
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.720]  investigation basically in Congress and said it's up to Obama now he's been
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.000]  caught perjuring himself he's been caught shipping the guns into Mexico and
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.160]  the memos Republic they were going to blame the Second Amendment and they just
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.840]  sit there and get away with it why because the Republican leadership is
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:21.400]  involved as well pre-Obama they were shipping guns into Mexico to knock off
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.080]  cartels and you know there's always truth to globalist lies they do something
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.920]  then blaming on somebody else when people in Latin America wonder why
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.800]  they're so enslaved it is to a great extent the United States that did it
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:36.240]  but it's the bankers running us that did it and now they're doing the same thing
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.400]  to us the Mennonites are supplying half the food in places like Paraguay
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:48.000]  there's only 60 70 80,000 of them only 40,000 adults the UN is moving to shut
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.400]  them down and not let them farm so people will die and they're using race
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.200]  because the Mennonites stay in their own group to keep their religion I mean
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.240]  when they're in Germany they don't breathe with other Germans when they're
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:02.960]  in Russia and there's German communities next door they're on the frontier when
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.720]  they're in the US they don't intermarry people with German surnames because it's
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:11.040]  a anti-baptist group they're using race there and they're probably gonna shut
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.600]  them down the Paraguay get out whitey okay goodbye we're gone half the food
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.240]  gone tens of millions of people half the food produced by 40,000 adults
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:27.000]  goodbye bye-bye gringo the UN knows just how to operate here come the Mennonites
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.680]  down the road they throw a hangar date in blue blow the whiteies up and it's
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.360]  trendy and liberal because the UN does it the UN wants all those people starving
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  to death you see you got to figure out how this works my dad was just down there
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.320]  at a soccer game he was down there helping poor kids but they took him to
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.760]  soccer even it got through a the media said a hangar date my dad was so close

[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.280]  them and happy holidays did you know that Michael Jackson when he did his this
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.500]  is it the world tour just before the start of that he was warning the people
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:02.080]  about 2012 I knew that he was making anti-establishment comments and things
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.200]  but I never really followed up on it and I get a lot of emails about that what
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.880]  do you know about it well he said I was looking on YouTube because YouTube has
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.320]  you know thousands of things that are there they're quite fascinating and in
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.840]  his warning he says we have less than this is like in 2008 2009 we have less
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.240]  than three years to do something about this about what's going on in the world
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.800]  worrying about the New World Order and so on so forth or it's going to be
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.520]  irreversible look it's going to be too late you know I need to look that up
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.200]  because I get emails about that all the time but you say you heard it very
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.600]  interesting no I didn't really follow that up right now two more items really
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.440]  quick Alex and I'll let you go ahead the call I just you know by surprise I
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.760]  went to the mailbox yesterday and I did receive a cost of living increase from
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:53.400]  social security well they said they were freezing the colors still right right
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:59.720]  I got I got them both yesterday I got a $46 increase for January 2012 so I think
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.360]  what's going on is they know that they're gonna there's gonna be a
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.720]  devaluation of the currency quite quite greatly so I think I think that the
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.000]  reason why they're sending them is because we're going to go into hyper
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.960]  inflation for sure I've got a big stack of news today mainstream basically saying
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.440]  that's the case good to hear from you great points Ted in Tennessee you're on
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:27.600]  the air Alex Ted I just want to say I enjoy your program thank you I find it
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:33.120]  very interesting I have one question you're talking about the oil being shut
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.360]  down in Iran most of that oil goes to Europe doesn't actually affect the
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.920]  United States exactly which the globalists want to
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.640]  implode Europe first yes you now you get it refineries here in the United
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:49.840]  States we make about what four to five billion gallons or billion barrels I was
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:56.640]  just looking at the list every day and most of that is shipped out so why don't
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.960]  we just are you sure I think you're talking about million because the US uses
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.640]  25 million barrels a day last time I checked and I think exports about 10
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:09.680]  million barrels I just went through the list on all the 200 refineries most of
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.160]  them are owned by foreign countries and that oil is processed here in the United
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.600]  States and goes elsewhere we don't get to touch it no I know if you go down to
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.400]  South Texas you watch the the the barges leaving with the refined oil now
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.440]  gasoline our natural gas is exported to but but I mean the issue here is I'm
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.400]  just telling you the United States uses 25 million barrels a day guys pull it up
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.760]  but but I mean what's your final point more and we sell it out but we do not
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.240]  tax it we tax it as if it was consumed here in the United States why don't we
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:56.600]  go and tax the exported oil as an export not as it as a US produce product well
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.880]  you don't usually want to tax your exports but I hear him after work I
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:07.280]  just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone come on don't be like

[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:32.160]  the ring of fire the ring of fire and it burns burns burn the ring of fire the
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:41.320]  ring of fire the ring of fire okay we are back and I want to continue with your
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.280]  phone calls I did pull up the strategic petroleum reserves the guy was talking
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.320]  about billions and I think he may have read that wrong the United States level
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.080]  is 21 million barrels a day my numbers it's been as high as 25 million
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.760]  barrels with the economy shut down who knows and a total approximately 51.2
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:07.760]  billion in shower crude I gotta read all these numbers you know I'll have to
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.800]  read this later the US PR is the largest emergency supply in the world with
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.440]  the current capacity of 727 million barrels so that's the that's the
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.560]  strategic reserve the current inventory is displayed by the SPR's website as of
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:29.880]  May 31st 2001 the current inventory was 726.5 million barrels that allows them
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.480]  to manipulate the oil price it's not really for our security that equates the
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.600]  34 days of oil at current daily US consumption level of 21 million barrels
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.760]  a day that was my point is they're not exporting billions of barrels a day
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:48.080]  because the entire the entire reserve 726 million at recent market prices
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:55.720]  $65 a barrel the SRP holds 334.3 billion in sweet crude that may be the number he
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.080]  was reading and approximately 51.2 billion in shower crude that's where we
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.120]  got the 50 billion numbers how much it's worth okay so there we go I was
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.640]  correct all right let's go ahead and talk to I wasn't like I'm correct look I
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.440]  showed you I'm correct I'm into checking myself constantly because I get
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.120]  things wrong but let's go ahead and talk to John in Louisiana John you're on the
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.920]  air go ahead hey Alex great talk to you to talk to you what's on your mind a few
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.520]  things I don't say that's great that you interviewed Ron Paul I'm a huge supporter
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:36.120]  Ron Paul and my aunt knows him personally you know like Jackson and I said
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.360]  that man is one of the most honest constitutional statesmen that there there
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.960]  is no he's Dudley do right with a hundred and seventy IQ oh yeah he's a
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:51.880]  he's a great American and he is the only choice that we have and basically it
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:57.960]  he's so real he's so good and it just shows you how wicked our so-called media
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.360]  is there a bunch of hijacked lying brainwashers desperately trying to keep
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.760]  the American people under their control exactly the fact that they sit there and
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.800]  do the things they do to him just shows what trash they are I mean it's just
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.160]  blatant it's just enough if you're open and you can see what's going on it is
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.480]  just it's just blatant it's yeah and the globalist days in the hole is to have
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.960]  30 to 50 million illegals here who we can't communicate with and who can't
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.000]  wake up to liberty who who think the government's their friend to checkmate
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.520]  America ever kicking the globalist out instead of all of us just in discovering
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.960]  liberty legalizing freedom and the whole world could move towards liberty
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:43.920]  instead we're moving towards World War three definitely about the NDAA bill I
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.640]  sent David Vitter an email and right before he was supposed to vote and I
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:54.400]  also called his office and talked to Stu Jade well just basically didn't say
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.400]  anything about what David Vitter was going to do and just said he would pass
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.360]  along the message well after the vote I got an email from David Vitter you know
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:08.200]  I don't know if this is just automatic response they give through emails or
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.040]  whatever but it was basically some tribe about how they were supposed to fight
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.280]  the war on terror and oh yeah that's all they ever do is Ron Paul won't get rid
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.160]  of our liberties and have a war on our freedom he's the enemy thanks John
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.960]  Janice in Texas you're on the air welcome hi Alex I have a little bad
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:33.080]  news just quick last week they passed a bill like suspending the the rules or
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:39.520]  whatever words passed with unanimous consent with no debate and it gives okay
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:46.680]  it's HR 24 at five and it reauthorizes the 2004 project bio shield 2006 all
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:52.560]  health preparedness Jean Green one of the authors of the bill goes into this
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.960]  whole spiel about that Galveston lab and says oh it'll give it's the only lab
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.480]  in the United States owned by a university because it's owned by yeah
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.760]  it's a level four bio weapons lab in a level two level and that means stuff
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.240]  that'll kill everybody's 98% of people that are exposed to it are 99 totally
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.680]  weaponized deadly stuff like Ebola you name it and it's in a level two bio
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.320]  system on a coastline ravaged by hurricanes it's totally insane and
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:27.000]  they're building them all over the country so they can develop new vaccines
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.920]  to try to force on us what else you want to tell us Janice well this can you
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:35.880]  look at this HR to 405 because it gives more money to that lab and gives more
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.680]  power and money to the evil Sebelius and out more vaccines stockpiling they
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.460]  keep talking about oh yeah no no the government pays the company to produce
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:51.600]  the weapons to soft kill us I mean it's a global takeover we're on the march the

[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:20.600]  and the sky is gray I'm Alex Jones your host I'm only after the truth I'm only
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:29.160]  after anthropology sociology archaeology psychology I study what it is to be
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:35.160]  human I study history I learn more and more by the day and I realize the
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.400]  globalist understand how humans operate they make their study of that and they
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:45.360]  treat us like animals they treat us like people in an artificial environment in
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:51.240]  fact I'm gonna do a film review of the island movie that came out five or six
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:57.080]  years ago so I was watching it on the treadmill jogging this morning and just
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:01.240]  the archetype or the metaphor of the people in this artificial city believing
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.280]  there's been a plague that killed everybody outside the city and that the
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.160]  police states to keep them safe and really they're just clones to provide
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.760]  organs to their wealthy counterparts on the outside and they talk about eugenics
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.960]  I need to find out the author of the book that that's based on and if they're
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.360]  alive try to interview them now because that's really the establishment telling
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:25.080]  you what they know and a lot of times I've learned with Hollywood they're
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.640]  actually against what's happening there's a new movie out that I'd forgotten
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.600]  that I'm in that I haven't had a chance to watch all yet but it's got Demi more
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:40.240]  and a whole bunch of other big stars in it and it's just now coming out in
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.600]  select art house theaters it's kind of in that phase but it's a it's a big movie
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:52.600]  it won the Sundance Film Award for best screenplay and they're back there they
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.560]  told me about it yesterday I'd forgotten that I shot the video and audio for it a
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.320]  year ago and just kind of blew it off because I'm always moving forward and
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:06.160]  then I start getting emails pouring in yesterday going I just saw this at the
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.440]  movie theater you're in this movie you're like all over it and they're back
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:15.520]  there watching it right now and they're just completely blown away by the fact
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.840]  that it mean I'm just all over it and people are like wow this is positive
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.720]  there's all these anti-New World Order anti-gun control rants in it and well
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.640]  I'm gonna do a review of the next few days and and I'll just leave it at that
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:37.240]  but something to discuss now at the start of the next hour for those of you
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.160]  that are holding coming up in about 25 minutes I'm gonna get to you I'm gonna
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:46.920]  go to Matt Bruno Linden Otter Mike and others that are patiently patiently
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:55.160]  holding and we will get to all of you and get your break down of what you want
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:59.360]  to say and then I'm gonna get into all the internet censorship being openly
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:03.040]  announced now they're trying to pass legislation to do it we got the huge
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:07.880]  Ron Paul interview coming up but I wanted to get Pierce Corbin on we're gonna
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.640]  talk to him in just a moment but then I want to get more into this whole how they
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:16.600]  want to play us all a golf against each other black white native groups old young
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.240]  and they use the same tactics to get us to kill each other you know what
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.600]  happened to the Native Americans was wrong what happened to blacks was wrong
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.040]  what happened to white slaves in Rome was wrong and it's time for us to treat
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.880]  every human with the same dignity and the same admiration for the human spirit
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:39.360]  to realize that that the collectivist are actually hyping up multiculturalism
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.200]  and the rest of it to get us fighting with each other and each other's
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.480]  throat some to speak more to that coming up now Pierce Corbin has been called by
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.440]  the what associated president Fox News as one of the top long-term weather
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:57.680]  forecasters in the world he can do it a year out and he I remember two years ago
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.640]  on the show said you're gonna have a very wet winter and Texas is gonna have
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.880]  flooding we were in the middle of a drought then it was flooding the lakes
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.760]  filled back up and then the drought came back in and said you'll have a
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.320]  drought again we had him on a year ago and he does it as the ancients did they
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:15.840]  don't know exactly why it works this way but the moon blocking the sun and its
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.240]  solar winds a lot of factors go into it and he's with weatheraction.com he's a
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:25.440]  meteorologist and an astrophysicist studies course how the heavens have an
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.160]  effect on the earth a consultant and owner of weather action who makes weather
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.400]  forecast up to year in advance Corbin is well known for his opposition to the idea
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:37.840]  of anthropogenic global warming and he just has I've seen some statistics of
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.160]  about what is it an 87% accuracy rate in long-term forecasting when others in
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:47.120]  long-term forecasting have no accuracy to speak of and so he breaks down the fact
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.560]  that they use limited models for how they claim the weather works ignoring the
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.800]  sun the moon solar radiation which they now admit the ionizing stuff coming in
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:01.600]  is the main driver of course any plant knows if it had a brain it's the sun
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.080]  Pierce Corbin great to have you here with us break down great to have you
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.360]  break you're gonna have the floor here in a moment I appreciate you joining us
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.840]  break down from your research how things are really working versus what they
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:16.800]  teach and then we're honored to have you give us your long-term and short-term
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:23.400]  forecast sir okay well the important thing about what we say is first of all
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.600]  as far as co2 is concerned to get that out of the window it's no evidence
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.880]  whatsoever that co2 controls weather or climate if anything world temperatures
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:39.360]  drive carbon dioxide levels on average because that's driven by the sea so when
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.040]  it gets warmer co2 comes out of the sea because it doesn't dissolve so well
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:50.840]  right now as far as what we do we find that it's the charged particles from the
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:58.760]  sun ejected by the sun hitting earth and the effect in the ionosphere and all
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:03.520]  levels of the atmosphere which change climate and weather now these are
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.160]  modulated by magnetic connections wherever they go they're good or bad
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.720]  which goes into magnetic cycles and the stratospheric wind above the other
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.880]  levels of the atmosphere and the moon which interrupts the solar wind in
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:23.680]  various ways so by understanding these processes in a kind of a test we can
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:29.480]  we can work out when in the past will be similar total forcing situations for
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:35.120]  the earth whether it will be sometime in the future and we can use that whether
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.800]  in the past to predict the future now as you said in previous longer interviews
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.960]  the ancients in every culture whether it was Latin Mesoamerica or the
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:53.640]  Babylonians they knew the sun and moon affected it they didn't know why they
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.560]  just knew that it had an effect but I saw the UN at Copenhagen as you know two
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.840]  years ago past a resolution saying the sun does not affect our climate that's
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:10.640]  like saying water doesn't affect fish correct correct I mean man can pass
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.160]  laws about what man does but man cannot pass laws about nature I mean that is
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:21.640]  infamously is delusion among them well the CO2 warmest religious sex really
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:27.200]  and what we've seen in Durban is just the last gas of a religious religious sex
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.360]  who were desperate to predict any anything claim everything that happened
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.920]  is there in order to protect that gravy train other like the preacher that said
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.280]  that the preacher six months ago that said Jesus was coming and then he didn't
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.400]  so he backed it down the road I mean I mean really it's the same silly witch
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.280]  doctoring that we see from and of course I'm a Christian I'm just saying
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:53.800]  people coming out saying they know all this stuff and they're a hunter you know
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:59.560]  Al Gore we'd all be under water by now it's incredible yeah yeah well he does
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.440]  Al Gore believe it I mean he's calling on the third world to not develop or to
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.880]  develop in his own way with low carbon footprint as he calls it which is cost
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.560]  three times as much now if Al Gore believed this he would reduce his own
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.280]  carbon footprint but he's got the carbon footprint which is the envy of
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.920]  probably 90% of people in America and he'd like to have you know as many cars
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.960]  as he's got and as many houses he's got all producing CO2 so he's total
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.600]  hypocrisy and so for more he's got a got a house near the sea so obviously
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.640]  doesn't believe it's going to be going to be a great great flood boom at all
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:41.920]  it's just nonsense lies deceit and in the end theft from the the past focus of
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.320]  population and by the way that's not our opinion we have the emails it's all
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.400]  come out now but but but shifting gears out of that to real science and again the
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.560]  media is that analysis we've shown the articles in the past they're on your
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:58.440]  website you really you see the past forecast you've been stunningly accurate
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:02.640]  so I'm gonna be a little bit selfish here can you give me the the North
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:11.760]  American prognosis sir well we will do more is we had a number of statements we
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.680]  made in back in October which have been turning out right actually but at some
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.240]  parts of Europe it's going to be going wrong so we've been revising those
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.200]  forecasts and in a week or so I'll be glad to come back and give you a much
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.760]  fuller one for the USA and South Canada the interesting thing is there's going
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.320]  to be a lot of wild fluctuations this this winter they're not going to be
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:39.160]  uniformly cold but there will be some very heavy snow about them I'd like to
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.800]  you know give you the right timing of those so if you have me on in a week or
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:48.560]  so we'll give you all we know but we are sure I understand you're crunching the
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:55.640]  latest numbers but I mean specifically generally for North America what I mean
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.640]  oh you don't want to give your full forecast before it's ready but you do
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:03.760]  it well there's going to be some very very severe bags of snow in the
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.840]  northeast at times that is true you know and we've found the snow as well and
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:15.440]  we've got some provisional ideas that went but it's best to come back with you
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.000]  know but I noticed six six eight months ago you did predict early snow and and
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.600]  and oh yeah oh yeah oh we did and it was a it was record early for Colorado and
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:31.240]  other states no that's right no we were very pleased about but especially if I
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.720]  come back to you on on the detail because what happened in Europe was very
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:42.240]  interesting we expected we had a mild start to November which happened we
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:47.240]  expected it to cool down quite rapidly to an exceptionally cold December that
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:54.440]  it didn't cool down like we thought so then we looked carefully at the options
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.360]  in the past and found that rather than the ones where the moon was more
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:04.120]  important we should look at the ones where starlet brings the more important
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:10.200]  because there is choices about the past so we changed to that set of options and
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:15.760]  that says that December in the in Britain and West Europe will be cold
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:22.240]  pretty cold and snowy until near the end but not exceptionally cold so you know
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:26.800]  we changed the forecast and what we've said now the revised book that is working
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.640]  out superbly and there is a lot of snow in the north part of the rain in
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:37.400]  West England which is what we said and we're also interested in the prediction
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:44.720]  of very very mild spell right at the end of the month whether be no crisis just
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:49.360]  sweeping in making it very mild in Europe now that may be accompanied by very
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:58.920]  cold and very snowy in the north of USA but before saying that for sure we want to check
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:04.400]  generally well then obviously we'll get you on in a week or two should I get you
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:07.880]  on later next week or early in the next week to make sure that you've got it
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:14.400]  already okay well then I'll ask Jaren the producer to how about we set you up
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.520]  for next Friday sir okay well well well well since you say you're not quite
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.600]  ready with the forecast you know the next six months into the next year which I
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.680]  totally understand is you're actually doing real science not just making stuff
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.720]  up like Al Gore generally looking at the world and the Enviro cult that's
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.320]  actually a cover for the eugenics cult Lord Moncton others point out that they
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.840]  admit in their internal documents that are public they want to reduce
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.160]  population they want to cut off they want to cut off the Third World's energy
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.120]  but then they always lecture everyone that we've got to get these carbon
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:52.280]  deals to help the Third World when it's really a death sentence and that really
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:57.240]  the mainline liberals aren't liberals at all they are a bunch of green fascist
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:03.000]  anti-humans yeah yes I agree with that yes I've been to meetings where you know
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.880]  they sort of forgotten we were there and they suddenly start talking about
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:11.560]  reducing reducing world population and then they say you know the world has to
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:17.720]  go down by one third or a half but it only has to be has to be 25% in in the
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:22.560]  United Kingdom they say how they're going to achieve this I have no idea yeah
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.480]  well my point is I see the same thing in England in Europe they say the the
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.000]  carbon the carbon people are like have open borders have you know to the Third
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.920]  World be loving to them and I'm like how about you not shoot them up with
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.000]  deadly vaccines and that you've been caught spiking and how about you don't
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.440]  cut their power off and their development yes that's right I mean you
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:49.240]  know I support the electrification of Africa and if that requires coal, fire, power
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.080]  stations which is a cheap system that's what should be done and of course you
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.640]  can remove the smoke so they're not polluting in the in the true sense for
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:02.760]  the extra carbon but offside they could use to be good for agriculture and
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.760]  yeah generally looking at the earth because I know you you're an astrophysicist
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:10.840]  so you can speak to space weather not just earth weather this is always
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.720]  intriguing I get Lord Moncton on I even watch Discovery Channel pieces I've
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.760]  read some of the literature from the universities of carbon dioxide hundreds
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:22.520]  of times higher and just in the last million years or so I've seen numbers
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:29.200]  of 14 times higher and things like that so so here's my question if if it's so
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.120]  low a trace gas that all plants need to live part of the carbon cycle and if
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.840]  it's point three nine zero sometimes measured point three six zero they want
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:44.200]  to lower it if it's such a trace gas and and from what I've read the earth is in
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:51.040]  a carbon dioxide low level this phenomenon in earth history what's
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:57.240]  going on well what we have now is the most efficient plant that we've ever
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.920]  had I mean I don't get where but evolutionary speaking there's two types
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.160]  of photosynthesis the second more efficient type around now so this type
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:14.040]  one plant and type two plant working in parallel and I think the main reason for
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:19.280]  the low levels now as the world's one time about 300 million years ago in the
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:25.640]  past is these very efficient very efficient plant the last time it was as
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:32.480]  low as this for any length of time was 300 million years ago I don't know if
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:37.240]  that mark the advent of of type two photosynthesis or what there were then
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.080]  fluctuations I'm looking at the graph now and it went up by about factor of
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:50.360]  five or ten for a while and then came down again to current levels extra CO2
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:56.080]  is no danger it's a good thing well but sir let me stop you obviously plants
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.080]  put off more oxygen humans and animals are healthier we know in a higher oxygen
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.480]  level plants I've read can't deal with as much stress they believe the
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:09.560]  desertification of many areas of Sahara has actually been because of lower CO2
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.600]  so obviously you're on the same page to me it it looks like a danger of not
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:21.200]  having enough CO2 and then we bleed out like Mars well that's true well Mars
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:29.560]  and Mars are probably to do with other things but the CO2 levels if they go
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:33.320]  very low much lower than they are now it means some plants wouldn't wouldn't
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.040]  survive now you see the certain than I would say mad scientists made the right
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:44.400]  word in the delusional CO2 warmest camp who want to develop microbes which would
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:50.320]  remove CO2 now from the atmosphere now if these microbes are more efficient and
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.080]  photosynthesis then they would reduce the levels of CO2 in the world and the
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.160]  consequences would be that all plant life would die and if that happened we
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.840]  would die too yeah I saw that they're developing these they could release them
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.640]  and kill the planet saying in danger of these people and quite frankly they
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:13.880]  should be locked up or set to do some useful work such as coal mining in
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:20.840]  Africa to help electrify Africa I know we're trying to empower Latin America
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:25.080]  Africa Asia I want people to live and be wealthy and then the fake liberals call
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:28.280]  us racists when they want to kill these brown people dead in a hammer
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.920]  sure I think I should tell you a few things about general pictures of the
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:37.960]  of the future more extreme events and so on I mean the first thing to know about
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:42.320]  our forecast is that when we have a big extreme event we normally also predict
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:46.000]  on the bank on the top and you can see what stay there you've done that
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.280]  accurately final segment peers stay there weather action calm incredible
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.880]  scientists incredible information and yes they're already testing microbes that
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.480]  destroy carbon dioxide get rid of it folks they want to kill the planet these

[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:27.920]  thrown we're on a planet orbiting a giant star who has mass coronal ejections
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:34.440]  of flame thousands of times bigger than our planet we are bathed in its
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:39.920]  radiation and it storms the moon blocks that radiation many times the UN says
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:46.200]  has no effect on us really the earth chilled away from the sun is what
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:53.640]  controls our seasons this is how dumb they think you are if you give the
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:59.600]  globalist a ride my sweet darling we will die there is a killer on the road
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.640]  his brain is squirming like a toad now we're going back to our guest Pierce
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:08.400]  Corbin we're almost out of time he's graciously gonna come back on next
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:12.480]  Friday or next Thursday with us we've got the full computerized report broken
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.560]  down but finishing up the point about events here will be will be seen as
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.920]  events on the Sun Pierce Corbin go ahead hello yes yeah the point I wanted to
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:27.320]  make is that with our process you can see events on the sun which we predict
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.000]  and then the consequential events on earth and if people go on our website
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.080]  and look at weather action news number 31 for example it spells out there is it
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:41.200]  just an example 15th 6 of November we said there'd be a lot of events on the
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.080]  sun and as there was a very big active solar we didn't remember they are one
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:49.560]  through three nights we also predicted coinciding the battle just following it
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:54.400]  there would be that's a possible tornado event in south with England which are
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.720]  quite rare and there was one we also predicted the people are crossing the
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.000]  USA which is good and we predicted there would be more earthquakes in that
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.560]  period with the world so you can see the chain of events which of course actually
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:13.840]  this is the other thing whereas there's no no co2 explanation for any of these
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:19.080]  things now you'll be interested to know what's going to happen in the next
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:25.440]  year or so and in general terms there will be more of the very extreme event
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:32.480]  because of the sun and then after that in a couple years there'll probably be
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:37.080]  less of the very extreme event but there'll be a general shift the more
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.760]  cooling in the northern hemisphere the jet stream will come further south so
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:50.360]  we'll have more of the very cold with heavy snow and so on and the similar
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.680]  problems in the southern hemisphere you're fading off whenever you talk a
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.400]  little softer you were saying because we're in a higher magnetic field what
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:01.320]  were you saying a minute ago no what we're in is a further minimum and moving
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:08.480]  to go less maximum okay well there's actually be more more activity but the
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:14.240]  kind of magnetic state is changing all the time and we're now in a period for
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.360]  these you know a few years of these very extreme events because of the
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:23.200]  coincidences well they say Texas is in a twice a century drought and that's
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:26.920]  normally nine years long they say we're in the end of the eighth year is that all
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.040]  just poppycock or I mean that's what the old-timers say or is that based in
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:36.240]  reality well it might be true but you mean how do you have a hand before well
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:40.360]  of course it's done before all these things have happened before so it will
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:45.320]  end in in due course and it's nothing to do with with mankind you see when you
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.640]  see German extreme things happening was we can predict in detail it's
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:54.320]  ridiculous to tell you well editing we can't predict must be done by CO2 that's
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.400]  there's more science you actually can predict predict more things wow well we'll
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:03.640]  have to get that full report from you next Friday Pierce Corbin of weatheraction

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:28.840]  Alex Jones alright we're gonna premiere that Ron Paul interview at 1 30 it'll
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:33.120]  air here for the first time the video the audio all of it was amazing I'm gonna
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:39.880]  cover news and take your calls right now we cover it all with Ron Paul right now
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.440]  let's go to Bruno in Maryland then Lyndon Otter Mike Matt and others in fact
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:48.520]  Matt's the next after Bruno I just skipped Matt Bruno you're on the air go
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:54.000]  ahead Alex great to talk to you Alex I'm a Catholic priest and just wanted to
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.240]  weigh in on your reference that bishops document yes sir I spent years I spent
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:03.000]  years researching it and thank you my brother for all your stuff I devour it
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.960]  Alex I just want to say sadly you might give him too much credit I don't think
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:15.840]  these are guys who get the score and it's ironic you look back to Pope Pius
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:21.560]  the 10th 100 years ago and he said people who who dream this utopia was
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:28.080]  possible were insane dreamers and miscreants and I don't think they
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:33.880]  understand I really don't I think they have this utopia naive vision and that's
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.040]  as far as it goes yeah you're right it's not the entire Catholic Church is
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:42.840]  calling for the open borders it's the 33 Hispanic bishops to see how that's a
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:46.520]  right I mean are they calling for Mexico to have open borders Mexico's got some
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:51.080]  of the most controlled the US is wide open we're bankrupt and then they it's
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:57.040]  like this idea that Newt has said and so is Perry that have a big heart give
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:02.800]  people who are illegal immigrants in state tuition illegals people in other
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:08.640]  states don't get that because it's paid for by Texas taxpayers I mean I mean
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.720]  well why don't we have a big heart then and and just give everybody something
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:19.720]  free because you can't do that I mean it's crazy that alone oh absolutely and
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:25.680]  it's a cardinal ratchinger who's going on to be the current pope it's amazing a
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.080]  man in his position back then he openly lamented the quality of bishops chosen
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:38.160]  after the 1960s and so yeah we're in quite a crisis the best description I
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:45.360]  ever heard was it's the Mad Hatter's Tea Party bit large but yes but I don't
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.480]  think they're on board Alex I don't think certainly they're not friends of
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:55.280]  the Russians and Goldberg and globalists I really think that they just dream of
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:00.680]  this silly future well all I know is the Forge Foundation the globalists the
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:04.760]  UN are all for totally open borders we've got the most open society ever and
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.320]  the globalists are using our freedom against us and as I said I mean there's
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:13.760]  six billion seven hundred million people are they all going to come here and
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:18.640]  then and here's my issue with the average immigrant they are buying the
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:21.600]  government's their friend and when the government says you shouldn't own guns
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:26.540]  and we need higher taxes and communism they think that's good because the
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:30.560]  government's acting like they're their friend they're not your friend I mean
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.320]  where are these Hispanic bishops warning Mexico not to take the Gardasil shot
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.240]  where are the UN and others are pushing to not develop Mexico you see I
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:46.240]  actually want people to do well I don't want them to be dead and sterile but
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.160]  instead they give them this fake liberation theology of well you'll get
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:55.920]  those evil Americans you know what about folks that are in your parish or
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:59.600]  flock or whatever I mean I mean are they awake to what's going on
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:05.080]  people are they certainly know where I stand but honestly Alex we got a kind
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:10.840]  of choose our spots and lay low unfortunately and even even the folks
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:15.400]  who would call themselves comparably comparatively conservative no I don't
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:18.440]  think they get the whole thing and I guess that's my underlying point in
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.280]  speaking to you when you mentioned the Ford Foundation the UN they know the
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.240]  score they know what they want to accomplish and I really do think at
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:32.400]  least this collection of bishops are really in a hay somebody once called
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:37.240]  the US bishops conference the Democratic Party at prayer no no so I've
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:41.160]  seen that yeah no it's certainly and it's not just the Catholic Church it's
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:45.800]  the Methodist even a lot of Baptist I mean I mean I see the Catholic Church
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:49.600]  and other churches put out anti-gun stuff I mean it's like look this is
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:53.560]  America stop attacking the Second Amendment I appreciate your call more

[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.760]  is big to have Ron Paul coming out and telling like it is that's like four
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:50.520]  years ago we talked about the North American Union and the Security and
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:56.960]  Prosperity Partnership and the Trans Texas Corridor CNN Fox News and MSNBC I
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:02.360]  played the clips here all went on TV and said Ron Paul is insane this does not
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:06.640]  exist he is talking about imaginary things now understand we had at that
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:11.640]  time the SPP documents judicial watch had sued and gotten them it was even in
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:17.120]  some newspapers mainstream papers there were billboards up saying welcome to the
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:22.320]  first leg of the NAFTA superhighway development inner port zone in Kansas
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:27.240]  City and Dallas Texas Ross Perot owned one of them giant billboards that we
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:32.320]  videotaped and that are online in my film in game saying trans Texas
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.560]  Corridor part of the NAFTA superhighway system official Department of
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:43.400]  Transportation documents and they think the public is so dumb I just saw an
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.880]  article the other day in Mother Jones saying Ron Paul what was the headline on
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.880]  that article it attacked me as well it was Ron Paul don't believe the hype I
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.600]  think was the headline yeah don't believe your hype and said he can't win he
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:00.080]  goes on Alex Jones's show they believe there's a North American Union forming
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:04.640]  we're already in one they've already got Canadian and Mexican troops in the US
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.200]  and vice versa they are now allowed Mexican troops in the US and Texas in
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.560]  shootouts it's all over the South Texas news and there it is don't believe the
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:18.680]  hype I mean they think their readers I mean if I if I was a Mother Jones
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:25.120]  reader and somebody treated me like that this is like saying Disney World
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.280]  doesn't exist in Orlando Florida or George Washington doesn't exist it's
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:37.680]  like saying giraffes don't have brown spots and little horns or antlers it's
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:41.440]  like saying a crocodile doesn't have teeth it's like saying fish don't have
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:47.240]  eyes spiders don't have fangs it it's like saying fire hydrants don't have
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:52.600]  water in them it's like saying fire engines aren't red fire isn't hot sky
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.280]  isn't blue black isn't black white isn't white up isn't up down isn't down
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.760]  left isn't left right isn't right I mean they just say Ron Paul is insane he
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:08.920]  says that there's a North American Union forming when it's all public but not on
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:12.840]  the news and people I'd say these so-called liberals I watch their shows
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:16.040]  on MSNBC and stuff and I read them it's all about how they're so smart and
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.800]  they're so intellectual and they and aha these idiots that believe in
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:27.120]  government corruption are crazy you people are like moron children who've
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:31.840]  been given you know ten times the dose of Prozac with a ladling of shock
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:37.160]  therapy and we're run over by a car I know it feels good to stand around in a
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.520]  mutual admiration society oh we're so smart oh we're so smart oh we're so
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:47.520]  trendy oh we're so you know I don't have time for it anymore I mean in fact you
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.960]  can show them actually found the article yeah it's Ron Paul don't believe the
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.720]  high but wouldn't even get to mention it but but that lie is so incredible you
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:57.560]  scroll down there it talks about the nap the superhighway and it says Ron Paul
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.120]  talks about things that don't exist and then giggles and then links to some
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:05.240]  other article making it up I mean ladies and gentlemen I've been to the
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.440]  trans-Texas corridor and the North American Union Department transportation
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.600]  meetings in Austin San Antonio and Dallas their maps are all public the
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:17.320]  development zones they building part of it outside Austin that the plan to put
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:21.160]  toll roads on all the roads that I mean it's all happening the city council two
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:24.000]  years ago that I'm going to your calls
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:28.440]  was still saying they weren't gonna put toll roads on mopec and I-35 when
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:31.360]  people got mad and then they're back announcing it but they're saying we're
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:36.720]  not calling them toll roads we're calling them I forget some special lane or
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:42.760]  something I mean it's like when we exposed that the build was for US
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:47.160]  citizens for two weeks the media said we were liars and crazy and that it wasn't
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.800]  for US citizens and then when it was admittedly for US citizens they said
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:57.560]  so what and then now they've doubled back and say it isn't for US citizens
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.080]  I remember reading the Patriot Act in 2001 right after it passed in October
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:07.120]  we're reading at the 28th the day after it passed because you couldn't read it
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:09.720]  until they passed it then they made it public that was the first time that
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:14.480]  happened now they do it all the time and it said it's for general public misdemeanors
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:17.280]  no more Bill of Rights no more Constitution breaking your house without
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.760]  warrants give you a gag order if you do and I would get on air and talk about it
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.480]  and I went to the city council and they would laugh at me and say mr. Jones
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:31.160]  everybody knows that it's true and I'm like here's the subsection and the next
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:34.000]  time I went down there they actually listened and Austin said they weren't
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.480]  gonna follow it
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.080]  people say oh well the cities can't say anything the feds are really 800 plus
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.240]  cities have total amnesty for illegals you know that's that is a violation of
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:48.880]  state and federal law why can't the states enforce what is constitutional if
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:51.760]  they're doing stuff that's unconstitutional no all the power is
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:55.360]  local and the globalists know that and the minute we figure that out is the
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:02.680]  minute we take this country back but that's not the Patriot Act and they're
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:06.520]  militarily just lying to you to make the debate about is it in there or not
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:12.360]  instead of hey do we want this in there we're not Kim trailing but we are this
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:16.920]  is not an assault at Waco as they machine gun the people Mars attacks don't run we
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:22.520]  are your friends oh you're my friend laser beams them I mean that doesn't
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:26.160]  work on me somebody has a dagger going don't put your hands up I'm a friend
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:30.000]  that's a classic thing killers do do what I say and everything will be all
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.960]  right no everything's not gonna be all right if you go along with them sure he
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:39.040]  may stab you or shoot you right there in the shopping mall parking lot but at
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.440]  least you're not going to that there's some dungeon where they can torture you
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:48.080]  and enjoy themselves I'm gonna do what I've done not once but twice once with a
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:52.200]  gun once with a knife I couldn't help it it wasn't cuz I was brave you pull a
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:56.400]  knife and gun on me I'm gonna try to take it away and then I'm gonna hurt you
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:00.320]  because all I got to do is just remove that compulsion and not hurt people oh
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:06.480]  the governor I'm turning it off click tell my brain kill you see we're giving
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:10.520]  all these instincts for a reason and it's time we use them in the info war
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.400]  you're powerful the system scared of you enough to jack your water and food
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:19.360]  with stuff to make you passive on record but you can you can jack that any time
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:23.440]  you want you can tell your brain I'm aware of the poisoning jacket I'm under
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:29.640]  attack I'm done with it doesn't matter what you tried on me you have oh no I
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.720]  dare how much power you've got and the scum knows it
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:41.000]  Matt in California thanks for holding her on the air welcome I'd like to get a
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.280]  little nerd going on to help but the info war is out there try to find some
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:50.880]  information on the internet sure and a way to do that if you have like Mozilla
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:57.920]  Firefox yes sir in the browser put about comma config and then hit the
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:03.120]  enter button or go and it'll basically have like a little warning deal there
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:07.920]  just click past that and then you could see in there where all the white list and
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:12.760]  blacklist are and you can turn them all off that's right if people would just
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:17.160]  learn how all their programs work the legal ease is oh you could turn off the
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.520]  surveillance the private companies have then of course when you do that you
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:24.800]  always catch them back dooring it but the point is make it harder for them use
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:28.520]  things like start page with Catherine Albrecht that's a proxy you know and
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:32.040]  it's not that you have something to hide it's that why do you even have walls if
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:36.520]  you have something to hide you're not bad to have bathroom walls you want
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.120]  privacy again the people would say well why do you want Bill of Rights a
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:44.360]  Constitution why don't you just let us do what we want we have privacy because
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:50.080]  we need privacy because it why do you need a lock on your door because there's
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:54.000]  bad people out there why didn't you need a lock on government because it gets out
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.920]  of control in every case this is all common sense anything else sir yeah I
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:04.040]  was wanting to talk about Sun Microsystems they have a program out
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:11.160]  basically like for a video game and it's called Project Dark Star and what you
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:15.640]  do is as a human you go in and play the video game and you go up against some AI
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:21.400]  that AI you kill them off the land so they move away from that land and you
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:25.960]  start building whatever there when they go away they start fighting each other
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:31.320]  and they learn how to kill each other so then they come back and try to kill you
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.800]  again if they don't succeed they go back and do it over and over and over again
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:40.880]  and then they learn how to kill you now that's what the globalists do and but
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:45.400]  again they know resistance is victory we resist them we get better you
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:49.080]  understand that's why we fight them you understand you can turn that around the
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:54.440]  other way you understand you understand that correct yeah I know they're doing
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:57.200]  it with computer chips they're doing it with all kinds of stuff well we got
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:04.040]  something pretty powerful too electrochemical in the event of an
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.080]  emergency do you really trust Obama and the federal government to provide for
[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:12.000]  you and your family modern-day emergencies like floods tornadoes

[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:39.560]  email to Bruce Fine the Constitutional Scholar I got a petition that can take
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:44.320]  these people to federal court put them in jail and put warrants up for their arrest
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:49.280]  and I got a plan to enforce it we need to do this because this is the way we take
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:54.040]  our liberty back is with information we have the Constitutional Weapon we have a
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:58.840]  willpower there's been enough people been ripped off like Gerald Selectay all
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:03.000]  these people that's been criminalized to file formal charges against all these
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.680]  people including Eric Holder everybody I got a good petition. Well Lyndon let me
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:11.760]  say this Bruce Fine's got a website I forget the name of it but you can get
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:14.960]  a hold of them there but send us your petition and I'll try to send it over
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:18.560]  to him I say try because sometimes stuff falls with its cracks but God bless you
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:24.040]  and great points thanks for holding to bring that up look suing the system for
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.600]  violation of your civil rights is a great thing because even if you lose some
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:31.640]  of them are going to make it through and it's going to raise these issues
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.800]  pointing out illegal wars pointing out illegal torture pointing out illegal
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:40.680]  surveillance pointing out all the criminal stuff this government's doing
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:43.680]  like Holder shipping guns into Mexico the fact that he's been caught as a
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:47.360]  liar that just keeps putting it out there where they can finally be brought
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:51.600]  to justice you ever give in to them and ever all that they'll never get in
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:55.040]  trouble it's over that's why it's a big deal that Ron Paul came out and said
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:59.040]  Eric Holder's a criminal and the Justice Department is criminal and did this to
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:03.040]  blame the Second Amendment that's big news because Ron Paul said it and that's
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:08.320]  why we love Ron Paul he's not a coward so that interview is coming up let's jam
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:13.040]  in some more here otter in mass good to hear from you sir welcome greetings you
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:18.480]  online there yes sir got statically sorry so I hold in my hot little hands
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:23.560]  here a letter from the Social Security Administration which came up earlier and
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:30.120]  this is for an individual that's disabled entirely completely for life for
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:33.800]  three years there hasn't been a call increase and I heard a gentleman earlier
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:37.960]  speaking about it I'm not a lawyer I can't practice law but I can read it
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:42.280]  I'm looking at this and I'm reading it I'm saying that it says the amount do you
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:48.520]  beginning January 2012 is in this particular case 728 40 so this
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:54.240]  individual's been getting 704 dollars and 40 cents a month for the last three
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.320]  years that's what they're supposed to have been living on now the amount being
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:06.280]  given to you raised by the law provides for an increase in S and Social
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:12.840]  Security payments in January and it goes on to say that the reason is that the
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:16.560]  Commonwealth so I can only speak to what has been written and tell for this
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:21.640]  state the reason that you have received an increase is that the Commonwealth has
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:27.120]  kicked in 30 dollars and 40 cents so in reality SSI has rolled it back six
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:31.200]  dollars per individual and the Commonwealth has kicked in some money to
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:35.720]  make it look like it's gone up a little bit well I know this they take your
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.400]  money for your whole life and then as they devalue the currency they cooked
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:45.200]  that number it should be a much bigger increase and then now in Europe they're
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:48.800]  actually cutting people social security including their private accounts to pay
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:55.160]  the bankers who created the thousand plus trillion I mean that's the big
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:59.760]  nut to crack everything else is chump change we have plenty of money to pay
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.560]  people their social security it's the same in Europe but the media is making
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:06.880]  it all about social security saying that's what's gonna bankrupt things
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:10.800]  whether you're for it or not my thing is it gets people dependent on
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:14.880]  government through your money they took from you and other people's and so
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:18.080]  that's why it's so dangerous they always steal it one way or the other and
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.560]  they're stealing it through devaluation right now I appreciate your call we
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:24.840]  should do some articles on this three years since the cost of living went up
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:28.320]  and now they're really getting ready to devalue the currency so it won't matter
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:32.080]  how much they increase it in a while I mean in Zimbabwe they've got you know
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:36.080]  ten trillion dollar notes that are worth you know enough to buy a cup of

[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:32.760]  FEMA region 6 Austin, Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.960]  and we are joined by Republican front-runner presidential candidate
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:47.280]  Ron Paul even mainstream media admits he's in second third in some cases first
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:50.880]  place and of course the national polls he's the only person who can beat
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:56.640]  President Obama and he joins us today Congressman thank you for coming on thank
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:59.520]  you Alex good to be with you again it's good to have you with us there is so
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:03.840]  much happening I've got a lot of questions but what is most important
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:09.800]  congressman right now on your radar well it's a continue to do what I've been
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:12.360]  doing you know blood people say well what's your strategy what are you gonna
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:16.320]  do differently and you know me well enough that probably the last 30 years
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:19.560]  especially the last 10 years since we've known each other I do the same thing
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:23.400]  over and over again but I try to improve not only the delivery but the message
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:27.880]  always stays the same but we we get better organized so we'll continue to do
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:31.920]  that but the next I mean the big thing now is these next three weeks I mean you
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:36.200]  know how much energy we put into Iowa and New Hampshire because you know it
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.920]  offers an opportunity it's a smaller state and you can meet a lot of people
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.320]  you can do direct mail so we've done our very very best we think we're in a good
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.360]  position but we're going to work right up until you know the caucuses occur on
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:52.120]  the third and then of course the primary in New Hampshire on the 10th but it's
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:56.480]  unbelievable how much volunteer work we're getting and there's so much work
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:02.640]  going on outside of the campaign it's so fantastic so I believe that could be
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:07.440]  our secret weapon that nobody measures the amount of activity going on outside
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:11.080]  the campaign but we're going to continue to do that we're doing with a lot more
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:15.800]  energy and they continue to try to sell this this this mind game or the self
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:18.920]  fulfilling prophecy that even though he wins all these strong pulls and even
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:22.720]  though he's always a top tier candidate you still can't have him but I think that
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.640]  hoax is really beginning to backfire on them yeah I don't know how long they can
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:32.880]  get away with you know if Newt wins at Iowa you know he's the shoe in for the
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:38.440]  whole nomination if I win it's a total fluke and I'm just a troublemaker and
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:43.440]  a spoiler but we still have to prove ourselves under the circumstances of the
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:47.840]  disadvantages with the Main Street media but we know we know where we stand we
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:53.480]  know what we have to overcome and I think I think we're doing a very good
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:59.040]  job on this and no matter how they spin it there's a limit to how they how much
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:03.120]  they can spin it you know even when even when they give me 90 seconds actually
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:06.920]  we've been able to turn that around and turn it into a positive when you see
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.800]  guys like John Stewart and others you know just mocking you know the
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:15.400]  unfairness of the system so we have to keep playing along that's all they've
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:18.960]  tried to ignore you now that's failing the attacks are beginning do you think
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:22.240]  that it's gonna do the same thing again and boomerang back on them because the
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:26.840]  the Main Street media and political system is so discredited yeah I think so
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:32.080]  in you know in a way even though you know the the king makers in the Main Street
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:37.520]  media and the establishment people are gunning you know the other candidates
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.880]  have you noticed that they're a little less aggressive they're more aggressive
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:43.920]  against each other than they are against me because I think they know the
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:47.520]  significance of the number of people and they're not going out of their way to
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:51.520]  offend the other they say oh there's just a couple percent there's seven or eight
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.640]  percent but they're being a lot more cautious because they know our
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.920]  percentages are much higher and we can play a significant role and they're in
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:03.720]  there being a little more cautious at least if you were to go after Obama more
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:08.440]  pretty much run against Obama transcend the other Republican minions and point
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:14.600]  out as you have that they're basically just rhino Republican versions of that
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:18.960]  and point out that you've pointed out the real problems and are the only
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:23.960]  candidate that has any shot at trying to turn the ship around well actually I
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.400]  think that is good strategy because I wish we had more polling honest polling
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.480]  with my name against Obama because you know we appealed to a lot of
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.880]  independents and even some of the more sensible and honest lip rolls you know
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:41.680]  the progress that are anti-war so I think what you're suggesting is very good
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:46.040]  and I would have to admit I don't do enough of that and it's a mixed bag
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.760]  politically I think is very very good and he deserves it and that's who
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.240]  ultimately have to run against but in the primary I'm not running against him
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:56.520]  and I also like to be as upfront as possible you know when it comes to
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:00.880]  analyzing our tragedies and the foreign policy and monetary policy and the
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:04.880]  economic foolhardiness of it and you know they've been going on for a long
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:08.680]  time and it's both parties but I should at least be more bipartisan and
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:14.200]  condemn Obama just as much as I criticize some of the things Republicans
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:19.080]  have done over the years as well look at Mitt Romney his voting record Obamacare
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:24.480]  he is a Republican Obama vote in another Obama or look at Newt Gennrich he's for
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:30.860]  carbon taxes Obamacare style stuff he is another Obama and so basically a it's
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:34.280]  a vote for Obama because either one of those guys is gonna beat Obama but be
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:37.880]  it's a vote for Obama because they're just clones of him just with a little
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:43.040]  bit different rhetoric I think that that is the secret weapon congressman and I
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:46.840]  got a little bit of them but probably not as sharp as I could have or what you
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.520]  might have done but you know in the debate the other night I said the two of
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:53.920]  them are totally on the defensive they're defending their record I mean how
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:59.000]  can they how can they lead our party if they're defending themselves for not
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.920]  being you know for having been like like Obama all along so that is the big
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:10.040]  issue and I think probably you know Gennrich has been pretty aggressive in
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:14.360]  that light so maybe that's one of the reasons he got bumped up a bit so that's
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:19.760]  not a bad advice at all. RonPaul2012.com it is absolutely essential obviously
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:23.520]  everybody go out and get ready to try to be delegates everybody hit the ground
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:28.520]  in Iowa I know I have family who's actually gone to Iowa so there isn't
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:32.040]  massive grassroots operation all the different ways people can get involved
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:37.080]  are at RonPaul2012.com I want to go back to the campaign here in a moment sir but
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:40.760]  they've obviously tried to keep you with 89 seconds and the CBS debate in other
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:45.200]  places from actually talking about the real issues and instead they'll ask you
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  what do you think a nude what do you think a myth so they can basically still
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:53.000]  give you time and not get caught censoring you but they still censor you
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.520]  in another way what what do you have to say about that well I mean that's been
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:01.680]  ongoing and I've lived with that for a long time I have to be on guard for it
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:05.920]  but and try to distract them from them but that's that's ultimately their their
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:12.360]  goal is to make a subtle if not blunt assumption that well you can't win and
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:17.000]  therefore we shouldn't pay a whole lot of attention to you but the only way we
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  can ultimately overcome that is success in Iowa you know as a beginning point you
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.160]  know if we if we do really well there they're gonna have a lot harder time
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:31.160]  doing that to it I saw the Republicans here in Austin are gonna protest Eric
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:34.360]  Holder the Attorney General today because he wants the UN to oversee our
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:39.280]  elections and I agree that's certainly out of control and treasonous but this
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:43.520]  is the guy caught perjuring himself in the memo CBS released last week show
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:47.040]  that they said they were gonna blame the guns in Mexico on the second
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:51.800]  amendment is that not a form of false flag against our most basic of right
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:57.800]  sir and what would you do in president to people like Eric Holder we should be
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.440]  immediately fired and then there should be an investigation and find out if
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:06.200]  charges should be made and that's obviously over the top and all these
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:11.960]  kind of sting operations and false flag this is this is criminal and I think
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.600]  they do it constantly I think they were doing that when this there was this so
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:22.920]  called attempt to kill the Saudi or the Iranian ambassador you know that that
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:26.880]  kind of stuff is just way too much but no they should be investigating and then
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:32.480]  you know that's one thing I think the government House committee is doing a
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:36.600]  pretty good job at investigating that but I don't know whether charged with we
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:41.240]  may but the heat deserves that charges but you know up against him well said
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:44.480]  you got it right the first time the the claim of the use car salesman to kill
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:48.680]  the Saudi ambassador and even mainstream media had to admit that was totally
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:54.240]  phony and a pretext to attack Iran yeah that was the real the real excuse to
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:42:00.880]  blame it on it on them and and and we know that is you know I just wonder
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:04.360]  about that whether that kind of ever get tried because he does maybe the truth
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:07.560]  will come out and sometimes they won't try these people because they don't want
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.480]  the truth to come out so it's just another propaganda stuff as far as I'm
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:15.080]  concerned now they want to go after Syria it's now admitted the US Israel and
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:20.360]  others are staging giant military attacks inside Iran what do you make of
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:25.760]  Congress not being consulted on that well unfortunately that's been happening
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:30.280]  for a long time and Congress is just totally negligent on this you know the
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.520]  other night when they were talking about this in the debates you know on what
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:38.520]  the president's responsibility is is when they you know shoot down or are
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:43.280]  able to get one of our drones and the argument was should we go in and get it
[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:48.160]  or should we just go in and destroy it and I tried to get attention on that I
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:53.560]  would my suggestion would be why don't we avoid it by not sending drones over a
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:57.920]  sovereign nation just looking for a problem to start another war I mean they
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:03.040]  never talked about you know the lack of wisdom of having been over there and
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.920]  losing a drone over a foreign nation which we consider an enemy I just think
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.560]  that is it's a reflection of a policy that has to be changed what's your view
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:17.120]  on the NDAA and and the endopathy commentatus and the declaration of the
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:21.600]  whole world is a battlefield yeah well I think the significant difference is not
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.040]  so much in what they have done but the announcement and the arrogance of it all
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:29.400]  that they actually put it into law you know our government's been involved with
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:33.320]  our CIA and involvement and they were throwing governments and it's for a long
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:37.880]  long time and of course last spring I guess it was in February where the
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:41.760]  administration admitted that they could assassinate American citizens and now
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:48.000]  they're putting it into law so this this to me is an extremely wrong way to go
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:53.360]  this is a giant step this should be the biggest news going right now that it
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:59.440]  literally legalizing martial law yeah you know and our debate often does it
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:04.040]  come up it didn't come up at all you know and then the arrogance and and this is
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:08.160]  the one thing ran got stopped the arrogance of them trying to push through
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:13.040]  under voice vote that if you go through a trial and found innocent the government
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:17.800]  wants the right to push in prison for life anyway and fortunately that they
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.120]  wanted to do that in voice vote and he finally got a vote on that and that was
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:27.240]  canceled out but that is arrogance of the administration and the neglect of the
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:32.000]  Congress in using their authority and responsibility as well as the people
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.040]  that's why it's up to so many of us now to wake the people up because they don't
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:40.640]  probably realize the significance but this is big this is big you know the
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.880]  monetary issues big all these things I've talked about but this this step
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:50.440]  where they can literally arrest American people American citizens and put them
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.520]  away without a trial and you heard what Lindsey Graham say what they ask for a
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:45:00.160]  lawyer tell them no lawyer for you I mean that is arrogant and bold and
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:04.160]  dangerous that's hoping pray that we can get that kind of stuff reversed
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:08.120]  congressman we've only got a few minutes left with you here and I wanted to
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:13.480]  continue looking at the presidential race what would be the first three things
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:18.640]  that you would do the first three goals when you got into office when you were
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:25.520]  sworn in in January of 2013 well there are there are three big goals we might
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:29.920]  not be able to do as much all by yourself the first few days but you could
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:33.840]  change the foreign policy it may send a message to the world that we are not
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.280]  looking for more wars we're looking for you know a more peaceful solution to to
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:42.520]  the problems and that is to start bringing on our troops home which would
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:46.240]  send a message that that money is going to be spent at home instead of overseas
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:49.840]  might send a message to the market that things will be different but then the
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:53.320]  other other than that then that we'd be working on the budget to cut the spending
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:56.560]  you know my proposal that if we were serious about this we have to cut the
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:00.240]  budget I want to cut it first year two trillion dollars and the other thing that
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:04.120]  must be changed is curtailing the power of the Federal Reserve to monetize debt
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:10.200]  and get something passed where we can either or or both you know restrain the
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:14.360]  Federal Reserve to act on its own to print trillions and trillions of dollars
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:18.440]  and bailing out everybody around the world as well as a thorough audit of the
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:24.480]  Federal Reserve and then find out you know find out exactly what they have
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:28.880]  been doing and and then aim for legalizing the competing currency some
[02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:32.440]  of those messages if we change our foreign policy bring our troops home
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:37.440]  that balance start balancing the budget you know you don't have to wait for
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:40.680]  everything to be perfect it's just the direction we're going with people might
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.800]  say hey you know this is different and maybe some optimism would come back
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:50.520]  which we need a lot of beautifully said what can we do on the campaign trail
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:54.080]  briefly and then finally I know you've written a piece today it's on your
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:47:01.200]  congressional site it's also an info wars dot com about forced drug research

[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:14.960]  ensure that you win an Iowa congressman in closing well we're doing and if
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:19.720]  they're not involved anybody's not involved want to go to Ron Paul 2012 and
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:24.520]  find out because people can phone from home they certainly can raise funds
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:28.840]  people can are going out to Iowa there's activity but there's a lot of
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.280]  electronic activity going on you know with automatic phoning and different
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:39.800]  things that fun this is very very important so we're in the last the lap

[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:28.000]  minutes if you're watching us on screen you can see it it's on YouTube it's got
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.360]  128,000 views you can actually put the headline in and hit search on it we'll
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:37.040]  show you the real number about 150,000 views of a video I aired last Friday night
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:44.200]  on info wars nightly news John Corzine spills his guts to Alex Jones and I did
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:50.440]  a little fake interview with myself as John Corzine it's obviously satire a
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:55.760]  people say Alex is trying to fool us it's not really Corzine no kidding I
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:59.920]  sped his voice up like a chipmunk then they say it's anti-semitic he has a
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:04.280]  black hat and a beard John Corzine is Italian his name is Italian and in
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:08.120]  banker you know monopoly men wear a little hat has a beard plus Corzine does
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:14.040]  so they try to invent stuff now I see this more and more they froze the view
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:19.120]  count and that happens normally with cashing but it didn't happen with other
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:25.160]  big videos it happened with our videos but the proof is the videos in the most
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:30.680]  viewed area of news and politics have less views in the last two days than we
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:37.560]  do and the listeners are noticing it one commenter buck PWNZ buck pond says
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:44.160]  123,000 now and it's not the most viewed yet a video from the eighth is in fifth
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.840]  place with less views what a joke yeah and the their videos up there that have
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:53.600]  had like 50,000 views in two days that are there and then here's ours in two
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:58.720]  days we'd like double that and of course you can again enter the search term into
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:05.720]  general YouTube and actually get a closer number and if it is a YouTube
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:09.560]  malfunction which it may well be why is it happening to me and not other folks
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:14.880]  that you know the point is is that routinely every day we've got videos
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:18.240]  that should be on the front page and they're not and I know then that makes
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:21.840]  them a set of getting 200 300,000 views they get a million or two so I know why
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:25.800]  they don't like it I remember one time the Obama deception got a million views
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:29.120]  in one day on one channel and you could see the algorithm was probably at about
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:33.000]  two four million and then maybe 20 30 40 million when it hits that zeitgeist
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.640]  they just erased it for two weeks and and and it was a record that we didn't
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:42.720]  do it they had to restore it so we try to make stuff for free give it to you the
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:46.280]  prison planet dot TV subscribers see it first and finance our outreach to you
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:51.480]  and they don't want you to see that so John Corzine spills his guts to Alex

[02:56:55.560 --> 02:57:00.040]  this video whatever reason you know I told you this was coming years ago because
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:03.120]  I read Toyota and others talking about it but here it is Daily Mail no more
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:07.080]  talking behind the wheel scientists develop system that can shut down your
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:10.080]  cell phone while you're driving and of course it also tracks everything you're

[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:29.040]  nationwide ban on the use of cell phones or text messaging and devices while
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:33.520]  driving which sounds reasonable but that should be a local law and locally
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:37.080]  enforced as we tell you that you're four or five times more likely they admit
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:41.720]  with texting to kill people than drunk driving it is dangerous I mean I see

[02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:58.560]  they're always on a phone just like texting while they're driving 80 miles an
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:02.080]  hour dangerous but again we don't need the feds doing that we have

[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:23.040]  Kyle and Tennessee then Justin and Chris it's all we have time for Kyle thanks
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:29.000]  for holding hi Alex it's great to be on today the privilege to be on your show
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.960]  I thought Ron Paul was gonna be on today so I could ask him some questions but
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:37.000]  that's okay there's a couple things I always wanted to talk about that could
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:43.760]  help Ron Paul do better in the debate and one was that it just seems like I hear
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:47.040]  a lot of times from my friends that you know this false information that oh
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:52.120]  Ron Paul's anti-submitic or he's anti-defense that's all I hear a lot
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:57.040]  of times and for me the best thing Ron Paul could do was just in one of these
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:02.120]  debates say hey if Ron Paul if Iran is a threat to our national security that I'm
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:05.520]  gonna get a declaration of war from the Congress and I'm gonna go blow him up
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:10.840]  and get it over with exactly the issue is he will not play politics like Rand
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:15.600]  Rand is a patriot has been blocking all this tyranny but he'll at least play
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:19.800]  that patty cake in the system kind of backed off a little bit because he'll
[03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:23.840]  he'll at least say things like that Ron Paul won't even do that because he knows
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:27.800]  Iran wants to be our friend he knows our government's overthrown him not once
[03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:32.160]  not twice but three times and is blowing stuff up and he just will not play
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:36.440]  politics he will not do it and in a way that makes him even more admirable and
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:41.040]  if folks want to say that we shouldn't go attack country so we're anti-semitic
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:45.840]  let them say it you know people just use that and I'm just sick of it again I
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:49.560]  appreciate your call the globalist love to call people anti-semitic is a lot of
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:52.480]  times it makes them mad because they weren't and then they start bashing
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:56.400]  Israel because they won't want measured criticism they want to make it all
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:04.280]  nasty okay that plays into the whole trap again I don't like a lot of things
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:07.920]  Israel does but I like a lot of things China or Russia or the US does or
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:12.720]  England does I don't dislike people in England and so I've criticized Israel
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:16.680]  when they do bad things which they do do but I don't hate Jews you see that's the
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:22.160]  difference and I mean it's the same thing across the board and so that's why
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:25.000]  the white supremacists and others hate me not just because they're federally
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:28.840]  controlled but because they know I don't hate people you know for their race or
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:35.000]  religion and I reasonably criticize and the system doesn't like that Chris and
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:39.960]  Pennsylvania you're on the year welcome hey Alex can you hear me yes sir I can't
[03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:46.640]  go ahead okay just real quick I had a situation today that came up my daughter
[03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:50.600]  went to my daughter's the eight months pregnant and she went to the OBGYN and
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:55.240]  every time she's gone there she's telling her to take the flu shot which on the
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:59.520]  insert says you're not supposed to do every single time and they tell her it's
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:04.800]  safe it's safe well today I when she has a miscarriage they'll they'll again the
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:09.040]  doctors brainwashing does what they're told but it is a eugenics operation and
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:12.680]  they always said until three years ago never give a pregnant woman a shot it
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:16.480]  causes an autoimmune response it causes brain damage causes genetic problems or
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:22.080]  causes miscarriage period and when when my daughter asked her okay tell me what's
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:25.720]  in the flu shot because I've trained her well they will lie and say there's not
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:29.960]  the Marisol even though there is they well what she told her she did she
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:33.400]  didn't tell her anything she told her she said I get many emails every day
[03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:37.600]  telling me to make sure my pregnant mothers get vaccinated that's what she
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:42.000]  told my dog yeah it's a giant PR thing where they know we're waking up the
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.400]  numbers show it so they're trying to cram it down our throat hallmark I never
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:49.360]  even covered it last week has little cards about better vaccinate your little
[03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:52.960]  sweetie they're coming out with hundreds of shots that they get vaccine
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:57.280]  liability protection on trying to push and it's on purpose you know how many
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:01.600]  girls they're gonna kill in Mexico with this for with this forced Mexican
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:05.840]  inoculation of the Mexican girls there ought to be a revolution down there over
[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:12.440]  this the thing that infuriates me is is that she goes to a doctor and on her
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:18.520]  doctor's form they say patient refuses flu shot she's branded as someone who
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:24.240]  is total crud sir exactly but look look look she needs to bring literature in
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:28.400]  and educate them you need to go in there with her there anything we can do I
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:33.000]  mean can we sue them for harassment I mean they told her today that from now
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:37.320]  on every single time she comes in she will be asked to get a flu no no no it's
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:40.760]  all part of pressuring listen in California they just signed a law three
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:44.440]  months ago where they're gonna shoot kids up without parental consent I mean
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:49.000]  the government knows we're waking up so they're coming in with both feet on top
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:53.120]  of us trying to make us conform like we're a bucking horse get the Ron Paul
