[00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:04.837]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.137]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:06.997]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:08.118]  And we're under attack right now.
[00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:09.658]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:11.238]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:12.579]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.582]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:29.644]  I have a guest who's one of the top people tracking ISIS in Turkey joining us.
[00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:30.584]  We have been hit
[00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:36.971]  With a wide-scale, across-the-board attempt to take over InfoWars and different accounts today.
[00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:41.193]  We'll tell you about the hack attack when we come back after this special report.
[00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:43.474]  It's ongoing right now.
[00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:44.374]  The ghetto.
[00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:48.776]  Not the place you would imagine methods of global dominance to spring from.
[00:00:48.776 --> 00:01:00.702]  But it was in the ghettos across the United States that Saul Alinsky would fine-tune tactics of civil disobedience that would one day be employed by New World Order puppet Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:01:00.982 --> 00:01:06.126]  Resolutions of ideal problems always carry with them in their wake another problem.
[00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:09.989]  Alinsky's Rules for Radicals is the left's playbook.
[00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:19.357]  Chock full of creeping tactics used by scheming politicians and Soros-fueled millennial generation groups like Black Lives Matter.
[00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:22.679]  All lives matter.
[00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:23.400]  All lives matter.
[00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:25.515]  I'm a black guy.
[00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:29.319]  Hell-bent on tearing the fabric of American society apart.
[00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:41.633]  Anti-cop rhetoric that is sweeping the United States of America, fueled by this group, some of the vulgar, vile, vicious rhetoric that's coming out, talking about killing cops.
[00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.596]  Going to the beach is the biggest hit!
[00:01:45.725 --> 00:02:06.672]  Alinsky's albeit deceptively noble attempt to create a system to reward the have-nots with the power and surplus of the haves would prove to be just as useful for the New World Order sycophants to achieve an uprooting of American values and an overpass of the United States Constitutional Foundation to be replaced by totalitarianism and
[00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:14.580]  Disguised as compassionate socialism, these tactics simply needed the perfect charismatic turncoat to steer them.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.522]  Enter Barack Obama.
[00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:20.386]  All of us want to give our president every tool necessary to do this.
[00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:22.428]  And all of us were willing to do that in this bill.
[00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:26.407]  And anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people.
[00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:36.534]  Saul Alinsky died decades before a young pre-Senate Barack Obama would spend three years following in Alinsky's footsteps as a community organizer.
[00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:50.124]  In 2009, the National Review stated, Obama's mentors from his Chicago days studied at a school Alinsky founded, and they taught their students the philosophy and methods of one of the first community organizers.
[00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:52.905]  Saul Alinsky wrote in Rules for Radicals,
[00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:12.718]  If we're going to change it to what we think it should be.
[00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:15.821]  That means working in the system.
[00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:24.049]  So what are some of the tactics being utilized in that system at accelerating degrees in the shaping of modern American society?
[00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:24.910]  Rule number one.
[00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.753]  Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.
[00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:46.000]  Obama and the nutjobs in the nation's capital would have us all believe that they have overwhelming support from the have-nots, while destroying the middle class, increasing the debt and welfare class to unsustainable levels, and projecting it all from their mainstream media bubble.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.581]  Less than loving expressions by Christians?
[00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:07.956]  I get concerned.
[00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:08.536]  That's right.
[00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:10.817]  Let's criticize Christianity on Easter, you piece of crap.
[00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.158]  Best topic for another day.
[00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:13.659]  Skipping to rule number eight.
[00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.439]  Keep the pressure on.
[00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.740]  Never let up.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.642]  Obama must say this rule to himself every morning.
[00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:22.303]  As one shoe drops, another one is ready to fall.
[00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:37.188]  Not in the manner of a leader responding to a country's pleas in the midst of a crisis, but more in the vein of a tyrant quietly and charismatically creating them, while offering shallow direction as stale as his predecessor's rhetoric.
[00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:46.851]  And if just that sample of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals wasn't enough, Alinsky even dedicated the left's playbook to Lucifer himself.
[00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:50.272]  I suppose given a choice, I think I would pick hell.
[00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:54.665]  The reason I picked Hell is because that's where all the handouts are.
[00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:57.433]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com We'll be back!
[00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:04.545]  The Affluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:15.194]  A wealthy Texas teen, who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing four people while driving drunk, will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:21.839]  Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya, were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:36.084]  Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenzatine during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths, when a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:42.787]  He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter, a sentence critics saw as far too light.
[00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:50.090]  Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:54.466]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:11.489]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:14.191]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:17.734]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:06:17.734 --> 00:06:24.079]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.261]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put
[00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:27.821]  We're good to go.
[00:06:58.277 --> 00:07:05.184]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:08.086]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:14.012]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:17.275]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:20.398]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:29.666]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:40.375]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:48.224]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:50.326]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:52.409]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:55.953]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:08:02.945 --> 00:08:05.008]  We are on the march.
[00:08:05.008 --> 00:08:08.474]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:08.474 --> 00:08:11.578]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:38.104 --> 00:08:44.350]  Well, the founder of Motorhead, Lenny's, made the jump into hyperspace at age 70.
[00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.195]  But we'll have to get to that a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:55.622]  Because InfoWars is under sustained attack across the board.
[00:08:56.997 --> 00:09:07.780]  From our Facebook accounts to our Twitter accounts to our passwords into InfoWars to other attacks that are going on currently simultaneously.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.562]  Definitely a large coordinated attack and we are writing stories about it right now.
[00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:22.665]  About 25 minutes ago a story went up on InfoWars.com where one of the hacks was successful.
[00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:25.666]  We had it removed within 11 minutes.
[00:09:27.644 --> 00:09:30.447]  And, of course, had changed a particular passcode.
[00:09:30.447 --> 00:09:37.996]  They hacked through and got David Knight's passcode, but simultaneously got Paul Watson's code to his Twitter.
[00:09:37.996 --> 00:09:40.518]  That account is currently hijacked.
[00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:46.865]  We'll put Paul Watson's Twitter account, Prison Planet, up on screen for folks so they can see what's happening right now.
[00:09:47.921 --> 00:10:00.606]  We are investigating Islamic training schools in the United States currently, and we're on the ground yesterday, and basically all hell's been breaking loose since that happened.
[00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:03.788]  I told Biggs I had a bad feeling about it and just to get ready.
[00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:07.529]  I'm the one that sent him out there, but I told him yesterday at 5 o'clock, I said, get ready.
[00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:11.971]  Spidersense says, you know, we got enemy fighters coming in, watch your six.
[00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:13.652]  There's a lot of intel coming in right now.
[00:10:14.432 --> 00:10:19.217]  I basically already put my finger on what's going on here.
[00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:21.379]  You have to go back in time.
[00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:25.342]  Here's an RT article, a CNN article, and a bunch of others.
[00:10:25.342 --> 00:10:28.565]  Let me put the pieces together for you first.
[00:10:28.565 --> 00:10:35.692]  Back in 2013 and 14, CNN and a bunch of other globalist media operations got hacked.
[00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:42.314]  Probably by Russians calling themselves the Syrian Electronic Army.
[00:10:42.314 --> 00:10:49.956]  We know it was the Russian government that hacked and got the climate change emails, where they were coordinating with the UN and all the major professors at over a thousand colleges.
[00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:51.196]  It was 2000 plus.
[00:10:51.196 --> 00:10:56.497]  How to engage in fraud, how to hide the decline, how to pass carbon taxes.
[00:10:56.497 --> 00:10:58.338]  So again, the Russians blew that wide open.
[00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:00.199]  Probably the Russians.
[00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:13.172]  In fact, they pretty much admitted it's Russians involved in the, quote, Syrian Electronic Army, because it deals with Syria, sending out the intel that our government was funding radical al-Nusra al-Qaeda groups that became ISIS.
[00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.573]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:20.419]  So the Russians won that info war in concert with American patriots that will not engage in treason.
[00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:39.162]  Cy Hearst came out last week with a huge article and excerpts of his new book, Military to Military, or our own military, at the very time that I was engaging in my patriotic duties just as an American to not work with Al Qaeda and working with Colonel Schaefer and many others on and off air, generals, you name it.
[00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:40.882]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:11:40.882 --> 00:11:44.723]  Retired generals.
[00:11:44.723 --> 00:11:46.563]  This is real war, folks.
[00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:49.464]  This is against the globalists that are playing all our countries off against each other.
[00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:54.626]  Very high-level chess.
[00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:59.990]  We knew at the time that if we could get the military informed of this, it would all implode.
[00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:06.135]  Turning the Christian areas of Syria over to Al-Qaeda so they could slaughter everybody by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:12:06.135 --> 00:12:20.166]  And so, as the Syrian Electronic Army continued to hack CNN, to hack other hundreds of publications, and post Infowars.com articles, and you can look it up, that's who they posted, mainly,
[00:12:21.465 --> 00:12:31.291]  BBC, NPR, Skype, I mean, Facebook accounts, Twitter accounts, this is now the counter response to that.
[00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:45.641]  Directed out of Turkey, ISIS connected groups, to go in and post disinfo to discredit InfoWars, and also then blame it on the Syrian Electronic Army, which hasn't happened yet.
[00:12:46.903 --> 00:12:53.247]  But that is my belief where this is coming from and what we've expected to happen.
[00:12:53.247 --> 00:12:54.227]  Breaking!
[00:12:54.227 --> 00:12:56.028]  Here's the headline.
[00:12:56.028 --> 00:12:59.871]  Kudeytah in Turkey, Ergun flees to US airbase.
[00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:01.832]  This is the hacked article.
[00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.773]  That was put up by someone not in InfoWars.
[00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:44.843]  Double our load balancing systems, to use an old-fashioned term, with more media tentacles.
[00:13:44.843 --> 00:13:49.148]  And we're always adding new tentacles, new heads to the Hydra, and so we're just going to grow a bunch more.
[00:13:49.148 --> 00:13:49.828]  That's what we do.
[00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:50.870]  In fact, that's when we grow.
[00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.733]  That's our directive to grow when we're effectively attacked.
[00:13:54.741 --> 00:14:03.509]  That's in all organisms across this planet, and we follow the genetic model that God's laid down when it comes to info war.
[00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:08.513]  And so now we're going to just expend even more capital and just get more aggressive and work even harder.
[00:14:08.513 --> 00:14:12.496]  And we're going to double our output now against the enemy in the next 12 months.
[00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:15.459]  It was already pretty much planned, but I'm going to ensure that happens.
[00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.701]  So just continue to attack.
[00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:20.123]  The more successful you are, the more successful we'll be.
[00:14:20.123 --> 00:14:20.903]  That's how this works.
[00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:33.120]  So breaking, they successfully hacked InfoWars and posted a fake article that Ergun, the pretty much dictator, he had a staged election.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.021]  The guy caught by the Russians buying the ISIS oil.
[00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:38.143]  The Russians have blown up thousands of their trucks.
[00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:40.424]  They're now stopped the route out of Iraq.
[00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:51.901]  Um, up into Turkey, up through Syria, and so now they're going out of Iraq into Turkey, and there are thousands of trucks lined up there.
[00:14:51.901 --> 00:14:53.923]  The Russians have exposed all that.
[00:14:53.923 --> 00:14:58.125]  And so, uh, Ergun is threatening to blow up Russian ships in the Mediterranean.
[00:14:58.125 --> 00:14:59.486]  He's threatening to start World War III.
[00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:01.528]  He's threatening to shoot down more aircraft.
[00:15:01.528 --> 00:15:09.873]  The Russians, uh, obviously have been pointing out that Ergun, a month ago, invaded Iraq, uh, with actual tank battalions.
[00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:29.049]  They actually sent ground troops in, and so it is just a full-on battle with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and NATO, and others, fighting the Russians, the Iraqis, and the Syrians, who are battling the Al-Qaeda forces that are the proxy warriors for the West.
[00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:36.936]  And this is all just spilling out into the open, and so we see these feeble, I mean it is feeble,
[00:15:38.226 --> 00:15:42.068]  I mean, you go on, you post a fake article, like we're going to be upset by that.
[00:15:42.068 --> 00:15:44.990]  We're just going to come out and expose that you successfully did that.
[00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.852]  We'll just change our passcodes, increase our security.
[00:15:47.852 --> 00:15:52.415]  We've been, compared to a lot of other media outlets, very successful defeating a lot of this.
[00:15:52.415 --> 00:15:54.216]  We have a lot of great top hackers and people.
[00:15:55.919 --> 00:16:03.262]  Like Mr. Gray and others I need to get back in contact with who do routine analysis of the holes in our systems.
[00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.443]  There's always holes in everything.
[00:16:05.443 --> 00:16:08.524]  But we try to keep those holes to a minimum.
[00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:12.426]  So this is ongoing and it's what we expect.
[00:16:12.426 --> 00:16:16.067]  It's what we expect engaging the globalists.
[00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:19.149]  So there you see Paul Watson's account hacked.
[00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:21.249]  It is now shut down by Twitter for now.
[00:16:21.249 --> 00:16:24.491]  Locked down until Paul, who is in transit,
[00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.071]  Uh, visiting family in Europe.
[00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:32.473]  So as soon as he's able to, uh, he will get the Twitter account back under his control.
[00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:35.435]  Uh, the hackers are not, are no longer in control.
[00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:36.655]  Twitter has locked it down.
[00:16:36.655 --> 00:16:41.618]  Uh, our Twitter account is locked down right now, but we're in contact with them.
[00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:48.941]  Uh, they didn't successfully take over the real Alex Jones, but they successfully tried to change the passcode so many times it locked out.
[00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:53.078]  And by the way, these are long passcodes.
[00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:58.862]  These are not our dates of birth or our mommy's dates of birth or middle names.
[00:16:58.862 --> 00:17:02.285]  You know, the classic questions banks ask you.
[00:17:02.285 --> 00:17:07.109]  So they clearly got a breach into someone's computer.
[00:17:09.397 --> 00:17:12.580]  We're really going into the info war against these people.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.322]  Kevin Booth, who's had major documentaries air on Showtime and on HBO.
[00:17:33.203 --> 00:17:42.983]  And on other major networks, documentary filmmaker, also film producer, good friend of mine, known for years, Bill Hicks producer.
[00:17:44.071 --> 00:17:53.455]  He was already going to be in studio today and he has a major Turkish insider who's been tracking ISIS and the government working with ISIS.
[00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:56.876]  This gentleman is now in hiding and has had to flee Turkey.
[00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:59.397]  He is going to be joining us with Kevin via Skype.
[00:17:59.397 --> 00:18:01.038]  Kevin Booth will be in the in-studio.
[00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:06.720]  He's back in Texas visiting family over the Christmas holiday, normally out in Los Angeles.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.223]  So we are going to show you exclusive footage from Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:18:13.437 --> 00:18:14.018]  We're good to go.
[00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:36.779]  Wasn't playing both sides.
[00:18:36.779 --> 00:18:37.859]  People say, oh, they were just playing both sides.
[00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:38.819]  No, they weren't.
[00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:46.643]  They have been working from day one with the Russians and with the Syrians to not let Al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia take over.
[00:18:46.643 --> 00:18:48.203]  They've been totally against it.
[00:18:48.203 --> 00:18:51.585]  They went public three years ago and said, don't be Al Qaeda's air force.
[00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:53.345]  It was such a big deal.
[00:18:53.345 --> 00:18:57.887]  I told you it won't bring down the globalist overnight, but it has wounded them grievously.
[00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:58.848]  They're crippled right now.
[00:18:59.662 --> 00:19:14.006]  Like, you know, the Bismarck German battleship, twice the size of the British battleships, finally had its rudder shot, and it was spinning in circles, and it wasn't long until it went to the bottom of the deep blue sea to Davy Jones' locker.
[00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:26.589]  Well, this is the type of crippling blow, just like the Russians blowing climate change wide open by hacking the UN and the University of Cambridge, and England and others.
[00:19:26.589 --> 00:19:28.650]  This is a devastating blow.
[00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:31.252]  Devastating.
[00:19:31.252 --> 00:19:35.415]  And we intend to continue rubbing, rubbing into the wound.
[00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:43.502]  This just has them howling mad that the criminals that have hijacked our government have been caught running ISIS.
[00:19:43.502 --> 00:19:56.251]  They now have the Democrats out saying they want national taxes to pay for the fight against ISIS that Hillary Clinton literally laid down on her back four years ago and gave birth to.
[00:19:56.251 --> 00:19:58.193]  I mean, that baby came out of mama.
[00:19:59.381 --> 00:20:00.782]  911, what is your emergency?
[00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:02.304]  There's somebody in my house.

[00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:10.952]  Homes without a security system are up to three times more vulnerable to a burglary.
[00:20:10.952 --> 00:20:12.873]  That's why they're SimpliSafe.

[00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:04.919]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:08.101]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:17.267]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:19.428]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support
[00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:19.668]  We're good.
[00:21:39.457 --> 00:21:41.740]  Don't throw those gift cards away.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:50.150]  Use that money to get high quality products and save 15% in the process, all the while funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:51.532]  That's a 360 win.
[00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:53.394]  Don't donate your money to the banksters.
[00:21:53.394 --> 00:21:57.680]  Visit InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[00:21:58.462 --> 00:22:05.549]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:09.533]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:12.936]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:18.041]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:29.145]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again, but be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[00:22:29.145 --> 00:22:39.170]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.091]  Don't miss out.
[00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:46.297]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[00:22:46.297 --> 00:22:51.903]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:55.566]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[00:22:55.566 --> 00:22:56.628]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[00:22:58.544 --> 00:22:59.364]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:22:59.364 --> 00:23:01.145]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:02.806]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:23:02.806 --> 00:23:05.627]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:23:05.627 --> 00:23:07.908]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:12.430]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.372]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[00:23:20.554 --> 00:23:22.195]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:23:27.654 --> 00:23:31.117]  So you've got to take a state construction license exam or certification.

[00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:07.605]  So to be clear, I'm going to move out of this hacking story of InfoWars.
[00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:13.291]  Again, InfoWars successfully hacked, but you've got to quantify success.
[00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:21.020]  The camel's nose did get under the tent flap, but we stomped on it within 11 minutes, 12 minutes of it being under the flap.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.944]  So it ran honking and squawking off into the desert.
[00:24:25.182 --> 00:24:26.964]  Quite literally.
[00:24:26.964 --> 00:24:34.791]  But we will continue to redouble our vigilance and track exactly what's going on, obviously.
[00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:45.760]  But they were able to get into InfoWars about, now about 45 minutes ago, for 11 minutes, and they posted the article.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.601]  Here it is.
[00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:48.863]  We have a screenshot of it of your TV viewer.
[00:24:48.863 --> 00:24:51.245]  Adon Salazar is writing an article on this right now.
[00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:56.450]  And you will have a screenshot of that for radio listeners in the next hour or so.
[00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.031]  Breaking!
[00:24:57.031 --> 00:24:59.874]  coup d'etat in Turkey, Erdogan flees to U.S.
[00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:00.835]  airbase.
[00:25:00.835 --> 00:25:08.383]  President Erdogan Tuesday was overthrown as a result of coup d'etat.
[00:25:08.383 --> 00:25:12.288]  And it was put out by quote, David Knight is who they claimed did it.
[00:25:13.826 --> 00:25:14.847]  So there you go.
[00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:18.452]  That is what they were able to do.
[00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:20.855]  They were able to hijack Paul Watson's account successfully.
[00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:26.623]  They tried to hijack our Twitter account and it looks like they tried to get into everything else but failed.
[00:25:31.232 --> 00:25:36.975]  So they had some sophisticated computer systems plugged into things trying to break through codes and things.
[00:25:36.975 --> 00:25:42.678]  They didn't just get through an admin and then use that to get into some of the other accounts.
[00:25:42.678 --> 00:25:49.321]  They were in there trying to figure out codes across a wide spectrum of different systems.
[00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:51.903]  So this is not one person.
[00:25:51.903 --> 00:25:53.844]  And they're acting like they're the electronic
[00:25:55.009 --> 00:26:02.296]  The Syrian Electronic Army is pro-Syrian government, anti-Al Qaeda, al-Nusra, anti-ISIS.
[00:26:02.296 --> 00:26:13.347]  So this is done, in my opinion, with a first approximation, to discredit the Syrian Electronic Army and InfoWars.
[00:26:13.347 --> 00:26:15.570]  And again, I want to be clear, we don't engage in hacking.
[00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:21.897]  We don't engage in anything that could be considered illegal.
[00:26:21.897 --> 00:26:23.640]  We're out in the open, in the sunshine.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.263]  It's where we fight these tyrants.
[00:26:25.263 --> 00:26:26.746]  It's where we choose to meet the vampires.
[00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:27.908]  We don't scurry around in the dark.
[00:26:29.861 --> 00:26:35.924]  That's why usually when I go to an investigative report or something or I'm going to a foreign country, I say, I'm coming to your country to do this.
[00:26:35.924 --> 00:26:39.886]  And I tell the security services in an article addressed to them what I'm doing.
[00:26:39.886 --> 00:26:46.990]  And then they have, you know, MI5 and MI6 waiting for me at the hotel, want to have dinner and, you know, talk about what's coming up at Bilderberg.
[00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.250]  And I'd just rather have it that way.
[00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:52.296]  I'm a white knight, folks.
[00:26:52.296 --> 00:27:02.383]  I'm up here on the Green Hill, on the horse, with my spear, and, you know, I don't claim to be the toughest guy or the smartest guy around, but I know this, I'm going to take on tyranny.
[00:27:02.383 --> 00:27:05.946]  And I have nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of, because I'm in the right.
[00:27:05.946 --> 00:27:14.232]  And if I get struck down or destroyed or set up or politically assassinated with disinformation, that's just the way the cookie crumbles, folks.
[00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:17.335]  Our ancestors fought tooth and nail that we have basic liberty today.
[00:27:18.277 --> 00:27:22.641]  And I'm not going to let down my family name or my ancestors.
[00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.983]  So, I'm committed.
[00:27:24.983 --> 00:27:29.867]  So many people are scared of being demonized by the media or being physically attacked.
[00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:35.831]  You're going to lose everything if you don't stand up and act like a man.
[00:27:35.831 --> 00:27:38.013]  Don't people get that?
[00:27:38.013 --> 00:27:43.278]  And I know our listeners understand that, but the globalists miscalculated.
[00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:45.840]  They may have half the American people in a coma.
[00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:47.890]  Roughly, is what the numbers show.
[00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.454]  A little more than half don't know what planet they're on.
[00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:53.715]  Liberals, conservatives, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:53.715 --> 00:28:01.241]  They're just a pack of brain-dead entertainment heads, self-propelled stomachs, who basically aren't even alive, in my view.
[00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:07.346]  I'm not going to say they're animals, because at least animals are motivated by some consciousness and an agenda.
[00:28:07.346 --> 00:28:13.892]  They are spectators at their own funeral, at the death of their consciousness.
[00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:16.980]  They don't like reality.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:22.563]  Anthony Guthardt made a great point yesterday in a Facebook message we did, that reality is viral.
[00:28:22.563 --> 00:28:26.725]  Not fake reality TV, not fake stuff they say is reality, but it isn't.
[00:28:26.725 --> 00:28:32.889]  But real reality, teleprompter-free reality, that is viral.
[00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:38.792]  And that's the crossroads that we've now reached.
[00:28:38.792 --> 00:28:44.856]  And we have just seen unprecedented demonization and lies against Infowars the last few months.
[00:28:46.297 --> 00:28:48.899]  And people will pat me on the back and say, man, I'm really sorry, bud.
[00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:52.042]  They're attacking you on local news, local radio, local paper.
[00:28:52.042 --> 00:28:53.804]  I turn on national TV, they're attacking you.
[00:28:53.804 --> 00:28:54.845]  Man, it must be rough.
[00:28:54.845 --> 00:29:00.029]  Must be rough that an occupied government, sworn to enslave the people, doesn't like me?
[00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:03.792]  I absolutely love it!
[00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:06.315]  I came to fight!
[00:29:06.315 --> 00:29:10.598]  The only way that tyrants and evil men flourish is that good men do nothing.
[00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:11.279]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:15.536]  The enemy hates me?
[00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:17.597]  The enemy lies about me?
[00:29:17.597 --> 00:29:19.498]  I love it!
[00:29:19.498 --> 00:29:23.361]  Because it means I'm effective.
[00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:31.546]  And see, if you can pick up on that paradox, other people would fall to their knees and roll around in catatonic states being demonized because they don't have a strong self-image.
[00:29:31.546 --> 00:29:32.747]  They don't believe in anything.
[00:29:34.526 --> 00:29:40.288]  Enemies that put fluoride in our water to brain damage our kids and write books bragging about it the White House science czar?
[00:29:40.288 --> 00:29:43.129]  And then I'm upset if they demonize me?
[00:29:43.129 --> 00:29:48.051]  If you're not being demonized by the enemy, folks, you're on the wrong side!
[00:29:48.051 --> 00:29:49.452]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.452 --> 00:29:51.973]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.973 --> 00:29:54.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.218]  Are you looking for affordable housing?
[00:30:00.218 --> 00:30:02.419]  Well, check out these headlines.
[00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:05.802]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[00:30:05.802 --> 00:30:07.263]  265 square foot apartments.
[00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:09.964]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[00:30:09.964 --> 00:30:14.567]  Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[00:30:14.567 --> 00:30:16.529]  It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:19.090]  Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:23.973]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme, but she's living in the West Village for just $775 a month.
[00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:26.415]  And here's one out of New York.
[00:30:26.415 --> 00:30:30.717]  What living in a dumpster for a year taught this professor about the things we don't need.
[00:30:30.717 --> 00:30:32.618]  All these articles have one thing in common.
[00:30:32.618 --> 00:30:36.341]  You are being trained and conditioned to accept less.
[00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:40.623]  We are living in a society that's going through monumental technological changes.
[00:30:40.623 --> 00:30:43.985]  We have the ability to create systems where everyone can prosper.
[00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:45.226]  But what's going on?
[00:30:45.226 --> 00:30:51.449]  The social engineers and social controllers of the world want us to expect less while paying more.
[00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:52.710]  It's all about social control.
[00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.072]  And this is the main reason why they won it.
[00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:58.576]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:02.100]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:07.927]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing
[00:31:08.007 --> 00:31:08.267]  We're good.
[00:31:28.579 --> 00:31:32.960]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.102]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:49.954]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:32:50.294 --> 00:32:52.435]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:55.857]  Visit Infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:55.857 --> 00:32:57.158]  Fortune favors the bold.
[00:32:57.158 --> 00:33:01.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:07.163]  When I was young, I was the nicest guy I knew.
[00:33:19.332 --> 00:33:29.419]  I thought I was the chosen one But time went by and I found out a thing or two
[00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:42.077]  InfoWars is investigating David Knight, myself, Joe Biggs, the Gulan schools that get billions of dollars of U.S.
[00:33:42.077 --> 00:33:43.638]  tax money.
[00:33:43.638 --> 00:33:47.559]  Their estimated wealth is between 25 and 50 plus billion dollars globally.
[00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:49.080]  They're based out of Turkey.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.401]  Their entire board is in Turkey.
[00:33:51.401 --> 00:33:55.742]  They get 500 million a year plus from Texas taxpayers.
[00:33:55.742 --> 00:34:00.504]  In charter school money, and you think you're sending your kid to a regular school, it is a Islamic caliphate.
[00:34:00.504 --> 00:34:01.825]  They actually teach the caliphate.
[00:34:02.722 --> 00:34:09.745]  Then they have Rachel Maddow and everybody get up on MSNBC and say there is no Caliphate, there are no schools, there are no training facilities.
[00:34:09.745 --> 00:34:13.967]  Really, we just had one in Houston this weekend with our drone flying over it.
[00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:18.969]  Looks like a 5A high school.
[00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:23.591]  And Joe Biggs has got his report almost ready with all that.
[00:34:23.591 --> 00:34:26.212]  So, is it connected to that?
[00:34:27.549 --> 00:34:34.473]  Or is the successful hack of Infowars to put up a fake story that the president of Turkey, Ergun, fled to a U.S.
[00:34:34.473 --> 00:34:46.321]  airbase in a coup in Turkey because the Gulan schools are fighting with him, he's suing him here, the head of Gulan hasn't shown up to trial dates, court dates, there's an arrest warrant out.
[00:34:47.816 --> 00:34:49.798]  I mean, that's just the Arab world, folks.
[00:34:49.798 --> 00:35:01.346]  They just fight with each other constantly, and there's no civilization, because everyone is scrabbling for power constantly, instead of just trying to plant crops, or invent things, or build things.
[00:35:01.346 --> 00:35:02.867]  And the Middle East wasn't always like that.
[00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:06.390]  So much of our science came from there, and it didn't used to be so backward.
[00:35:09.397 --> 00:35:15.862]  But it's economy via conquest or economy via innovation?
[00:35:15.862 --> 00:35:25.731]  And all economies have always been a mix of the two, historically, but now we're shifting to an economy of conquest and we're being conquered by the globalists.
[00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:28.173]  We think we're part of the conquering American empire.
[00:35:29.602 --> 00:35:47.386]  Global government is financial institutions with diplomatic immunity above the law that control the UN army known as NATO that are trying to destroy every sovereign country in the world incrementally with a soft kill economic program so they don't know what hit them.
[00:35:47.386 --> 00:35:55.688]  Russia has successfully reverse engineered how they've been taken down, how the communists were put in in 1917, how their population was reduced.
[00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.951]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn helped expose it.
[00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:01.353]  I helped reverse engineer it.
[00:36:01.353 --> 00:36:02.494]  I'm not bragging, it's fact.
[00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:07.577]  The Russians have downloaded my info, looked at it, found it to be accurate.
[00:36:07.577 --> 00:36:10.479]  They've now moved on past that and are
[00:36:11.621 --> 00:36:13.623]  Not going along with the New World Order.
[00:36:13.623 --> 00:36:14.904]  I mean, I've always had a global show.
[00:36:14.904 --> 00:36:16.565]  It's about communicating to world leaders.
[00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:17.646]  It's about reaching out to everybody.
[00:36:17.646 --> 00:36:31.198]  It's about... I don't dumb this show down for the dumbed-down masses that think they're liberal because they want to ban Christmas and ban a white Christmas and ban paper bags and ban ethnic food in a college line because it's racist.
[00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:34.782]  Or they want to ban Lynch Hall because they think about lynching.
[00:36:34.782 --> 00:36:35.803]  We don't target
[00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:37.630]  The brain dead.
[00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.633]  As Christ said, let the dead bury the dead.
[00:36:40.633 --> 00:36:42.935]  Knock the dust off your feet.
[00:36:42.935 --> 00:36:45.838]  Pearls before swine.
[00:36:45.838 --> 00:36:46.318]  We're here.
[00:36:47.421 --> 00:37:10.868]  Like when I had, basically, he was the head of their parliament, the head of the Diet, the Vice President of Japan on, or the former head of German intelligence on, or the former head of technical at the NSA on, or all these other CIA whistleblowers and CIA aircraft bosses, and I mean, from the bottom to the top, we've had them all on.
[00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:15.309]  Terry Reid, you know, the whole dark alliance
[00:37:16.365 --> 00:37:17.365]  Gary Webb story.
[00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:20.387]  I was talking to Gary Webb two weeks before he got shot twice in the head.
[00:37:20.387 --> 00:37:28.050]  I mean, I interviewed the DC madam a month before she died, and she was trying to tell me stuff off air.
[00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.630]  I knew full well it was all tapped.
[00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:35.433]  I said, do not tell me a word about your client list in DC.
[00:37:35.433 --> 00:37:37.434]  Fans know they got a recording of it.
[00:37:37.434 --> 00:37:40.355]  I said, you say this stuff on air or nowhere.
[00:37:41.104 --> 00:37:42.906]  Because then we're covered.
[00:37:42.906 --> 00:37:44.667]  And she goes, oh, don't worry.
[00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:45.528]  I've got all the info.
[00:37:45.528 --> 00:37:48.230]  They're not going to mess with me.
[00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:53.395]  And I said, look, it's known who your client list was.
[00:37:53.395 --> 00:37:59.380]  She came on via former NSA person that got me in contact with her, and they hung her in her mama's shed.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.063]  And then I got a call from her condo manager.
[00:38:03.063 --> 00:38:03.904]  He said, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:04.983 --> 00:38:06.083]  She was getting ready to leave the country.
[00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:06.964]  They were death-threatening her.
[00:38:06.964 --> 00:38:08.564]  She would have never killed herself.
[00:38:08.564 --> 00:38:11.225]  That handwriting in her death note is fake.
[00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:15.686]  And he sent me a copy of her lease and notes to her that I showed on air.
[00:38:15.686 --> 00:38:21.228]  It wasn't, didn't even look like the same person.
[00:38:21.228 --> 00:38:24.729]  Be like if they said I committed suicide and it was written in Chinese.
[00:38:24.729 --> 00:38:29.310]  I don't, I don't write or speak Chinese folks or Hebrew, you know, maybe Yiddish.
[00:38:36.107 --> 00:38:37.748]  And I'm not trying to freak people out.
[00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:41.651]  I want you to know the real world I live in.
[00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:44.472]  You go watch these James Bond movies over here.
[00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:46.874]  That's all fantasy land, folks.
[00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:48.735]  The real war is going on right now.
[00:38:48.735 --> 00:38:51.957]  It's in the supermarket line with the GMO food.
[00:38:51.957 --> 00:38:53.678]  It's in the high fructose corn syrup.
[00:38:53.678 --> 00:38:54.619]  It's in the aspartame.
[00:38:54.619 --> 00:38:58.121]  It's in the GMO garbage.
[00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:00.203]  It's in the MSG.
[00:39:02.352 --> 00:39:09.634]  And they think you're so dumb, they've written white papers and books galore, just admitting the whole stinking thing.
[00:39:09.634 --> 00:39:15.215]  But we just talked to RIT people, and I'm going to shift gears into other news.
[00:39:15.215 --> 00:39:18.716]  And they said, very sophisticated.
[00:39:18.716 --> 00:39:24.538]  They came in, did what they did, then wiped everything, their trail.
[00:39:24.538 --> 00:39:28.239]  And they didn't just get into InfoWars, they got into Twitter and other things.
[00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:36.233]  And they came in and they posted a fake article breaking coup d'etat in Turkey.
[00:39:36.233 --> 00:39:37.253]  Ergun flees to U.S.
[00:39:37.253 --> 00:39:37.593]  Air Base.
[00:39:37.593 --> 00:39:45.557]  In fact, I was in here and they brought in new articles as I was looking at literally hundreds of others and I said, what is this?
[00:39:45.557 --> 00:39:45.997]  Ergun?
[00:39:45.997 --> 00:39:46.597]  Who wrote this?
[00:39:46.597 --> 00:39:48.358]  This doesn't have a byline.
[00:39:48.358 --> 00:39:52.660]  This says David K. Knight hardly ever writes articles.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.561]  I said, go get David, please.
[00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:56.382]  I said, this isn't right.
[00:39:56.382 --> 00:39:58.003]  Because I was looking at the article and
[00:39:59.153 --> 00:40:05.218]  It was written by somebody who could tell English isn't their first language.
[00:40:05.218 --> 00:40:11.563]  And instantly, Anthony and Buckley came running in going, yeah, a fake article's been posted.
[00:40:11.563 --> 00:40:12.204]  I go, how long ago?
[00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:13.024]  They looked at their watch.
[00:40:13.024 --> 00:40:13.545]  11 minutes ago.
[00:40:13.545 --> 00:40:15.106]  It's down now.
[00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:17.008]  Don Salazar caught it.
[00:40:17.008 --> 00:40:18.409]  And I said, check everything.
[00:40:18.409 --> 00:40:19.049]  Check all the Twitter.
[00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.130]  Check all the Facebook.
[00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:25.094]  But I said, number one, run over there and make sure they haven't tried to breach any of the big bank systems.
[00:40:25.094 --> 00:40:25.795]  Obviously, they hadn't.
[00:40:27.092 --> 00:40:33.217]  That's all big third-party stuff, but the point is this is what goes on in this world.
[00:40:33.217 --> 00:40:45.886]  And I would say 50-50 it was done to try to scare us away from investigating these charter schools that actually teach the caliphate.
[00:40:47.022 --> 00:40:50.765]  I remember hearing this like five years ago, you better cover the caliphate in these schools!
[00:40:50.765 --> 00:40:52.746]  And I'm just like, oh, give me a break.
[00:40:52.746 --> 00:40:54.347]  I mean, it's just, I didn't believe it.
[00:40:54.347 --> 00:41:02.954]  And then we start investigating and it's billions of taxpayer money a year to teach the most hardcore drivel.
[00:41:02.954 --> 00:41:08.298]  And then you learn Saudi Arabia, and I stand by the fact that Saudi Arabia is buying up Fox News, it's buying up Hollywood.
[00:41:08.298 --> 00:41:11.180]  People go, oh, you're covering up for the Jews, they own Hollywood.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.442]  Nobody debates that Jews dominate Hollywood.
[00:41:14.369 --> 00:41:15.810]  I've been out there.
[00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:19.713]  Powerful Jewish directors, producers, a lot of Italians as well.
[00:41:19.713 --> 00:41:20.994]  That's just what I see.
[00:41:20.994 --> 00:41:23.336]  But a lot of, you know, people with other surnames.
[00:41:23.336 --> 00:41:27.519]  But yeah, I mean, the Jews went out there and founded Hollywood.
[00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:29.941]  They ran a lot of the theater in New York and whatever.
[00:41:29.941 --> 00:41:34.345]  The point is, is that Saudi Arabia is influencing our movies.
[00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:37.968]  China is influencing our movies more and more.
[00:41:39.537 --> 00:41:45.222]  I mean, I turn on movies all the time now and it's just how great the Politburo is and how great the Communist Chinese are in mainline U.S.
[00:41:45.222 --> 00:41:50.247]  movies.
[00:41:50.247 --> 00:41:53.390]  They stopped Red Dawn from coming out and had it re-edited for a year and a half.
[00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.691]  It just goes on and on.
[00:41:54.691 --> 00:41:58.335]  Michael Savage's book got censored by the Communist Chinese, the one before this last one.
[00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:03.261]  And what I'm saying is, I've dealt with the Saudi Arabians.
[00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:05.443]  I've dealt with the stuff they pulled.
[00:42:05.443 --> 00:42:11.408]  I have experienced the power of the radical Islamic lobby because I didn't want to start a war over there.
[00:42:11.408 --> 00:42:13.089]  I didn't want to clash with civilizations.
[00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:14.731]  I didn't want to invade and blame Iraq.
[00:42:14.731 --> 00:42:16.332]  It had nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:42:16.332 --> 00:42:28.742]  So the left didn't like me because I was pro-gun and pro-life, but they tolerated me when Bush was in because I exposed so much stuff that they could get political points out of.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.702]  But now that we are being flooded with millions across Europe and the U.S.
[00:42:33.702 --> 00:42:45.850]  of people that invaded Syria to take it over with their whole families, and they're saying, we hate you, we're taking over, we're going to get you, and they're getting taxpayer money, I'm like, no, because they're going to attack and then they're going to take my rights.
[00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:48.311]  And now they're announcing mandatory naked body scanners.
[00:42:48.311 --> 00:42:49.812]  They want them on the highways.
[00:42:49.812 --> 00:42:54.015]  They're announcing federal taxes to, quote, fight ISIS when they're the ones that helped create it.
[00:42:56.129 --> 00:42:57.772]  I'm against the globalist agenda.
[00:42:57.772 --> 00:42:58.854]  We failed.
[00:42:58.854 --> 00:43:01.299]  We let the globalists destabilize the Middle East.
[00:43:01.299 --> 00:43:03.222]  Now they're going to collapse it into us.
[00:43:03.222 --> 00:43:03.463]  No!
[00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:10.682]  And they've got all their operatives and their professors threatening us and just coming out of the woodwork?
[00:43:10.682 --> 00:43:28.266]  Look, if I wasn't intimidated by the globalists that ran 9-11 with the radical jihadists, and if I'm not intimidated by the Mossad and others that have actually sent people here, and those are off-record discussions, but it's happened, if I'm not intimidated by the CIA, the Pentagon, the rest of it, do you Muslim radicals think you intimidate me?
[00:43:28.846 --> 00:43:31.350]  You don't intimidate me one bit.
[00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:36.016]  In fact, you helped me jump out of bed this morning with a spring in my step at 6 a.m.
[00:43:36.016 --> 00:43:46.170]  Whenever I get tired, folks, all I gotta do is remember all the people, all the tyrants and all the bullies and all the scum that think they're better than patriots of this country.
[00:43:47.295 --> 00:43:52.099]  And who think we're dead already and have rolled over all your intimidation and all your garbage.
[00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:55.721]  Radical jihadists, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:43:55.721 --> 00:43:56.902]  You people have no honor.
[00:43:56.902 --> 00:44:02.927]  Look at Al Sharpton calling for the Don of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, to step down.
[00:44:02.927 --> 00:44:09.992]  The New World Order gives that little FBI informant pimp all that power.
[00:44:09.992 --> 00:44:15.336]  And how he responds to his own maggot boss is to say, you should step down.
[00:44:15.336 --> 00:44:16.557]  And we need a black mayor.
[00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:23.024]  As soon as they get a black mayor, they can really, you know, tear the city down faster.
[00:44:23.024 --> 00:44:26.267]  Just like Obama could double black unemployment.
[00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:28.449]  That's why they do that stuff.
[00:44:28.449 --> 00:44:29.850]  I mean, it is just so sick.
[00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.012]  Why don't you put somebody in there who's black like the Milwaukee Sheriff?
[00:44:33.012 --> 00:44:34.434]  Oh, he'd fix things.
[00:44:34.434 --> 00:44:43.761]  I guarantee you, if they put somebody in there like the Milwaukee Sheriff, not because he's black because he knows what he's doing as a constitutionalist, I guarantee in four or five years they'd have that crime rate cut in half in Chicago.
[00:44:43.761 --> 00:44:44.102]  Guarantee.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.282]  But see, it's a criminal run system.
[00:44:47.282 --> 00:44:49.284]  They don't want it to be cut.
[00:44:49.284 --> 00:44:50.185]  They don't want it to stop.
[00:44:50.185 --> 00:44:55.730]  They want the gravy train to keep moving.
[00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.652]  So that's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:04.197]  And it's more important than ever for people to understand, when you see Rachel Maddow in two days,
[00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:18.695]  In 400-something newspapers and then 300-something newspapers the next day, attaching Alex Jones and lying about me, what does that tell you?
[00:45:18.695 --> 00:45:21.896]  That we are over the zeitgeist.
[00:45:21.896 --> 00:45:24.157]  We got payloads of truth.
[00:45:24.157 --> 00:45:25.317]  We're dropping bombs.
[00:45:25.317 --> 00:45:27.518]  We're blowing up enemy installations in the Infowar.
[00:45:28.533 --> 00:45:37.540]  Now, you can take what we've done, adapt it, learn from it, make it better, engage the globalists, start a YouTube channel, start a podcast, take action.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.443]  And don't let COINTELPRO come in and stir you up to end fight with other people.
[00:45:41.443 --> 00:45:48.989]  That's their only hope to stop the Liberty Movement is to sit there and mess with you and vent you off into one of their little mental illness clubs.
[00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:54.594]  Take action against the New World Order today, and it will fall.
[00:45:54.594 --> 00:45:54.734]  Now,
[00:45:58.467 --> 00:46:11.590]  Another reason it's going to fall, is destined to fall, is because its entire system is full of people that were compartmentalized and now know the truth.
[00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.191]  So a lot of positive things are happening.
[00:46:13.191 --> 00:46:17.992]  Also, do I have a special sheet in here today?
[00:46:17.992 --> 00:46:21.673]  I don't know what the heck, people might have forgotten to bring that in.
[00:46:21.673 --> 00:46:26.014]  We're running free shipping for everybody for the next week.
[00:46:27.415 --> 00:46:30.942]  It started off as, hey, people that have, you know, were given holiday cards.
[00:46:30.942 --> 00:46:32.185]  A lot of them can be used anywhere.
[00:46:32.185 --> 00:46:34.290]  A lot of people that were given, uh...
[00:46:36.428 --> 00:46:40.009]  A little shopping cards, what do you call them?
[00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:43.870]  My mind's so full of data, you know, gift cards.
[00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.991]  But a lot of people have gift cards that are specific to a certain source.
[00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:50.352]  So it's frustrating for them to not be able to get the 15% off already all the other big discounts.
[00:46:50.352 --> 00:46:58.035]  It's just 15% off for everybody that uses the promo code at checkout, and it says at checkout what the promo code is.
[00:46:58.035 --> 00:46:58.255]  Okay?
[00:46:58.255 --> 00:47:00.636]  Yeah, it's GIFTS15.
[00:47:02.242 --> 00:47:07.383]  So that's all you gotta do is go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:07.383 --> 00:47:17.006]  And look, these are all, Brain Force has the known ingredients, some of them prescription from Europe, not yet prescription here, that are known naturally to just boost cognitive ability, memory, all of it.
[00:47:17.006 --> 00:47:18.127]  It's just amazing.
[00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:21.027]  BrainForceInfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:21.027 --> 00:47:28.409]  Winter Sun, the great high quality vitamin D, the type that can be absorbed under the tongue.
[00:47:28.409 --> 00:47:29.670]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:31.598 --> 00:47:34.221]  We've got the Secret 12, Methylcobalamin, and Vitamin B12.
[00:47:34.221 --> 00:47:35.782]  The best you're going to find out there.
[00:47:35.782 --> 00:47:36.983]  We've got the Oxy Powder.
[00:47:36.983 --> 00:47:38.345]  We've got the X2.
[00:47:38.345 --> 00:47:40.307]  We've got a bunch of discounts running as well.
[00:47:40.307 --> 00:47:49.336]  But regardless, we need the funding to deal with legal and cyber security and everything we do.
[00:47:49.336 --> 00:47:53.781]  We don't get $2 billion like NBC and MSNBC to say, turn your guns in.
[00:47:54.690 --> 00:48:02.152]  We don't get $450 million a year, as I've said a thousand times or more, like NPR does, and beg for money every week, basically.
[00:48:02.152 --> 00:48:05.572]  We just get up here and we sell high-quality products and we have sponsors.
[00:48:05.572 --> 00:48:09.033]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:48:09.033 --> 00:48:11.933]  The Hillary for Prison shirts are limited edition.
[00:48:11.933 --> 00:48:13.054]  We're not going to make any more.
[00:48:13.054 --> 00:48:19.215]  And so while different sizes and supplies last, you can find that very popular shirt that I forgot.
[00:48:19.215 --> 00:48:22.236]  I mentioned, you know, that women and people were wearing it up at Trump rallies.
[00:48:22.236 --> 00:48:24.036]  I didn't know that Trump had actually tweeted it.
[00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:26.682]  Can we show the article today?
[00:48:26.682 --> 00:48:30.125]  Trump Tweets InfoWars T-Shirt.
[00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:33.087]  That story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:33.087 --> 00:48:35.009]  It says on the back, Legalize Freedom.
[00:48:35.009 --> 00:48:37.211]  InfoWars.com.
[00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:40.914]  And Weldon, again, said the last shipment came in.
[00:48:40.914 --> 00:48:42.095]  And that is what is available.
[00:48:42.095 --> 00:48:44.496]  It's so popular, I might make another variant of it or something.
[00:48:44.496 --> 00:48:46.058]  People are begging me not to get rid of it.
[00:48:46.058 --> 00:48:49.841]  But Hillary for President 2016.
[00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:51.962]  Well, it's now Hillary for Prison.
[00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.864]  And you can see the shirt at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:55.162 --> 00:49:03.991]  You have to understand, folks, that this is the animating contest for liberty.
[00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:10.758]  And I know the reason we're having a big effect is you are taking action, supporting our local affiliates, spreading the word.
[00:49:12.355 --> 00:49:22.102]  And we are a committed organization that will never back down, that will never falter or waver in our steadfastness to never quit.
[00:49:22.102 --> 00:49:26.765]  We may falter or waver in the fight, but our hearts will not falter and waver until they cease to be.
[00:49:28.888 --> 00:49:34.573]  And I just feel so sorry for people that are scared or on the fence who haven't gotten past their fear and committed.
[00:49:34.573 --> 00:49:45.003]  It's like coming out of a storm when you're on a sailboat and it's windy and it's scary and a squall blows through and you're out there for 30 minutes and you never think it's going to end and the boat might turn over and all of a sudden the squall blows out.
[00:49:45.003 --> 00:49:48.626]  I was on a sailboat with my dad one time as a kid when that happened.
[00:49:48.626 --> 00:49:55.312]  It's called a black squall or a blue squall and it was just blue sky and beautiful on that lake after we came through that.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:03.623]  And when we come through that, it's such a great thing.
[00:50:03.623 --> 00:50:11.387]  We give in to this, we shut up, we go along, we keep our heads down, we lose our heads.
[00:50:11.387 --> 00:50:18.171]  And to be a man, to be a human, is to truly defend your country and your ideals and your family.
[00:50:18.171 --> 00:50:20.633]  And I know I'm doing that, and I am so fulfilled
[00:50:22.924 --> 00:50:24.507]  It is humbling.
[00:50:24.507 --> 00:50:34.121]  When you really get fulfilled, when you really become a man, and that just means following the directive of what a man does, it is amazing.
[00:50:34.121 --> 00:50:37.487]  And I look around me and I see all these scared men trying to act like tough guys.
[00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:41.971]  And I realize that they have the potential to be real men.
[00:50:41.971 --> 00:50:47.893]  But they've got to first humble themselves and realize that they have a duty to stand up for others around them.
[00:50:47.893 --> 00:50:51.055]  And that means learning what's happening and then taking action.
[00:50:51.055 --> 00:50:55.177]  And standing up to ridicule, attacks, and persecution.
[00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:56.698]  Then you will be a man.
[00:50:56.698 --> 00:50:57.118]  Stay with us.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.060]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[00:52:27.725 --> 00:52:30.786]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:30.786 --> 00:52:33.427]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:52:33.427 --> 00:52:34.148]  Croix River.
[00:52:34.148 --> 00:52:36.389]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:52:36.389 --> 00:52:39.350]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:40.230]  His excuse?
[00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:41.551]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:41.551 --> 00:52:43.171]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:52:43.171 --> 00:52:48.934]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:54:48.504 --> 00:54:52.747]  government, CIA-funded domestic schools that are teaching caliphate.
[00:54:52.747 --> 00:55:04.117]  If they think hacking and continuing to hack InfoWars, as they're doing currently right now, is going to make us leave them alone, boy, I am coming after you now.
[00:55:04.117 --> 00:55:13.745]  So, doesn't mean I'm going to defeat you, but my listeners and all the people that we're going to chain reaction are going to come after you now.
[00:55:15.834 --> 00:55:22.637]  And I'm already after the Turkish corrupt government trying to murder every Christian and get their hands on, like they're Armenians or something.
[00:55:22.637 --> 00:55:24.837]  I'm already going after all of it.
[00:55:24.837 --> 00:55:27.278]  Period.
[00:55:27.278 --> 00:55:31.900]  And I'm gonna go after anybody else that defends it, like those Young Turks.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:35.361]  The Young Turk Party, folks, do you realize what the Young Turks did?
[00:55:35.361 --> 00:55:36.702]  The real Young Turk Party?
[00:55:36.702 --> 00:55:38.683]  This is all just sick jokes in our face.
[00:55:39.497 --> 00:55:41.398]  The more I sit back and look at it.
[00:55:41.398 --> 00:55:45.680]  And the left where they're all fake laughing like they're friendly and they're good.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.342]  They're sick taking this country down.
[00:55:50.342 --> 00:55:55.484]  And then they use the radical Islamic attacks on this country to take our freedoms.
[00:55:55.484 --> 00:55:59.526]  By the way, you know Jerry Brown signed the law, AB 1014.
[00:55:59.526 --> 00:56:03.508]  This is the KPCC headline.
[00:56:03.508 --> 00:56:07.530]  Police in California can seize guns without prior notice starting January 1st.
[00:56:08.897 --> 00:56:10.078]  It's not a real warrant.
[00:56:10.078 --> 00:56:11.679]  It's not a real restraining order.
[00:56:11.679 --> 00:56:19.005]  They just announced that they think you need to have a quote, wellness check, and they come and grab you and grab your guns.
[00:56:19.005 --> 00:56:24.130]  And then the way it works is you got to spend 20, 30 grand to get them back.
[00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:29.614]  I remember that headline two years ago, gun confiscation begins in California, Bloomberg business.
[00:56:29.614 --> 00:56:37.260]  See, in New York, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, areas like Chicago, California, they're just beta testing
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.681]  Stuff outside of law or passing laws.
[00:56:40.681 --> 00:56:43.783]  I mean, they're coming for our guns.
[00:56:43.783 --> 00:56:46.785]  They're coming for our basic freedoms.
[00:56:46.785 --> 00:56:52.608]  Police of California can seize guns without prior notice starting January 1st.
[00:56:52.608 --> 00:56:53.828]  Isn't that just special?
[00:56:53.828 --> 00:56:56.490]  Family members who believe a loved one poses a danger.
[00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.491]  Well, if they have proof or any statements, the police already have probable cause.
[00:56:59.491 --> 00:57:00.031]  But no, no, no.
[00:57:00.031 --> 00:57:00.872]  It's just they just feel.
[00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:11.010]  Family members who believe a loved one poses a danger to themselves or others will be able to ask police to seek a temporary gun violence restraining order from a judge.
[00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:14.374]  But if you actually read, it's these rubber stamps, like the blood draws they do.
[00:57:14.374 --> 00:57:19.079]  Beginning January 1st, the order would allow police to seize the person's guns for 21 days.
[00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:20.640]  Uh, yeah, right.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.422]  State lawmakers approved the legislation.
[00:57:22.422 --> 00:57:23.623]  Gary Brown signed it into law.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.082]  And then it just goes on through it.
[00:57:26.082 --> 00:57:39.619]  Oh, how about the FBI was trying to stop the two reported shooters in San Bernardino, but was ordered two years ago to stand down, and they had a Justice Department racism investigation done on them.
[00:57:41.198 --> 00:57:43.339]  Roger Stone sent me this article today.
[00:57:43.339 --> 00:57:46.441]  Donald Trump takes on Bill Clinton's behavior towards women.
[00:57:46.441 --> 00:57:53.945]  He of course, Trump Insider, told you a month ago when he was here and then again a few weeks ago that he's going to bring up Bill Clinton and all the rape settlements.
[00:57:53.945 --> 00:58:00.088]  So is Bill Clinton approaching his Cosby moment?
[00:58:00.088 --> 00:58:04.030]  Very bold by Mr. Trump.
[00:58:06.052 --> 00:58:07.393]  And we think it should be brought out.
[00:58:07.393 --> 00:58:09.634]  It's a fair game, as he says.
[00:58:09.634 --> 00:58:11.575]  Hey, how about this one to end the hour?
[00:58:11.575 --> 00:58:12.256]  Delusional!
[00:58:12.256 --> 00:58:14.897]  They're not delusional.
[00:58:14.897 --> 00:58:15.398]  The U.S.
[00:58:15.398 --> 00:58:18.620]  State Department credits Washington with bringing peace to Syria.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:23.603]  The State Department actually ran the destabilization of Syria because the Pentagon wasn't wholeheartedly for it.
[00:58:23.603 --> 00:58:28.446]  Hillary was cheap cook and bottle washer over the whole thing.
[00:58:28.446 --> 00:58:29.967]  Gave birth to ISIS.
[00:58:29.967 --> 00:58:33.229]  And now the same State Department comes out and takes credit for bringing peace.
[00:58:35.131 --> 00:58:38.856]  I mean, these people got a lot of nerve.
[00:58:38.856 --> 00:58:40.438]  You didn't build that business either, huh?

[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:15.003]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.003 --> 01:00:22.806]  Kevin Booth, fresh back from Turkey, is going to be in studio with us with major investigative info.
[01:00:22.806 --> 01:00:32.070]  One reason we may be getting a massive hack attack ongoing right now, it's still ongoing, but that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger and helps us learn, so thank you.
[01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:35.572]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the special report and I'll be back after the break with Kevin Booth in studio.
[01:00:36.451 --> 01:00:38.171]  Kid Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:49.734]  Let's talk about so-called white privilege, this notion that white people have advantages in society simply because of their skin color or the fact that their ancestors may have taken land or goods from other ethnic groups in centuries past.
[01:00:49.734 --> 01:00:59.797]  I'm sure you've heard the phrase before on the internet, particularly mainstream media, especially after the recent University of Missouri protests, where protesters demanded that the university president
[01:01:00.217 --> 01:01:03.939]  Recognize his white privilege, but are white people the only ones with racial privilege?
[01:01:03.939 --> 01:01:05.640]  I mean, do they have a monopoly on it?
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.481]  And by the way, what exactly is a white person?
[01:01:07.481 --> 01:01:11.904]  I mean, in college, I had a roommate who was one 16th African American.
[01:01:11.904 --> 01:01:15.086]  So does that mean he only has 15th, 16th white privilege?
[01:01:15.086 --> 01:01:16.287]  I mean, how do we define that?
[01:01:16.287 --> 01:01:22.511]  I mean, are we going to have to use Nazi family tree charts, for example, to determine how white a person is?
[01:01:22.511 --> 01:01:28.034]  If their mother or grandmother was white, that means he has this much white privilege or how do we define that?
[01:01:28.294 --> 01:01:36.858]  This very notion that you can group people into racial groups that have certain privileges is racist in itself, because at that point you're not even looking at people by their individual qualities.
[01:01:36.858 --> 01:01:37.899]  You're grouping them by race.
[01:01:37.899 --> 01:01:42.201]  You're inviting them into races, and that is inherently racist when you judge people by their skin color.
[01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:47.144]  But for the sake of discussion, let's take the leftist argument that all white people are into one group.
[01:01:47.144 --> 01:01:53.227]  Does that one group really have all the privileges in the world, or do other groups also have advantages present in the past?
[01:01:53.407 --> 01:02:06.883]  For one thing, a couple years ago I saw this video that went viral online of these anti-illegal immigration protesters who were confronted by this Native American who was claiming that, hey, you are all illegals, you are all invaders, go back to Europe, go back to your own countries.
[01:02:06.883 --> 01:02:08.785]  You're all illegal!
[01:02:08.785 --> 01:02:10.667]  You're all illegal!
[01:02:10.667 --> 01:02:12.269]  We didn't invite none of you here!
[01:02:12.469 --> 01:02:15.431]  And of course the leftists took the video to claim that, hey, he's right.
[01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:19.934]  You know, white people really did come in here and use their privilege to take the land away from the Native Americans.
[01:02:19.934 --> 01:02:21.475]  But here's what they're not telling you.
[01:02:21.475 --> 01:02:25.979]  Most of these Native American tribes back in the day were fighting each other for the same land.
[01:02:25.979 --> 01:02:30.722]  You know, you had, so, for example, the Comanches fighting the Wichita and so forth.
[01:02:30.862 --> 01:02:34.024]  Basically speaking, the Native American tribes did have an advantage.
[01:02:34.024 --> 01:02:35.365]  They were on this land first.
[01:02:35.365 --> 01:02:40.448]  They were on this land thousands of years before the first Europeans even set sight on this land.
[01:02:40.448 --> 01:02:41.429]  So they had an advantage.
[01:02:41.429 --> 01:02:43.030]  They had a privilege.
[01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:46.712]  They had this land before anyone else, and that was a huge advantage.
[01:02:46.712 --> 01:02:48.773]  Simply put, they fought each other over it.
[01:02:48.773 --> 01:02:54.217]  So you had this whole conquest mentality that predated the first Europeans setting foot on North America.
[01:02:54.417 --> 01:03:05.984]  You know, on the other side of the world, and I'm not talking about white European side of the world, you had the Ottomans, and the Persians, and the Arabs, and so on and so forth, all these non-whites that were fighting each other over the same pieces of land.
[01:03:05.984 --> 01:03:09.887]  So, you know, you see this conquest ethics, this conquest mentality.
[01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:12.148]  It's not just, white people don't have a novelty on it.
[01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:19.753]  It wasn't just the British Empire, and the Spanish Empire, and the Portuguese Empire, Roman Empire, all these empires that were predominantly Caucasian,
[01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:21.373]  So to speak.
[01:03:21.373 --> 01:03:23.334]  They didn't have a monopoly on conquest.
[01:03:23.334 --> 01:03:28.937]  Just about every single ethnic group in the world has had a conquest at a time or two.
[01:03:28.937 --> 01:03:34.179]  But going back to the Native American example, the current core tenet of social justice is to correct for history.
[01:03:34.179 --> 01:03:38.641]  For example, let's say that the United States decides to give all its land back to the Native Americans.
[01:03:38.641 --> 01:03:41.882]  You know, the country is going to shut down and give the land back to who was here first.
[01:03:41.882 --> 01:03:42.623]  But who do you give it to?
[01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:45.664]  Do you give it to the Apache or to the Comanche or the Navajo?
[01:03:46.304 --> 01:03:54.127]  I mean, the point being all these tribes occupy the same land at one point or the other and they all fought each other over it.
[01:03:54.127 --> 01:03:55.228]  So who do you give the land to?
[01:03:55.228 --> 01:04:02.151]  I mean, you get this complex history, this world history of conquest and divide and conquer and what have you.
[01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:11.495]  So there is no rectifying history concerning that every single ethnic group in world history is guilty of conquest and oppression.
[01:04:11.775 --> 01:04:15.998]  And all these leftists and social justice warriors are out protesting against white privilege.
[01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:23.724]  They're complete hypocrites because you never see one of them say that, hey, I'm going to quit my job at this company so a misplaced minority can take my place.
[01:04:23.724 --> 01:04:31.229]  Or the college kids, for example, you never hear them say, hey, I'm going to withdraw from the university so that a misplaced minority can take my seat in this classroom.
[01:04:31.229 --> 01:04:32.630]  No, you never hear that at all, do you?
[01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.832]  That's the sheer hypocrisy of the social justice warrior movement.
[01:04:35.832 --> 01:04:42.076]  They want to take things from you and give it to minorities they say are being oppressed without doing it themselves.
[01:04:42.076 --> 01:04:46.319]  And how are they going to decide which minorities are the most oppressed anyway?
[01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:51.642]  I mean, simply put, every single ethnic group in world history has been oppressed at one time or another.
[01:04:51.642 --> 01:04:53.723]  So what are you going to do then about all this inequality?
[01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:54.464]  Well, it's pretty simple.
[01:04:54.804 --> 01:05:00.168]  Quit dividing people by racial groups, quit judging them by their skin color, and instead see people as individuals.
[01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:15.099]  Will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:22.186]  Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya, were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:28.433]  Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenzatine during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths.
[01:05:29.614 --> 01:05:36.000]  When a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.064]  He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter.
[01:05:40.064 --> 01:05:42.707]  A sentence critics saw as far too light.
[01:05:42.707 --> 01:05:50.454]  Cowt and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[01:05:50.454 --> 01:05:53.577]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[01:07:38.374 --> 01:07:39.235]  It's so simple.

[01:08:18.734 --> 01:08:24.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:30.845]  My friends, don't take InfoWars.com and our backup site PrisonPlanet.com for granted.
[01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:34.608]  Please don't take the fact that we're on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube for granted.
[01:08:34.608 --> 01:08:37.291]  We deal with constant censorship, constant harassment.
[01:08:38.975 --> 01:08:45.318]  We've been successfully hacked two other times in the last 18-19 years that I've been an internet presence.
[01:08:45.318 --> 01:08:48.360]  I was on radio and TV about a year before I had a website.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.660]  Two years.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.962]  But we have had successful hack attacks of InfoWars today.
[01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:59.965]  Posting the fake article breaking coup d'etat in Turkey, Erdogan flees the US airbase.
[01:08:59.965 --> 01:09:04.167]  And they are currently trying to break back in yet again.
[01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:05.528]  And we have two different
[01:09:06.846 --> 01:09:13.452]  Good IT companies, and they say it's very sophisticated what they're doing.
[01:09:13.452 --> 01:09:18.856]  It is the CIA that has been funding the Turkish government and funding ISIS.
[01:09:18.856 --> 01:09:21.578]  That, of course, has been exposed by this show and others.
[01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:33.688]  The Syrian Electronic Army, three years ago and then again two years ago, and I can show you some of those articles here if you're a TV viewer, took over CNN, you name it.
[01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:38.058]  Literally hundreds of publications and posted InfoWars.com links.
[01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:40.377]  We do not endorse that.
[01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:41.297]  We do not support that.
[01:09:41.297 --> 01:09:42.758]  We're not involved in that.
[01:09:42.758 --> 01:09:45.720]  But there were links exposing that Al-Qaeda was the main rebel force.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.820]  That of course later came out.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.522]  You now see the Pentagon saying they don't want to be part of this.
[01:09:49.522 --> 01:09:57.346]  It has been a devastating victory against the globalists in Saudi Arabia and Turkey and NATO trying to overthrow the Middle East and put radical Islamists in.
[01:09:57.346 --> 01:10:03.769]  I have stacks of articles today that are executing women for free speech, death sentences for poets.
[01:10:03.769 --> 01:10:06.130]  I just oppose totalitarianism.
[01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:07.051]  I'm not anti-Islam.
[01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:09.870]  But I'm against funding radical Islam to take over the world.
[01:10:10.993 --> 01:10:15.255]  And it comes out of Saudi Arabia, and then using the threat of it to take my freedoms and my family's freedoms.
[01:10:15.255 --> 01:10:16.936]  I mean, I'm a real liberal, folks.
[01:10:16.936 --> 01:10:18.577]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:10:18.577 --> 01:10:20.198]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[01:10:20.198 --> 01:10:21.078]  I'm that kind of liberal.
[01:10:21.078 --> 01:10:25.901]  Not the modern liberals with political correctness saying, ban, it's a, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
[01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:31.743]  And they're actually doing that and, you know, saying if a white person wants to eat Chinese food, it's cultural appropriation.
[01:10:31.743 --> 01:10:33.384]  They're actually banning that at universities.
[01:10:33.384 --> 01:10:39.748]  I mean, you cannot, you know, people are resigning under new blacklist at Yale because they said, we're not going to ban Halloween.
[01:10:39.748 --> 01:10:40.248]  Get over it.
[01:10:40.868 --> 01:10:43.450]  People being offended by people in cowboy outfits.
[01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:45.632]  That's the real tyranny.
[01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.193]  And I'm a real liberal.
[01:10:47.193 --> 01:10:52.077]  People call me a libertarian, right-winger, whatever, because I'm pro-gun.
[01:10:52.077 --> 01:10:54.479]  The definitions are all scrambled.
[01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:56.480]  Syrian electronic army hack.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.823]  CNN accounts amid Geneva talks.
[01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:00.943]  RT.
[01:11:02.185 --> 01:11:03.226]  Here's another one.
[01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:07.209]  Hackers hijack CBS to claim Obama involvement in Boston bombings.
[01:11:07.209 --> 01:11:08.129]  Tweet InfoWars.
[01:11:08.129 --> 01:11:10.671]  That was the Free Syrian Army again.
[01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:13.493]  Global websites hacked by Syrian Electronic Army.
[01:11:13.493 --> 01:11:16.315]  And of course they tweet InfoWars.
[01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:22.560]  So I believe that this is being done because it looks like something they'd put out, that Irgun's been overthrown and run to an airbase.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.761]  Fake story.
[01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:24.742]  Only up for 11 minutes.
[01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:28.291]  They took over Paul Watson's Twitter account.
[01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:31.272]  They're trying to get into everything right now, which is a good drill for us.
[01:11:31.272 --> 01:11:38.054]  We're contacting some of the better hackers that have consulted for us and others right now, and this will make us better.
[01:11:38.054 --> 01:11:43.196]  And again, they want to use these threats as well to pass the whole cyber security system that takes everybody's freedoms.
[01:11:43.196 --> 01:11:51.739]  Now joining us until the bottom of the next hour is my old friend, TV producer, filmmaker, best-selling author,
[01:11:52.839 --> 01:11:56.881]  Better known for being Bill Hicks' producer, the producer of Ninja Bachelor Party.
[01:11:56.881 --> 01:12:01.544]  I was in a juice plant the other day and they had a Ninja Bachelor Party type shake.
[01:12:01.544 --> 01:12:02.684]  I was getting one of those protein shakes.
[01:12:02.684 --> 01:12:03.705]  It was actually excellent.
[01:12:03.705 --> 01:12:07.027]  It's funny to walk around and see stuff you came up with, Bill, everywhere.
[01:12:07.027 --> 01:12:08.807]  But we're not here to get into comedy.
[01:12:08.807 --> 01:12:10.268]  Normally we have fun interviews.
[01:12:10.268 --> 01:12:14.330]  He, of course, was working with the Freeway Ricky Ross and the whole Gary Webb situation.
[01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.652]  That new film, how incredible, Kill the Messenger.
[01:12:17.652 --> 01:12:18.293]  So important.
[01:12:47.752 --> 01:12:50.036]  Kevin recently just got back from Turkey.
[01:12:50.036 --> 01:12:50.817]  He lives in LA.
[01:12:50.817 --> 01:12:51.818]  He's visiting family.
[01:12:51.818 --> 01:12:52.780]  He's a Texan.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.223]  Visiting family out in Fredericksburg.
[01:12:55.223 --> 01:12:58.227]  And he said, man, I've got incredible stuff from the Middle East.
[01:12:58.227 --> 01:13:01.572]  And then I was looking at who he was going to bring on the show in about 30 minutes.
[01:13:03.682 --> 01:13:06.505]  This particular doctor, and I was like, wait a minute, Joe Biggs knows who that is.
[01:13:06.505 --> 01:13:13.692]  This is the guy that's getting ISIS defectors to defect and expose that the West and the Turkish government and others are funding him.
[01:13:13.692 --> 01:13:14.693]  This guy's in hiding.
[01:13:14.693 --> 01:13:15.774]  This guy's really big.
[01:13:15.774 --> 01:13:16.374]  He's interviewed him.
[01:13:16.374 --> 01:13:20.598]  We've got a three-minute supercut we're going to play here in a moment.
[01:13:20.598 --> 01:13:27.465]  But you add this today happening as the hack trying to not just hijack InfoWars but bring it down is happening.
[01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:33.511]  And so this is the most sophisticated, sustained attack we've ever seen.
[01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:35.832]  I mean, it's sophisticated, folks.
[01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:39.693]  And I'm not going to get into exactly what's going on, but all the really important stuff is secure.
[01:13:39.693 --> 01:13:47.435]  But I don't know if it's this or we're investigating these Islamic Jihad schools that the CIA openly got Congress to allow.
[01:13:47.435 --> 01:13:51.396]  We're talking billions a year to these groups that actually teach caliphate.
[01:13:51.396 --> 01:13:54.057]  I mean, I'm sorry, my daughters are not going to live in a caliphate over my dead body.
[01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:58.619]  So this is all going on and it's just over the top.
[01:13:58.619 --> 01:13:59.780]  And the stuff is so over the top.
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.521]  You hear billions a year of U.S.
[01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:05.885]  taxpayer, $500 million of Texas money a year to one group.
[01:14:05.885 --> 01:14:09.889]  It's the second biggest skilled visa group after Google.
[01:14:09.889 --> 01:14:13.231]  Tens of thousands of workers brought in a year.
[01:14:13.231 --> 01:14:16.975]  And they run schools that look like charter schools and they teach caliphate.
[01:14:16.975 --> 01:14:18.416]  I mean, and I hear that.
[01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:19.257]  No, that's not true.
[01:14:19.257 --> 01:14:21.058]  That's just crazy right wing stuff.
[01:14:21.058 --> 01:14:21.679]  It's real.
[01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:26.273]  So Joe Biggs is going to pop in with us at the start of the next hour.
[01:14:26.273 --> 01:14:27.655]  But Kevin Booth, great to have you here.
[01:14:27.655 --> 01:14:29.296]  Great to see your lovely wife, Trey.
[01:14:29.296 --> 01:14:31.357]  We used to hang out so much when you guys lived here in town.
[01:14:31.357 --> 01:14:32.638]  How many years have you lived in L.A.
[01:14:32.638 --> 01:14:32.999]  now?
[01:14:32.999 --> 01:14:34.460]  It's been 10 years now I've been gone.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.541]  Hard to believe.
[01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:36.101]  Yeah.
[01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:39.684]  Brother, let's just get right into radical Islamic terror.
[01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.726]  You started out, you told me, making a film about...
[01:14:42.506 --> 01:14:47.868]  Mafia in government, corruption, crime, and it keeps leading you back to radical Islam.
[01:14:47.868 --> 01:14:51.329]  Tell us about the upcoming film, what you witnessed in Turkey.
[01:14:51.329 --> 01:14:55.090]  Well, our story actually started in Bulgaria.
[01:14:55.090 --> 01:15:10.855]  And we started researching this country based on when communism fell, how they left the KGB, left all these mafias in place to basically take control over all these countries that dropped out of communism at the end of the 80s, beginning of the 90s.
[01:15:11.915 --> 01:15:20.492]  And how there's all these mafia organizations basically in charge of the government, complete corruption, and now they're the ones financing a lot of this.
[01:15:21.653 --> 01:15:24.614]  And I remember at first you were saying, what do you think about Putin three, four years ago?
[01:15:24.614 --> 01:15:28.255]  I mean, sometimes you spend five, six years on a film, you do real research.
[01:15:28.255 --> 01:15:31.636]  And I was like, no, Putin's not perfect, but the West is starting the fight with him.
[01:15:31.636 --> 01:15:35.197]  And I think you ought to get that perspective in it as well.
[01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:41.538]  How have your views and your research developed or evolved in your, what is it, three years you've been working on this?
[01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.079]  I just did two years.
[01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:44.059]  Yeah.
[01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:47.600]  So in the last two years or so, how have things changed?
[01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:49.714]  I don't know.
[01:16:07.765 --> 01:16:13.546]  And the reason we linked up with him is because he's the one who is known for the Bulgarian umbrella and all that stuff.
[01:16:13.546 --> 01:16:16.747]  We're trying to tie in all these stories, but then all these things connect.
[01:16:16.747 --> 01:16:19.868]  And then Robert ended up getting us into the Russian embassy.
[01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:24.869]  And so we've actually been meeting with Putin's press secretary, and we're that close to getting in a meeting with Putin.
[01:16:24.869 --> 01:16:27.690]  I'm not sure if it's going to happen or not, but we're in the door.
[01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:31.931]  And so we're by no means out to make a movie to make Putin look bad.
[01:16:31.931 --> 01:16:33.551]  I mean, it seems like
[01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:37.014]  It's all becoming one big mass as far as the power goes.
[01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:40.978]  Yeah, there's global organized crime playing the nations off against each other.
[01:16:40.978 --> 01:16:41.499]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:41.499 --> 01:16:48.366]  And then you have all these smaller mafia groups that are still being controlled from Russia or so forth, but it's no different than American mafia, you know, whatever.
[01:16:48.366 --> 01:16:50.187]  There's just, it's a whole hierarchy.
[01:16:50.888 --> 01:16:53.490]  And it's who can be the most sophisticated ends up dominating.
[01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:54.491]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:57.093]  But it led you into radical Islamic areas.
[01:16:57.093 --> 01:17:00.195]  I saw the footage in the Supercut we're going to play after the break.
[01:17:00.195 --> 01:17:01.816]  I think I'm going to skip this network break.
[01:17:01.816 --> 01:17:02.897]  I just can't help it.
[01:17:02.897 --> 01:17:04.558]  I mean, this is some powerful info.
[01:17:04.558 --> 01:17:07.641]  Tell us about this guest that's coming on a little bit later.
[01:17:08.061 --> 01:17:13.866]  Well, once again, Robert Steele connected me with Professor Amit Yala.
[01:17:13.866 --> 01:17:23.955]  He has recently had to flee the country because he was interrogating former ISIS fighters, ISIS fighters that have defected.
[01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:27.599]  And some people that he were involved with have been hunted down and murdered.
[01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:29.500]  And so he decided he needed to leave.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.801]  He's in the United States right now.
[01:17:31.802 --> 01:17:34.743]  Well, I sent a crew to Istanbul to cover Bilderberg and Jim Tucker.
[01:17:34.743 --> 01:17:35.704]  It's in the film Endgame.
[01:17:58.892 --> 01:18:00.573]  And they were followed from the hotel.
[01:18:00.573 --> 01:18:01.333]  They were followed everywhere.
[01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:02.213]  It's on video.
[01:18:02.213 --> 01:18:03.133]  Yeah.
[01:18:03.133 --> 01:18:03.913]  At the end of Endgame.
[01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:05.154]  I mean, this is not a game.
[01:18:05.154 --> 01:18:06.794]  I mean, this is not a free country.
[01:18:06.794 --> 01:18:07.034]  Yeah.
[01:18:07.034 --> 01:18:08.415]  Now, Turkey, it's crazy.
[01:18:08.415 --> 01:18:11.896]  It's a little bit like New York on some level, you know, on some weird level.
[01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:12.736]  Certainly beautiful.
[01:18:12.736 --> 01:18:12.976]  Yeah.
[01:18:12.976 --> 01:18:17.377]  After being in Bulgaria, it was like going to New York because Bulgaria is a lot more foreign.
[01:18:17.377 --> 01:18:19.498]  And then we go to Turkey.
[01:18:19.498 --> 01:18:22.339]  So on some level, there's a lot of money there.
[01:18:22.339 --> 01:18:23.779]  It's a modern city on some level.
[01:18:23.779 --> 01:18:27.100]  But then you have all these mosques everywhere and everybody's just.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.242]  Everybody is so afraid of the government.
[01:18:29.242 --> 01:18:29.743]  It's crazy.
[01:18:29.743 --> 01:18:30.765]  You can't talk to anybody.
[01:18:30.765 --> 01:18:36.793]  We had a lot of bizarre situations with people backing out of interviews at the last second.
[01:18:36.793 --> 01:18:38.435]  Of course, nobody wants to be on camera.
[01:18:38.435 --> 01:18:40.057]  It's just crazy.
[01:18:40.057 --> 01:18:42.941]  And once you give in to that, your future, your prosperity is over.
[01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:49.422]  Yeah, and another thing, too, is that when we've been filming throughout Eastern Europe, we were able to have a team of bodyguards with us.
[01:18:49.422 --> 01:18:52.023]  We were not allowed to bring our team of bodyguards into Turkey.
[01:18:52.023 --> 01:18:59.448]  I don't know if I should be saying that on this, but we couldn't cross the Turkish border with our bodyguards that we were using in Eastern Europe.
[01:18:59.448 --> 01:19:01.629]  It's a whole different set of rules over there.
[01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:05.932]  And it's also interesting, too, because I've flown into Turkey now, and I've also driven into Turkey.
[01:19:07.853 --> 01:19:10.856]  You know, the border where they have the border crossings is very tight.
[01:19:10.856 --> 01:19:18.783]  You know, we have one thing where we're like looking for refugees and we're trying to like see what it takes to drive from Bulgaria into Turkey and back and forth.
[01:19:18.783 --> 01:19:24.749]  And the border is very tight on these crossings, but then there's just all these other places where people can cross.
[01:19:24.749 --> 01:19:32.496]  And we're trying to, you know, the whole thing about refugees crossing over and the, you know, the terrorists being mixed in with the refugees and all that.
[01:19:32.496 --> 01:19:33.737]  Which is undoubtedly happening.
[01:19:33.897 --> 01:19:34.838]  Yeah, obviously.
[01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:38.000]  And then our government knows they're going to hit us, and then we're going to have our rights taken away.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.380]  This is really a simple equation.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:43.543]  Yeah, and they've got all these guys just doing their jobs.
[01:19:43.543 --> 01:19:45.444]  Everybody's afraid of getting fired.
[01:19:45.444 --> 01:19:50.567]  Everybody working in every structure I looked at, they're just afraid of losing their jobs.
[01:19:50.567 --> 01:19:54.570]  And so they'll just do whatever they're told, because everybody is so broke over there.
[01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:55.811]  Everybody's so poor over there.
[01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:58.113]  And that's why they want Cloward and Piven here.
[01:19:58.113 --> 01:20:00.895]  Get you in debt, break you, now you can be controlled for chicken feed.
[01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:01.696]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:13.446]  I mean, if looking at Bulgaria and some of these other Eastern European countries is the future of what could happen to America, I think people better take a look at what's happened to Bulgaria and some of these other little countries over there.
[01:20:13.446 --> 01:20:21.634]  Even though it's small, getting into this small country of Bulgaria has given us a chance to break apart the whole hierarchy because it's such a small country.
[01:20:21.634 --> 01:20:22.555]  It's very fascinating.
[01:20:23.584 --> 01:20:29.626]  And the average American is busy watching Caitlyn Jenner or busy watching the Kardashians or the NFL.
[01:20:29.626 --> 01:20:34.088]  They have no idea that the world is just descending into chaos right now.
[01:20:34.088 --> 01:20:36.969]  Well, Caitlyn Jenner is a hero, Alex.
[01:20:36.969 --> 01:20:38.629]  Oh, what is it?
[01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:39.529]  Stunning and brave.
[01:20:39.529 --> 01:20:42.570]  And then it cuts to Brett Favre.
[01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:43.111]  He won't clap.
[01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:44.731]  He's like, what?
[01:20:44.731 --> 01:20:45.251]  What?
[01:20:45.251 --> 01:20:46.172]  ESPN hero?
[01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:47.272]  What?
[01:20:47.272 --> 01:20:48.933]  It's not like we're even against Caitlyn Jenner.
[01:20:48.933 --> 01:20:52.394]  It's just like, this is not stunning, not brave, not attractive.
[01:20:53.476 --> 01:20:54.397]  It's called surgery.
[01:20:54.397 --> 01:21:00.181]  I mean, what if I want to have a change to a walrus?
[01:21:00.181 --> 01:21:02.403]  I don't want taxpayers to pay for it.
[01:21:02.403 --> 01:21:03.784]  You'd be a hero.
[01:21:03.784 --> 01:21:05.766]  And stunning and brave.
[01:21:05.766 --> 01:21:07.167]  Alright, getting serious here.
[01:21:07.167 --> 01:21:15.673]  We've got this supercut from the unnamed upcoming film, and I tell you, you really are an avant-garde filmmaker because you just start out with an idea,
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:20.043]  You first told me about this about three years ago, but I guess you've been working on it two years.
[01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:22.465]  And, I mean, didn't your... Yeah, we've been traveling for two years.
[01:21:22.465 --> 01:21:25.548]  Did the first American drug war take six, seven?
[01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:28.511]  Took, uh, the first American drug war took about five years.
[01:21:28.511 --> 01:21:28.672]  Five.
[01:21:29.349 --> 01:21:30.090]  Yeah.
[01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:31.631]  But then I guess a couple more to even get it out.
[01:21:31.631 --> 01:21:32.372]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:32.372 --> 01:21:33.212]  I have seven in my head.
[01:21:33.212 --> 01:21:34.553]  Is that wrong or is my memory?
[01:21:34.553 --> 01:21:35.154]  Tell me if I'm wrong.
[01:21:35.154 --> 01:21:35.734]  No, you're right.
[01:21:35.734 --> 01:21:40.058]  I mean, I guess, you know, I mean, if you want to add on, yeah, I mean, the years before I actually start filming, right?
[01:21:40.058 --> 01:21:43.701]  I start, in my head, I start the day that the camera starts rolling.
[01:21:43.701 --> 01:21:46.643]  But yeah, there are... Well, you make these films because what I love about it is you start them.
[01:21:47.384 --> 01:21:50.165]  And it's true reality TV because you don't even know where you're going to go.
[01:21:50.165 --> 01:21:50.625]  Absolutely.
[01:21:50.625 --> 01:21:56.208]  On this film, this in fact, this film more than ever has been just just heading into the wind.
[01:21:56.208 --> 01:22:01.530]  Like we didn't know we were basically let's go to Eastern Europe and try to uncover corruption.
[01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:03.951]  And it wasn't even our plan to go to Turkey.
[01:22:03.951 --> 01:22:05.952]  It wasn't even our plan to talk about terrorism.
[01:22:05.952 --> 01:22:07.692]  It wasn't even our plan to talk about any of this.
[01:22:07.692 --> 01:22:08.533]  It's just where it led us.
[01:22:09.253 --> 01:22:30.412]  Let's be honest, about three years ago we were out to dinner and you're like, Putin's a total thug, taking over, and he's put all these mafias in, and I said, well that's kind of true, but I said, you better see the West and Soros starting all this, and so, and you're like, yeah I've heard that, well don't worry, I'm going to investigate it all, so we're not lionizing Putin, we're not lionizing Soros, the point is, don't you see how the West is starting a lot of this now?
[01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.453]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:31.453 --> 01:22:33.715]  So you have, since you've investigated, you've come around to that.
[01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:34.396]  Yes, yes.
[01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:44.644]  It's not like, I mean, listen, I made a film, Masters of Terror, basically accusing Putin of blowing up apartment buildings when he was Vice President during the Chechen War to get popular support.
[01:22:44.644 --> 01:22:48.708]  Now, I didn't say he did it, I just said it was in the Moscow News that police caught
[01:22:49.932 --> 01:22:54.373]  At a Fourth Department building, the FSB, that's the Federal Security Bureau, planting bombs.
[01:22:54.373 --> 01:22:55.714]  They said it was part of a drill.
[01:22:55.714 --> 01:22:58.314]  Other people say, no, that was a setup to blame Putin.
[01:22:58.314 --> 01:23:01.395]  All I know is, Putin isn't attacking America.
[01:23:01.395 --> 01:23:06.037]  Putin is actually, the Russian government is under attack.
[01:23:06.037 --> 01:23:07.397]  And so I don't want to have World War III with them.
[01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:10.118]  We've actually gotten the ban, and here I go saying this name.
[01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:12.839]  Pussy Riot is in our movie.
[01:23:12.839 --> 01:23:14.119]  To tell the whole Russian story.
[01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:15.780]  It was quite a big deal to get them in the movie.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.940]  I just like saying the name.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:17.520]  Well, whatever.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.721]  It's Kitty Cat Riot.
[01:23:18.721 --> 01:23:22.282]  The point is that's a known CIA-funded group to run around and pull stunts.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.961]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know about that.
[01:23:24.961 --> 01:23:27.603]  I don't know if it's a known CIA group, but we're still working on that.
[01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.185]  But they're in our film.
[01:23:29.185 --> 01:23:31.506]  It's a known Soros front group, yes.
[01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:32.187]  That's interesting.
[01:23:32.187 --> 01:23:33.548]  I would interview them, great.
[01:23:33.548 --> 01:23:43.315]  But I mean, you can see what the old geezers at the CIA are going, we'll get young girls and give them a name and then they'll go into Russia and Putin will arrest them and he'll look like a thug.
[01:23:43.315 --> 01:23:45.797]  I mean, the Russians are not buying any of it.
[01:23:45.797 --> 01:23:47.138]  Yeah.
[01:23:47.138 --> 01:23:49.780]  No, it was funny getting Oleg Kalugin's take on Pussy Riot.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.702]  What did he think about that?
[01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:58.765]  That is just a stunt to make themselves popular and they're touring around with Madonna now.
[01:23:58.765 --> 01:24:03.109]  Well yeah, they're playing along with it for their own personal power, but I'm talking about...
[01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:05.771]  What gave birth to all of this?
[01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:06.552]  No, absolutely.
[01:24:06.552 --> 01:24:08.592]  No, I mean, it's been a good ploy for sure.
[01:24:08.592 --> 01:24:13.393]  I mean, it's complicated, you know, because you get, you know, I can't honestly tell you.
[01:24:13.393 --> 01:24:14.273]  I get it.
[01:24:14.273 --> 01:24:16.994]  You fly on the wall are just going to show both sides of the circuit.
[01:24:16.994 --> 01:24:17.874]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:24:17.874 --> 01:24:21.115]  I'm not, I'm not accusing them of anything like that.
[01:24:21.115 --> 01:24:26.396]  We're just like putting him in there, hearing what they say and taking it on the next, the next level.
[01:24:27.156 --> 01:24:28.216]  You have done well.
[01:24:28.216 --> 01:24:32.077]  Now, we've got your guest coming up, and we're going to talk about him here in a moment.
[01:24:32.077 --> 01:24:34.638]  But first, let's go to this short and super cut.
[01:24:34.638 --> 01:24:38.779]  You gave us a great, like, eight-minute one, but for time constraints, we edited it down to about three minutes.
[01:24:38.779 --> 01:24:46.461]  The visuals here, if you're a radio listener, you've got to go to infowars.com forward slash show to be able to see this, but it's powerful.
[01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:51.502]  I've been told by folks who have traveled to Turkey, friends and family, they say it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, other than, say,
[01:24:52.734 --> 01:24:57.479]  Areas of Croatia and Bosnia, they say, are just like over-the-top magic.
[01:24:57.479 --> 01:25:00.362]  Yeah, we've crashed many drones on this project.
[01:25:00.362 --> 01:25:04.407]  In fact, I had to buy this latest drone in the Grand Bazaar.
[01:25:04.407 --> 01:25:06.829]  So, there's a funny scene in the movie.
[01:25:06.829 --> 01:25:08.531]  By the way, this movie isn't all serious.
[01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:13.577]  I mean, it's kind of a dark comedy that I look at what's happening with the world right now as a dark comedy.
[01:25:13.577 --> 01:25:14.758]  So, it is a dark comedy.
[01:25:14.858 --> 01:25:20.322]  There's a scene in the movie right now where we actually, after crashing the drone, we have to go buy another drone so that we can spy.
[01:25:20.322 --> 01:25:24.425]  Like they're selling us the thing that we need to use to spy on them with.
[01:25:24.425 --> 01:25:32.171]  Actually in the Grand Bazaar, so there's like spices and camels and then we go there to buy a drone and we get all these kids to teach us how to fly it and all that.
[01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:35.233]  But we got some amazing footage there in Turkey with the drone.
[01:25:35.233 --> 01:25:39.617]  Let's go ahead and roll this from the upcoming unnamed project by Kevin Booth.
[01:25:59.726 --> 01:26:08.213]  Without any ideology, a terrorist is someone who is carrying out violent activities towards society.
[01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:10.223]  Who is killing?
[01:26:10.223 --> 01:26:11.403]  Who is attacking?
[01:26:11.403 --> 01:26:12.744]  Who is assaulting?
[01:26:12.744 --> 01:26:14.505]  Without any reason?
[01:26:14.505 --> 01:26:15.325]  Or with any reason?
[01:26:15.325 --> 01:26:15.966]  It doesn't matter.
[01:26:15.966 --> 01:26:21.409]  Because terrorists usually play to two factors.
[01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:22.789]  First is the ethnicity.
[01:26:22.789 --> 01:26:25.030]  The second is the religion.
[01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:30.693]  The third factor could be if there is someone who is killed or imprisoned in their family.
[01:26:30.693 --> 01:26:33.335]  These three factors are extremely important.
[01:26:33.335 --> 01:26:37.277]  If they exist in your family, you should be very careful
[01:26:38.813 --> 01:26:53.263]  among your children because terrorist organizations can reach to your children and try to win their hearts from those factors by playing out to those factors as children are very emotional at those ages.
[01:26:56.594 --> 01:26:57.495]  So he shot the judge.
[01:26:57.495 --> 01:26:59.659]  You interviewed him directly afterwards.
[01:26:59.659 --> 01:27:00.380]  Like, what did he say?
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.144]  What was just... He was so relaxed.
[01:27:03.144 --> 01:27:07.590]  He was trained very well and got prepared for this occasion.
[01:27:08.812 --> 01:27:10.192]  Very relaxed.
[01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:13.813]  As if he didn't commit a crime an hour ago.
[01:27:13.813 --> 01:27:16.054]  He is the most innocent guy in the world.
[01:27:16.054 --> 01:27:16.994]  Right.
[01:27:16.994 --> 01:27:28.477]  What upsets me the most is the fact that ISIS is being used for an excuse to intervene those lands or the people over there.
[01:27:29.162 --> 01:27:31.945]  It shouldn't be because what they are doing is not right.
[01:27:31.945 --> 01:27:42.075]  However, by doing their attacks or carrying out those attacks, they are inviting people from abroad to take retaliation against them.
[01:27:42.075 --> 01:27:48.902]  Now, this is blood on top of blood, which is not good and not acceptable, but this is the way it is.
[01:27:48.902 --> 01:27:50.945]  If you attack people, they are going to
[01:27:51.645 --> 01:27:52.466]  Come after you!
[01:27:52.466 --> 01:28:00.892]  Islam is just like Christianity and Judaism is an Abrahamic religion.
[01:28:00.892 --> 01:28:08.637]  And in all those three religions, killing someone without a probable cause is not acceptable.
[01:28:08.637 --> 01:28:12.420]  And one of the biggest crimes mankind can commit.
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.141]  Islam is not like that.
[01:28:14.141 --> 01:28:18.264]  ISIS, Al-Qaeda and other radicals are using their
[01:28:21.678 --> 01:28:23.639]  And now it's time for the NPR Hour!
[01:28:51.967 --> 01:28:53.208]  I'm sorry, how loud am I here?
[01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:54.089]  Kevin, can you hear me?
[01:28:54.089 --> 01:28:55.489]  Yeah, it's a lot louder, I'm sorry.
[01:28:55.489 --> 01:28:57.531]  Listen, we're the anti-NPR.
[01:28:57.531 --> 01:28:58.671]  I know, I had to turn it up real loud.
[01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:03.034]  This is Sam Kennison on the radio.
[01:29:03.034 --> 01:29:04.835]  You should play Sam.
[01:29:04.835 --> 01:29:05.496]  You could play Sam.
[01:29:07.062 --> 01:29:12.627]  You know they're, well as you know, they're trying to now remake it, your book.
[01:29:12.627 --> 01:29:17.731]  I guess Russell Crowe is not involved now, or he's a little bit, and turn it into a movie?
[01:29:17.731 --> 01:29:19.152]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:19.152 --> 01:29:21.294]  I can't talk about that right now.
[01:29:21.294 --> 01:29:22.215]  It is exciting though.
[01:29:22.215 --> 01:29:23.175]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.175 --> 01:29:24.797]  Many exciting things.
[01:29:24.797 --> 01:29:27.659]  Don't let it out of the bag that they're looking at me as B. Sam Kennison.
[01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:28.500]  Come on.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:29.581]  Don't start that rumor.
[01:29:31.477 --> 01:29:35.419]  Alright folks, Kevin Booth is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:35.419 --> 01:29:36.720]  Many irons in the fire.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:47.625]  We're gonna get serious though and come back and look at the west backing of Al Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS with a major insider, Dr. Ahmet S. Gayla.
[01:29:47.625 --> 01:29:51.547]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.547 --> 01:29:54.228]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.968 --> 01:30:08.133]  Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe Show to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State.
[01:30:08.133 --> 01:30:19.559]  Coons said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force, Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against IS.
[01:30:19.559 --> 01:30:20.060]  The U.S.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:25.583]  has spent more than $5 billion on the war against IS since August 2014.
[01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:27.784]  The cost is expected to rise considerably
[01:30:27.984 --> 01:30:32.766]  Now that the Obama Administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the group.
[01:30:32.766 --> 01:30:39.150]  Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:51.516]  On Monday, Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's had really minimal impact on ISIS.
[01:30:51.516 --> 01:30:55.138]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.524 --> 01:31:07.550]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:14.055]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:31:14.055 --> 01:31:15.736]  The numbers are staggering.
[01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:22.301]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[01:31:22.461 --> 01:31:26.003]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[01:31:26.003 --> 01:31:27.364]  Don't let them win.

[01:33:00.836 --> 01:33:04.443]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:04.443 --> 01:33:08.591]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:16.989 --> 01:33:18.950]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:19.710]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:20.170]  Central.
[01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:22.291]  Four hours of hard-hitting radio.
[01:33:22.291 --> 01:33:24.012]  We have one of our great anchors or hosts.
[01:33:24.012 --> 01:33:24.892]  Hosts the fourth hour.
[01:33:24.892 --> 01:33:26.993]  Some days I host as well, but I'm always here.
[01:33:26.993 --> 01:33:27.553]  Three hours.
[01:33:27.553 --> 01:33:28.313]  11 a.m.
[01:33:28.313 --> 01:33:28.834]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:28.834 --> 01:33:30.975]  in the third hour of Overdrive.
[01:33:30.975 --> 01:33:33.195]  We have our guest joining us from the United States.
[01:33:33.195 --> 01:33:40.438]  He's had to flee Turkey because of his associates being killed by ISIS groups for exposing what they're really up to.
[01:33:40.438 --> 01:33:44.760]  Dr. Ahmet S. Yayla will be joining us here in just a moment.
[01:33:46.050 --> 01:34:01.344]  All Hades is breaking loose right now with all sorts of different hack attacks, attempts, successful attempts, in some cases to hack InfoWars, and post stories like breaking coup d'etat in Turkey, Ergun flees to U.S.
[01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:02.024]  Air Base.
[01:34:02.024 --> 01:34:04.686]  Not true.
[01:34:04.686 --> 01:34:10.572]  Now, the Syrian Electronic Army, of course, has taken over CNN, you know it for, and tweeted InfoWars articles.
[01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:13.742]  What we've been talking about for four years has now been proven.
[01:34:13.742 --> 01:34:22.824]  The West is funding ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra to take over areas of the Middle East and destabilize it.
[01:34:22.824 --> 01:34:26.245]  Turkey, of course, the government has been caught buying the oil.
[01:34:26.245 --> 01:34:28.585]  Red-handed.
[01:34:28.585 --> 01:34:30.226]  They've shot down a Russian jet.
[01:34:30.226 --> 01:34:31.766]  They're threatening to blow up Russian ships.
[01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:37.928]  The Russians have moved in S-400 anti-aircraft missiles that can shoot down any aircraft in the world.
[01:34:39.258 --> 01:34:41.219]  Things are escalating quickly.
[01:34:41.219 --> 01:34:47.363]  That's why we're so focused on this and not dancing with the stars or the NFL.
[01:34:47.363 --> 01:34:56.849]  That said, we have just incredible ISIS-type behavior happening.
[01:34:56.849 --> 01:35:03.674]  And we have a senior Democrat, we have his clip coming up, calling for surtax the American people to pay for the war against Islamic State.
[01:35:03.674 --> 01:35:05.075]  So they ship Islamic State in.
[01:35:07.725 --> 01:35:14.930]  They let them attack and then they take all of our rights and tax us when Hillary was caught basically creating the organization.
[01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:24.577]  That's all coming up in one moment, but first, we have the biggest special that we've ever offered.
[01:35:24.577 --> 01:35:31.542]  We have the biggest special that we've ever offered when it comes to the InfoWars, Nightly News, all of my films, e-books, so much more.
[01:35:31.542 --> 01:35:34.844]  15 years of our 20 years, I've had PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:36.604 --> 01:35:41.885]  And PrisonPlanet.TV works absolutely first-rate.
[01:35:41.885 --> 01:35:44.165]  It is subscriber-based.
[01:35:44.165 --> 01:35:47.186]  20 people can use each membership.
[01:35:47.186 --> 01:35:50.306]  So your username, you can share it with 20 friends and family.
[01:35:50.306 --> 01:35:56.487]  Normally, it's 60-something bucks for a year, but we normally have a special, so it's 54.
[01:35:56.487 --> 01:35:56.867]  Now it's 36.50.
[01:35:56.867 --> 01:36:02.528]  That's six months free when you sign up for a yearly membership.
[01:36:02.528 --> 01:36:03.989]  A one-time fee.
[01:36:03.989 --> 01:36:05.209]  Where you can sign up month-to-month is $5.95.
[01:36:07.421 --> 01:36:12.083]  So instead of $71 a year, it's $36.50.
[01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:22.408]  And that funds an organization that sends reporters around the world, that has other investigative journalists and filmmakers in the studio, that has everybody from Donald Trump to Ron Paul on.
[01:36:22.408 --> 01:36:24.029]  We're pretty close to the Putin interview as well.
[01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:25.370]  Kevin's working on his own.
[01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:26.910]  It's exciting.
[01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:27.791]  We're taking action.
[01:36:27.791 --> 01:36:30.092]  We're reaching 20 million people a week and growing.
[01:36:30.092 --> 01:36:34.114]  And our target audience isn't some demographic for sales, it's the whole world.
[01:36:35.117 --> 01:36:48.353]  It's to promote freedom and peace in our time and free market ideas, renaissance, true liberalism, the opposite of the counterfeit fascist liberals and their neocon cohorts and rhinos.
[01:36:48.353 --> 01:36:50.395]  So we're running the special until the new year.
[01:36:51.869 --> 01:36:53.609]  We're talking six months free right now.
[01:36:53.609 --> 01:36:55.450]  There's never been a better time.
[01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:56.670]  There's no excuses.
[01:36:56.670 --> 01:37:02.112]  And the money we get goes to build this organization that just gets more and more effective every day.
[01:37:02.112 --> 01:37:06.113]  And we are under attack, but we take that as part of the excitement of this.
[01:37:10.393 --> 01:37:15.096]  Demonization tactics, hack attacks, just so many other things that go on.
[01:37:15.096 --> 01:37:22.221]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsNews.com, go there, takes about a minute to sign up, and I appreciate your support.
[01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:24.883]  But again, we can get censored on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[01:37:24.883 --> 01:37:28.045]  Our own platforms, though, give us more redundancy.
[01:37:28.045 --> 01:37:29.186]  You get it all there first.
[01:37:29.186 --> 01:37:32.648]  You get a lot of exclusive material at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:32.648 --> 01:37:39.152]  Also, we're doing 15% off for everybody, because it gets too confusing just saying if you have a gift card, you get 15% off, you get that too.
[01:37:40.533 --> 01:37:41.234]  We're good to go.
[01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:06.743]  People in your community, your neighbors, folks on Facebook, Twitter, other platforms, Pinterest, Instagram, about in full force.
[01:38:06.743 --> 01:38:16.253]  It's your word of mouth is the reason we're like a salmon swimming upstream against this tide of demonization and attacks so we can bring you groundbreaking investigative journalism.
[01:38:16.253 --> 01:38:16.673]  So I'm done.
[01:38:17.674 --> 01:38:22.235]  Talking about that, I want to thank you all for your support and salute you for what you've done.
[01:38:22.235 --> 01:38:30.197]  Kevin Booth, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, award-winning documentary filmmaker of American Drug War I and II and so many other films.
[01:38:30.197 --> 01:38:31.097]  He's here.
[01:38:31.097 --> 01:38:43.320]  Kevin, I could introduce this guest, but you know the doctor better than I. He has written the book, ISIS Defectors Inside, stories of confronting the caliphate.
[01:38:46.485 --> 01:38:47.865]  He has testified to the U.S.
[01:38:47.865 --> 01:38:53.967]  Senate Homeland Security Committee and Subcommittee on Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attacks as an expert.
[01:38:53.967 --> 01:38:56.767]  He has spoke to law enforcement groups around the world.
[01:38:56.767 --> 01:38:58.848]  I mean, his bio is just amazing.
[01:38:58.848 --> 01:39:00.368]  He's appointed by the official advisor of the U.S.
[01:39:00.368 --> 01:39:09.530]  Department of Homeland Security between 2006 and 2007 to advise on understanding and building connections with terrorism-targeted international communities living in the United States.
[01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:13.413]  And he can get into Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, Hezbollah, PKK.
[01:39:13.413 --> 01:39:14.934]  It's very complex.
[01:39:14.934 --> 01:39:15.755]  He has a Ph.D.
[01:39:15.755 --> 01:39:18.317]  degree from the University of North Texas in the U.S.
[01:39:18.317 --> 01:39:20.959]  and his Master's in Criminal Justice.
[01:39:20.959 --> 01:39:24.742]  You got to know him through one of your CIA contacts.
[01:39:24.742 --> 01:39:25.323]  Robert Steele.
[01:39:25.323 --> 01:39:26.644]  Robert Steele.
[01:39:26.644 --> 01:39:33.770]  And he just has so much intel on what's really happening in Turkey, bordering Syria, who the players are and where this is going.
[01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:37.834]  So tell us about him and then let's introduce him and get him to crystallize for us what's happening.
[01:39:38.527 --> 01:39:43.652]  Well, I mean, I think you gave him a pretty good introduction there, but recently he's been with a partner.
[01:39:43.652 --> 01:39:50.379]  They've been filming all these interrogations of defected ISIS fighters, just trying to understand all this.
[01:39:50.379 --> 01:39:54.162]  I mean, trying to understand the mindset, the psychology, the brainwashing, whatever it is.
[01:39:54.162 --> 01:39:55.303]  It's very complex.
[01:39:56.264 --> 01:40:14.036]  And, you know, that's why, you know, I've spent a lot of time with him, just filming him, filming him talking, and these videos, we're basically trying to get the transcripts of it, because now there's hours and hours of these ISIS fighters, like, talking about ISIS and, you know, working on getting it all translated in transcripts.
[01:40:14.036 --> 01:40:14.796]  Amazing footage.
[01:40:14.796 --> 01:40:16.197]  I haven't seen anybody else with this material.
[01:40:16.437 --> 01:40:20.222]  Yeah, it's pretty... Well, Doctor, thank you so much for your courage.
[01:40:20.222 --> 01:40:21.824]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:40:21.824 --> 01:40:24.147]  I know that some of your colleagues have been murdered.
[01:40:24.147 --> 01:40:26.691]  I know that you've had to come to the United States.
[01:40:26.691 --> 01:40:28.193]  Simply incredible.
[01:40:28.193 --> 01:40:29.815]  You've got the floor for the rest of the hour.
[01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:33.981]  Explain to us exactly what's happening, who ISIS is, and where all this is going.
[01:40:35.843 --> 01:40:38.465]  Thank you very much for hosting me.
[01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:41.428]  I really appreciate your comments.
[01:40:41.428 --> 01:40:54.982]  It's been like a month I have arrived and I had to flee Turkey because, as you mentioned, we were interviewing ISIS defectors with a colleague from Georgetown University, Professor Ernst Peckert.
[01:40:56.954 --> 01:41:03.917]  She's a psychologist and we were talking to those ISIS defectors to figure out what was really going on.
[01:41:03.917 --> 01:41:06.959]  What's the reason they were inside ISIS?
[01:41:06.959 --> 01:41:18.725]  Especially we were trying to understand the whole organization so that we can find out policies or ways to better deal with those people.
[01:41:20.539 --> 01:41:31.288]  It took me like a year to reach them out and to gain their trust and to see if I could persuade them to talk to us.
[01:41:31.288 --> 01:41:33.650]  First, just talking.
[01:41:33.650 --> 01:41:36.613]  We spent like with 10 of them, hours.
[01:41:42.384 --> 01:41:44.567]  And we had a little Skype hiccup with the doctor.
[01:41:44.567 --> 01:41:46.750]  We'll see if that comes back.
[01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:48.192]  But just really unprecedented.
[01:41:48.192 --> 01:41:50.395]  I mean, this is big news.
[01:41:50.395 --> 01:41:53.599]  When Biggs heard you were having this gentleman on, it was like, wow!
[01:41:53.599 --> 01:41:57.504]  You know, that guy really has been inside ISIS tracking them.
[01:41:57.504 --> 01:41:58.345]  A pretty big fish.
[01:41:58.866 --> 01:42:03.248]  And then he's there talking about ISIS is being used to take over Syria and it's wrong.
[01:42:03.248 --> 01:42:07.250]  This is a top Homeland Security advisor saying what I'm saying, what Colonel Shaffer's saying.
[01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.710]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:07.710 --> 01:42:08.651]  Every time I get into U.S.
[01:42:08.651 --> 01:42:12.032]  government, they're all like us and don't like what's happening.
[01:42:12.032 --> 01:42:18.075]  So I wonder, why is this going on if almost everyone I talk to, generals, you name it, are against what's happening?
[01:42:18.075 --> 01:42:19.276]  I mean, who's directing this then?
[01:42:19.776 --> 01:42:20.477]  It's crazy.
[01:42:20.477 --> 01:42:22.979]  And to be over there in Turkey, I mean, that's just why.
[01:42:22.979 --> 01:42:28.102]  I mean, everybody in Turkey is so afraid of everything and in all these countries.
[01:42:28.102 --> 01:42:32.906]  So I can see why he came over here and kept it down low.
[01:42:32.906 --> 01:42:42.653]  And it's kind of a weird situation he's in because he wants to get out there and tell everybody that, but he also wants to survive and he wants his family to survive.
[01:42:44.915 --> 01:42:55.121]  We've spent a lot of times with a lot of refugees too, and you know, it's interesting because you want to believe everything the refugees are telling you, but you don't ever know if it's all true or not, you know?
[01:42:55.121 --> 01:43:01.224]  I believe we have Dr. Yaila back, again, Homeland Security, Turkish insider.
[01:43:01.224 --> 01:43:04.706]  Just so much intelligence he's got, I don't know where to begin in the time.
[01:43:04.706 --> 01:43:12.910]  Sir, sorry you got cut off, you were getting into talking to these defectors and others.
[01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:13.531]  Please continue.
[01:43:18.129 --> 01:43:23.052]  Doctor, can you hear me?
[01:43:23.052 --> 01:43:24.413]  Let's go to telephone.
[01:43:24.413 --> 01:43:25.493]  If you can do that, guys.
[01:43:25.493 --> 01:43:26.854]  Let's go ahead and abort and go to telephone.
[01:43:26.854 --> 01:43:28.815]  I don't want to jack with the Skype anymore.
[01:43:28.815 --> 01:43:29.636]  Continuing here.
[01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:31.016]  We'll keep him in the next hour if we have to.
[01:43:31.016 --> 01:43:31.777]  We've got Vegas coming here.
[01:43:31.777 --> 01:43:34.218]  He'll have some good questions.
[01:43:34.218 --> 01:43:39.821]  Just all the things this guy's done and the fact that he got recommended to you by Steele.
[01:43:39.821 --> 01:43:41.042]  Wow, I can't wait to see the film, Kevin.
[01:43:41.542 --> 01:43:42.943]  Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
[01:43:42.943 --> 01:43:47.907]  I mean, I'm also working with this guy, Asen Jordanoff.
[01:43:47.907 --> 01:44:03.761]  I call him the Alex Jones of Bulgaria because he's like this conspiratorial guy and he's uncovering some of these incredible wiretaps that have been going on between government officials and judges and what's going on with the elections over there and everything.
[01:44:03.761 --> 01:44:05.302]  It's just crazy.
[01:44:05.302 --> 01:44:06.523]  Let's go back to the doctor.
[01:44:06.523 --> 01:44:07.183]  We do have him, sir.
[01:44:07.183 --> 01:44:07.784]  Sorry about that.
[01:44:07.784 --> 01:44:08.505]  Please continue, sir.
[01:44:09.107 --> 01:44:10.628]  It's okay.
[01:44:10.628 --> 01:44:14.969]  So, we have started this project after I reached out to ISIS defectors.
[01:44:14.969 --> 01:44:19.631]  You know, I was based in Sharnurfa, Turkey, by Syrian border.
[01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:22.512]  Sharnurfa has a population of 2 million people.
[01:44:22.512 --> 01:44:34.336]  Right now, there are around 500,000 Syrian refugees in Sharnurfa living alone as refugees.
[01:44:34.336 --> 01:44:36.917]  So, there's a lot of refugees there, and of course there's several... Continue.
[01:44:42.850 --> 01:44:44.330]  I'm going to go with my directive, guys.
[01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:45.771]  I'm going to go phone.
[01:44:45.771 --> 01:44:47.591]  That's what we're doing.
[01:44:47.591 --> 01:44:48.531]  It's the fun of the show, though.
[01:44:48.531 --> 01:44:50.032]  It's teleprompter-free.
[01:44:50.032 --> 01:44:50.992]  It's real.
[01:44:50.992 --> 01:44:52.612]  CNN would have two or three backup guests.
[01:44:52.612 --> 01:44:53.412]  That's what they do.
[01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:55.053]  And when one goes down, they bring the other on.
[01:44:55.053 --> 01:44:56.473]  I mean, this is real.
[01:44:56.473 --> 01:44:58.014]  This is why people tune in.
[01:44:58.014 --> 01:44:59.494]  It's what we do.
[01:44:59.494 --> 01:45:01.814]  And we've got Joe Biggs coming in here about this.
[01:45:01.814 --> 01:45:05.295]  Have you looked into these Islamic schools?
[01:45:05.295 --> 01:45:08.356]  Just one of them gets billions a year from the U.S.
[01:45:08.356 --> 01:45:08.656]  government.
[01:45:08.656 --> 01:45:10.176]  500 million in Texas.
[01:45:10.176 --> 01:45:12.037]  It's the biggest charter school group in the U.S.
[01:45:13.228 --> 01:45:14.929]  It actually teaches Caliphate.
[01:45:14.929 --> 01:45:15.389]  Wow.
[01:45:15.389 --> 01:45:17.469]  And then other kids go and don't even know.
[01:45:17.469 --> 01:45:20.030]  And then they're in an Islamic training school.
[01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:26.612]  I used to hear this three or four years ago from Patriots, and it was so at the top, I didn't really look into it, because it just sounded crazy.
[01:45:26.612 --> 01:45:29.613]  There's these big giant charter schools, they teach the Caliphate!
[01:45:29.613 --> 01:45:33.254]  And I'd be like, and some of these people were smart folks, and I was like, really?
[01:45:33.254 --> 01:45:34.195]  Yeah, I'll look into it.
[01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:37.557]  And there wasn't really a lot of news coverage, so I was like, that must not be true.
[01:45:37.557 --> 01:45:40.218]  Now we've gone out and looked, it's real.
[01:45:40.218 --> 01:45:46.883]  And now they've basically indicted the guy in Turkey, lawsuits have started in the U.S.
[01:45:46.883 --> 01:45:48.884]  of these schools, and it's all coming out.
[01:45:48.884 --> 01:45:50.185]  It's like, what else is going on?
[01:45:50.185 --> 01:45:53.067]  I mean, how infiltrated is this country?
[01:45:54.491 --> 01:45:55.992]  That's what I'm looking for.
[01:45:55.992 --> 01:45:56.293]  I don't know.
[01:45:56.293 --> 01:45:57.634]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[01:45:57.634 --> 01:45:58.815]  I don't know how infiltrated it is.
[01:45:58.815 --> 01:46:04.280]  I mean, I'd like to hear what your definition is of teaching the caliphate.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.662]  What is your definition?
[01:46:05.662 --> 01:46:07.763]  Radical Islam is going to take over the world.
[01:46:07.763 --> 01:46:08.824]  Yeah.
[01:46:08.824 --> 01:46:12.288]  And that you're soldiers in that politically and physically if need be.
[01:46:12.288 --> 01:46:13.889]  Yeah.
[01:46:13.889 --> 01:46:14.550]  That's crazy.
[01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:15.571]  That's crazy.
[01:46:17.205 --> 01:46:23.826]  And I guess, you know, the CIA wants to be able to steer all these organizations, but then they just have them go wreck all these countries that weren't doing anything to us.
[01:46:23.826 --> 01:46:25.007]  It looks pretty nasty.
[01:46:25.007 --> 01:46:28.187]  So what do you think the CIA's endgame is in all this?
[01:46:28.187 --> 01:46:29.308]  Well, we always talk about the CIA.
[01:46:29.308 --> 01:46:32.748]  There's like 16 different major intelligence agencies in the United States alone.
[01:46:32.748 --> 01:46:36.429]  The CIA is probably, from the best minds I've talked to, seven different groups.
[01:46:36.429 --> 01:46:38.270]  That's from David Steele.
[01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:40.110]  But others agree with that.
[01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:41.570]  I mean, there's all these different factions.
[01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:43.051]  I mean, I'll have one faction of the CIA.
[01:46:44.625 --> 01:46:46.007]  You know, give me information.
[01:46:46.007 --> 01:46:49.972]  It's not classified or secret, just information that's always been accurate.
[01:46:49.972 --> 01:46:54.337]  And then I have another section of the CIA, I know that's been after me.
[01:46:54.337 --> 01:46:56.400]  And then you've got other sections that just want to make money.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.524]  You've got sections that are over the narcotics trafficking.
[01:46:59.524 --> 01:47:02.367]  You've got the sections, you know, the big sections that are over analysis.
[01:47:03.288 --> 01:47:06.332]  They're more like Professor Bookworm types.
[01:47:06.332 --> 01:47:15.123]  And you've got the people that are the actual boots on the ground for the intelligence agencies, the army and navy and other commandos.
[01:47:15.123 --> 01:47:16.845]  And they're all patriots.
[01:47:16.845 --> 01:47:21.851]  So if they're allowing this to happen or even fueling it to happen, what do you think they're trying to achieve from this?
[01:47:23.516 --> 01:47:26.618]  It's chaos, and then they can come in as the saviors over the chaos.
[01:47:26.618 --> 01:47:27.278]  Yeah.
[01:47:27.278 --> 01:47:31.400]  Well, I mean, it's one thing if you overthrow some bad guy and then put something good in.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:40.785]  That's still meddling in the foreign affairs, but you overthrow a good guy and you put in ISIS to kill every Christian you find, and then Obama won't let Christian refugees out?
[01:47:40.785 --> 01:47:41.786]  He'll only let Sunnis out?
[01:47:42.972 --> 01:47:45.233]  I mean, it's like diabolical, man.
[01:47:45.233 --> 01:47:51.614]  I mean, you really look at it, it's like, wow, what have Christians done for the government to have this giant, look at the IRS persecution.
[01:47:51.614 --> 01:47:52.034]  Yeah.
[01:47:52.034 --> 01:47:55.535]  I mean, the government has a big giant you-know-what for Christians.
[01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:57.896]  I'm sick of it, I'm not putting up with it.
[01:47:57.896 --> 01:48:03.317]  And some of the thing about the refugees, and I'm not saying it's not real, but there's kind of some funny moments in the film where
[01:48:03.897 --> 01:48:09.924]  Well, we're watching all these stories about like, you know, millions of refugees, millions of refugees, and we get in the van and we go there and they're not there.
[01:48:09.924 --> 01:48:12.407]  And then we go to this location and we can't find them.
[01:48:12.407 --> 01:48:17.132]  And we're constantly looking for where are all these millions of refugees we keep seeing on the news.
[01:48:17.132 --> 01:48:19.235]  They keep evaporating or changing.
[01:48:19.235 --> 01:48:19.796]  Well, they do.
[01:48:19.796 --> 01:48:23.560]  Once they get to the parent place with the Germans or whatever, they're dispersed.
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.941]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[01:48:24.941 --> 01:48:30.643]  But I mean, everywhere we got, they were just, you know, we just kept getting to places where, oh, they were just here, they were just here.
[01:48:30.643 --> 01:48:34.645]  Well, that's because you see them on their lead across the border, 5,000, and then they just run for the hills.
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:40.162]  Yeah, but I think also the news is having a lot to do with it.
[01:48:40.162 --> 01:48:47.186]  Well, we have reporters over in France and England, and every day at the tunnel there's people trying to hijack cars and just wandering around breaking things.
[01:48:47.186 --> 01:48:47.927]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:48:47.927 --> 01:48:48.387]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.387 --> 01:48:55.371]  No, no, I know it's really out there, but I think the way the news, the way the mainstream media is distorting the way it's really going down.
[01:48:55.371 --> 01:48:55.631]  I agree.
[01:48:55.631 --> 01:48:56.532]  Did we ever get the doctor back?
[01:49:00.942 --> 01:49:01.583]  Sure.
[01:49:01.583 --> 01:49:03.764]  In fact, this is an important clip.
[01:49:03.764 --> 01:49:08.608]  Democrat calls for surtax on the American people to pay for war against Islamic State.
[01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:09.388]  They create it.
[01:49:09.388 --> 01:49:10.109]  They fund it.
[01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.870]  They protect it.
[01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:20.452]  And then they're actually pitching it, let's put a tax on all Americans, a war tax, it'll never go away, on everything, to pay to fight the group they're publicly funding.
[01:49:20.452 --> 01:49:23.532]  They'll probably actually give the money directly to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:23.532 --> 01:49:25.333]  Here's the over-the-top clip.
[01:49:25.333 --> 01:49:35.114]  President Obama sent us an AUMF, that's Washington speak for a request for a declaration of war against ISIS, all the way back in February.
[01:49:35.114 --> 01:49:37.675]  And we have not taken it up, debated it, and passed it.
[01:49:38.135 --> 01:49:42.577]  And we owe that to our veterans and to those serving in the conflict against ISIS.
[01:49:42.577 --> 01:49:46.579]  But we also need to stand up and say, how are we going to pay for it?
[01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:52.422]  All the previous wars, as you referenced, before Iraq and Afghanistan, had a dedicated war surtax.
[01:49:52.422 --> 01:49:59.946]  And I think that's one way we could fairly pay for it, with a small surtax that exempted active-duty military families and veterans.
[01:50:02.025 --> 01:50:04.927]  Folks, the military-industrial complex is the most bloated in the world.
[01:50:04.927 --> 01:50:05.347]  The U.S.
[01:50:05.347 --> 01:50:08.008]  defense budget is more than half the world defense budget.
[01:50:08.008 --> 01:50:10.310]  Now the military-industrial complex wants more?
[01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:13.712]  You people want more?
[01:50:13.712 --> 01:50:16.253]  And of course you'll exempt yourselves, saying the troops will be exempt.
[01:50:16.253 --> 01:50:17.274]  They'll bring that back later.
[01:50:17.274 --> 01:50:18.895]  You won't even give them health care.
[01:50:18.895 --> 01:50:20.916]  We deserve, our troops deserve a new tax!
[01:50:22.119 --> 01:50:26.263]  Directly to pay to fight the group they created.
[01:50:26.263 --> 01:50:28.905]  I mean, I have never seen more oxymoron... Well, I guess I did.
[01:50:28.905 --> 01:50:34.971]  The State Department came out yesterday and said, we have brought peace to Syria when they ran the whole destabilization.
[01:50:34.971 --> 01:50:35.632]  Kevin?
[01:50:35.632 --> 01:50:36.913]  Well, what do you think they're trying to do?
[01:50:36.913 --> 01:50:39.155]  What do you think the endgame here in the States is, though?
[01:50:39.315 --> 01:50:40.116]  In America.
[01:50:40.116 --> 01:50:41.878]  And to turn everything into a ghetto?
[01:50:58.755 --> 01:51:01.796]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:01.796 --> 01:51:04.436]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:04.436 --> 01:51:05.177]  Croix River.
[01:51:05.177 --> 01:51:07.397]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:07.397 --> 01:51:10.358]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:10.358 --> 01:51:11.238]  His excuse?
[01:51:11.238 --> 01:51:12.578]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:12.578 --> 01:51:14.179]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:09.426]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:53:09.426 --> 01:53:14.868]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:53:14.868 --> 01:53:16.348]  How is this even possible?
[01:53:16.348 --> 01:53:23.891]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:53:23.891 --> 01:53:31.533]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:53:31.533 --> 01:53:34.734]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.

[01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:10.594]  Sir, Amit Yala is our guest.
[01:54:10.594 --> 01:54:12.774]  We finally got him on the phone.
[01:54:12.774 --> 01:54:13.795]  Thank you so much for being with us.
[01:54:13.795 --> 01:54:15.215]  It's about 5-10 minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:15.215 --> 01:54:21.117]  Sir, you've been trying to get started here with your incredible historic interviews with these ISIS people.
[01:54:21.117 --> 01:54:21.838]  Please continue.
[01:54:21.838 --> 01:54:22.758]  Give us the big picture.
[01:54:22.758 --> 01:54:25.239]  In one of the interviews with Kevin, you talked about
[01:54:26.235 --> 01:54:29.196]  The fact that it's just unprecedented.
[01:54:29.196 --> 01:54:34.037]  I believe you said that ISIS is being used to basically take Syria away.
[01:54:34.037 --> 01:54:36.178]  I mean, what's the geopolitical aim here?
[01:54:36.178 --> 01:54:39.419]  Who's really behind ISIS, sir?
[01:54:39.419 --> 01:54:45.020]  Okay, we have interviewed around 30 ISIS defectors as of now.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:51.742]  And this question was one of the questions I asked them, with Dr. Anspecter, during our interview.
[01:54:51.742 --> 01:54:54.203]  I have three answers to this question.
[01:54:55.272 --> 01:55:02.234]  Most of the time, the defectors answered in similar ways.
[01:55:02.234 --> 01:55:08.297]  The first, they argued that Syria and Iran is behind ISIS.
[01:55:08.297 --> 01:55:11.658]  The second, Russia is behind ISIS.
[01:55:11.658 --> 01:55:17.320]  And the third, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey behind ISIS.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:24.342]  The ISIS fighters, or the terrorists, who had been in the field and fought,
[01:55:25.616 --> 01:55:37.025]  I think that those three countries are behind the fertilizer or forcing factors behind ISIS.
[01:55:37.025 --> 01:55:50.997]  They think Syria, because Syria and Iran are acting together in the region, and they think that Assad is trying to show the whole world that if you do not work with me, you have to work with these animals.
[01:55:50.997 --> 01:55:52.218]  So here, have a request them.
[01:55:53.653 --> 01:56:01.278]  I don't think there's any evidence that Assad's behind ISIS.
[01:56:01.278 --> 01:56:02.659]  That was my next question.
[01:56:02.659 --> 01:56:04.800]  How do you know they haven't defected to you to give you this info?
[01:56:23.934 --> 01:56:34.419]  And I understand their stories are true through what they are talking and through their narrative.
[01:56:34.419 --> 01:56:43.623]  For example, when I asked about Russia, they said there are Russian generals who are at the age of around 40, 45.
[01:56:43.623 --> 01:56:49.886]  They claim that they are retired from Russian military as generals.
[01:56:50.612 --> 01:56:55.395]  They converted to Islam and right now they are fighting for ISIS.
[01:56:55.395 --> 01:57:05.120]  And when they described those generals, they were the ones who were making the critical decisions on the battlefield.
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.302]  And one of the fighters told me that I never trusted them because
[01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:13.009]  They were there in the name of Russia.
[01:57:13.009 --> 01:57:15.250]  I asked them if they were Chechens.
[01:57:15.250 --> 01:57:16.511]  He said no.
[01:57:16.511 --> 01:57:18.732]  These are real blond Russians.
[01:57:18.732 --> 01:57:22.414]  And they are the ones who were steering us towards the war.
[01:57:27.696 --> 01:57:36.341]  Sure, the only line I've seen on that, doctor, is that the Russians in Chechnya and other areas basically try to run the radicals out and just say, get out of the country.
[01:57:36.341 --> 01:57:38.162]  And then some of them have then been coming to Syria.
[01:57:38.162 --> 01:57:50.991]  But I don't even think the CIA and others who've been caught up to their eyeballs working with ISIS and NATO have said that the Russians, well, that would be full spectrum dominance if the Russians were running ISIS and countering ISIS.
[01:57:54.934 --> 01:58:06.406]  But people in ISIS said that those three countries, or those three groups at least, have stakes in it.
[01:58:06.406 --> 01:58:10.891]  You know, they were at least using ISIS for their own causes.
[01:58:10.891 --> 01:58:11.512]  You can say that.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.222]  I was about to say, I don't know how ISIS would follow Russians.
[01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:19.723]  I mean, I just, I just, look, I mean, you're there, you've done these interviews.
[01:58:19.723 --> 01:58:22.184]  Well, 60 seconds, we got a break, sir.
[01:58:22.184 --> 01:58:23.285]  60 seconds, one minute break.
[01:58:23.285 --> 01:58:30.568]  I want to come back and ask you, summing it all up, because I heard you in an interview with Kevin talking about the plan is to bring down Syria, okay.
[01:58:30.568 --> 01:58:34.610]  Well, who's behind that then from your research?
[01:58:34.610 --> 01:58:40.132]  I mean, pretty, pretty interesting stuff we're hearing here today.
[01:58:40.132 --> 01:58:41.633]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.599 --> 01:58:48.560]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:54.782]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[01:58:54.782 --> 01:58:57.963]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:58:57.963 --> 01:59:07.125]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:59:07.125 --> 01:59:10.186]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the info war
[01:59:10.506 --> 01:59:10.786]  We're good.
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.022]  Don't throw those gift cards away.
[01:59:32.022 --> 01:59:40.430]  Use that money to get high quality products and save 15% in the process, all the while funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:41.812]  That's a 360 win.

[02:00:38.144 --> 02:00:45.590]  Dr. Amet S. Yala, ICSVE.org, read more on the site, B-I-V-O-L dot B-G.
[02:00:47.108 --> 02:00:55.953]  I gotta try to get this guy back up sometime when we're not having Skype problems to really do research and then ask him a bunch of hardcore questions.
[02:00:55.953 --> 02:00:58.315]  I mean, I could see the Russians trying to infiltrate ISIS.
[02:00:58.315 --> 02:01:03.178]  I could see the Russians doing something like that, but to have these, quote, ISIS defectors telling him, Russia runs me.
[02:01:03.178 --> 02:01:11.382]  I mean, I think he's saying he's done so many interrogations he believes these aren't infiltrators or double or triple agents, but look what's happened at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:01:11.382 --> 02:01:12.603]  I'm not saying he's wrong.
[02:01:12.603 --> 02:01:13.804]  I don't want to spend a limited time
[02:01:14.384 --> 02:01:16.145]  Okay, now, for example, I always questioned why
[02:01:41.949 --> 02:01:45.690]  Assad and ISIS are not fighting each other.
[02:01:45.690 --> 02:01:51.812]  They claim that they are there to get rid of Syrian regime, right?
[02:01:51.812 --> 02:01:57.054]  But in their history, ISIS never fought against Bashar.
[02:01:57.054 --> 02:02:02.695]  For example, when they captured Tal Abyad, they were running refineries over there.
[02:02:02.695 --> 02:02:05.156]  And the refineries were broken.
[02:02:05.156 --> 02:02:10.998]  So they talked to Syrian government and Assad sent them engineers to fix those refineries.
[02:02:12.096 --> 02:02:21.483]  They let Syrian engineers fix refineries for like a week, and then they started to sell oil to Assad, the Bashar regime.
[02:02:21.483 --> 02:02:31.790]  And some of their fighters started to question this act, and they said, how come we are giving the Bashar regime the oil?
[02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:35.553]  He turns back and kills our people with that oil.
[02:02:35.553 --> 02:02:38.515]  In their history, they never really fought against Bashar.
[02:02:41.872 --> 02:02:51.238]  For example, in Raqqa, when they were going into Raqqa, there were strongholds of Bashar regime.
[02:02:51.238 --> 02:02:57.562]  They say the soldiers' fleet and Bashar left all the weapons and ammunition to ISIS.
[02:02:57.562 --> 02:03:00.064]  And same thing happened in several places.
[02:03:00.064 --> 02:03:10.571]  So there are lots of questions which cannot be answered or understood by even the high-level ISIS members.
[02:03:11.516 --> 02:03:19.559]  So, it's clearly understandable that there are lots of things going on behind the scenes.
[02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:19.799]  Sure.
[02:03:19.799 --> 02:03:26.662]  The head of Defense Intelligence, who just quit a few months ago, went on Al Jazeera, I don't know if you've seen the clip, Doctor, and he said that the U.S.
[02:03:26.662 --> 02:03:33.244]  government basically funded and helped ISIS, that that was a direct order of Obama.
[02:03:33.244 --> 02:03:37.606]  I don't think so, or I have never heard of this.
[02:03:37.606 --> 02:03:38.106]  Interesting.
[02:03:38.106 --> 02:03:40.647]  So, overall, what is your organization working on today?
[02:03:42.116 --> 02:03:46.098]  Right now, they are in trouble.
[02:03:46.098 --> 02:03:51.900]  However, it doesn't mean that they are not going to exist in the next century.
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:04:00.004]  Even though they are losing land, it might be more problematic for the West or for us, because they are not going anywhere.
[02:04:00.004 --> 02:04:04.726]  So if they lose land, they are going to be among us, which is more difficult to deal with them.
[02:04:05.986 --> 02:04:17.935]  Once they are inside you, once they infiltrate the cities in the West, or even in Turkey, it becomes more difficult and the danger they impose becomes higher.
[02:04:17.935 --> 02:04:26.101]  So by losing land, it doesn't mean that they are going to get off our side in the near future.
[02:04:26.101 --> 02:04:26.662]  No, I get it.
[02:04:26.662 --> 02:04:31.506]  If they're kicked out of Syria, now they will just run around attacking everywhere else.
[02:04:31.506 --> 02:04:32.987]  And of course, Western governments know that.
[02:04:33.772 --> 02:04:42.421]  Yes, and we also should understand that there are lots of Wahhabi youth in Europe and in the United States as well.
[02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:44.543]  Talking about Wahhabist groups, amazing.
[02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:50.129]  Alright, Doctor, I want to have you back on so we can talk about what's happening with the migrants into Europe and get more of your perspective.
[02:04:50.129 --> 02:04:53.353]  ICSVE.org, thank you so much.
[02:04:53.353 --> 02:04:55.215]  We'll be back with Kevin Booth and Joe Biggs.
[02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:04.392]  The Affluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[02:05:04.392 --> 02:05:15.037]  A wealthy Texas teen, who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing four people while driving drunk, will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[02:05:15.037 --> 02:05:22.120]  Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya, were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.482]  Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenza teen.
[02:05:25.842 --> 02:05:40.006]  During his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths, when a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong, he has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter.
[02:05:40.006 --> 02:05:42.627]  A sentence critics saw as far too light.
[02:05:42.627 --> 02:05:50.389]  Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[02:05:50.389 --> 02:05:53.490]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:08:22.289 --> 02:08:23.490]  Joe, Joe.
[02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:24.930]  You don't work for Joe.
[02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.971]  Joe got taken over.
[02:08:26.971 --> 02:08:27.531]  The G.I.
[02:08:27.531 --> 02:08:30.213]  Joe command base is run by Cobra.
[02:08:30.213 --> 02:08:32.133]  Do you understand that?
[02:08:32.133 --> 02:08:37.316]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North America.
[02:08:37.316 --> 02:08:38.676]  They're on record with that.
[02:08:38.676 --> 02:08:40.157]  That was all Pentagon directed.
[02:08:40.737 --> 02:08:42.577]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[02:08:42.577 --> 02:08:44.058]  You dress like Cobra.
[02:08:44.058 --> 02:08:45.718]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[02:08:45.718 --> 02:08:46.999]  You are Cobra.
[02:08:46.999 --> 02:08:48.919]  Hail Cobra!
[02:08:48.919 --> 02:08:49.999]  You want to be little boys?
[02:08:49.999 --> 02:08:52.920]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:58.041]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[02:08:58.041 --> 02:08:59.241]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[02:08:59.241 --> 02:09:00.682]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[02:09:00.682 --> 02:09:03.542]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[02:09:03.542 --> 02:09:05.283]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[02:09:05.783 --> 02:09:13.892]  When I went through the process of becoming Press Secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[02:09:13.892 --> 02:09:16.836]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[02:09:16.836 --> 02:09:18.457]  It's run by chaos!
[02:09:18.457 --> 02:09:20.360]  It's run by Spectre!
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.945]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:26.822]  They run little kids.
[02:09:26.822 --> 02:09:28.064]  They run the snuff films.
[02:09:28.064 --> 02:09:28.885]  They run the drugs.
[02:09:28.885 --> 02:09:29.606]  They run it all.
[02:09:29.606 --> 02:09:34.634]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[02:09:34.634 --> 02:09:40.363]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[02:09:40.896 --> 02:09:43.499]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[02:09:43.499 --> 02:09:46.061]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[02:09:46.061 --> 02:09:48.023]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[02:09:48.023 --> 02:09:54.169]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[02:09:54.169 --> 02:09:55.490]  You work for Chaos.
[02:09:55.490 --> 02:10:00.555]  You work for Cobra.
[02:10:00.555 --> 02:10:01.576]  How do they get power?
[02:10:01.576 --> 02:10:06.020]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[02:10:10.327 --> 02:10:11.548]  Go f*** yourself.
[02:10:11.548 --> 02:10:12.329]  Who is COBRA?
[02:10:12.329 --> 02:10:16.132]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[02:10:16.132 --> 02:10:20.675]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[02:10:20.675 --> 02:10:23.458]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[02:10:23.458 --> 02:10:24.999]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[02:10:24.999 --> 02:10:26.840]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.221]  COBRA runs it all.
[02:10:28.221 --> 02:10:29.703]  COBRA is real.
[02:10:29.703 --> 02:10:31.204]  You can call it whatever you want.
[02:10:32.495 --> 02:10:34.616]  Cobra is in control of America.
[02:10:34.616 --> 02:10:40.620]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:45.984]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[02:10:45.984 --> 02:10:48.485]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[02:10:48.485 --> 02:10:50.106]  That's what Cobra would say.
[02:10:50.106 --> 02:10:51.847]  That's what Specter would say.
[02:10:51.847 --> 02:10:53.629]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:55.630]  Because that's who those people are.
[02:10:56.330 --> 02:11:01.013]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[02:11:01.013 --> 02:11:06.276]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[02:11:06.276 --> 02:11:10.178]  You will kneel before Cobra of Faith!
[02:11:12.469 --> 02:11:16.531]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:11:16.531 --> 02:11:19.072]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:11:19.072 --> 02:11:22.133]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[02:11:22.133 --> 02:11:24.354]  You pathetic little worm!
[02:11:24.354 --> 02:11:27.836]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[02:11:34.639 --> 02:11:41.343]  We just had Dr. Ahmet S. Yaila on the broadcast who advises Homeland Security and more.
[02:11:41.343 --> 02:11:45.685]  And he said some things I agree with from the analysis in the clip from your film.
[02:11:45.685 --> 02:11:51.449]  The other stuff he was saying that these quote ISIS defectors tell him, no one else is saying that.
[02:11:52.645 --> 02:12:00.070]  But if the West can't fix intelligence, they will have people defect who will then go give disinfo.
[02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:01.631]  And the system's been caught doing that.
[02:12:01.631 --> 02:12:03.633]  I'm not saying he's doing that.
[02:12:03.633 --> 02:12:09.577]  He seems like a nice enough guy and interesting and, you know, has some of his colleagues killed by ISIS, reportedly.
[02:12:09.577 --> 02:12:15.140]  But the point is that, I mean, next we're going to hear Russia overthrew Libya?
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:19.443]  I mean, it's on record that the West did that using al-Qaeda.
[02:12:19.443 --> 02:12:21.405]  It's on record ISIS is al-Qaeda.
[02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:24.032]  The Pentagon has gone public.
[02:12:24.032 --> 02:12:30.421]  The Council on Foreign Relations wrote articles three years ago saying why we need Al Qaeda in Syria and admits it.
[02:12:30.421 --> 02:12:31.522]  Cy Hirsch has come out.
[02:12:31.522 --> 02:12:35.287]  I mean, it's like saying two plus two doesn't equal five.
[02:12:35.287 --> 02:12:39.312]  And I get he's relaying what they told him, but I mean, we've seen
[02:12:40.785 --> 02:12:42.246]  Different people under interrogation.
[02:12:42.246 --> 02:12:46.948]  I know this was people just being interviewed, but you know, say all sorts of stuff.
[02:12:46.948 --> 02:12:53.752]  But don't you think like from the Ricky Ross thing that these guys, they even know who they're working for?
[02:12:53.752 --> 02:12:59.595]  I mean, these fighters, don't you think these fighters are kind of segregated off from what's really happening?
[02:12:59.595 --> 02:13:05.398]  Oh yeah, like Rick Ross, the real Rick Ross, not the fat jail guard, didn't know he was working with the CIA for years.
[02:13:05.398 --> 02:13:06.099]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:07.802 --> 02:13:08.803]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:13:08.803 --> 02:13:09.783]  They can tell them anything.
[02:13:09.783 --> 02:13:10.364]  Yeah.
[02:13:10.364 --> 02:13:13.186]  They'll probably tell them they're Russian generals, they're probably CIA.
[02:13:13.186 --> 02:13:17.129]  Yeah, I mean, basically... Because we know they've got special forces in there commanding them, actually.
[02:13:17.129 --> 02:13:19.310]  That's why the military's gone public.
[02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:24.774]  Yeah, I mean, you start interrogating somebody, I mean, they'll tell you... they'll tell you whatever you want to hear.
[02:13:24.774 --> 02:13:26.836]  Yeah, the moon's made of cheese.
[02:13:26.836 --> 02:13:30.739]  But he just called up after the interview, he was like, I am not involved in the hack of your site.
[02:13:30.739 --> 02:13:34.722]  And I'm not saying he's not involved, I'm like, my interview has nothing to do with that on your site today.
[02:13:35.422 --> 02:13:36.183]  We didn't say that.
[02:13:36.183 --> 02:13:44.069]  It's just, like you were saying, it shows this whole Eastern European or the whole East Arab stuff where everybody's afraid of what's going to be said and what's going to be done.
[02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:46.131]  It's almost like their own political correctness.
[02:13:46.131 --> 02:13:51.716]  I mean, we're just here interviewing somebody saying, isn't it interesting we're talking about Turkey and now our site's been hacked today with TurkInfo.
[02:13:51.716 --> 02:13:53.077]  We don't actually know what it's about.
[02:13:53.277 --> 02:13:57.083]  Yeah, I mean, they're afraid to even just say the word president over there.
[02:13:57.083 --> 02:14:01.069]  I mean, they're, anybody, they're all just, everybody's scared to death.
[02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:03.332]  It's a little bit like Bohemian Grove.
[02:14:03.332 --> 02:14:04.874]  The whole country.
[02:14:04.874 --> 02:14:05.856]  The whole continent.
[02:14:05.856 --> 02:14:07.018]  It's like the Turkish president.
[02:14:08.664 --> 02:14:15.707]  Sister says, we're not buying oil from Syria, and then there's 2,000 trucks lined up going right into the government depot.
[02:14:15.707 --> 02:14:18.368]  Yeah, I mean, what do you expect?
[02:14:18.368 --> 02:14:21.089]  Kevin, that's not a Christmas tree behind you over there, okay?
[02:14:21.089 --> 02:14:22.630]  I'm gonna have you arrested if you say it is there.
[02:14:22.630 --> 02:14:23.190]  Look behind you.
[02:14:23.190 --> 02:14:24.171]  It's a holiday tree.
[02:14:24.171 --> 02:14:25.391]  It's not there.
[02:14:25.391 --> 02:14:26.612]  No, there's nothing there.
[02:14:26.612 --> 02:14:30.273]  Tell me there's nothing there behind you.
[02:14:30.273 --> 02:14:30.954]  Where?
[02:14:30.954 --> 02:14:31.934]  I don't see anything.
[02:14:31.934 --> 02:14:32.514]  There.
[02:14:32.514 --> 02:14:33.255]  In fact, what do you see?
[02:14:33.255 --> 02:14:33.875]  Just a white wall?
[02:14:35.541 --> 02:14:37.945]  Again, if you're a radio listener, we're simulcasting television.
[02:14:37.945 --> 02:14:40.990]  I still get emails going, why do you hear you say, look at this, look at that?
[02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:45.938]  Because we're a radio show that turned into television about 15 years ago.
[02:14:45.938 --> 02:14:47.661]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:14:48.482 --> 02:14:54.428]  Now, joining us is Joe Biggs out of the Situation Room, the other studio.
[02:14:54.428 --> 02:14:56.510]  We're in the War Room in here.
[02:14:56.510 --> 02:15:00.454]  Joe, so much is going on, so much is unfolding.
[02:15:00.454 --> 02:15:03.877]  The site continuing to have hack attacks going on as we speak.
[02:15:03.877 --> 02:15:04.998]  All this other crazy news.
[02:15:04.998 --> 02:15:08.662]  The Democrats want to tax us all to fight ISIS.
[02:15:08.662 --> 02:15:09.583]  What do you make of all this?
[02:15:10.285 --> 02:15:11.086]  Yeah, this is interesting.
[02:15:11.086 --> 02:15:13.787]  I mean, like you said, we've got someone coming on talking about Turkey.
[02:15:13.787 --> 02:15:27.136]  I'm actually waiting to release a report here in the next day or so about a Turkish imam that we were looking into, Fethullah Gulen, who is the head of the largest amount of charter schools in the United States.
[02:15:27.136 --> 02:15:32.500]  So it's very interesting that this is all happening now, that we have these Turkish posts coming up.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:39.184]  This guy is a Turkish-born Muslim imam who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.
[02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:53.284]  He got to come into America allegedly with the help of the CIA to be able to get a visa and now his company is one of the largest proponents of those H-1B visas with his Gulan movement.
[02:15:54.471 --> 02:15:59.996]  Now the FBI previously resisted granting permanent residency status to Gulen according to leaked cables.
[02:15:59.996 --> 02:16:00.837]  Part of the U.S.
[02:16:00.837 --> 02:16:07.804]  government believes that Gulen is a radical Islamist whose moderate message cloaks a more sinister and radical agenda.
[02:16:07.804 --> 02:16:14.731]  Now let's be clear, when we say alleged, we're just being out of preponderance of journalistic integrity.
[02:16:14.731 --> 02:16:17.894]  The WikiLeaks cables, I mean like half of them are about this movement.
[02:16:18.594 --> 02:16:24.558]  With the Stratford group freaking out about it and saying it's serious.
[02:16:24.558 --> 02:16:27.440]  We do have the CIA letter to get him in, correct?
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:28.521]  Yes, exactly.
[02:16:28.521 --> 02:16:31.303]  And then you have the FBI coming out and saying, no, this is a bad guy.
[02:16:31.303 --> 02:16:32.764]  And the CIA says, you know what?
[02:16:32.764 --> 02:16:33.945]  No, we're using this person.
[02:16:34.725 --> 02:16:42.409]  You know, the Gula-inspired schools are the largest charter network in the U.S., and they receive approximately $150 million a year in taxpayer money.
[02:16:42.409 --> 02:16:47.611]  There are about 130 of these charter schools in 26 states, the most being in Texas.
[02:16:47.611 --> 02:16:49.472]  And we have six right here in Austin.
[02:16:49.472 --> 02:16:51.033]  One just opened up not too long ago.
[02:16:51.913 --> 02:16:58.117]  The number I saw was 500 million a year and something between 25 and 50 billion global.
[02:16:58.117 --> 02:16:59.698]  I mean, I guess it's so shadowy.
[02:16:59.698 --> 02:17:02.559]  I mean, how much money do they have and how much taxpayer money do they get?
[02:17:02.559 --> 02:17:04.721]  Because I've seen widely ranging numbers.
[02:17:04.721 --> 02:17:08.843]  Well, you have right here, you have a company called the Cosmos Foundation.
[02:17:08.843 --> 02:17:09.884]  Now they're the umbrella group.
[02:17:10.484 --> 02:17:11.184]  That's right.
[02:17:31.989 --> 02:17:41.174]  And, you know, from what we've seen based off this one foundation, there's $150 million a year, but there are many other groups that they spread throughout the country.
[02:17:41.174 --> 02:17:48.458]  So, it's upwards of, they're saying, around $50 billion worldwide that this Gulen movement actually makes.
[02:17:48.458 --> 02:17:51.819]  And if you read some of these headlines about the schools, U.S.
[02:17:51.819 --> 02:17:54.981]  charter school network with Turkish link draws federal attention.
[02:17:54.981 --> 02:17:56.382]  Islamic cleric linked to U.S.
[02:17:56.382 --> 02:17:58.503]  charter schools involved in Turkey's political drama.
[02:17:58.943 --> 02:17:59.443]  We're good to go.
[02:18:15.693 --> 02:18:18.635]  Fethullah Gulen was a no-show at his first trial in Turkey.
[02:18:18.635 --> 02:18:29.201]  Gulen faces terrorism charges for being the leader of the Fethullah terrorist organization and is accused of plotting to imprison his critics despite his repeated claims of innocence.
[02:18:29.201 --> 02:18:36.365]  Now an arrest warrant has been issued for 61 suspects, including Gulen himself, for their involvement in this terrorist organization.
[02:18:36.365 --> 02:18:37.326]  And he hasn't shown up to court?
[02:18:37.586 --> 02:18:39.147]  Yes, and he is a no-show.
[02:18:39.147 --> 02:18:41.307]  But he's got charter schools right down the street.
[02:18:41.307 --> 02:18:43.048]  That sounds normal.
[02:18:43.048 --> 02:18:47.550]  And they do it under the beard of STEM, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
[02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:51.171]  Now most of these teachers that they bring in are from Turkey.
[02:18:51.171 --> 02:18:53.952]  They speak mostly Turkish.
[02:18:53.952 --> 02:18:57.514]  They do not speak English that well and they are not qualified
[02:18:58.274 --> 02:19:01.277]  Remotely, anywhere near what teachers in the US are.
[02:19:01.277 --> 02:19:04.019]  Now in Texas, you don't even have to be a certified teacher.
[02:19:04.019 --> 02:19:07.943]  So that's how they're able to get more Turkish teachers into the United States.
[02:19:07.943 --> 02:19:17.192]  Now if you actually look at their board of members for the Cosmos Foundation, it says right here, Turkey, Turkey, Turkey, Turkey, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Turkey, Turkey, Turkey.
[02:19:17.192 --> 02:19:19.834]  And see, this is what Akron was doing, getting government funds.
[02:19:19.834 --> 02:19:22.136]  I mean, this is, America is just a big joke.
[02:19:22.136 --> 02:19:23.918]  The whole world comes here now to suck on us.
[02:19:25.796 --> 02:19:29.220]  Yeah, our tax dollars are paying for them to come over here and basically take the jobs.
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:34.486]  They want us to give you the impression that they're just a hard-working group of guys over there trying to educate our kids.
[02:19:34.486 --> 02:19:40.013]  But according to Whistleblower, these teachers see something else, a lot more sinister going on.
[02:19:40.013 --> 02:19:41.495]  So we'll get back to that after the break.
[02:19:41.855 --> 02:19:49.502]  Absolutely, and Kevin Booth's riding shotgun with us, and we've got Dr. Steve Pacinik coming on, former head of the State Department Psychological Warfare Operations.

[02:22:22.984 --> 02:22:25.285]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[02:22:25.285 --> 02:22:28.146]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[02:22:28.146 --> 02:22:29.267]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[02:22:29.267 --> 02:22:35.070]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.

[02:22:57.794 --> 02:23:04.882]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:23:04.882 --> 02:23:08.886]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[02:23:08.886 --> 02:23:12.289]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:23:12.289 --> 02:23:17.374]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:23:17.975 --> 02:23:22.317]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[02:23:22.317 --> 02:23:28.479]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[02:23:28.479 --> 02:23:38.504]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[02:23:39.204 --> 02:23:40.445]  Don't miss out.
[02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:45.629]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[02:23:45.629 --> 02:23:51.234]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[02:23:51.234 --> 02:23:54.897]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[02:23:54.897 --> 02:23:56.138]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[02:24:04.301 --> 02:24:07.002]  Look, all this stuff is window dressing.
[02:24:07.002 --> 02:24:11.504]  Islamic caliphate schools.
[02:24:11.504 --> 02:24:14.985]  Billions paid over the years in the aggregate.
[02:24:14.985 --> 02:24:16.386]  All the bizarreness happening.
[02:24:16.386 --> 02:24:17.026]  The war.
[02:24:17.026 --> 02:24:19.787]  Shooting down Russian jets.
[02:24:19.787 --> 02:24:22.008]  Our government funded radical Islam.
[02:24:22.008 --> 02:24:22.968]  They turned them loose.
[02:24:22.968 --> 02:24:24.329]  They ran the Arab Spring.
[02:24:24.329 --> 02:24:25.189]  And they brag about it.
[02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:29.271]  And then they get out there and confuse everybody about who's behind it.
[02:24:30.589 --> 02:24:33.971]  And everybody lines up in fear and parrots the party line.
[02:24:33.971 --> 02:24:38.034]  And then we lose our culture and our society.
[02:24:38.034 --> 02:24:47.281]  Our government's bringing in radical jihadis who will attack us and the answer will be naked body scanners, checkpoints, national ID cards.
[02:24:47.281 --> 02:24:47.921]  And that's it.
[02:24:47.921 --> 02:24:57.948]  The corruption of society, the bullying of culture, the driving us into tyranny in the name of having security when all we're going to get is even more oppression.
[02:24:57.948 --> 02:24:58.408]  I want to get
[02:24:59.409 --> 02:25:08.697]  More comments from Joe Biggs, who has a big report coming out that will premiere tomorrow on the syndicated radio slash TV broadcast, I think at 1230.
[02:25:08.697 --> 02:25:13.422]  But Kevin, other comments from you about the film, your website, where folks can follow your work.
[02:25:14.335 --> 02:25:16.617]  Just find me right now, just find me on Facebook.
[02:25:16.617 --> 02:25:18.017]  Just look me up on Facebook.
[02:25:18.017 --> 02:25:23.721]  And check out this other website, bivol.bg.
[02:25:23.721 --> 02:25:29.585]  I'm working with this guy, Asen Jordanoff, and I call him the Alex Jones of Bulgaria.
[02:25:29.585 --> 02:25:37.170]  And once again, I keep coming back to Bulgaria because it's like this little tiny country that got just devastated by communism.
[02:25:37.170 --> 02:25:39.752]  It's the most bizarre place you've ever seen in your life.
[02:25:39.752 --> 02:25:41.993]  And it's the gateway to Turkey.
[02:25:41.993 --> 02:25:43.514]  It's the gateway to Russia.
[02:25:43.514 --> 02:25:44.195]  It's in the center
[02:25:44.315 --> 02:25:46.956]  You mean communism devastates stuff?
[02:25:46.956 --> 02:25:47.636]  Uh, just a little.
[02:25:47.636 --> 02:25:51.378]  Bernie Sanders says it creates heaven on earth.
[02:25:51.378 --> 02:25:53.658]  You could just see from the buildings they left.
[02:25:53.658 --> 02:26:02.842]  It's like this gorgeous European community mixed in with these Russian ghetto buildings that they just left everywhere.
[02:26:02.842 --> 02:26:07.783]  Well, they admitted that the plan was to make culture ugly to hurt humans.
[02:26:07.783 --> 02:26:08.384]  It's crazy.
[02:26:08.384 --> 02:26:10.124]  Notice how our buildings look like that now.
[02:26:10.124 --> 02:26:11.205]  That's the trendy liberal style.
[02:26:12.625 --> 02:26:13.045]  Yeah.
[02:26:13.045 --> 02:26:15.227]  You don't want to live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment?
[02:26:15.227 --> 02:26:15.367]  No.
[02:26:15.367 --> 02:26:17.429]  So they can pay more taxes?
[02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:19.050]  You're not trendy?
[02:26:19.050 --> 02:26:21.251]  I mean, these buildings are ugly.
[02:26:21.251 --> 02:26:22.773]  Why are you racist?
[02:26:22.773 --> 02:26:24.434]  Why am I racist?
[02:26:24.434 --> 02:26:29.257]  Because it's, uh... Well, see how political correctness works?
[02:26:29.257 --> 02:26:33.561]  Prostrate yourself before me and beg that I wail on and say you're not racist.
[02:26:33.561 --> 02:26:34.541]  Prostrate yourself.
[02:26:34.541 --> 02:26:35.022]  Not prostate.
[02:26:35.022 --> 02:26:35.462]  Prostrate.
[02:26:38.035 --> 02:26:42.077]  Listen, I will waive it.
[02:26:42.077 --> 02:26:44.098]  I am Glinda the Good Witch.
[02:26:44.098 --> 02:26:45.179]  You are now not racist.
[02:26:45.179 --> 02:26:54.763]  So what's going on, Alex?
[02:26:54.763 --> 02:26:55.984]  Oh, we're just hanging out.
[02:26:55.984 --> 02:26:57.365]  We're coming over for dinner tonight.
[02:26:57.365 --> 02:26:58.885]  Let's just stop right there.
[02:26:58.885 --> 02:27:01.587]  Let's go now to Joe Biggs.
[02:27:01.587 --> 02:27:02.587]  Joe, this is really serious.
[02:27:02.587 --> 02:27:05.889]  We're joking around about it, but things have really entered the twilight zone.
[02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:07.969]  Yes indeed.
[02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:10.711]  So what we were talking about earlier before the break was Fethullah Gulen.
[02:27:10.711 --> 02:27:14.795]  He is a Turkish Imam who's living in a self-imposed exile here in America.
[02:27:14.795 --> 02:27:20.499]  Now what he's done, he has wanted in Turkey on terrorism charges by the Erdogan government.
[02:27:20.499 --> 02:27:26.964]  Now he also started the Golan Movement, which is basically taking over Turkey and many parts of the world.
[02:27:27.384 --> 02:27:30.026]  He started this charter school system here in America.
[02:27:30.026 --> 02:27:38.531]  Now, what they're doing is they're saying that this charter school has nothing to do with the Golan movement in Turkey, but that is where things get a little weird.
[02:27:38.531 --> 02:27:40.693]  Even though it has the same name, it's not the same thing?
[02:27:40.693 --> 02:27:48.778]  Well, he has the Harmony Schools in America, so they're Harmony STEM schools of science, technologies, engineering, and math, and he uses that as a beard.
[02:27:48.778 --> 02:27:56.523]  Now, what he does is he brings in his own teachers from Turkey, and what they do is they give a cutback of 40% of their salary, which goes back to the Golan movement.
[02:27:56.923 --> 02:27:57.443]  In Turkey.
[02:27:57.443 --> 02:27:58.444]  Is that documented?
[02:27:58.444 --> 02:28:02.846]  I mean, I've read that in papers, but, I mean, I mean, they think that, they allege that, or is that confirmed?
[02:28:02.846 --> 02:28:04.947]  Um, we'll say alleged at this point in time.
[02:28:04.947 --> 02:28:09.629]  But, uh, that's what they're going with right now, that's what in most of the documents that they're finding.
[02:28:09.629 --> 02:28:16.453]  Uh, they've talked to whistleblowers, uh, one teacher who was an American teacher, she ended up actually marrying one of the Turkish teachers, and, uh, that
[02:28:17.153 --> 02:28:24.040]  Based off that marriage, she found out that he was told he had to sign something to give back 40% of his check to the Golan movement.
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:27.543]  So that's based off of a whistleblower coming forward with that information.
[02:28:27.543 --> 02:28:31.167]  Now what Golan wants to do is basically take over Turkey.
[02:28:31.167 --> 02:28:41.717]  What he does is he uses schools to cherry-pick people that he can recruit and basically impose this whole Sharia mindset and he puts them into the police force, he puts them into the government.
[02:28:42.497 --> 02:28:44.879]  By the way, that's what Irgun is saying.
[02:28:44.879 --> 02:28:52.463]  And again, this gets into this whole weird Middle Eastern thing where everybody's stabbing each other in the back and everybody's double dealing and screwing everybody over.
[02:28:52.463 --> 02:28:59.886]  Well, there's this quiet war going on in Turkey between Erdogan and Golan as well, because Golan's trying to fight for power.
[02:28:59.886 --> 02:29:06.210]  And like you said, he's secretly getting these people put in position to basically, you know, try to overthrow what's going on.
[02:29:06.970 --> 02:29:09.933]  You know, the Golan Movement's ultimate goal is to open charter schools in the U.S.
[02:29:09.933 --> 02:29:10.694]  and funnel the U.S.
[02:29:10.694 --> 02:29:13.757]  tax dollars back into the Golan Movement in Turkey.
[02:29:13.757 --> 02:29:19.543]  They skimped through just enough for the public taxpayers for these charter schools so it doesn't look suspicious.
[02:29:19.543 --> 02:29:23.987]  Now, the Golan schools are among the nation's largest users of the H-1B visas.
[02:29:23.987 --> 02:29:29.072]  In 2009, the schools received government approvals for 684 visas, more than Google, which had 440.
[02:29:30.433 --> 02:29:31.894]  And Intel Corp had $1,200.
[02:29:31.894 --> 02:29:33.274]  So they're up there.
[02:29:33.274 --> 02:29:37.795]  They're bringing in those people to skim the money to help fund this Golan movement.
[02:29:37.795 --> 02:29:43.617]  That's what the major papers are saying and we're investigating it and are going to be looking into it more.
[02:29:43.617 --> 02:29:45.498]  Don't buy a lot of what Eargun says either.
[02:29:45.498 --> 02:29:46.198]  Thank you Joe Biggs.
[02:29:46.198 --> 02:29:47.579]  Your Big Report tomorrow.
[02:29:47.579 --> 02:29:48.139]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.951 --> 02:30:08.098]  Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe Show to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State.
[02:30:08.098 --> 02:30:19.526]  Coons said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force, Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against IS.
[02:30:19.526 --> 02:30:20.026]  The U.S.
[02:30:20.026 --> 02:30:25.550]  has spent more than $5 billion on the war against IS since August 2014.
[02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:27.752]  The cost is expected to rise considerably
[02:30:27.972 --> 02:30:32.736]  Now that the Obama Administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the group.
[02:30:32.736 --> 02:30:39.120]  Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:51.489]  On Monday, Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's had really minimal impact on ISIS.
[02:30:51.489 --> 02:30:55.112]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:31:05.350 --> 02:31:08.231]  We've always offered five months free.

[02:31:17.575 --> 02:31:20.877]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:01.682]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:01.682 --> 02:32:09.926]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:09.926 --> 02:32:15.349]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:17.870]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:29.165 --> 02:32:31.367]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:31.367 --> 02:32:36.351]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:36.351 --> 02:32:39.653]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:39.653 --> 02:32:43.136]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:43.136 --> 02:32:45.118]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:45.118 --> 02:32:49.221]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[02:32:49.221 --> 02:32:54.826]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:16.118 --> 02:33:22.424]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:22.424 --> 02:33:37.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.717 --> 02:33:43.782]  What you're about to witness is basically total transparency of InfoWars.com and this media operation.
[02:33:45.612 --> 02:33:53.517]  I decided to take the path, and I don't say this to brag, I just studied history and I went with my heart and my intellect as well, to not be a coward.
[02:33:53.517 --> 02:34:07.106]  And to not join with different gangs and different globalist operators, but to try to actually go create a media organization that would promote true renaissance values, not just American values.
[02:34:08.203 --> 02:34:10.625]  And it's been a learning experience for 21 years.
[02:34:10.625 --> 02:34:11.385]  I started out in 1995.
[02:34:11.385 --> 02:34:17.710]  It's been 21 years and just about 2-3 months in April.
[02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:27.757]  And so right now, I literally am just so busy that I don't have time, or he doesn't have time as well, for me to just call up Dr. Steve Pachenik and ask him what he thinks is going on.
[02:34:27.757 --> 02:34:28.758]  I'll just do it on air.
[02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:35.896]  So, so much of what you see on this three-hour, four-hour radio slash TV show is behind-the-scenes stuff.
[02:34:35.896 --> 02:34:52.031]  I mean, you see me running back in here during the breaks as different hack attacks are being launched, some successful, some not successful, against InfoWars right now, with them posting an article that Erdogan had fled to a U.S.
[02:34:52.031 --> 02:34:53.312]  military base and been overthrown.
[02:34:55.356 --> 02:34:58.897]  Now, would you say that's because we're exposing Islamic Caliphate schools in the U.S.
[02:34:58.897 --> 02:35:01.078]  that are trying to overthrow Erdogan?
[02:35:01.078 --> 02:35:14.663]  Would you say it's because the Syrian Electronic Army, which is pretty much the Russians, keeps posting info wars links on hacked sites like the Washington Post, the New York Times, and Barack Obama's personal Twitter?
[02:35:14.663 --> 02:35:16.263]  I didn't do that two years ago.
[02:35:16.263 --> 02:35:17.483]  I didn't do that a year ago.
[02:35:17.483 --> 02:35:19.804]  I'm not asking the Syrians to do that.
[02:35:19.804 --> 02:35:24.406]  I don't want that type of traffic from a hacked presidential Twitter.
[02:35:25.942 --> 02:35:26.902]  We got our own traffic.
[02:35:26.902 --> 02:35:29.405]  We're not involved in criminal activity.
[02:35:29.405 --> 02:35:33.148]  Now, they are attacking these countries, so they've got a right militarily to do what they're doing.
[02:35:33.148 --> 02:35:34.189]  We're not involved.
[02:35:34.189 --> 02:35:35.370]  I'm an American.
[02:35:35.370 --> 02:35:37.973]  I'm not involved in any agencies, nothing.
[02:35:37.973 --> 02:35:40.015]  But I basically talk to everybody.
[02:35:40.015 --> 02:35:42.337]  Because this is what's going on in the real world.
[02:35:43.888 --> 02:35:48.791]  And we just had a guest on earlier that, you know, was putting out the most ridiculous stuff.
[02:35:48.791 --> 02:35:52.574]  Nothing against the guy, but, you know, oh, the Russians are behind ISIS.
[02:35:52.574 --> 02:35:54.375]  Yeah, and I'm an Easter Bunny from Pluto.
[02:35:54.375 --> 02:36:04.042]  I mean, you've got the former head of defense intelligence coming out and saying two months ago that they were ordered to help create ISIS and protect them, and it's wrong, and it's crazy.
[02:36:04.042 --> 02:36:06.444]  And you've got Sy Hersh's new excerpt coming out.
[02:36:06.444 --> 02:36:08.085]  Steve Piccinini sent me an email last week about it.
[02:36:08.085 --> 02:36:08.485]  Look at this.
[02:36:08.485 --> 02:36:09.306]  It's huge.
[02:36:09.306 --> 02:36:13.249]  Saying what he said, what others have said, what Colonel Schaefer said a week after Benghazi.
[02:36:14.005 --> 02:36:19.553]  They shipped the arms up to Syria from Libya to destabilize it.
[02:36:19.553 --> 02:36:23.258]  They changed the name of Al-Qaeda and Al-Nusra to ISIS to confuse the public.
[02:36:23.258 --> 02:36:24.880]  The military said we're not going to be part of this.
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:27.924]  General Dempsey went to the White House and said we won't be part of it.
[02:36:27.924 --> 02:36:30.428]  And here it is, Cy Hirsch, two times Pulitzer Prize winner.
[02:36:32.662 --> 02:36:35.445]  Confirming what we already knew, but it's from him.
[02:36:35.445 --> 02:36:41.891]  But it was more that the generals were leaking info to Assad and the Russians the last three years.
[02:36:41.891 --> 02:36:43.793]  And he says it all ended with Dempsey leaving.
[02:36:43.793 --> 02:36:46.175]  That's not what I'm told.
[02:36:46.175 --> 02:36:55.965]  I mean, believe me, when somebody like Colonel Schaefer who goes and testifies in secret hearings in Congress, he has to get authorized by the group he's with to even come on this show.
[02:36:57.281 --> 02:37:00.844]  I mean, you don't just think I have, like, a CIA whistleblower on, like, Tosh Plumlee.
[02:37:00.844 --> 02:37:07.510]  The point is, there's all these different players and groups.
[02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:17.138]  And it's one thing to be able to, you know, arrest and SWAT team the former technical director of the NSA, William Binney, and try to intimidate him because he's on his own.
[02:37:17.138 --> 02:37:19.119]  But at a certain point, people push back.
[02:37:19.119 --> 02:37:20.461]  So there's all these different camps.
[02:37:20.461 --> 02:37:21.842]  So I'm going to ask Dr. Pachinik.
[02:37:23.127 --> 02:37:27.597]  A, just off his gut who he thinks is trying to shut down InfoWars right now.
[02:37:28.607 --> 02:37:32.068]  And then, B, looking at the situation with Russia.
[02:37:32.068 --> 02:37:35.989]  I mean, here comes Cy Hirsch saying what you said a month ago, word for word.
[02:37:35.989 --> 02:37:37.889]  You said, yes, we made the decision.
[02:37:37.889 --> 02:37:42.350]  We've been working with the Russians quite nicely to take out these people.
[02:37:42.350 --> 02:37:45.851]  There are other groups in our government that wanted to work with them, but we're not allowing that.
[02:37:45.851 --> 02:37:47.151]  And those aren't boasts you're making.
[02:37:47.151 --> 02:37:49.852]  I mean, you did head up the State Department psychological war operations.
[02:37:49.852 --> 02:37:54.013]  You did do, I'm not bragging, it's true, legendary stuff like the Camp David Accords.
[02:37:54.993 --> 02:38:07.404]  Right through to famous hostage situations, right through to, you know, the Justice Department coming after you for work you did, officially, for the President, with operations in Italy, and, you know, things like that.
[02:38:07.404 --> 02:38:11.227]  I mean, you know, major operations, deaths of Prime Ministers, you name it.
[02:38:11.227 --> 02:38:14.250]  I mean, whatever went on, the point is, I don't want to get subpoenaed, I don't know.
[02:38:14.850 --> 02:38:15.991]  But now here you are.
[02:38:15.991 --> 02:38:21.232]  So because again, you know, people, modern folks out there barely know who Donald Trump's name is, much less sure.
[02:38:21.232 --> 02:38:26.995]  So we're asking a real spymaster what he thinks is going on here on air.
[02:38:26.995 --> 02:38:35.938]  I want to get your view on what's happening with this whole situation and where it's going, because it seems to me the whole narrative has collapsed in a beautiful, spectacular way.
[02:38:35.938 --> 02:38:42.180]  It's now kitchen table talk, breakfast table talk that our government runs ISIS in the general public.
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:43.261]  The military is
[02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:46.263]  Over-the-top angry and upset.
[02:38:46.263 --> 02:38:54.648]  It's causing a catharsis, almost, of such devastation to the neocons and the globalists that this is a grievous blow, I believe.
[02:38:54.648 --> 02:38:57.831]  I don't think they can put this back in the genie bottle.
[02:38:57.831 --> 02:39:01.934]  And then separately, then I'm going to shut up and get your take, sir.
[02:39:01.934 --> 02:39:07.157]  They're trying to just normalize it now and go, OK, we're going to get attacked by Muslims, radicals we brought in.
[02:39:07.157 --> 02:39:10.860]  And when they attack, we're going to take gun owners' rights.
[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:11.981]  We're going to take veterans' rights.
[02:39:11.981 --> 02:39:13.342]  I mean, they're actually saying that.
[02:39:14.938 --> 02:39:18.019]  So then when they attack, they don't get in trouble for bringing them in.
[02:39:18.019 --> 02:39:19.040]  I lose my rights.
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:20.380]  You lose your rights.
[02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:21.820]  That dog isn't gonna hunt.
[02:39:21.820 --> 02:39:28.082]  I mean, I know for a fact, and I'm not bragging, I don't even like being in this position, that major governors listen every day.
[02:39:28.082 --> 02:39:29.023]  I know a fact.
[02:39:29.023 --> 02:39:30.603]  Huge amounts of Congress listen.
[02:39:30.603 --> 02:39:32.064]  Not that I'm even that special.
[02:39:32.064 --> 02:39:38.926]  Everybody else is too cowardly, too stupid in the media to talk about real stuff or to have people like you on.
[02:39:38.926 --> 02:39:41.927]  I mean, is this a Twilight Zone episode, Dr. Pachinic?
[02:39:43.038 --> 02:39:44.419]  No, not really, Alex.
[02:39:44.419 --> 02:39:52.004]  What's happened is you've created a paradigm shift in the media, which occurred 21 years ago.
[02:39:52.004 --> 02:39:59.689]  And when I came on your show 14 years ago, and I categorically stated 9-11 was a false flag, stand down.
[02:40:00.402 --> 02:40:03.243]  People began to think, and they began to understand.
[02:40:03.243 --> 02:40:06.965]  Because I knew this, because I taught this type of attack.
[02:40:06.965 --> 02:40:11.886]  I knew the people in the Bush administration, the Cheney, the neocons, Wolfowitz.
[02:40:11.886 --> 02:40:13.587]  But let's go beyond that.
[02:40:13.587 --> 02:40:21.990]  What's happened is, you have hit to the core of the continuous lies that the different administrations have been planning on the U.S.
[02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:23.371]  citizenry.
[02:40:23.371 --> 02:40:28.333]  And Cy Hirsch, quite frankly, and I, we're not buddies.
[02:40:28.333 --> 02:40:29.353]  I've known about him.
[02:40:29.904 --> 02:40:41.273]  And actually I had a confrontation with him in an intelligence meeting, but I will guarantee you that what he is saying now, what he said about Osama bin Laden in all of his articles is correct.
[02:40:41.273 --> 02:40:45.337]  There isn't one iota of distortion, not one iota of lie.
[02:40:45.337 --> 02:40:49.040]  He's basically parroting and then adding background to everything you say.
[02:40:49.620 --> 02:41:00.022]  No, he not only corroborated everything I said, but he went into detail to talk about two other people whom, ironically, I had a confrontation with, but I also respected.
[02:41:00.022 --> 02:41:02.163]  And one was General Martin Dempsey.
[02:41:02.163 --> 02:41:11.065]  When I last met him, or I first met him, was the last day I was in the Council on Foreign Relations before I told you and the public, your public, that I was resigning.
[02:41:11.565 --> 02:41:26.003]  And I had asked General Dempsey 10 years ago or somewhere along that line, will you argue against the President of the United States, given the fact that we had admirals who did that in 48, we had generals who did that in the military during the Vietnam War.
[02:41:26.483 --> 02:41:28.724]  He categorically said he would.
[02:41:28.724 --> 02:41:31.845]  I absolutely respect General Martin Dempsey.
[02:41:31.845 --> 02:41:33.465]  I do not think he's a traitor.
[02:41:33.465 --> 02:41:43.429]  I think he's a great American, like many of our generals, who had to quietly dissent against a presidential dictum, which by the way, I have gone against repeatedly.
[02:41:43.929 --> 02:41:57.618]  But I was in a more junior position, but I absolutely agree with General Martin Dempsey, and I had also met Michael Flynn, who was then head of G2 military intelligence and became the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[02:41:57.618 --> 02:42:01.120]  All three of these men, I can corroborate what they say.
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:09.706]  I can vouchsafe for their integrity and their willingness, like many Americans, to defy what has been going on in the narrative.
[02:42:10.087 --> 02:42:11.371]  And you're part of that, Alex.
[02:42:11.371 --> 02:42:14.281]  And I'm not here to flatter you, but I will explain to you what they did.
[02:42:15.023 --> 02:42:30.947]  General Dempsey and Mike Flynn basically did a full analysis, and what that happens is you use SIGINT, a human, you use all the 16 agencies we have to do an assessment, or we used to call a net assessment, of what's happening in Syria.
[02:42:30.947 --> 02:42:41.650]  Because the administration, Obama had no really idea of it, Hillary Clinton had no idea, Susan Rice had no idea, Valerie Dredd, all of them had never been in the military.
[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:43.230]  None of them had been in combat.
[02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:47.493]  And because of the mistakes that were made under Bush Jr.
[02:42:47.493 --> 02:42:51.535]  in Iraq, where we deposed Saddam Hussein, subsequently had chaos.
[02:42:51.535 --> 02:43:06.025]  We then went into Libya, thanks to Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice and Samantha Power, and we created a massive, massive source of chaos, where Benghazi was the focal source of the CIA transmitting
[02:43:06.605 --> 02:43:21.974]  And sending weapons, major weapons, to the Turks and the so-called middle rebels or the moderate rebels in Syria, but were really the extremists.
[02:43:21.974 --> 02:43:34.382]  And what was happening there was, in effect, when the generals saw this happening and they saw that the civilians really had no idea what was going on, Flynn and Dempsey, I can't corroborate their actual actions,
[02:43:35.023 --> 02:43:39.245]  Basically said, look, we're not going to disrupt this in a political statement.
[02:43:39.245 --> 02:43:43.746]  We're going to disrupt it along the flow of information relationships.
[02:43:43.746 --> 02:43:46.627]  What Cy Hirsch said was absolutely correct.
[02:43:46.627 --> 02:43:52.370]  We have had a military to military relationship with the Russians that has been outstanding since 91.
[02:43:53.650 --> 02:44:06.336]  Now, contrary to the neocons, contrary to the narratives of civilians who would like to say they bombed the Russians, or it's a Russian conspiracy, that's absolutely... And that's why the political class wants to talk about war with Russia in these debates.
[02:44:06.336 --> 02:44:08.117]  They're so angry that the U.S.
[02:44:08.117 --> 02:44:09.637]  military is defying them.
[02:44:09.637 --> 02:44:12.258]  And I'm not trying to lionize the U.S.
[02:44:12.258 --> 02:44:15.380]  Army especially, but it's exactly what you said here a decade ago.
[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:19.762]  They are literally the best patriots we've got, holding back so much of this.
[02:44:20.558 --> 02:44:29.141]  Well, you have to understand, I mean, when I worked in government, my primary position was always as a military officer.
[02:44:29.141 --> 02:44:33.963]  When I went into intelligence, I was trained in that at MIT and at Harvard.
[02:44:33.963 --> 02:44:39.185]  That was a secondary position, but I was proud to be in intelligence, and of course then I am a psychiatrist.
[02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:57.143]  But my loyalty has always been to the Republic as it has been for Martin Dempsey, as it has been for General Flynn, for many other generals who supported our American positions and understood that our civilian leaders, remember, most of them had not been to war.
[02:44:57.873 --> 02:44:59.594]  Clinton had never been in combat.
[02:44:59.594 --> 02:45:00.314]  Bush Jr.
[02:45:00.314 --> 02:45:01.554]  had never been in combat.
[02:45:01.554 --> 02:45:06.396]  And Obama, that's a Freudian flip, had never been in combat.
[02:45:06.396 --> 02:45:07.617]  Yet we had Bush Sr.
[02:45:07.617 --> 02:45:08.677]  who'd been in combat.
[02:45:08.677 --> 02:45:11.778]  I'd worked with Secretary Baker who'd been in combat.
[02:45:11.778 --> 02:45:14.159]  I had Nixon who'd been in combat.
[02:45:14.159 --> 02:45:16.480]  I had Carter who'd been in the military.
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:25.444]  So those who had been in the military as president had very good representatives who understood the capability of war and the limits of war.
[02:45:25.444 --> 02:45:26.504]  And our generals,
[02:45:26.986 --> 02:45:31.307]  Are brilliant at what they can do and they know what they don't want to do.
[02:45:31.307 --> 02:45:33.888]  And the great generals are not the ones who go to war.
[02:45:33.888 --> 02:45:36.869]  They're the ones who say, you know, what is it that we can do to stop?
[02:45:36.869 --> 02:45:37.189]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:37.189 --> 02:45:38.089]  Let me throw this in then.
[02:45:38.089 --> 02:45:55.214]  How seismic is it that we've had a huge, basically military countercoup against the civilian insane people who are like a compulsive gambler at a slot machine trying to conquer and start wars
[02:45:55.794 --> 02:45:56.534]  They can't win.
[02:45:56.534 --> 02:46:10.258]  I mean, this is such a big deal to have it confirmed that our own military went around Obama and the neocons and gave the Russians and the Syrians all the authorization and info they needed to defeat Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:46:10.258 --> 02:46:14.038]  And then I've met with a bunch of special forces people, current duty, you name it.
[02:46:14.038 --> 02:46:16.119]  They're all completely awake now.
[02:46:16.119 --> 02:46:18.359]  I mean, the system has a big problem.
[02:46:18.359 --> 02:46:20.200]  I don't see how they're going to put this back in the bottle.
[02:46:20.856 --> 02:46:22.979]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:46:22.979 --> 02:46:26.863]  I would call this or we call this a soft coup.
[02:46:26.863 --> 02:46:30.067]  A soft coup meaning that we haven't overthrown the president.
[02:46:30.067 --> 02:46:32.150]  We don't intend to overthrow the president.
[02:46:32.651 --> 02:46:34.793]  There's not violence involved.
[02:46:34.793 --> 02:46:37.035]  There are not going to be guns in the street.
[02:46:37.035 --> 02:46:54.533]  But Alex, the same way you change the narrative of the media, what's happening now, thanks to the bravery of these men who've been in our military and our navy, and also the men who were fired in Benghazi and the stand down in AFRICOM and the naval officers who were involved,
[02:46:55.325 --> 02:47:01.226]  All these people stood up and had their day in court and continue to have that.
[02:47:01.226 --> 02:47:02.987]  Some are heard, some aren't.
[02:47:02.987 --> 02:47:08.328]  But you have to remember, our democracy and our republic is a very fluid entity.
[02:47:08.328 --> 02:47:09.408]  It's not static.
[02:47:09.408 --> 02:47:10.469]  It doesn't stay one way or the other.
[02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.709]  And I agree.
[02:47:10.709 --> 02:47:16.050]  So the truth is out in the public opinion, the military system-wide is saying no to the tyranny.
[02:47:16.590 --> 02:47:17.551]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:17.551 --> 02:47:21.054]  What is that doing to the more corrupt elements of the establishment?
[02:47:21.054 --> 02:47:22.355]  Well, they're getting scared.
[02:47:22.355 --> 02:47:28.840]  And what happened is, because of your ability to articulate and our military willing to stand up... Please stop giving me the credit.
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:30.541]  I get 1% of the credit, sir.
[02:47:30.541 --> 02:47:31.802]  Well, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:47:31.802 --> 02:47:32.863]  The platform gets it.
[02:47:32.863 --> 02:47:34.004]  I know, I know.
[02:47:34.004 --> 02:47:36.146]  Alex, we've known each other for too long.
[02:47:36.146 --> 02:47:39.108]  This is not, you know, we're not bragging here.
[02:47:39.108 --> 02:47:44.072]  We're basically saying because of that narrative, you have a man like Trump come forward.
[02:47:44.577 --> 02:47:52.184]  Whatever he may or may not be, he is changing the entire dynamics of the Republic and the way they're getting elected.
[02:47:52.184 --> 02:48:00.572]  In effect, what he's done is to take away the underbrush of the corruption with the Bushes, the entire Bush family, the entire Clinton family.
[02:48:00.572 --> 02:48:01.272]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:48:01.272 --> 02:48:04.916]  You came on and we'll keep you in the next hour of need because we've got... Who's co-hosting next hour?
[02:48:06.553 --> 02:48:07.533]  I don't get a call like you do.
[02:48:07.533 --> 02:48:09.815]  What I get is two helicopters monitoring me two weeks ago.
[02:48:29.184 --> 02:48:29.804]  Sure, that's just a message.
[02:48:29.804 --> 02:48:31.406]  You gotta remember what I'm about to tell you.
[02:48:31.406 --> 02:48:31.906]  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:31.906 --> 02:48:33.707]  I don't get a call like you get.
[02:48:33.707 --> 02:48:39.611]  I get helicopters that are monitoring me when I'm unloading a truck with books in it.
[02:48:39.611 --> 02:48:41.633]  I get subpoenas from the U.S.
[02:48:41.633 --> 02:48:52.661]  prosecutors in Miami-Dade County because the State Department and our FBI are upset about what I may say or I might do.
[02:48:52.661 --> 02:48:54.442]  You gotta remember, there's one element here.
[02:48:55.026 --> 02:48:56.867]  No one is going to take you down, Alex.
[02:48:56.867 --> 02:48:58.388]  I can assure you of that.
[02:48:58.388 --> 02:49:03.851]  You're just being, uh, you're just being played with as a kind of warning.
[02:49:03.851 --> 02:49:07.113]  You know, you can only go so far or do so much.
[02:49:07.113 --> 02:49:10.374]  But guys like me, they have them in their sights.
[02:49:10.374 --> 02:49:14.517]  And the reason for it is they know exactly what I was trained to do.
[02:49:14.517 --> 02:49:16.158]  My job is very simple.
[02:49:16.158 --> 02:49:22.141]  It was to do regime change without violence, without killing, and without assassination.
[02:49:22.955 --> 02:49:35.323]  That's very deadly to a system that really has never been involved in a regime change in the Soviet Union or in Cambodia, where we had greater killers than you have in ISIS in the Middle East.
[02:49:35.323 --> 02:49:42.248]  We had 1.2 million Khmer Rouge who killed 1.2 million of their own people.
[02:49:42.248 --> 02:49:49.333]  So those of us who were involved in the Reagan and the Bush senior administration and Nixon administration, we're pragmatists.
[02:49:49.913 --> 02:50:07.686]  We're not ideologues, but our loyalty lies to the Presidency, not to the President, to the Presidency, the Republic, to the military, and to the intelligence community as long as it complies with the requirements of the Republic and the laws.
[02:50:07.686 --> 02:50:14.951]  Now, those stipulations are extremely important and that's why America and your audience has to understand these are brave men.
[02:50:15.549 --> 02:50:18.230]  Cy Hirsch has been deprecated in Washington.
[02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:20.571]  I can't tell you how badly he's been hit.
[02:50:20.571 --> 02:50:22.753]  Yet he and I, I don't know him.
[02:50:22.753 --> 02:50:24.213]  I have great respect.
[02:50:24.213 --> 02:50:27.635]  Martin Dempsey has been a hero and a quiet hero.
[02:50:28.533 --> 02:50:38.866]  And Flynn, I watched him do a brilliant job of running a social studies program a whole day involving social scientists from all over the country.
[02:50:38.866 --> 02:50:46.356]  So these are what I call the scholar warriors who have gone to the forefront and started to say, it's enough.
[02:50:46.516 --> 02:50:48.917]  And imagine if they're going public.
[02:50:48.917 --> 02:50:51.578]  If they're going public, they're ready to have a fight.
[02:50:51.578 --> 02:50:53.319]  They're ready to have this come out in Congress.
[02:50:53.319 --> 02:50:57.661]  They're ready for Obama to try to go after them for sharing intelligence with the Russians.
[02:50:57.661 --> 02:50:58.981]  This is seismic.
[02:50:58.981 --> 02:51:01.322]  They are throwing down the gauntlet.
[02:51:01.322 --> 02:51:02.563]  And that's all I'm saying.
[02:51:02.563 --> 02:51:08.285]  Don't the crooks in the establishment know when they threaten you or me, all that does is make us double down?
[02:51:08.285 --> 02:51:09.925]  Don't they know our psychology?
[02:51:09.925 --> 02:51:10.046]  No.
[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:15.062]  You see, I'm getting interfered with right now.
[02:51:15.062 --> 02:51:18.223]  Just while I'm talking to you, they're jamming me on this phone.
[02:51:18.223 --> 02:51:19.484]  And this is a hard line.
[02:51:19.484 --> 02:51:22.585]  I'm not being paranoid, I just know it.
[02:51:22.585 --> 02:51:23.526]  You hear that?
[02:51:23.526 --> 02:51:25.307]  No, it's probably just on your side.
[02:51:25.307 --> 02:51:25.787]  But go ahead.
[02:51:25.787 --> 02:51:29.929]  It's on my side, but they're jamming me on this side, because this is an undisclosed number, my friend.
[02:51:29.929 --> 02:51:36.332]  The point is, these are obsessional politicians who've never had real life experience.
[02:51:36.332 --> 02:51:40.755]  Obama is created, developed, and nurtured by the CIA.
[02:51:40.755 --> 02:51:41.695]  He doesn't know anything else.
[02:51:42.358 --> 02:51:44.059]  He's not a man of strategy.
[02:51:44.059 --> 02:51:45.860]  He's not a conceptual man.
[02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:47.461]  He's not a great thinker.
[02:51:47.461 --> 02:51:55.105]  He's a man who's been told what to do, what to say, and he lies pathologically in a way that absolutely stuns me.
[02:51:55.105 --> 02:51:59.228]  He makes Nixon look like he was the most honest man I've ever met.
[02:51:59.848 --> 02:52:02.070]  Obama has repeatedly lied about it.
[02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:06.674]  Well let me throw this out, because we've got more time, and I skipped the break and I'm going to quit doing this because it's so important.
[02:52:06.674 --> 02:52:08.475]  Let me throw this at you, Dr. Pachinik.
[02:52:08.475 --> 02:52:09.236]  Yes.
[02:52:09.236 --> 02:52:10.277]  Here's an example.
[02:52:10.277 --> 02:52:14.340]  You brought up Mr. Stone with the Trump camp.
[02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:15.441]  Correct.
[02:52:15.441 --> 02:52:20.045]  I mean, really, he's like the head of the campaign, but he's out of it for other reasons, obviously.
[02:52:20.045 --> 02:52:20.706]  Correct.
[02:52:20.706 --> 02:52:25.530]  I mean, this guy, obviously, top guy with Nixon, top guy with Bush Sr., other folks, I mean, running major
[02:52:26.030 --> 02:52:27.751]  Political operations in third world countries.
[02:52:27.751 --> 02:52:29.171]  I mean, it's highly respected.
[02:52:29.171 --> 02:52:29.712]  That's correct.
[02:52:29.712 --> 02:52:32.633]  It's obvious what the guy is and does.
[02:52:32.633 --> 02:52:44.738]  He came here before Trump came on, and I'm not going to get into the inside baseball of it, but he briefed me on stuff, and then when you came on and talked about him a few weeks later, you laid out everything he said word for word.
[02:52:44.738 --> 02:52:48.539]  And I didn't know what he was talking about.
[02:52:48.539 --> 02:52:51.260]  But then went on and said, even though I haven't talked to him, you can see what's happened.
[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:54.722]  And that's basically what he told me and
[02:52:55.642 --> 02:52:58.765]  about this whole fissure in the system, and Trump knows that.
[02:52:58.765 --> 02:53:00.686]  He was explaining, no, Trump's really for real.
[02:53:00.686 --> 02:53:02.988]  We're not going to let them break this country and destroy it.
[02:53:02.988 --> 02:53:03.688]  They're globalists.
[02:53:03.688 --> 02:53:07.832]  They want to roll us into this thing, and they want to have basically a corporate takeover and loot it.
[02:53:07.832 --> 02:53:09.813]  We're not going to allow it.
[02:53:09.813 --> 02:53:16.078]  And so it was just amazing to hear you then basically say what you knew he'd already told me.
[02:53:16.078 --> 02:53:21.943]  It's just very, very interesting to realize there's all these different camps in these different intelligence agencies.
[02:53:22.623 --> 02:53:26.468]  Well, the truth of the matter is there are those who believe in the truth.
[02:53:26.468 --> 02:53:27.549]  We're called truthers.
[02:53:27.549 --> 02:53:30.853]  And I take it not as an insult, but as a point of pride.
[02:53:30.853 --> 02:53:34.197]  And I think your entire audience should take that as a point of pride.
[02:53:34.197 --> 02:53:37.560]  And you should sell the shirts called truthers because I'm one of them.
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:38.762]  And you can't lie.
[02:53:39.728 --> 02:53:45.650]  Either 9-11 was a conspiracy or it was a disaster of a competency.
[02:53:45.650 --> 02:53:48.110]  They didn't claim it was a competency issue.
[02:53:48.110 --> 02:53:49.911]  They knew it was a conspiracy.
[02:53:49.911 --> 02:53:52.111]  The Building 7 came down.
[02:53:52.111 --> 02:53:53.812]  The issue of Osama Bin Laden.
[02:53:53.812 --> 02:54:02.874]  How could I predict 12 years ahead of time that this president, whom I didn't even know, would claim that he assassinated a man who was already dead?
[02:54:02.874 --> 02:54:06.135]  Well, he fell into that trap and the entire intelligence community.
[02:54:06.375 --> 02:54:10.677]  They had over a thousand articles demonizing us last week just on that subject.
[02:54:31.946 --> 02:54:49.557]  So, what's happening is, and again, let me go back to the fact, a narrative was created by people like me, you, Cy Hirsch, Dempsey and others, Tracy, there are many of us out there who are finally coalescing into one voice and saying, you know what?
[02:54:49.557 --> 02:54:50.318]  We need a Trump.
[02:54:51.010 --> 02:54:57.397]  Whoever Trump is, he is a force to contend with and he will not tolerate this kind of nonsense.
[02:55:04.099 --> 02:55:08.021]  That Trump would go after Hillary on the rape stuff with protecting Clinton.
[02:55:08.021 --> 02:55:13.265]  I was told that they were waiting for them to attack on 9-11 and think Trump was weak on that.
[02:55:13.265 --> 02:55:19.288]  And Trump's ready to just absolutely annihilate them with it because they don't know they've lost all credibility.
[02:55:19.288 --> 02:55:22.590]  And Trump basically has been recruited by patriots.
[02:55:22.590 --> 02:55:23.551]  He didn't want to do it, by the way.
[02:55:24.151 --> 02:55:27.634]  On a political, what they know could be a suicide mission.
[02:55:27.634 --> 02:55:31.917]  And people, real statesmen don't tell you all this stuff, folks, okay?
[02:55:31.917 --> 02:55:34.679]  I mean, all these other people are cowards, they can be intimidated.
[02:55:34.679 --> 02:55:40.103]  Whatever you want to say about Trump, he, believe me, they wouldn't let me know some of this stuff if it wasn't the case.
[02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:44.572]  They have recruited him on a suicide mission to try to save America.
[02:55:44.572 --> 02:55:45.753]  Trump believes the narrative.
[02:55:45.753 --> 02:55:46.974]  The narrative's real.
[02:55:46.974 --> 02:55:48.995]  It trumps all these other fake people.
[02:55:48.995 --> 02:55:50.536]  We've got to bet on it.
[02:55:50.536 --> 02:55:56.961]  And then you came on when I hadn't even talked about this yet or had Trump on, and you already basically knew all about it.
[02:55:56.961 --> 02:56:01.604]  But not even though you knew him, you understood the narrative because it was the truth and a way out of this.
[02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:03.290]  That's correct.
[02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:11.903]  And I am so fortunate, as America is and you are, to have Trump come forward, spend his time, his energy, his money.
[02:56:11.903 --> 02:56:13.425]  He doesn't need to do this.
[02:56:13.425 --> 02:56:16.269]  But he sees, and this is a very smart individual.
[02:56:16.269 --> 02:56:17.792]  I'm not talking only book smart.
[02:56:18.252 --> 02:56:20.213]  He's incredibly shrewd.
[02:56:20.213 --> 02:56:23.674]  He understood what happened in 9-11 because he knows Silverstein.
[02:56:23.674 --> 02:56:26.616]  He knows the World Trade Center better than anybody.
[02:56:26.616 --> 02:56:34.299]  He knows the machinations behind the World Trade Center and the insurance company that Silverstein created a scam.
[02:56:34.299 --> 02:56:36.200]  And so Trump knows all of this.
[02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:43.501]  And by the way, folks don't know he's threatening them in language that only the establishment knows, and the public doesn't even get what he's saying.
[02:56:43.501 --> 02:56:47.882]  Trump is like Godzilla attacking Tokyo every day.
[02:56:47.882 --> 02:56:50.083]  I mean, he is scaring the hell out of them.
[02:56:50.083 --> 02:56:56.164]  Well, yeah, but I gotta tell you, he's got nuance, despite what he's saying, and they think he's braggadocio and all that.
[02:56:56.164 --> 02:56:56.864]  Not really.
[02:56:56.864 --> 02:56:58.244]  He's kind of hinting.
[02:56:58.244 --> 02:57:02.285]  When he said, look, I got Bill in my sight, he's warning Hillary.
[02:57:02.785 --> 02:57:05.288]  That this is more than just about Bill.
[02:57:05.288 --> 02:57:18.845]  This is about Bill's banking failures, how he destroyed the banking system, how he flooded the markets with dollars, how he corrupted our system in banking, how she's involved in banking.
[02:57:18.845 --> 02:57:21.649]  I mean, he's giving you the cues as to what's going to happen.
[02:57:22.129 --> 02:57:32.899]  When he's talking about ISIS, or he's talking about strong people, he's not talking about generals who've been on a pension and who don't want to, you know, stand up.
[02:57:32.899 --> 02:57:47.612]  He's talking about generals who've stood up and said many things, and said many things against the administration, like, say, General Stanley McChrystal, who made it very clear what he thought about the Obama administration and the people who served him.
[02:57:48.172 --> 02:57:51.236]  And General McChrystal's deputy is Mike Flynn.
[02:57:51.236 --> 02:57:52.638]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:57:52.638 --> 02:58:01.028]  So there are many generals in our system who are very smart, have gone to many schools, but have been in combat and understand the limits of war.
[02:58:01.028 --> 02:58:04.393]  In the meantime, Trump is signaling to everyone, look,
[02:58:05.023 --> 02:58:08.388]  This is a last chance for us to really get our act together.
[02:58:08.388 --> 02:58:13.474]  It doesn't matter whether you're Republican, Democrat, rich, poor, left-wing, right-wing.
[02:58:13.474 --> 02:58:14.396]  All of that is gone.
[02:58:14.396 --> 02:58:16.699]  It doesn't matter what gender you are.
[02:58:16.699 --> 02:58:21.165]  If you think Hillary Clinton should be elected because she's a woman, you got a big mistake.
[02:58:21.405 --> 02:58:27.351]  Well sure, and there's also this socialist, globalist thing of mounting America's head like a trophy.
[02:58:27.351 --> 02:58:28.972]  They want to conquer us.
[02:58:28.972 --> 02:58:33.416]  Don't the globalists get in conquering America, they're going to blow the whole engine of the world economy.
[02:58:33.416 --> 02:58:35.138]  We've got to save America.
[02:58:35.138 --> 02:58:36.339]  We've got to do it now.
[02:58:36.339 --> 02:58:39.442]  Fourth Hour with Dave and I, Steve Pucinich and myself coming up.
[02:58:39.442 --> 02:58:41.904]  Infowars.com, email that out to folks.
[02:58:41.904 --> 02:58:43.606]  They want to shut us down.
[02:58:43.606 --> 02:58:44.607]  Support us.
[02:58:44.607 --> 02:58:45.568]  Don't take us for granted.
[02:58:48.564 --> 02:58:52.546]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:58:52.546 --> 02:58:58.850]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:58:58.850 --> 02:59:06.135]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:14.880]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[02:59:15.240 --> 02:59:21.403]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:21.403 --> 02:59:24.444]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:59:24.444 --> 02:59:26.245]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[02:59:26.245 --> 02:59:29.826]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:59:29.826 --> 02:59:31.727]  No needles, no injections.
[02:59:31.727 --> 02:59:33.368]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:59:33.368 --> 02:59:34.569]  Try it for yourself.
[02:59:34.569 --> 02:59:36.870]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:42.052]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:44.913 --> 02:59:50.395]  InfoWarsLife's Secret 12.
[02:59:50.395 --> 03:00:01.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:09.344]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.493 --> 03:00:17.094]  We're good to go.
[03:00:34.557 --> 03:00:50.935]  I'm in a month and a half, but David Knight's about to pop in, Steve Pchenik's with us, StevePchenik.com, best-selling author, master spy, former head of PsyOps for the State Department, involved in major regime change all over the world, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations until he resigned and exposed 9-11.
[03:00:55.367 --> 03:00:57.789]  It really is amazing.
[03:00:57.789 --> 03:00:59.410]  It's like Fight Club now.
[03:00:59.410 --> 03:01:06.075]  If you haven't seen Fight Club, you don't know, but that's kind of a socialist narrative where people try all sorts of dirty tricks.
[03:01:06.075 --> 03:01:07.376]  I mean, they've sent a killer here.
[03:01:07.376 --> 03:01:08.377]  I'm gonna talk about that next week.
[03:01:09.861 --> 03:01:12.022]  Cop got killed stopping him.
[03:01:12.022 --> 03:01:26.228]  It's like they try all these dirty tricks, but it's like there's so many good people, even in the FBI, in the local police, in the government, in the military, that are actually protecting the country outside of their orders, that it's like bizarre.
[03:01:26.228 --> 03:01:28.989]  It's like Fight Club now, where
[03:01:30.936 --> 03:01:34.978]  Like the police should warn me about stuff, and then it's true what they warn me about?
[03:01:34.978 --> 03:01:53.730]  It's really... I'll tell you the most humbling thing in my life, Dr. Pachinic, I know they got corrupt people in the system as well, to realize there's a whole war going on right now in the government for the heart and soul of this country, and that I wouldn't even be here right now if it wasn't just for prayers, but people taking action to support the Infowar.
[03:01:53.730 --> 03:01:58.313]  It's very humbling to realize that when you say Infowars is at the heart of this,
[03:01:59.073 --> 03:02:02.136]  I actually don't want that credit, but I know the enemy already knows that.
[03:02:02.136 --> 03:02:05.018]  I kind of want to be under the radar, but I guess we just have to go ahead and own it.
[03:02:05.018 --> 03:02:15.226]  But it is true that InfoWars, all our guests, our crew, not just Alex Jones, I'm a small part of it, really are changing history together, and we're in an epic battle right now, Dr. Pchenik.
[03:02:16.499 --> 03:02:17.679]  That's correct, Alex.
[03:02:17.679 --> 03:02:19.540]  You know, I've said it a long time ago.
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:32.384]  When you were willing to bring me on, and you were willing to listen to the narrative, and I made predictions, and they would come true, I said to you, eventually, that will culminate in a candidate.
[03:02:32.384 --> 03:02:34.705]  That candidate, I didn't know, was going to be Trump.
[03:02:35.265 --> 03:02:37.126]  But I knew... You said it over and over again!
[03:02:37.126 --> 03:02:38.527]  I just can't believe how smart you are.
[03:02:38.527 --> 03:02:39.187]  It really is true.
[03:02:39.187 --> 03:02:40.467]  No, it's not about smart.
[03:02:40.467 --> 03:02:44.329]  All I am is really... I feel the American public and where they're going.
[03:02:44.329 --> 03:02:45.630]  It's not about intelligence.
[03:02:45.630 --> 03:02:49.212]  It's about emotions and understanding what you understand.
[03:02:49.212 --> 03:02:50.812]  It's the heartland of America.
[03:02:50.812 --> 03:02:55.635]  It's understanding that most of the people in this country do not make billions of dollars.
[03:02:55.635 --> 03:02:58.276]  Most of the people in this country are not millionaires.
[03:02:58.276 --> 03:03:02.738]  Most of the people in this country are not doctors and lawyers or politicians who have done nothing.
[03:03:03.178 --> 03:03:08.780]  Most of the people in this country have to work one job, two jobs, send their kids to school.
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:10.961]  They have a hard time making a living.
[03:03:10.961 --> 03:03:13.922]  And, by the way, they're proud to serve our country.
[03:03:13.922 --> 03:03:19.625]  They go to the military, they don't have to brag about it, and they don't avoid the draft.
[03:03:19.625 --> 03:03:21.766]  Now, I'm not talking about everyone.
[03:03:21.766 --> 03:03:26.027]  I'm just saying that the hard land of America has its own narrative.
[03:03:26.027 --> 03:03:32.030]  And what I was fortunate to do was to live in places like Montana, Florida, and the South and the West.
[03:03:32.537 --> 03:03:32.877]  I think so.
[03:03:49.687 --> 03:03:50.548]  I don't know.
[03:04:04.628 --> 03:04:06.089]  You're that Alan Freed.
[03:04:06.089 --> 03:04:08.611]  This is the comparable part to rock and roll.
[03:04:08.611 --> 03:04:16.677]  This is the content narrative of a major shift in our politics, both domestically and foreign affairs.
[03:04:16.677 --> 03:04:18.018]  Well, I agree.
[03:04:18.018 --> 03:04:22.581]  I mean, 1776, that spirit survived all over the country, but really strong in some areas.
[03:04:22.581 --> 03:04:30.066]  And I think that's all we're doing is bringing a fire that still was burning and spreading it, not just in the country, but worldwide.
[03:04:30.066 --> 03:04:34.149]  Well, you know, number one, we don't indict anybody or everybody.
[03:04:34.873 --> 03:04:39.495]  I've never been on this show where I've heard a massive denunciation of Muslims.
[03:04:39.495 --> 03:04:40.575]  Never heard it.
[03:04:40.575 --> 03:04:45.037]  Never heard anybody denounce anybody in this, not with credibility.
[03:04:45.037 --> 03:04:50.999]  We were on this show when we said, look, this is a... everything that happened has happened to us by us.
[03:04:50.999 --> 03:04:52.640]  In other words, the Americans... Stay there, doctor.
[03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:52.960]  Stay there.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:53.820]  We're coming back with David Knight.
[03:04:53.820 --> 03:04:54.600]  You'll be able to finish up.
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:55.100]  Thank you.
[03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:55.841]  StevePachinick.com.
[03:04:58.993 --> 03:05:04.237]  The Affluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[03:05:04.237 --> 03:05:14.886]  A wealthy Texas teen, who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing four people while driving drunk, will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[03:05:14.886 --> 03:05:17.408]  Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya,
[03:05:17.768 --> 03:05:21.949]  We're taking into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[03:05:21.949 --> 03:05:35.774]  Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenzatine during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths when a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[03:05:35.774 --> 03:05:42.477]  He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter, a sentence critics saw as far too light.
[03:05:42.477 --> 03:05:43.457]  Couch and his mother,
[03:05:43.757 --> 03:05:50.229]  Disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[03:05:50.229 --> 03:05:53.355]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:58.208 --> 03:06:05.116]  In the 15 year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[03:06:05.116 --> 03:06:08.019]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[03:06:08.019 --> 03:06:13.906]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of signups.
[03:06:13.906 --> 03:06:15.688]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.

[03:06:58.047 --> 03:07:07.092]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:07:07.092 --> 03:07:13.575]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:07:13.575 --> 03:07:15.276]  The numbers are staggering.
[03:07:15.276 --> 03:07:21.840]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.521]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[03:07:25.521 --> 03:07:26.902]  Don't let them win.

[03:08:10.202 --> 03:08:12.844]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:12.844 --> 03:08:18.007]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:08:23.852 --> 03:08:33.418]  We have a dominant elite in this country that hates private property, that hates free market, that hates Christian values, family values.
[03:08:33.418 --> 03:08:38.402]  But then they're all ultra-rich, but tell us we shouldn't have wealth.
[03:08:38.402 --> 03:08:41.504]  It is a very greedy, hateful system.
[03:08:41.504 --> 03:08:45.807]  The opposite of Renaissance is attempting to take over the world.
[03:08:47.134 --> 03:08:54.061]  And it's a lot of special interests that exempt themselves from law so that they're ready to put a lot of onerous taxes on us.
[03:08:54.061 --> 03:09:00.227]  We have the Democrats calling for a surtax on the American people to pay for war against Islamic State.
[03:09:00.227 --> 03:09:03.090]  Ineffective air campaign has thus far cost five billion.
[03:09:04.912 --> 03:09:10.557]  Coons, the congressman, said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for U.S.
[03:09:10.557 --> 03:09:16.662]  military force, Congress was levying a new tax on Americans to pay for military actions against I.S.
[03:09:16.662 --> 03:09:20.945]  Well, yeah, if you bankrupt the country, there won't be any more giant defense budget.
[03:09:20.945 --> 03:09:23.948]  I mean, leave the golden goose alone and take the egg each morning.
[03:09:24.668 --> 03:09:27.150]  I mean, even if they were crooks, they should be smarter than this.
[03:09:27.150 --> 03:09:32.734]  But they just have this greedy will to squeeze blood out of a stone.
[03:09:32.734 --> 03:09:40.119]  Dr. Pachinik, I want to start throwing it here to David Knight for some of his questions and comments as we segue into him hosting most of this fourth hour today.
[03:09:42.466 --> 03:09:56.899]  I see the attacks, I see the mainstream media attacks, literally, thousands of articles a week on average now lying about this show, but lying about Trump, lying about everybody else, lying about anybody who isn't, you know, basically part of the in-gang.
[03:09:56.899 --> 03:10:01.764]  It doesn't work though, I mean, I'm not just saying that, doesn't the establishment get
[03:10:02.572 --> 03:10:03.973]  No, not really.
[03:10:03.973 --> 03:10:12.618]  When you're desperate, and this establishment is desperate, and we're talking about the military-industrial complex and Obama, he's not a man who has
[03:10:13.799 --> 03:10:17.963]  A strong sense of integrity or honesty.
[03:10:17.963 --> 03:10:19.844]  He likes to pretend that.
[03:10:19.844 --> 03:10:22.526]  The reality is they're working out of desperation.
[03:10:22.526 --> 03:10:28.030]  They have no ability to create a creative strategy or think out of the box.
[03:10:28.030 --> 03:10:35.516]  In fact, what's happening now, you should think of it as really the reward for 21 years of being successful.
[03:10:35.516 --> 03:10:37.738]  When people are dying or they're desperate,
[03:10:38.298 --> 03:10:46.002]  In their ability to continue this addictive behavior of self-destruction, of destroying our economy, of going to war.
[03:10:46.002 --> 03:10:52.025]  You know, it cost us $6 trillion, the Afghanistan war, and we've been there 14 years.
[03:10:52.025 --> 03:10:55.727]  Cost us another couple of trillion dollars in Iraq, and we've been there.
[03:10:55.727 --> 03:11:00.109]  The military-industrial complex doesn't care how many people die for them.
[03:11:00.109 --> 03:11:03.151]  They don't care how much money is sacked out of the system.
[03:11:03.151 --> 03:11:05.892]  Remember, a politician is not really a job.
[03:11:06.432 --> 03:11:12.377]  A politician is just an excuse for narcissism and sociopathy to get into power.
[03:11:12.377 --> 03:11:14.098]  Look at how they treat the veterans!
[03:11:14.098 --> 03:11:15.839]  I mean, they just... They don't care.
[03:11:15.839 --> 03:11:20.002]  I mean, my friends who are in charge of the veterans, I talk to the veterans, they don't care.
[03:11:20.002 --> 03:11:21.643]  This is cannon fodder.
[03:11:21.643 --> 03:11:30.590]  What basically happens is the industry wants to go from bandages to bullets, and once they create the cannon fodder they need, they really don't care.
[03:11:31.130 --> 03:11:52.138]  But people like Trump are coming in and people like yourself and the generals who do care, the ones who go to the army hospitals, not the ones who have never been in the military, avoided the draft like Jeb Bush or Obama or Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton, who's never been effective in combat, who's never been effective in
[03:11:52.618 --> 03:11:56.861]  Isn't that our greatest weakness, is that we have this leadership that is so soft?
[03:11:56.861 --> 03:11:58.623]  Yes, and that's why we have to get rid of it.
[03:11:58.623 --> 03:11:59.603]  It's a cancer.
[03:11:59.603 --> 03:12:05.628]  It's a cancer of the spoiled, the entitled, and the narcissist.
[03:12:05.628 --> 03:12:11.472]  And Hillary is the classical pathological liar who can't tell you the right from wrong.
[03:12:11.472 --> 03:12:20.499]  I mean, I happen to know her daughter, who's a very sweet girl, but the reality is that Bill and Hillary are literally what we call folie a deux, two people going along
[03:12:20.939 --> 03:12:25.063]  Making believe that their fantasy world can be imposed on our world.
[03:12:25.063 --> 03:12:26.064]  Bill tried it.
[03:12:26.064 --> 03:12:27.526]  It didn't work, really.
[03:12:27.526 --> 03:12:29.007]  And then he changed the narrative.
[03:12:29.007 --> 03:12:34.373]  Hillary will try, but my suspicion and my prediction is Trump will devastate her.
[03:12:34.373 --> 03:12:38.377]  He will devastate her to the point where physically she won't be able to handle him.
[03:12:38.817 --> 03:12:44.622]  Obviously, Hillary knows Trump has major backing by hardcore patriots, right?
[03:12:44.622 --> 03:12:47.884]  Well, she knows that, but she marginalizes us.
[03:12:47.884 --> 03:12:51.547]  Basically, in her mind, we're not relevant to the major discord.
[03:12:51.547 --> 03:13:02.336]  What she's looking at is the Electoral College, which can be jimmied with or can be fixed, or with the election booth that Sununu fixed for the Bush family.
[03:13:02.336 --> 03:13:07.860]  You know, these are the kind of things that Trump has to know that can be fixed or in any way jimmied.
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:12.164]  Yeah, even in fixed polls, he's dead heat or two points ahead of Hillary.
[03:13:22.901 --> 03:13:24.182]  Well, it's not even that.
[03:13:24.182 --> 03:13:34.989]  I mean, it really is as simple as the fact that you want this person who can do things come in, or you want somebody who's never been able to accomplish anything except to... Well, exactly.
[03:13:34.989 --> 03:13:38.551]  We know Hillary and Bernie Sanders and Jeb Bush are a joke, and you notice...
[03:13:39.634 --> 03:13:42.276]  That they've just been writing him off, writing him off, writing him off.
[03:13:42.276 --> 03:13:47.601]  Now they've got their different campaign people talking about killing him on TV and radio.
[03:13:47.601 --> 03:13:50.403]  I mean, they really are pieces of work.
[03:13:50.403 --> 03:13:55.847]  Don't they get running two dynasties is what created the vacuum that allowed a Trump to come in?
[03:13:55.847 --> 03:14:01.051]  And if they don't let something real happen after that, the pressure only is going to intensify?
[03:14:01.051 --> 03:14:02.373]  They don't care.
[03:14:02.373 --> 03:14:07.076]  You have to understand the Clintons and the Bushes really don't care about the Republic.
[03:14:07.076 --> 03:14:08.698]  Basically, you have to remember that
[03:14:09.727 --> 03:14:13.190]  The old man, 41, George H.W.
[03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.510]  Bush.
[03:14:13.510 --> 03:14:16.412]  I mean, Bush was really a car salesman.
[03:14:16.412 --> 03:14:25.179]  When he finally married a press guy, they came into the social system and worked their way up as opportunists.
[03:14:25.179 --> 03:14:29.702]  Now, that's not what the Bush want to tell you, but basically that's the history.
[03:14:29.702 --> 03:14:32.164]  Clinton's history is a much more sorted one.
[03:14:32.164 --> 03:14:35.227]  He claims his father left and his mother was a nurse.
[03:14:35.227 --> 03:14:35.747]  Not correct.
[03:14:37.188 --> 03:14:38.369]  She was a prostitute.
[03:14:38.369 --> 03:14:40.571]  And he grew up in Hope, Arkansas.
[03:14:40.571 --> 03:14:42.673]  She was a prostitute for the mob.
[03:14:42.673 --> 03:14:45.776]  And that's where the mob would go before they came to Miami.
[03:14:45.776 --> 03:14:51.802]  So everything about Bill and Hillary is just an absolute nonsensical fantasy.
[03:14:52.262 --> 03:14:57.108]  Which, you know, people can enjoy or they can take seriously and claim, oh, we need a woman.
[03:14:57.108 --> 03:15:08.480]  The truth is we have 150 women who run companies like Norfolk Grumman and major electronic companies who are far more talented than she is and will come and do time after Trump.
[03:15:09.020 --> 03:15:13.025]  He says he's willing to go up against the mafias and when he starts calling for
[03:15:26.900 --> 03:15:30.801]  You know, not letting corporations be tax-exempt offshore, going after Wall Street.
[03:15:30.801 --> 03:15:36.363]  When he starts going after those cash cows, he certainly is signaling he means war.
[03:15:36.363 --> 03:15:40.405]  He does say some incendiary things, but, you know, again, nobody's perfect.
[03:15:40.405 --> 03:15:43.006]  I want to bring David Knight in here separately.
[03:15:43.006 --> 03:15:44.626]  He's about to take over in about five minutes.
[03:15:44.626 --> 03:15:46.287]  Steve Pchenik is our guest.
[03:15:46.667 --> 03:15:49.389]  Comments, David, also questions for Steve Pchenik.
[03:15:49.389 --> 03:15:58.514]  Regardless, no one can deny, David, and I want to get your take on this, that there is a huge counter-coup or soft coup, I've used those terms as well, that Dr. Pchenik used.
[03:15:58.514 --> 03:16:02.297]  It's so over-the-top that our military's publicly saying no.
[03:16:02.297 --> 03:16:04.578]  We told people years ago it was happening.
[03:16:04.578 --> 03:16:05.599]  Now it's confirmed.
[03:16:05.599 --> 03:16:07.280]  I mean, we had major guests confirming it.
[03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:10.320]  I talk to some of these military people.
[03:16:10.320 --> 03:16:11.801]  I mean, but this is huge.
[03:16:11.801 --> 03:16:17.122]  This is just, this is like a soft Valkyrie, you know, aka 1944.
[03:16:17.122 --> 03:16:18.282]  David Knight.
[03:16:18.282 --> 03:16:29.104]  Yeah, Alex, I would like to get Dr. Pachinik's comments on what former Democrat presidential candidate Jim Webb said about Hillary Clinton this week when he attacked her for inept leadership.
[03:16:29.104 --> 03:16:33.265]  I think it was absolutely amazing what he put out there as a Democrat.
[03:16:33.265 --> 03:16:35.966]  He said Hillary Clinton should be called to account for inept leadership.
[03:16:36.406 --> 03:16:40.289]  That brought about the chaos in Libya, the power vacuums that resulted in the rest of the region.
[03:16:40.289 --> 03:16:41.871]  While she held that office, the U.S.
[03:16:41.871 --> 03:16:45.533]  spent about $2 billion backing the Libyan uprising against Qaddafi.
[03:16:45.533 --> 03:16:49.857]  The uprising, which in part, was part of the Arab Spring, led directly to him being removed.
[03:16:49.857 --> 03:16:51.498]  Now we have 2,000 ISIS terrorists.
[03:16:51.498 --> 03:16:53.680]  It's exactly the same thing we've been seeing here.
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:54.821]  And of course, Webb was... Exactly.
[03:16:54.821 --> 03:17:04.248]  What do you make... I don't think he can hear you, but I've now piped him audio, Dr. Petchenik, about even Democrats coming out now, members of Congress, saying, Hillary, you ran the destruction of Libya and others.
[03:17:04.248 --> 03:17:04.749]  You're a joke.
[03:17:06.047 --> 03:17:08.809]  I think they're extremely well-meaning Democrats.
[03:17:08.809 --> 03:17:10.771]  You know, you can't put everybody in one pile.
[03:17:10.771 --> 03:17:18.077]  But I think if they were smart, if they really wanted to have a viable candidate, Hillary Clinton's not their candidate.
[03:17:18.077 --> 03:17:20.700]  I'm glad that Jim Webb came in as an independent.
[03:17:20.700 --> 03:17:22.421]  He served our country.
[03:17:22.421 --> 03:17:24.343]  He's a great American.
[03:17:24.343 --> 03:17:25.624]  He's a good novelist.
[03:17:26.204 --> 03:17:46.637]  But, I think the Democrats have to seriously think that they want to put up a couple hundred million on a person who's over 69 years old, who claims that she couldn't speak, had a flu attack, and basically messed up in Libya, Benghazi, the State Department, and everywhere else, that this is not a viable candidate.
[03:17:46.637 --> 03:17:47.658]  I mean, I'm a realist.
[03:17:48.458 --> 03:17:54.443]  I mean, do our elites really want us to be run by dirtbag mafias?
[03:17:54.443 --> 03:17:56.544]  Well, it's not a question, do they want to?
[03:17:56.544 --> 03:17:59.346]  The real question for them is, what do they get in return?
[03:17:59.346 --> 03:18:08.052]  The Clintons, with this Clinton Foundation around the world, are very good at being able to trade off all kinds of favors, even using the State Department.
[03:18:08.052 --> 03:18:15.818]  When she was in the State Department, she gave all kinds of kudos and goodies to Saudi Arabia
[03:18:16.298 --> 03:18:23.860]  To all kinds of Salafist regimes who really persecute women and at the same time she claims she's for women's rights.
[03:18:23.860 --> 03:18:29.841]  Yet on the other hand she's funded by the very countries that suppress women all over the world.
[03:18:29.841 --> 03:18:31.702]  Particularly in the Sunni world.
[03:18:31.702 --> 03:18:32.542]  And they know that.
[03:18:32.542 --> 03:18:33.482]  And she knows that.
[03:18:33.482 --> 03:18:35.002]  But she writes that off.
[03:18:35.002 --> 03:18:36.383]  The same thing with Bill.
[03:18:36.383 --> 03:18:39.764]  He doesn't care who he deals with as long as they're funded.
[03:18:39.764 --> 03:18:42.684]  Their obsession is money and corruption.
[03:18:42.684 --> 03:18:45.445]  They don't know any other alternative to it.
[03:18:46.065 --> 03:18:51.689]  And I thought Obama would come in and be able to change that narrative, but in fact it was pathetic.
[03:18:51.689 --> 03:18:54.911]  It was even a more pathetic narrative because he accomplished nothing.
[03:18:55.567 --> 03:18:59.589]  As opposed to Bill, where he might say something, and there was a little bit of drama there.
[03:18:59.589 --> 03:19:00.209]  I agree.
[03:19:00.209 --> 03:19:01.470]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[03:19:01.470 --> 03:19:02.210]  Last one of the week.
[03:19:02.210 --> 03:19:02.550]  No more.
[03:19:02.550 --> 03:19:03.411]  I can't keep doing this.
[03:19:03.411 --> 03:19:04.751]  And just please support our sponsors.
[03:19:04.751 --> 03:19:05.712]  Please check out the products.
[03:19:05.712 --> 03:19:07.213]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:19:07.213 --> 03:19:11.935]  David Knight's going to be taking over in the last half hour of this show, but I want to bring him back in.
[03:19:11.935 --> 03:19:18.438]  I mean, we're sitting here looking at this while the average American is watching NFL football or whatever, and I'm not bashing him.
[03:19:18.438 --> 03:19:18.898]  I get it.
[03:19:18.898 --> 03:19:20.219]  I used to love football, played football.
[03:19:22.441 --> 03:19:24.422]  That's all entertainment.
[03:19:24.422 --> 03:19:31.003]  And I wonder what's going to happen as the general public, as the economy gets worse, begins to realize what's happening.
[03:19:31.003 --> 03:19:39.846]  Because if the police and military already know what's going on, if the bureaucracy already knows what's going on, not because they're perfect, but because they're more close to the info, you know, it's their jobs.
[03:19:40.706 --> 03:19:49.031]  What is going to happen if the message of liberty has sold massively successfully with the people that run the country?
[03:19:49.031 --> 03:19:55.515]  If we've already basically won many areas of that fight, what's going to happen when the zombie public wakes up to it?
[03:19:55.515 --> 03:20:01.059]  I mean, I'm sorry, I know the globalists are going to try to run some kind of Black Lives Matter, kill the police movement.
[03:20:01.539 --> 03:20:04.080]  But that's not gonna, that's not gonna save them.
[03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:09.461]  They're not gonna run a George Soros overthrow Ukraine type deal here and scapegoat the local police.
[03:20:09.461 --> 03:20:13.381]  And a lot of local police are out of control, but the point is, that's not our biggest issue.
[03:20:13.381 --> 03:20:20.143]  I mean, I really see them trying to run some Saul Alinsky socialist destabilization campaign.
[03:20:20.143 --> 03:20:22.223]  That's their plan at regime change.
[03:20:22.223 --> 03:20:25.664]  Like a coup on our coup, politically.
[03:20:25.664 --> 03:20:28.045]  But I just don't see that duck flying, Dr. Pucinich.
[03:20:28.045 --> 03:20:29.585]  Then I'm gonna get David Knight to pop in.
[03:20:30.530 --> 03:20:32.591]  I don't think that's going to work.
[03:20:32.591 --> 03:20:34.252]  First of all, I've met Soros.
[03:20:34.252 --> 03:20:36.313]  He's singularly unimpressive.
[03:20:36.313 --> 03:20:43.737]  He's a man who made his fortunes by chance and by luck and by being very devious during World War II and subsequently.
[03:20:43.737 --> 03:20:47.018]  So he's not a man of integrity or somebody I would admire.
[03:20:47.018 --> 03:20:48.139]  I even met him in Russia.
[03:20:48.911 --> 03:20:55.633]  But the reality is, he is far less relevant to the American narrative than the Americans themselves.
[03:20:55.633 --> 03:20:56.774]  And what do I mean?
[03:20:56.774 --> 03:21:02.996]  The billionaires or the millionaires, they are not as relevant as the business people in the country who are the farmers.
[03:21:03.861 --> 03:21:06.923]  The car mechanics, the truckers.
[03:21:06.923 --> 03:21:10.144]  I mean, we have a vibrant economy that's going everywhere.
[03:21:10.144 --> 03:21:21.670]  Once Trump comes in and reverses inversion, which means he's going to take back those countries that decided to buy up an Ireland company on a piece of paper, everything is going to change.
[03:21:21.670 --> 03:21:25.031]  But we have to be able to elect that man.
[03:21:25.031 --> 03:21:28.333]  Once we can elect that man, the entire narrative will change.
[03:21:29.102 --> 03:21:34.257]  Up to that point, I just want to hold off on violence or on any other aspect.
[03:21:34.947 --> 03:21:36.008]  of rebellion.
[03:21:36.008 --> 03:21:41.373]  But remember, we've been in rebellion since the beginning of the Republic.
[03:21:41.373 --> 03:21:43.014]  That's why they're so scared of us.
[03:21:43.014 --> 03:21:46.597]  They know those coals are still in the fireplace and explode at any time.
[03:21:46.597 --> 03:21:47.898]  You're absolutely right.
[03:21:47.898 --> 03:21:49.119]  We have the power.
[03:21:49.119 --> 03:21:53.203]  Raising our kids, being strong, working hard.
[03:21:53.203 --> 03:21:57.407]  They want to break our will by being good and doing what's right.
[03:21:57.407 --> 03:21:59.048]  That's literally a chain reaction.
[03:21:59.048 --> 03:21:59.929]  It's a spirit.
[03:21:59.929 --> 03:22:01.930]  And I don't use the spiritual term,
[03:22:02.871 --> 03:22:03.712]  For no reason.
[03:22:03.712 --> 03:22:04.713]  It's electrical.
[03:22:04.713 --> 03:22:05.834]  It's science.
[03:22:05.834 --> 03:22:06.795]  We stand up.
[03:22:06.795 --> 03:22:07.936]  We trump them.
[03:22:07.936 --> 03:22:09.837]  We lay down and believe they're beating us.
[03:22:09.837 --> 03:22:10.898]  They win.
[03:22:10.898 --> 03:22:12.840]  Resistance is victory.
[03:22:12.840 --> 03:22:14.161]  Correct.
[03:22:14.161 --> 03:22:17.324]  And the truth will overcome everything else.
[03:22:17.324 --> 03:22:18.084]  Believe me.
[03:22:18.084 --> 03:22:20.006]  I mean, I've believed in the truth.
[03:22:20.006 --> 03:22:22.428]  You know, I've worked for what I believe to be the truth.
[03:22:22.428 --> 03:22:24.550]  I can't say I'm sacrosanct.
[03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:25.331]  None of us are perfect.
[03:22:26.519 --> 03:22:29.861]  That is exactly what we're about, and we're willing to die for.
[03:22:29.861 --> 03:22:31.722]  It was as simple as that.
[03:22:31.722 --> 03:22:36.264]  And I staked out my claim the day 9-11 came in, and even before that.
[03:22:36.264 --> 03:22:43.007]  Well, that's our ace of spades, is these minions, these sociopaths, these sellouts, these narcissists.
[03:22:43.007 --> 03:22:45.429]  All they care about is their stinking lives.
[03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:47.049]  They don't realize there's something a lot bigger than that.
[03:22:47.049 --> 03:22:49.211]  The life of the culture, the life of the people.
[03:22:49.211 --> 03:22:50.871]  They are scared of us.
[03:22:50.871 --> 03:22:53.533]  They know we're not afraid of them, and they hate it.
[03:22:55.420 --> 03:22:56.741]  That's correct.
[03:22:56.741 --> 03:22:58.602]  David Knight?
[03:22:58.602 --> 03:22:59.102]  Absolutely.
[03:22:59.102 --> 03:23:01.983]  David Knight, questions, comments, jump in here.
[03:23:01.983 --> 03:23:18.291]  Yeah, you know Alex, when I look at this, and of course we all know and agree with what Jim Webb was saying about Benghazi, and as I look at Benghazi, and Dr. Pachinick has talked about this, we've had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer talk about it, laying out exactly what was going on, saying the same things that Jim Webb said about it.
[03:23:18.911 --> 03:23:21.692]  But of course, there's a lot of people who still don't hear that.
[03:23:21.692 --> 03:23:23.492]  There's a lot of people who still have to understand that.
[03:23:23.492 --> 03:23:25.732]  But we don't have to convince everybody.
[03:23:25.732 --> 03:23:33.294]  You know, you can fool some of the people all the time, but you need to just get a critical mass, and I think we're very close to getting that critical mass.
[03:23:33.294 --> 03:23:34.414]  I agree with David.
[03:23:34.414 --> 03:23:45.596]  If you really begin to analyze the Revolutionary War, it was only 4-6% of the public that was involved in the actual fighting and demonstrations.
[03:23:45.596 --> 03:23:46.476]  So, David is correct.
[03:23:47.222 --> 03:23:49.003]  I don't need a majority.
[03:23:49.003 --> 03:23:52.325]  I just need the crux of the integrity.
[03:23:52.325 --> 03:23:55.608]  I need the Christians who understand what their values are.
[03:23:55.608 --> 03:24:00.971]  I need the people who understand their gun rights, their rights for freedom, and who've studied it.
[03:24:00.971 --> 03:24:03.953]  I don't have a problem when people are watching football or games.
[03:24:03.953 --> 03:24:05.054]  They have to watch.
[03:24:05.054 --> 03:24:06.715]  There's too much background.
[03:24:07.375 --> 03:24:11.658]  But you're right, Obama said bitter clingers, gun-owning Christians, people that believe in something.
[03:24:11.658 --> 03:24:16.781]  Doesn't mean we're perfect or have all the answers, but we believe in something, and it isn't him being God.
[03:24:16.781 --> 03:24:19.742]  It isn't MTV being God, and so here's my question.
[03:24:19.742 --> 03:24:23.465]  Here's my question to Dr. Steve McShannon.
[03:24:23.465 --> 03:24:28.888]  How will the empire strike back, A, and then B, I've got a good idea, but you've been inside it.
[03:24:28.888 --> 03:24:35.292]  Who are the special interests that are the real conscious enemies of this country?
[03:24:36.465 --> 03:24:42.390]  The real special interests, ironically, are the ones who want to create materials that we don't need.
[03:24:42.390 --> 03:24:59.323]  For example, you have Senator Portman of Ohio, who insisted against the desire of Martin Dempsey and the Defense Department to build the M1 Abrams, because he had 5,000 people unemployed, and he built the M1 Abrams tank.
[03:24:59.323 --> 03:25:01.305]  And the General said, we don't want it.
[03:25:01.860 --> 03:25:02.480]  We don't want it.
[03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:03.321]  We don't need it.
[03:25:03.321 --> 03:25:07.864]  And Senator Portman said, we're going to have it.
[03:25:07.864 --> 03:25:10.625]  And they built these M1 Abrams and we sold them overseas.
[03:25:10.625 --> 03:25:13.807]  In other words, we're building things we don't need.
[03:25:13.807 --> 03:25:19.570]  And it's time, as General Eisenhower said, to be careful of the military-industrial complex.
[03:25:19.570 --> 03:25:20.791]  They're very dangerous.
[03:25:20.791 --> 03:25:24.773]  They do not represent our interests, our basic goals.
[03:25:24.773 --> 03:25:27.155]  And they will show you on television every kind of
[03:25:28.078 --> 03:25:31.795]  Insignia or notation that they represent the Republic.
[03:25:31.795 --> 03:25:32.197]  They don't.
[03:25:32.719 --> 03:25:34.840]  We don't need a war in Afghanistan.
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:40.903]  I don't need 776 bases all over the world in 226 countries.
[03:25:40.903 --> 03:25:49.626]  I need our troops to be better trained, to be located in the United States, with forward positioning like Sinkpack and Southcom.
[03:25:49.626 --> 03:25:50.607]  Look at the new fighter!
[03:25:50.607 --> 03:25:52.447]  They admit it's a total piece of crap.
[03:25:52.447 --> 03:25:54.148]  It costs like a half billion a piece.
[03:25:54.148 --> 03:25:55.209]  It's total junk.
[03:25:55.209 --> 03:25:58.010]  And even Senator McCain, I must admit, said it was junk.
[03:25:58.590 --> 03:26:02.192]  But somehow, somebody upstairs is not willing to stop it.
[03:26:02.192 --> 03:26:05.174]  And that's where Trump comes in, in terms of personality.
[03:26:05.174 --> 03:26:05.995]  Obama can't do it.
[03:26:05.995 --> 03:26:09.056]  Well, that's why Trump is, in the final equation, good.
[03:26:09.056 --> 03:26:10.858]  The globalists have a mess of their madness.
[03:26:10.858 --> 03:26:12.599]  They want to sabotage the U.S.
[03:26:12.599 --> 03:26:14.460]  down the road for this global government.
[03:26:14.460 --> 03:26:16.561]  They're setting us up for a fall.
[03:26:16.561 --> 03:26:18.062]  We do not want to go along with it.
[03:26:19.505 --> 03:26:22.106]  Remember, what we need is an individual.
[03:26:22.106 --> 03:26:26.948]  Our country doesn't run in a collective, although that's what's been happening, collective decisions.
[03:26:26.948 --> 03:26:38.492]  But you see what happened in the soft coup, and it often happens that usually one or two of the individuals break out and change the narrative because they say, we can't let that continue with the old narrative.
[03:26:38.932 --> 03:26:41.955]  So Dempsey said, no, we're not going to confront the president.
[03:26:41.955 --> 03:26:43.276]  That was very smart.
[03:26:43.276 --> 03:26:45.958]  He saw what McChrystal did and it didn't help him.
[03:26:45.958 --> 03:26:47.559]  So McChrystal had to leave.
[03:26:47.559 --> 03:26:58.167]  So Dempsey went in and instead worked with the Israelis and the Russians to bring in lousy equipment and using Turkish equipment.
[03:26:58.167 --> 03:27:04.452]  So he used his brain and he's a very creative way of defying the community.
[03:27:04.452 --> 03:27:06.594]  Now, that's what we have in America.
[03:27:07.214 --> 03:27:18.904]  Our ability to be creative, to think out of the box, and to be really ingenious and at the same time entrepreneurial makes us very, very special and exceptional.
[03:27:18.904 --> 03:27:22.587]  Not because we stand for this or that, it's because we are this or that.
[03:27:22.987 --> 03:27:24.269]  We are unusual.
[03:27:24.269 --> 03:27:26.571]  We are a Judeo-Christian country.
[03:27:26.571 --> 03:27:29.574]  We are able to build a business in 36 hours.
[03:27:29.574 --> 03:27:41.126]  We are able to have property that can't be taken away from me in France or in Bulgaria or in South Africa as I had property taken away from me by Mbiki and the ANC.
[03:27:41.126 --> 03:27:42.888]  I mean, I've been through these experiences.
[03:27:43.388 --> 03:27:43.848]  We're good to go.
[03:28:00.060 --> 03:28:00.561]  Exactly.
[03:28:00.561 --> 03:28:02.302]  That is the basis of America.
[03:28:02.302 --> 03:28:04.945]  We have to decrease the size of the government.
[03:28:04.945 --> 03:28:07.307]  We need somebody who can clean it out.
[03:28:07.307 --> 03:28:09.048]  Things that I used to do in the old days.
[03:28:09.048 --> 03:28:12.171]  In other words, clean out this administration, that administration.
[03:28:12.171 --> 03:28:14.013]  And a man like Trump can do it.
[03:28:14.013 --> 03:28:16.255]  Someone else on the spectrum can't.
[03:28:16.255 --> 03:28:17.616]  I don't see anyone else who can.
[03:28:20.542 --> 03:28:22.043]  The others just don't get it.
[03:28:22.043 --> 03:28:24.004]  They care too much about the mainstream media.
[03:28:24.004 --> 03:28:24.444]  They don't get it.
[03:28:24.444 --> 03:28:26.525]  It's all about getting in the mainstream media's face.
[03:28:26.525 --> 03:28:29.226]  Dr. Pchenik, have a great New Year coming up.
[03:28:29.226 --> 03:28:30.547]  Look forward to speaking to you again.
[03:28:30.547 --> 03:28:33.228]  Thank you for spending 15 years with us here on air.
[03:28:33.228 --> 03:28:34.488]  And bless your audience.
[03:28:34.488 --> 03:28:37.129]  Thank you so much, Alex, for what you've done for America.
[03:28:37.129 --> 03:28:38.050]  Oh, no.
[03:28:38.050 --> 03:28:39.951]  I did it for America and my family, just like you did.
[03:28:39.951 --> 03:28:41.671]  And I'm not going to be run by bullies.
[03:28:41.671 --> 03:28:42.932]  God bless you.
[03:28:42.932 --> 03:28:44.753]  Again, people like that always thanking me.
[03:28:44.753 --> 03:28:46.073]  I thank Dr. Pchenik.
[03:28:46.073 --> 03:28:48.054]  I mean, but I don't want to be thanked.
[03:28:48.054 --> 03:28:49.235]  I mean, I'm not going to be a slave.
[03:28:49.995 --> 03:28:51.817]  I see people coming in with mafia government.
[03:28:51.817 --> 03:28:53.680]  I'm going to fight them.
[03:28:53.680 --> 03:28:55.181]  And that's the bottom line.
[03:28:55.181 --> 03:28:56.663]  And it doesn't mean we have all the answers.
[03:28:56.663 --> 03:28:58.225]  It doesn't mean we're perfect.
[03:28:58.225 --> 03:29:00.968]  But we are rooting for this country.
[03:29:00.968 --> 03:29:02.630]  We're rooting for the average person.
[03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:04.092]  And that's why we're under attack.
[03:29:04.092 --> 03:29:05.394]  And again, I don't cry about that.
[03:29:06.380 --> 03:29:07.721]  I expect to be attacked.
[03:29:07.721 --> 03:29:10.263]  And I didn't even plug products last hour.
[03:29:10.263 --> 03:29:12.264]  Buy the stuff at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:12.264 --> 03:29:13.245]  It's excellent.

[03:29:18.669 --> 03:29:20.410]  Buy the X2.

[03:29:21.131 --> 03:29:22.231]  See what it does for you.
[03:29:22.231 --> 03:29:24.493]  David Knight, thank you for letting me jump into your hour.
[03:29:24.493 --> 03:29:27.635]  Be out of this hour so you guys could host it, but sometimes I jump in, obviously.
[03:29:27.635 --> 03:29:29.597]  You're going to come back and cover a lot of key stuff.
[03:29:29.597 --> 03:29:30.177]  Take us out.
[03:29:30.177 --> 03:29:31.198]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[03:29:31.789 --> 03:29:32.269]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:40.814]  When we come back, we're going to talk about the pushback against the Virginia Attorney General who wants to strip people from other states of their concealed carry rights.
[03:29:40.814 --> 03:29:44.776]  And we're going to talk about the interview I had last night with Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[03:29:44.776 --> 03:29:47.757]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:47.757 --> 03:29:49.158]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.158 --> 03:29:51.679]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.679 --> 03:29:54.381]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.852 --> 03:30:07.998]  Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe Show to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State.
[03:30:07.998 --> 03:30:19.425]  Coons said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force, Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against IS.
[03:30:19.425 --> 03:30:19.925]  The U.S.
[03:30:19.925 --> 03:30:25.449]  has spent more than $5 billion on the war against IS since August 2014.
[03:30:25.449 --> 03:30:27.650]  The cost is expected to rise considerably
[03:30:27.870 --> 03:30:32.653]  Now that the Obama Administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the group.
[03:30:32.653 --> 03:30:39.017]  Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[03:30:39.017 --> 03:30:51.385]  On Monday, Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's had really minimal impact on ISIS.
[03:30:51.385 --> 03:30:55.027]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:58.368 --> 03:31:04.573]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[03:31:04.573 --> 03:31:07.775]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:31:07.775 --> 03:31:16.922]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:31:16.922 --> 03:31:19.104]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support
[03:31:19.124 --> 03:31:19.404]  We're good.
[03:31:39.392 --> 03:31:41.814]  Don't throw those gift cards away.
[03:31:41.814 --> 03:31:50.220]  Use that money to get high quality products and save 15% in the process, all the while funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[03:31:50.220 --> 03:31:51.601]  That's a 360 win.
[03:31:51.601 --> 03:31:53.463]  Don't donate your money to the banksters.

[03:33:10.727 --> 03:33:13.089]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.289 --> 03:33:17.629]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.629 --> 03:33:22.091]  I'm David Knight, your host for this final hour of the four-hour broadcast.
[03:33:22.091 --> 03:33:24.392]  We're going to talk about what's going on with Virginia.
[03:33:24.392 --> 03:33:33.314]  We've got the governor, Terry McAuliffe, whose qualification was being a campaign manager for the Clintons.
[03:33:33.314 --> 03:33:35.595]  That's what got him in as Democrat governor.
[03:33:35.595 --> 03:33:38.776]  And, of course, his sidekick, Attorney General Haring.
[03:33:39.636 --> 03:33:40.677]  Mark R. Herring.
[03:33:40.677 --> 03:33:42.879]  I suggest we start calling him Red Herring.
[03:33:42.879 --> 03:33:46.721]  Revoking 25 states' concealed carry permits.
[03:33:46.721 --> 03:33:49.463]  Just saying we're not going to recognize those from these other states now.
[03:33:49.463 --> 03:33:53.646]  That's definitely a political move, but there's going to be a pushback against this.
[03:33:53.646 --> 03:33:56.668]  I'm going to tell you what we learned last night from Larry Pratt.
[03:33:56.668 --> 03:33:59.270]  We had an interview with him on the nightly news.
[03:33:59.270 --> 03:34:00.590]  Larry Pratt, of course, is the
[03:34:01.731 --> 03:34:10.478]  A head of Gun Owners of America, a tireless worker, not only for our Second Amendment rights, but really for individual liberty in general.
[03:34:10.478 --> 03:34:13.180]  And we're going to talk about the many different aspects of that.
[03:34:13.180 --> 03:34:17.004]  Also a story about the EPA gives Americans 129 years of jail time.
[03:34:20.126 --> 03:34:21.167]  Imagine that.
[03:34:21.167 --> 03:34:30.553]  So we have these bureaucracies that not only write the laws and have their own police organizations, they have their own courts and they're sending people to jail.
[03:34:30.553 --> 03:34:34.015]  That's how out of control the central government is.
[03:34:34.015 --> 03:34:35.657]  So we're going to talk about both aspects of that.
[03:34:36.317 --> 03:34:40.361]  We're also going to talk about the 125th anniversary of Wounded Knee.
[03:34:40.361 --> 03:34:49.630]  That has lessons that go far beyond the conflict between the federal government and the Indians, or the white man and the Indians, however you want to look at this.
[03:34:49.630 --> 03:34:54.174]  I'm going to break that down for you because you need to see beyond the typical
[03:34:55.263 --> 03:34:58.725]  A dialogue of racism, even of genocide.
[03:34:58.725 --> 03:35:01.867]  No, this is really more about democide.
[03:35:01.867 --> 03:35:03.028]  Death by government.
[03:35:03.028 --> 03:35:14.435]  We know that our governments, not only in our country, but in every country in the world, governments kill more of their own people than in any other form of warfare or anything else.
[03:35:14.435 --> 03:35:15.996]  So we're going to talk about that as well.
[03:35:15.996 --> 03:35:22.540]  Let's go first to this, before we do it, let's talk about, because Alex hasn't been doing a lot of plugs here with everything that's been going on.
[03:35:23.180 --> 03:35:26.681]  I mentioned that we had Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America on last night on the Nightly News.
[03:35:26.681 --> 03:35:31.423]  We talked about this move against guns by the Virginia Democrats.
[03:35:31.423 --> 03:35:39.126]  If you want to catch the Nightly News each night, one way that you can do that and support our operation is to get a Prison Planet TV membership.
[03:35:39.126 --> 03:35:42.907]  Every year, at this time of year, we offer a sale.

[03:35:45.308 --> 03:35:46.168]  That's a big discount.
[03:35:46.588 --> 03:35:50.510]  This year we've extended it to six months for free when you get an annual membership.
[03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:54.232]  That's just 10 cents a day when you get a one-year membership.

[03:36:14.661 --> 03:36:17.043]  He calls it a Radio Ad Gift Card.

[03:36:40.339 --> 03:36:41.680]  Now, what's going on in Virginia?
[03:36:41.680 --> 03:36:47.703]  This is an amazing movement by the Attorney General, and of course it's tied to Terry McAuliffe.
[03:36:47.703 --> 03:36:51.526]  But listen to the way the Virginia Republicans are pushing back on this.
[03:36:51.526 --> 03:36:57.970]  We have state legislators saying that they are going to remove the protective detail of the Democrat governor.
[03:36:58.666 --> 03:36:59.447]  How about that?
[03:36:59.447 --> 03:37:07.393]  You know, we've talked many times about how all these people who are pushing for gun control are typically surrounded by bodyguards.
[03:37:07.393 --> 03:37:10.936]  And if they're a politician, they're surrounded by an army of bodyguards.
[03:37:10.936 --> 03:37:15.440]  And so the Virginia Republicans, this is the perfect response to this.
[03:37:15.440 --> 03:37:17.142]  Virginia Republicans have said, OK.
[03:37:17.742 --> 03:37:22.266]  You're going to take away our ability to protect ourselves with concealed carry?
[03:37:22.266 --> 03:37:24.949]  How about we remove your protective detail?
[03:37:24.949 --> 03:37:31.676]  And they said, well, if you're so afraid of guns, I don't want to stress you by having you surrounded by men who are carrying guns.
[03:37:31.676 --> 03:37:32.636]  So let's just remove that.
[03:37:32.636 --> 03:37:34.779]  And this is from a senator.
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:35.800]  And
[03:37:55.716 --> 03:38:00.200]  Uh, the concealed carry permits from people that are out of state that have typically been recognized.
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:06.145]  He says, I have a budget amendment that I'm looking at to take away his executive protection unit.
[03:38:06.145 --> 03:38:10.969]  If he's so afraid of guns, I'm not going to surround him with armed state policemen.
[03:38:10.969 --> 03:38:11.689]  Perfect.
[03:38:11.689 --> 03:38:16.573]  Now, when I was talking to Larry Pratt last night, I talked to him and you should watch this interview.
[03:38:16.573 --> 03:38:21.057]  Uh, we talked about a couple of different, uh, legal issues that they were involved in.
[03:38:21.057 --> 03:38:24.220]  Of course, they are a part of a, uh, a, um,
[03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:32.125]  A lawsuit that is pushing to stop people having their rights taken away by the Star Chamber process.
[03:38:32.125 --> 03:38:34.027]  You know, they anonymously accuse you.
[03:38:34.027 --> 03:38:35.508]  You don't even know that you're accused.
[03:38:35.508 --> 03:38:39.871]  They don't know that you've been put on a terror watch list or a no-fly list.
[03:38:39.871 --> 03:38:45.034]  And then based on that accusation, depriving you of fundamental rights.
[03:38:45.034 --> 03:38:46.576]  Things like being able to buy a gun.
[03:38:47.296 --> 03:38:50.617]  So, that is not the way we're going to move forward in this country.
[03:38:50.617 --> 03:38:52.118]  We're not going to allow that to happen.
[03:38:52.118 --> 03:39:14.706]  We're not going to allow them to revoke the Magna Carta, to revoke the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, and invoke a kind of secret star chamber that can accuse people anonymously, convict you, and punish you, all in secret, without you having a chance to have a public trial, to confront your accusers, to call witnesses in your defense, to have an attorney for your defense, all of that.
[03:39:15.146 --> 03:39:25.112]  Is being stripped by this and people who are supporting gun control, this type of gun control, liberals who are supporting this need to understand just how dangerous this is.
[03:39:25.112 --> 03:39:29.214]  This is a nuclear option to destroy legal protections.
[03:39:29.214 --> 03:39:33.096]  You don't want to do this no matter how desperately you hate guns.
[03:39:33.596 --> 03:39:34.637]  Think about what you're doing.
[03:39:34.637 --> 03:39:41.824]  You're destroying everything that we have built in this country in terms of a legal framework to contain out-of-control governments.
[03:39:41.824 --> 03:39:51.494]  You're going to create not only a dictatorship with these executive orders, but if you're going to allow these secret lists and allow them to start punishing people, and of course, this is where they begin.
[03:39:51.954 --> 03:39:53.035]  They always begin this way.
[03:39:53.035 --> 03:40:04.102]  Remember, the RICO statutes were initially enacted because they said, well, we have to take away the money of people who are in organized crime because they have so much money they can hire the best lawyers and they can get off.
[03:40:04.102 --> 03:40:05.863]  People said, okay, yeah, I understand that.
[03:40:05.863 --> 03:40:10.106]  Yeah, we know this guy is a mafia guy and we want to put him in jail, so let's do that.
[03:40:10.106 --> 03:40:13.468]  Let's take away his money before he is convicted.
[03:40:13.468 --> 03:40:14.849]  Okay?
[03:40:14.849 --> 03:40:16.531]  What did we get from that?
[03:40:16.531 --> 03:40:18.052]  Well, a number of things came from that.
[03:40:18.942 --> 03:40:22.164]  We have civil asset forfeiture, where they don't charge you with a crime.
[03:40:22.164 --> 03:40:23.645]  They don't convict you with a crime.
[03:40:23.645 --> 03:40:31.049]  They just steal your money, saying that we think that the money or the car or the airplane or the boat were somehow involved in drugs.
[03:40:31.049 --> 03:40:32.670]  We don't have to prove anything.
[03:40:32.670 --> 03:40:34.951]  We're going to call this a civil action, not a criminal action.
[03:40:34.951 --> 03:40:36.152]  So you don't get a day in court.
[03:40:36.152 --> 03:40:38.053]  We're just going to steal that money.
[03:40:38.053 --> 03:40:44.256]  And now you've got hundreds of millions of dollars that are funding police departments who are policing for profit.
[03:40:44.256 --> 03:40:46.998]  It's turned the police departments into highway robbers.
[03:40:47.438 --> 03:40:47.598]  I don't
[03:41:09.787 --> 03:41:10.427]  We're good to go.
[03:41:29.677 --> 03:41:33.939]  But let's talk about how this is going to look, of course.
[03:41:33.939 --> 03:41:37.540]  There's one particular case in this story from the Daily Caller.
[03:41:37.540 --> 03:41:40.201]  They're talking about a city like Bristol.
[03:41:40.201 --> 03:41:42.502]  It borders Virginia and Tennessee.
[03:41:42.502 --> 03:41:45.763]  And they're saying, well, there are people in Bristol who have concealed carry permits.
[03:41:46.583 --> 03:41:54.210]  And they could become criminals simply by crossing the street because the state line runs right through that town.
[03:41:54.210 --> 03:41:56.252]  That's how insane it is.
[03:41:56.252 --> 03:42:05.620]  So last night when I was talking to Larry Pratt, I talked to him about the lawsuit they have to stop executive orders to punish people who are on these secret lists.
[03:42:05.620 --> 03:42:13.587]  I talked to him about their efforts to defund part of the Attorney General's office if he's going to pursue this kind of political vendetta.
[03:42:14.387 --> 03:42:26.794]  And we also talked about the effort to close what they call the gun show loophole, which is essentially going to outlaw all private transfers, all private sales from one individual to another.
[03:42:26.794 --> 03:42:31.337]  And Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America had a very interesting thing to say last night.
[03:42:31.337 --> 03:42:33.098]  He said, if they do that,
[03:42:33.703 --> 03:42:33.943]  I'm going
[03:42:52.668 --> 03:42:55.050]  Americans 129 years of jail time.
[03:42:55.050 --> 03:42:56.351]  This is a story from the Drudge Report.
[03:43:22.628 --> 03:43:22.828]  Yes.
[03:43:41.658 --> 03:43:43.599]  His welder, he had eight acres in Montana.
[03:43:43.599 --> 03:43:44.799]  He's still fighting the EPA.
[03:43:44.799 --> 03:43:48.020]  They came after him on his eight acres.
[03:43:48.020 --> 03:43:50.001]  They excavated out a small area.
[03:43:50.001 --> 03:43:54.723]  They built a pond for their livestock, for their kids to swim in.
[03:43:54.723 --> 03:43:59.625]  And he got all the state and local permits, followed all the rules, but then the EPA came in and said no.
[03:44:00.365 --> 03:44:05.688]  That's a violation of our particular laws that we have created.
[03:44:05.688 --> 03:44:11.711]  They call them laws or regulations, but yeah, our Congress has abdicated its authority to pass laws.
[03:44:11.711 --> 03:44:15.013]  They came after him and they punished him with $37,000 a day fines.
[03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:21.773]  So it's now accumulated to millions of dollars.
[03:44:21.773 --> 03:44:25.976]  Because he built a pond, he excavated a small pond on his eight acres.
[03:44:25.976 --> 03:44:28.318]  This water does not go off of his property.
[03:44:28.318 --> 03:44:30.780]  It does not affect anything in the environment.
[03:44:30.780 --> 03:44:34.483]  This is a power grab by an out-of-control agency.
[03:44:34.483 --> 03:44:36.545]  But it's not just the EPA.
[03:44:36.545 --> 03:44:38.226]  It's not just the FAA.
[03:44:38.226 --> 03:44:40.588]  It's not just the FCC.
[03:44:40.588 --> 03:44:45.112]  All of these agencies are acting as bureaucratic fiefdoms.
[03:44:46.124 --> 03:44:54.475]  They are the lawmakers, they are the police, and the courts, and now the jailers of people.
[03:44:54.475 --> 03:44:56.457]  And it doesn't matter what the Constitution says.
[03:44:56.457 --> 03:45:02.404]  I mean, don't you think that $37,000 a day fine for something that small, even if it were a violation?
[03:45:03.726 --> 03:45:10.289]  We have the Constitution that says that you're not going to give excessive fines, but of course they say these are civil fines.
[03:45:10.289 --> 03:45:23.915]  How about the FAA coming out and saying, as of December 21st, if you don't register your half-pound drone with the FAA, your half-pound drone and up with the FAA, they will get a civil fine.
[03:45:23.915 --> 03:45:25.116]  That's the magic word.
[03:45:25.116 --> 03:45:26.156]  They can say civil.
[03:45:26.156 --> 03:45:31.699]  They sprinkle those little letters over it and that allows them to, in their mind, come after you
[03:45:32.759 --> 03:45:35.180]  Without any due process, by not calling it criminal.
[03:45:35.180 --> 03:45:43.843]  Say we're going to fine you $27,000, $27,500 exactly, just because you didn't register it with us.
[03:45:43.843 --> 03:45:45.524]  Not because you're doing anything criminal with it.
[03:45:45.524 --> 03:45:48.365]  They have a different scale for that.
[03:45:48.365 --> 03:45:50.946]  $250,000 max if it's criminal and three years.
[03:45:50.946 --> 03:45:52.687]  Okay, so that would be a trial.
[03:45:52.687 --> 03:45:58.209]  That would be like if you intentionally flew your drones into an airport space at an airplane or something.
[03:45:58.209 --> 03:45:58.969]  That would be criminal.
[03:45:58.969 --> 03:46:00.030]  I have no problem with that.
[03:46:01.191 --> 03:46:06.095]  Maybe those fines are excessive, but that would be something for a jury and a judge to decide.
[03:46:06.095 --> 03:46:19.145]  But when they come after you for simply not registering your half-pound drone and say, we're going to fine you $27,500, that is excessive, that is criminal action, and that is the way that our government is operating.
[03:46:19.145 --> 03:46:23.849]  All these bureaucracies are operating that way, whether it's the BATF, whether it's the FCC, FAA.
[03:46:23.849 --> 03:46:26.111]  The FCC comes and says, we're going to control the Internet.
[03:46:26.724 --> 03:46:32.850]  And then a group of judges says, well, you know, you don't really have any authority to control content.
[03:46:32.850 --> 03:46:37.956]  You really just were given authority to allocate bandwidth and control things like utilities.
[03:46:37.956 --> 03:46:44.903]  And so then the FCC comes back and has a little meeting and says, we have just pronounced the Internet to be a utility.
[03:46:44.903 --> 03:46:47.465]  And then the judges say, oh, OK, now you can regulate it.
[03:46:48.286 --> 03:46:55.011]  That's the kind of criminal fantasy land that these people in Washington have created.
[03:46:55.011 --> 03:47:05.379]  And when you look at what they're doing, this is what's really brilliant about the Daily Caller angle on this, they contrast them locking people up for these excessive amount of times, they contrast that
[03:47:05.959 --> 03:47:12.722]  With the criminal, criminal involvement and the massive scale of what happened with this gold mine that they blew up.
[03:47:12.722 --> 03:47:14.903]  The Gold King Mine.
[03:47:14.903 --> 03:47:22.447]  And that mine, it polluted rivers from Colorado through New Mexico and Utah.
[03:47:22.447 --> 03:47:23.808]  A toxic plume.
[03:47:23.808 --> 03:47:25.308]  It is still not cleaned up.
[03:47:25.308 --> 03:47:27.329]  It went through the Navajo Nation territory.
[03:47:27.329 --> 03:47:30.091]  It resulted in farms having their water supplies turned off.
[03:47:30.931 --> 03:47:35.295]  This was something that was predicted in an op-ed piece.
[03:47:35.295 --> 03:47:38.557]  I think it was either a week or a month before this happened.
[03:47:38.557 --> 03:47:39.578]  I'm just going off of memory.
[03:47:39.578 --> 03:47:43.781]  It was a retired miner who predicted this exact thing was going to happen.
[03:47:43.781 --> 03:47:49.005]  And he actually predicted that the EPA would use this as a kind of false flag.
[03:47:49.005 --> 03:47:50.587]  He says, you're going to create a problem.
[03:47:51.047 --> 03:47:54.910]  And then you're going to come in and say, we need more EPA regulations.
[03:47:54.910 --> 03:47:57.773]  We need to create this other project that we had in mind.
[03:47:57.773 --> 03:47:59.955]  He said that's why they're going to do it.
[03:47:59.955 --> 03:48:11.164]  And of course, the Department of Interior reviewed this spill incident, said the EPA could have avoided blowout if it had taken precautions that agency workers had used while opening other sealed mines in Colorado.
[03:48:11.164 --> 03:48:11.565]  Exactly.
[03:48:12.276 --> 03:48:13.598]  It wasn't a mystery.
[03:48:13.598 --> 03:48:19.745]  And yet, what have they done about this massive, massive piece of pollution?
[03:48:19.745 --> 03:48:21.227]  They haven't fined anybody.
[03:48:21.227 --> 03:48:23.350]  Nobody has lost their jobs.
[03:48:23.350 --> 03:48:26.033]  They didn't send any EPA employees to jail.
[03:48:26.033 --> 03:48:26.373]  Nothing.
[03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:28.311]  Nothing.
[03:48:28.311 --> 03:48:29.112]  Crickets.
[03:48:29.112 --> 03:48:29.812]  That's what's going on.
[03:48:29.812 --> 03:48:30.853]  You want to hear what they did?
[03:48:30.853 --> 03:48:32.855]  It's just total silence.
[03:48:32.855 --> 03:48:34.857]  Absolute silence.
[03:48:34.857 --> 03:48:52.572]  So, if you create a minor fault, they'll send you to jail, they'll fine you $37,000 a day, but if they create a toxic event that pollutes the water through three states, nothing happens to their employees.
[03:48:52.572 --> 03:48:53.913]  Now, I want to talk about the
[03:48:55.128 --> 03:48:59.335]  Today is the 125th anniversary of what happened at Wounded Knee in 1890.
[03:49:05.330 --> 03:49:08.391]  Maybe you know and maybe you don't know the history of this.
[03:49:08.391 --> 03:49:09.551]  I didn't know it.
[03:49:09.551 --> 03:49:11.571]  It isn't really talked about much in American history.
[03:49:11.571 --> 03:49:13.271]  They pretty much ignore it.
[03:49:13.271 --> 03:49:15.072]  We've had some documentaries done about it.
[03:49:15.072 --> 03:49:18.332]  I kind of learned about it because of the actions of Russell Means.
[03:49:18.332 --> 03:49:25.514]  My path has kind of almost crossed Russell Means, but I was always a little bit late to catch him.
[03:49:25.514 --> 03:49:33.455]  I know that four years before I got involved in the Libertarian Party, Russell Means was there with Ron Paul, almost got the nomination to run for president.
[03:49:34.059 --> 03:49:35.019]  The United States.
[03:49:35.019 --> 03:49:39.120]  I remember back in the 1970s the demonstrations that were at Wounded Knee.
[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:43.521]  I didn't really understand what that was about until many years later.
[03:49:43.521 --> 03:49:45.342]  There are books that have been written about it.
[03:49:45.342 --> 03:49:46.742]  Wounded Knee Part 2.
[03:49:46.742 --> 03:49:50.003]  There were some films that were done by director Michael Apted.
[03:49:50.003 --> 03:49:53.064]  He did a documentary about it called Incident at Oglala.
[03:49:53.604 --> 03:50:02.387]  He also did a dramatic movie about what happened at Wounded Knee Part 2, and that was called Thunderheart, that had Val Kilmer in it.
[03:50:02.387 --> 03:50:16.211]  But let's go back to what happened originally, and then we'll kind of tie this up with some of the things that Russell Means pointed out that we could all learn, because this is not simply a case of the white man versus the Indian.
[03:50:17.268 --> 03:50:21.349]  We need to understand that's the way they always sell these things to us.
[03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:30.252]  This is something you need to understand that the government did to these people, that our government did to these people, something that our government will do to us if we're not careful.
[03:50:30.252 --> 03:50:37.474]  And I'm going to break down some of the incidents that happened there as well as the parallels for white men in America.
[03:50:37.474 --> 03:50:40.755]  You know, Russell Means wrote a book, he called it, Where White Men Fear to Tread.
[03:50:41.235 --> 03:50:49.290]  He said the American government has broken every treaty with the Indians and white men, they're breaking that treaty they made with you called the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[03:50:49.290 --> 03:50:49.871]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:59.338 --> 03:51:08.065]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:08.065 --> 03:51:09.546]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.546 --> 03:51:17.473]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:52:15.869 --> 03:52:21.333]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:52:21.493 --> 03:52:31.503]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.

[03:54:09.435 --> 03:54:17.061]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and in this last segment I want to talk about the 125th anniversary of Wounded Knee.
[03:54:17.061 --> 03:54:20.424]  I think it has a lot of lessons for all of us about our government.
[03:54:20.424 --> 03:54:23.347]  On December 29, 1890, the U.S.
[03:54:23.347 --> 03:54:28.491]  Army's 7th Cavalry surrounded a band of ghost dancers near Wounded Knee Creek.
[03:54:29.574 --> 03:54:33.219]  Understand they're having a religious ceremony there, okay?
[03:54:33.219 --> 03:54:37.244]  Now, when the soldiers surround them, demand that they stop.
[03:54:37.244 --> 03:54:40.068]  Demand that they surrender their weapons, okay?
[03:54:40.068 --> 03:54:40.509]  There we go.
[03:54:40.509 --> 03:54:42.331]  It's not gun confiscation.
[03:54:42.331 --> 03:54:43.973]  I'm sure they didn't have guns at that point.
[03:54:44.594 --> 03:54:47.195]  But they told them also they're going to be relocated to another camp.
[03:54:47.195 --> 03:54:49.095]  They're acting very provocatively.
[03:54:49.095 --> 03:54:55.337]  We see this all the time with our government, with the way the police confront people who are exercising their right to protest as well.
[03:54:55.337 --> 03:54:57.837]  So they come up in a very provocative manner.
[03:54:57.837 --> 03:55:02.799]  A fight begins between a soldier and a deaf Indian named Black Coyote.
[03:55:02.799 --> 03:55:03.659]  A shot was fired.
[03:55:03.659 --> 03:55:06.480]  It's not clear who fired the shot or exactly what happened with it.
[03:55:08.573 --> 03:55:12.155]  At that point, the soldiers began shooting.
[03:55:12.155 --> 03:55:15.296]  They included firing cannon shots there.
[03:55:15.296 --> 03:55:20.398]  That's what makes many people believe that this wasn't just something that spontaneously occurred.
[03:55:20.398 --> 03:55:23.039]  Understand the 7th Cavalry, of course.
[03:55:23.039 --> 03:55:29.802]  This is the group that was involved in a massacre under General Custer about 13 years earlier.
[03:55:31.543 --> 03:55:34.124]  And of course, this was the same organization.
[03:55:34.124 --> 03:55:36.805]  A lot of these people who were there would know about that.
[03:55:36.805 --> 03:55:40.186]  Was there some revenge as part of this?
[03:55:40.186 --> 03:55:47.808]  Of course, Crazy Horse, who had defeated Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn, he had his heart buried at Wounded Knee.
[03:55:47.808 --> 03:55:52.550]  So there was a lot of connections between the biggest defeat of the American Army,
[03:55:53.582 --> 03:56:00.146]  against the uh... indians as they fought them and this final battle this is the last time there was a battle between of the u.s.
[03:56:00.146 --> 03:56:04.529]  government and the indians so they began uh... shooting at unarmed people
[03:56:05.168 --> 03:56:07.330]  Men, women, and children.
[03:56:07.330 --> 03:56:09.152]  They killed 300 Indians.
[03:56:09.152 --> 03:56:11.294]  They used not only guns, but cannons.
[03:56:11.294 --> 03:56:13.276]  Now, let me read you some of the eyewitness accounts.
[03:56:13.276 --> 03:56:18.241]  This is an 1891 Commission of Indian Affairs, where they had testimony.
[03:56:18.241 --> 03:56:20.223]  This is part of the historical record.
[03:56:20.223 --> 03:56:24.047]  Right near the flag of Truce, a mother was shot down with her infant.
[03:56:24.047 --> 03:56:26.830]  The child, not knowing that its mother was dead, was still nursing.
[03:56:27.310 --> 03:56:29.891]  That is especially very sad sight, said the witness.
[03:56:29.891 --> 03:56:34.032]  The women, as they were fleeing with their babies, were killed together.
[03:56:34.032 --> 03:56:35.293]  Shot right through.
[03:56:35.293 --> 03:56:38.994]  The women, who were very heavy with child, were also killed.
[03:56:38.994 --> 03:56:41.455]  A woman who survived lost her daughter, her baby boy.
[03:56:42.483 --> 03:56:49.707]  According to one account, a shot passed through her baby's body and hit her elbow, causing him to drop to the ground.
[03:56:49.707 --> 03:56:52.748]  She was also hit twice in the back.
[03:56:52.748 --> 03:57:05.574]  When I read these accounts, it reminded me of Randy Weaver's wife, who was shot dead while she was holding a baby by an FBI sniper named Lon Horiuchi.
[03:57:05.574 --> 03:57:10.457]  Lon Horiuchi was given a medal for that murder, that cold-blooded murder.
[03:57:11.793 --> 03:57:15.316]  And, of course, the people who were involved in this, many of them got medals as well.
[03:57:15.316 --> 03:57:15.676]  The U.S.
[03:57:15.676 --> 03:57:17.577]  Army suffered 25 casualties.
[03:57:17.577 --> 03:57:22.140]  20 members were awarded the Army's Medal of Honor, its highest commendation.
[03:57:22.140 --> 03:57:25.303]  And here's an interesting statistic.
[03:57:25.303 --> 03:57:26.584]  More U.S.
[03:57:26.584 --> 03:57:40.714]  Cavalry soldiers, more soldiers of the Army, received the Medal of Honor from what they did at Wounded Knee, killing unarmed civilians, for the most part, than the 64,000 South Dakotans who fought for four years in World War II.
[03:57:41.906 --> 03:57:43.448]  How's that for perspective?
[03:57:43.448 --> 03:57:53.479]  So you got 64,000 people in South Dakota who fought for four years during World War II, and there were fewer medals given out than were given out for this massacre.
[03:57:53.479 --> 03:57:58.144]  See, that was nothing but a race war.
[03:57:58.144 --> 03:58:00.907]  But understand that even though it was a policy of genocide,
[03:58:01.957 --> 03:58:05.241]  Understand, this is really our government coming after us.
[03:58:05.241 --> 03:58:12.168]  And understand that what they did to the Indians in terms of the reservations was far worse than this massacre.
[03:58:12.168 --> 03:58:14.250]  The reservations are like our welfare state.
[03:58:14.250 --> 03:58:16.753]  Their treaties are like our Constitution, destroyed.
[03:58:17.533 --> 03:58:25.204]  And the most dangerous thing that they did to them, the most damaging thing that they did to the Indians, was to ship their children off to school.
[03:58:25.204 --> 03:58:26.465]  That's how they destroy you.
[03:58:26.465 --> 03:58:27.967]  They come after the schools.
[03:58:27.967 --> 03:58:32.834]  That's what we were talking about with Fatala Gulen, and we're going to continue to expose that.
[03:58:32.834 --> 03:58:34.656]  Join us tonight for the Infowars Nightly News.
