[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.800]   He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.160]   And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.520]   and different accounts today.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.160]   We'll tell you about the hack attack when we come back after this special report.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.320]   It's ongoing right now.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.640]   >> The ghetto, not the place you would imagine methods of global dominance

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.800]   But it was in the ghettos across the United States that Saul Alinsky
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.080]   would fine tune tactics of civil disobedience that would one day be
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.920]   employed by New World Order puppet, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.920]   >> Resolutions of ideal problems always carry with them in their wake
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.080]   another problem.

[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.480]   Chock full of creeping tactics used by scheming politicians and
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.600]   sorrows fueled millennial generation groups like Black Lives Matter.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.480]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.200]   >> Hell bent on tearing the fabric of American society apart.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.240]   >> Anti-cop rhetoric that is sweeping the United States of America,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.160]   fueled by this group.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.560]   Some of the vulgar, vile, vicious rhetoric that's coming out,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.200]   talking about killing cops.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.920]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.360]   >> Alinsky's, albeit deceptively noble,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.920]   attempt to create a system to reward the have-nots with the power and
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.360]   surplus of the haves, would prove to be just as useful for
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.320]   the New World Order sycophants to achieve an uprooting of American values.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.240]   And an overpass of the United States Constitutional Foundation to be
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.360]   replaced by totalitarianism disguised as compassionate socialism.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.480]   These tactics simply needed the perfect charismatic turncoat to steer them.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.400]   Enter Barack Obama.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.280]   >> All of us want to give our president every tool necessary to do this.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   And all of us were willing to do that in this bill.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280]   And anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.200]   >> Saul Alinsky died decades before a young pre-Senate Barack Obama
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   would spend three years following in Alinsky's footsteps as a community organizer.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.400]   In 2009, the National Review stated Obama's mentors from his Chicago days
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.200]   studied at a school Alinsky founded.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.760]   And they taught their students the philosophy and
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.440]   methods of one of the first community organizers.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.400]   Saul Alinsky wrote in Rules for Radicals,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.280]   as an organizer I start from where the world is, as it is.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.240]   Not as I would like it to be.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.000]   That we accept the world as it is doesn't in any sense weaken our desire to
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.480]   change it into what we believe it should be.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.880]   It is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going to change it to what we
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.600]   think it should be.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.680]   That means working in the system.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.480]   So what are some of the tactics being utilized in that system at
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.960]   accelerating degrees in the shaping of modern American society?
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.640]   Rule number one, power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.160]   Obama and the nut jobs in the nation's capital would have us all believe that
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   they have overwhelming support from the have-nots.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.440]   While destroying the middle class, increasing the debt and
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.160]   welfare class to unsustainable levels, and projecting it all from their mainstream
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.200]   media bubble.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.240]   Rule number two, never go outside the expertise of your people.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.720]   Basically, why bother engaging in a rational debate based on facts with
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.880]   your adversary?
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.600]   Simply bring up the despised policies or traditions and
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   belittle them until they are crushed.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.680]   Less than loving expressions by Christians?
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   >> No.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   >> I get concerned.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.640]   >> That's right, let's criticize Christianity on Easter, you piece of crap.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.040]   >> That's a topic for another day.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.640]   >> Skipping to rule number eight, keep the pressure on, never let up.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.560]   Obama must say this rule to himself every morning.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.520]   As one shoe drops, another one is ready to fall.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.680]   Not in the manner of a leader responding to a country's pleas in the midst of
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.640]   a crisis, but more in the vein of a tyrant quietly and charismatically creating them.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.160]   While offering shallow direction as stale as his predecessor's rhetoric.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.040]   And if just that sample of Saul Alinsky's rules for
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.680]   radicals wasn't enough, Alinsky even dedicated the left's playbook to
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.920]   Lucifer himself.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.160]   >> I suppose given a choice, I think I would pick hell.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.600]   The reason I'd pick hell is because that's where all the have-nots are.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.880]   >> John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.400]   >> We'll be back.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.120]   >> The affluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.480]   reports Reuters.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.360]   A wealthy Texas teen who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.280]   sentence for killing four people while driving drunk,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.120]   will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.040]   Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.200]   were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.960]   Couch became known in the United States as the affluenza teen
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.680]   during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.040]   When a psychologist said he was so wealthy and
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.080]   He has been serving ten years probation for intoxication manslaughter,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.720]   a sentence critics saw as far too light.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.760]   Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month,
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.480]   prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.

[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.000]   to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.360]   help children focus.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.120]   All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.680]   Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.960]   are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.840]   It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down, and
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.120]   then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.960]   Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.240]   We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.960]   we have seen record numbers of signups.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.360]   PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.

[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   Because InfoWars is under sustained attack across the board.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   From our Facebook accounts to our Twitter accounts to our passwords into InfoWars,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   to other attacks that are going on currently simultaneously.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   Definitely a large coordinated attack.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   And we are writing stories about it right now.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   About 25 minutes ago, a story went up on InfoWars.com where one of the hacks was successful.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   We had it removed within 11 minutes.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   And of course, had changed the particular passcode.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   They hacked through and got David Knight's passcode, but
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   simultaneously got Paul Watson's code to his Twitter.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   That account is currently hijacked.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   We'll put Paul Watson's Twitter account, Prison Planet, up on screen for folks
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   so they can see what's happening right now.

[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   And basically all hell's been breaking loose since that happened.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   I told Biggs I had a bad feeling about it and just to get ready.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   I'm the one that sent him out there, but I told him yesterday at 5 o'clock,
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   "Get ready. Spidersense says we got enemy fighters coming in. Watch your six."
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   There's a lot of intel coming in right now.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   I basically already put my finger on what's going on here.

[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   Probably by Russians calling themselves the Syrian Electronic Army.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   We know it was the Russian government that hacked and got the climate change emails
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   where they were coordinating with the UN and all the major professors
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   at over 1,000 colleges. It was 2,000 plus.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   How to engage in fraud, how to hide the decline, how to pass carbon taxes.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   So again, the Russians blew that wide open.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   Probably the Russians. In fact, they pretty much admitted it's Russians involved
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   in the "Syrian Electronic Army" because it deals with Syria.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   Sending out the intel that our government was funding radical al-Nusra, al-Qaeda groups
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   that became ISIS. That's now mainstream news.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   So the Russians won that info war in concert with American patriots
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   that will not engage in treason.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   Cy Hirst came out last week with a huge article and excerpts of his new book,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   Military to Military, or our own military, at the very time that I was engaging
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   in my patriotic duties just as an American to not work with al-Qaeda
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   and working with Colonel Schaeffer and many others on and off air, generals, you name it.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   I'm just going to leave it at that, retired generals.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   This is real war, folks.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   This is against the globalists that are playing all our countries off against each other.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Very high level chess.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   We knew at the time that if we could get the military informed of this, it would all implode.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Turning the Christian areas of Syria over to al-Qaeda so they could slaughter everybody
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   And so as the Syrian electronic army continued to hack CNN,
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   to hack other hundreds of publications and post Infowars.com articles,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   and you can look it up, that's who they posted mainly,
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   BBC, NPR, Skype, I mean, Facebook accounts, Twitter accounts.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   This is now the counter response to that.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   Directed out of Turkey, ISIS connected groups to go in and post this info
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   to discredit Infowars and also then blame it on the Syrian electronic army,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   which hasn't happened yet.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   But that is my belief where this is coming from and what we've expected to happen.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Breaking, here's the headline, "Cudecah in Turkey, Ergun flees to US airbase."
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   This is the hacked article that was put up by someone not in Infowars.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   And then of course I began running around 15 minutes to airtime like a chicken when my head cut off,
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   saying check every account, Facebook, Twitter, because we're distributed over a lot of different platforms
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   so that we can survive attacks.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   You whack one mole, five others pop up, you whack five of those, 15 more pop up.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   By the way, I'm going to launch a lot of new Facebooks, Twitters, other accounts because of this.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   We've only been successfully hacked two other times,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   and I always double our load balancing systems to use an old-fashioned term,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   with more media tentacles.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   And we're always adding new tentacles, new heads to the Hydra,
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   so we're just going to grow a bunch more.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   That's what we do, in fact that's when we grow.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   That's our directive to grow when we're effectively attacked.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   That's in all organisms across this planet,
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   and we follow the genetic model that God's laid down when it comes to Infowars.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   So now we're going to just expend even more capital and just get more aggressive and work even harder.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   We're going to double our output now against the enemy in the next 12 months.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   It was already pretty much planned, but I'm going to ensure that happens.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   Continue to attack.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   The more successful you are, the more successful we'll be.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   That's how this works.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   So breaking, they successfully hacked Infowars and posted a fake article that Ergun,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   the pretty much dictator, he had a staged election.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   The guy caught by the Russians buying the ISIS oil.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   The Russians have blown up thousands of their trucks.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   They're now stopped the route out of Iraq up into Turkey, up through Syria,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   and so now they're going out of Iraq into Turkey, and there are thousands of trucks lined up there.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   The Russians have exposed all that, and so Ergun is threatening to blow up Russian ships in the Mediterranean.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   He's threatening to start World War III.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   He's threatening to shoot down more aircraft.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   The Russians obviously have been pointing out that Ergun a month ago invaded Iraq with actual tank battalions.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   They actually sent ground troops in, and so it is just a full-on battle with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and NATO and others,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   fighting the Russians, the Iraqis, and the Syrians who are battling the al-Qaeda forces that are the proxy warriors for the West.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   This is all just spilling out into the open, and so we see these feeble—I mean, it is feeble.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   I mean, you go on, you post a fake article, like we're going to be upset by that.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   We're just going to come out and expose that you successfully did that.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   We'll just change our pass codes, increase our security.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   We've been compared to a lot of other media outlets, very successful, defeating a lot of this.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   We have a lot of great top hackers and people like Mr. Gray and others.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   We need to get back in contact with, who do routine analysis of the holes in our systems.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   There's always holes in everything, but we try to keep those holes to a minimum.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   So this is ongoing, and it's what we expect.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   It's what we expect, engaging the globalists.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   So there you see Paul Watson's account hacked.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:27.720]   It is now shut down by Twitter for now, locked down until Paul, who is in transit, visiting family in Europe.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   So as soon as he's able to, he will get the Twitter account back under his control.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   The hackers are no longer in control. Twitter has locked it down.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   Our Twitter account is locked down right now, but we're in contact with them.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   They didn't successfully take over the real Alex Jones,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   but they successfully tried to change the passcode so many times it locked out.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.720]   And by the way, these are long passcodes.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   These are not our dates of birth or our mommy's dates of birth or middle names,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   you know, the classic questions banks ask you.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   So they clearly got a breach into someone's computer that had some of the passcodes.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   Now, again, all the other financial stuff and things are walled off between triple security and run by major companies.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   So that's totally separate and not part of that.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   That's all secure and safe.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   Now, we're really going into the info war against these people.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   Kevin Booth, who's had major documentaries air on Showtime and on HBO and on other major networks,
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   documentary filmmaker, also film producer, good friend of mine.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   I've known for years, Bill Hicks producer.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:51.720]   He was already going to be in studio today, and he has a major Turkish insider who's been tracking ISIS
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   and the government working with ISIS.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   This gentleman is now in hiding and has had to flee Turkey.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   He is going to be joining us with Kevin via Skype.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   Kevin Booth will be in the in studio.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   He's back in Texas visiting family over the Christmas holiday, normally out in Los Angeles.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   So we are going to show you exclusive footage from Istanbul, Turkey, tracking ISIS and exclusively talking to eyewitnesses
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:30.720]   that actually bring people out of ISIS and basically defect them to good areas of Western intelligence that are actually working with the Syrian government.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   And that's the big bombshell.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   Our military wasn't playing both sides.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   People say, oh, they're just playing both sides.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   No, they weren't.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   They have been working from day one with the Russians and with the Syrians to not let al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia take over.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   They've been totally against it.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   They went public three years ago and said, don't be al Qaeda's air force.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   It was such a big deal.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   I told you it won't bring down the globalist overnight, but it has wounded them grievously.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   They're crippled right now, like, you know, the Bismarck German battleship twice the size of the British battleships finally had its rudder shot.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   And it was spinning in circles and it wasn't long to go into the bottom of the deep blue sea to Davy Jones's locker.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Well, this is the type of crippling blow, just like the Russians blowing climate change wide open by hacking the U.N. and the University of Cambridge and England and others.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   This this is a devastating blow, devastating.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   And we intend to continue rubbing, rubbing into the wound.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   This is just has them howling mad that the criminals that have hijacked our government have been caught running ISIS.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   They now have the Democrats out saying they want national taxes to pay for the fight against ISIS.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   But Hillary Clinton literally laid down on her back four years ago and gave birth to that baby came out of Mama.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   911. What is your emergency?

[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   Our bloated federal government and a coterie of mega corporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and mega corporations steal billions of dollars of their money.

[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.

[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   Visit us at www.contractorexam.com today.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   So to be clear, I'm going to move out of this hacking story of Infowars.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   Again, Infowars successfully hacked, but you've got to quantify success.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   The camel's nose did get under the tent flap, but we stomped on it within 11 minutes, 12 minutes of it being under the flap.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   So it ran honking and squawking off into the desert quite literally.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   But we will continue to redouble our vigilance and track exactly what's going on, obviously.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   But they were able to get into Infowars about now, about 45 minutes ago for 11 minutes.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   And they posted the article. Here it is.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   We have a screenshot of it of your TV viewer.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   Adan Salazar is writing an article on this right now.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   And you will have a screenshot in that for radio listeners in the next hour or so.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   Breaking coup d'etat in Turkey, Ergun flees to US airbase.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   President Ergun Tuesday was overthrown as a result of coup d'etat.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   And it was put out by quote David Knight, is who they claimed did it.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   So there you go. That is what they were able to do.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   They were able to hijack Paul Watson's account successfully.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   They tried to hijack our Twitter account.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   And it looks like they tried to get into everything else, but failed.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   So they had some sophisticated computer systems plugged into things trying to break through codes and things.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   They didn't just get through an admin and then use that to get into some of the other accounts.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   They were in there trying to figure out codes across a wide spectrum of different systems.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   So this is not one person.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   And they're acting like they're the electronic, the Syrian electronic army that's pro-Syrian government.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   Anti-Al Qaeda, Al-Nusra, anti-ISIS.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   So this is done, in my opinion, with a first approximation to discredit the Syrian electronic army and InfoWars.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   And again, I want to be clear. We don't engage in hacking.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   We don't engage in anything that could be considered illegal.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   We're out in the open, in the sunshine.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   It's where we fight these tyrants. It's where we choose to meet the vampires.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   We don't scurry around in the dark.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   That's why usually when I go to an investigative report or something, or I'm going to a foreign country, I say, "I'm coming to your country to do this."
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   And I tell the security services in an article addressed to them what I'm doing.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   And then they have MI5 and MI6 waiting for me at the hotel and want to have dinner and talk about what's coming up at Bilderberg.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   And I'd just rather have it that way because I'm a white knight, folks.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   I'm up here on the Green Hill on the horse with my spear.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   And I don't claim to be the toughest guy or the smartest guy around, but I know this.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   I'm going to take on tyranny.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   And I have nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of because I'm in the right.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   And if I get struck down or destroyed or set up or politically assassinated with disinformation, that's just the way the cookie crumbles, folks.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   Our ancestors fought to the nail that we have basic liberty today.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   And I'm not going to let down my family name or my ancestors.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   So I'm committed.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   So many people are scared of being demonized by the media or being physically attacked.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   You're going to lose everything if you don't stand up and act like a man.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   Don't people get that?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   And I know our listeners understand that, but the globalists miscalculated.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   They may have half the American people in a coma, roughly, is what the numbers show.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   A little more than half don't know what planet they're on.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   Liberals, conservatives, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   They're just a pack of brain-dead entertainment heads, self-propelled stomachs who basically aren't even alive, in my view.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   I'm not going to say they're animals, because at least animals are motivated by some consciousness and an agenda.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   They are spectators at their own funeral, at the death of their consciousness.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   They don't like reality.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   Anthony Guttiardi made a great point yesterday in a Facebook message that we did, that reality is viral.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   Not fake reality TV, not fake stuff they say is reality, but it isn't.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.720]   But real reality, teleprompter-free reality, that is viral.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   And that's the crossroads that we've now reached.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   And we have just seen unprecedented demonization and lies against Infowars the last few months.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   And people will pat me on the back, you know what I mean, and say, "Man, I'm really sorry, bud.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.720]   They're attacking you on local news, local radio, local paper.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   I turn on national TV, they're attacking you.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   Man, it must be rough. Must be rough that an occupied government, sworn to enslave the people, doesn't like me.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   I absolutely love it.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.720]   I came to fight.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   The only way that tyrants and evil men flourish is that good men do nothing. Thomas Jefferson.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   The enemy hates me? The enemy lies about me?
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   I love it.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   Because it means I'm effective.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   And see, if you can pick up on that paradox, other people would fall to their knees and roll around in catatonic states being demonized,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   because they don't have a strong self-image. They don't believe in anything.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   Enemies that put fluoride in our water to brain damage our kids and write books bragging about it, the White House science czar,
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   and then I'm upset if they demonize me?
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   If you're not being demonized by the enemy, folks, you're on the wrong side.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.720]   Are you looking for affordable housing? Well, check out these headlines.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development. 265 square foot apartments.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment. It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   but she's living in the West Village for just $7.75 a month.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   And here's one out of New York.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   What living in a dumpster for a year taught this professor about the things we don't need.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   All these articles have one thing in common. You are being trained and conditioned to accept less.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   We are living in a society that's going through monumental technological changes.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   We have the ability to create systems where everyone can prosper.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   But what's going on?
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   The social engineers and social controllers of the world want us to expect less while paying more.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   It's all about social control, and this is the main reason why they want it.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.720]   nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.720]   Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano formulation.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release,
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lichens.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   Read the facts at Infowarslife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   Visit Infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   [Music]
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   Fortune favors the bold.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   When I was young, I was the nicest guy I knew.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   I thought I was the chosen one.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   But time went by and I found out a thing or two.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   My shine wore off as time wore on.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   Infowars is investigating David Knight, myself, Joe Biggs, the Gulan schools that get billions of dollars of U.S. tax money.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   Their estimated wealth is between 25 and 50 plus billion dollars globally.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.720]   They're based out of Turkey.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   Their entire board is in Turkey.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   They get 500 million a year plus from Texas taxpayers.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.720]   In charter school money, and you think you're sending your kid to a regular school, it is a Islamic caliphate.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   They actually teach the caliphate.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   Then they have Rachel Maddow and everybody get up on MSNBC and say there is no caliphate.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.720]   There are no schools.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   There are no training facilities.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   Really, we just had one in Houston this weekend with our drone flying over it.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   Looks like a 5A high school.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   And Joe Biggs has got his report almost ready with all that.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   So is it connected to that?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   Or is the successful hack of Infowars to put up a fake story that the president of Turkey, Ergun, fled to a U.S. air base in a coup in Turkey because the Gulan schools are fighting with him.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   He's suing him here.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   The head of Gulan hasn't shown up to trial dates, court dates.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   There's an arrest warrant out.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   I mean, that's just the Arab world, folks.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:35:00.720]   They just fight with each other constantly, and there's no civilization because everyone is scrabbling for power constantly instead of just trying to plant crops or invent things or build things.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   And the Middle East wasn't always like that.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   So much of our science came from there, and it didn't used to be so backward.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   But it's economy via conquest or economy via innovation.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   And all economies have always been a mix of the two historically.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   But now we're shifting to an economy of conquest, and we're being conquered by the globalists.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   We think we're part of the conquering American empire.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   Global government is financial institutions with diplomatic immunity above the law that control the U.N. army known as NATO that are trying to destroy every sovereign country in the world incrementally with a soft kill economic program so they don't know what hit them.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   Russia has successfully reverse engineered how they've been taken down, how the communists were put in in 1917, how their population was reduced.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   Alexander Solzhenitsyn helped expose it.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   I helped reverse engineer it.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   I'm not bragging.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   It's a fact.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   The Russians have downloaded my info, looked at it, found it to be accurate.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   They've now moved on past that and are not going along with the new world order.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   I mean, I've always had a global show.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   It's about communicating to world leaders.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   It's about reaching out to everybody.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   It's about I don't dumb this show down for the dumbed down masses that think they're liberal because they want to ban Christmas and ban a white Christmas and ban paper bags and ban ethnic food in a college line because it's racist or they want to ban Lynch Hall because they think about lynching.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   We don't target the brain dead.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   As Christ said, let the dead bury the dead.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   Knock the dust off your feet.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   Pearls before swine.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   We're here like when I had basically was the head of their parliament, the head of the diet, the vice president of Japan on or the former head of German intelligence on or the former head of technical at the NSA on or all these other CIA whistleblowers and CIA aircraft bosses.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   And I mean, from the bottom to the top, we've had them all on.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   Terry Reid, you know, the whole dark alliance, Gary Webb story.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   I was talking to Gary Webb two weeks before he got shot twice in the head.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   I mean, I interviewed the DC madam a month before she died and she was trying to tell me stuff off air.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   I did full.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   Well, it was all tapped.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   I said, do not tell me a word about your client list in DC.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   Fans know they got a recording of it.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   I said, you say this stuff on air or nowhere because then we're covered.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   You say it and she goes, oh, don't worry.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   I've got all the info.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   They're not going to mess with me.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   And I said, look, it's known who your client list was.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:59.720]   She came on via former NSA person that got me in contact with her and they hung her in her mama's shed.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   And then I got a call from her condo manager.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   He said, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   She was getting ready to leave the country.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   They were death threatening her.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   She would have never killed herself.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.720]   That handwriting in her death note is fake.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   And he sent me a copy of her lease and notes to her that I showed on air.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   It wasn't didn't even look like the same person.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   Be like if they said I committed suicide and it was written in Chinese, I don't I don't write or speak Chinese, folks, or Hebrew, you know, maybe Yiddish.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:37.720]   And I'm not trying to freak people out.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   I want, you know, the real world I live in.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   You don't watch these James Bond movies over here.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   That's all fantasy land, folks.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   The real war is going on right now.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   It's in the supermarket line with the GMO food.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   It's in the high fructose corn syrup.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   It's in the aspartame.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   It's in the GMO garbage.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.720]   It's in the MSG.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   And they think you're so dumb.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   They've written white papers and books galore just admitting the whole stinking thing.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   But we just talked to our IT people.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   I'm going to shift gears and other news.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   And they said very sophisticated.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   They came in, did what they did, then wiped everything their trail.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.720]   And they didn't just get into Infowars.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   They got into Twitter and other things.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   And they came in and they posted a fake article breaking coup d'etat and Turkey air gun fleas to U.S. air base.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   In fact, I was in here and they brought in new articles as I was looking at literally hundreds of others.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   And I said, what is this air gun?
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   Who wrote this?
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   This doesn't have a byline.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   This says David K. Knight hardly ever writes articles.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   I said, go get David, please.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   I said, this isn't right.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   Because I was looking at the article and it was written by somebody who could tell English isn't their first language.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   And instantly Anthony and Buckley came running in going, yeah, a fake article has been posted.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   I go, how long ago?
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   They looked at their watch.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   11 minutes ago.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   It's down now.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   Don Salazar caught it.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   And I said, check everything.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   Check all the Twitter.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   Check all the Facebook.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   But I said, number one, run over there and make sure they haven't tried to breach any of the big bank systems.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   Obviously, they hadn't.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   That's all big third-party stuff.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.720]   But the point is, this is what goes on in this world.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   And I would say 50/50 it was done to try to scare us away from investigating these charter schools that actually teach the caliphate.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   I remember hearing this like five years ago, you better cover the caliphate in these schools.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   And I'm just like, oh, give me a break.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   I mean, I didn't believe it.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:02.720]   And then we start investigating and it's billions of taxpayer money a year to teach the most hard-core drivel.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   And then you learn Saudi Arabia -- and I stand by the fact that Saudi Arabia is buying up Fox News, it's buying up Hollywood.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   People go, oh, you're covering up for the Jews.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   They own Hollywood.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   Nobody debates that Jews dominate Hollywood.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   There are powerful Jewish directors, producers, a lot of Italians as well.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   That's just what I see.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   But a lot of people with other surnames.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   But, yeah, I mean, the Jews went out there and founded Hollywood.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   They ran a lot of the theater in New York and whatever.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   The point is, is that Saudi Arabia is influencing our movies.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.720]   China is influencing our movies more and more.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   I mean, I turn on movies all the time now.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   And it's just how great the Politburo is and how great the Communist Chinese are in mainline U.S. movies.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   They stopped Red Dawn from coming out and had it re-edited for a year and a half.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   It just goes on and on.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   Michael Savage's book got censored by the Communist Chinese, the one before this last one.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   And what I'm saying is I've dealt with the Saudi Arabians.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   I've dealt with the stuff they pulled.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   I have experienced the power of the radical Islamic lobby because I didn't want to start a war over there.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   I didn't want to clash with civilizations.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   I didn't want to invade and blame Iraq.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   It doesn't do with 9/11.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   So the left didn't like me because I was pro-gun and pro-life.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   But they tolerated me when Bush was in because I exposed so much stuff that they could get political points out of.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   But now that we are being flooded with millions across Europe and the U.S. of people that invaded Syria to take it over with their whole families.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   And they're saying we hate you, we're taking over, we're going to get you.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   And they're getting taxpayer money.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   I'm like no because they're going to attack and then they're going to take my rights.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.720]   And now they're announcing mandatory naked body scanners.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.720]   They want them on the highways.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   They're announcing federal taxes to "fight ISIS" when they're the ones that helped create it.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   I'm against the globalist agenda.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   We failed.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   We let the globalists destabilize the Middle East.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   Now they're going to collapse it into us.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   No.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   And they've got all their operatives and their professors threatening us and just coming out of the woodwork.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   Look, if I wasn't intimidated by the globalist that ran 9/11 with the radical jihadist.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   And if I'm not intimidated by the Mossad and others that have actually sent people here.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   And those are off-record discussions but it's happened.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   If I'm not intimidated by the CIA, the Pentagon, the rest of it.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.720]   You Muslim radicals think you intimidate me?
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   You don't intimidate me one bit.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   In fact, you helped me jump out of bed this morning with a spring in my step at 6 a.m.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   Whenever I get tired, folks, all I got to do is remember all the people, all the tyrants and all the bullies and all the scum.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   That think they're better than patriots of this country.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   And who think we're dead already and have rolled over all your intimidation and all your garbage.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.720]   Radical jihadist, CNN, MSNBC, you people have no honor.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.720]   Look at Al Sharpton calling for the Don of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel to step down.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   The New World Order gives that little FBI informant pimp all that power.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   And how he responds to his own maggot boss is to say you should step down.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   And we need a black mayor.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   As soon as they get a black mayor, they can really tear the city down faster.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   It's like Obama could double black unemployment.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   That's why they do that stuff.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.720]   I mean, it is just so sick.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   Why don't you put somebody in there who's black like the Milwaukee sheriff?
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   Oh, he fixed things.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   I guarantee you if they put somebody in there like the Milwaukee sheriff, not because he's black, because he knows what he's doing as a constitutionalist.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   I guarantee in four or five years, they'd have that crime rate cut in half in Chicago.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   Guarantee.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   But see, it's a criminal run system.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   They don't want it to be cut.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   They don't want it to stop.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   They want the gravy train to keep moving.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   So that's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   And it's more important than ever for people to understand.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:09.720]   When you see Rachel Manno in two days in 400 and something newspapers and then 300 and something newspapers the next day,
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   attacking Alex Jones and lying about me, what does that tell you?
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.720]   What does that tell you?
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.720]   That we are over the zeitgeist.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.720]   We got payloads of truth.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   We're dropping bombs.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.720]   We're blowing up enemy installations in the info war.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   Now, you can take what we've done, adapt it, learn from it, make it better, engage the globalists, start a YouTube channel, start a podcast, take action.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   And don't let COINTELPRO come in and stir you up to end fight with other people.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   That's their only hope to stop the liberty movement is to sit there and mess with you and vent you off into one of their little mental illness clubs.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   Take action against the new world order today and it will fall.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   Now, another reason it's going to fall is destined to fall is because its entire system is full of people that were compartmentalized and now know the truth.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   So a lot of positive things are happening.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   Also, do I have a special sheet in here today?
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.720]   I don't know what the heck.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   People might have forgotten to bring that in.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   We're running free shipping for everybody for the next week.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   It started off as, hey, people that have – we're giving holiday cards.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   A lot of them can be used anywhere.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   A lot of people that were given little shopping cards.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.720]   What do you call them?
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.720]   My mind is so full of data, gift cards.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   But a lot of people have gift cards that are specific to certain stores.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   So it's frustrating for them to not be able to get the 15 percent off already all the other big discounts.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   It's just 15 percent off for everybody that uses the promo code at checkout, and it says at checkout what the promo code is.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.720]   Okay?
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.720]   Yeah, it's gift 15.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   So that's all you got to do is go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   Regardless, we need the funding to deal with legal and cybersecurity and everything we do.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.720]   We don't get $2 billion like NBC and MSNBC to say turn your guns in.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.720]   We don't get $450 million a year, as I've said a thousand times or more, like NPR does, and beg for money every week basically.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.720]   We just get up here and we sell high-quality products and we have sponsors.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.720]   InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   The Hillary for Prison shirts, our limited edition.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   We're not going to make any more.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   And so while different sizes and supplies last, you can find that very popular shirt that I forgot.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   I mentioned that women and people were wearing it up at Trump rallies.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   I didn't know that Trump had actually tweeted it.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.720]   Can we show the article today?
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.720]   Trump tweets InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.720]   That story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   It says on the back, "Legalize freedom."
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   InfoWars.com.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   And Weldon again said the last shipment came in, and that is what is available.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   It's so popular I might make another variant of it or something.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   People are begging me not to get rid of it.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.720]   But Hillary for President 2016, well, it's now Hillary for Prison.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   And you can see the shirt at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:03.720]   You have to understand, folks, that this is the animating contest for liberty.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   And I know the reason we're having a big effect is you are taking action, supporting our local affiliates, spreading the word.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   And we are a committed organization that will never back down, that will never falter or waver in our steadfastness to never quit.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.720]   We may falter or waver in the fight, but our hearts will not falter and waver until they cease to beat.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:33.720]   And I just feel so sorry for people that are scared or on the fence who haven't gotten past their fear and committed.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   It's like coming out of a storm when you're on a sailboat and it's windy and it's scary and a squall blows through and you're out there for 30 minutes and you never think it's going to end and the boat might turn over and all of a sudden the squall blows out.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   I was on a sailboat with my dad one time as a kid when that happened.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.720]   It's called a black squall or a blue squall.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.720]   And it was just blue sky and beautiful on that lake after we came through that.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:01.720]   And when we come through that, it's such a great thing.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:08.720]   We give in to this, we shut up, we go along, we keep our heads down, we lose our heads.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:17.720]   And to be a man, to be a human is to truly defend your country and your ideals and your family.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.720]   And I know I'm doing that.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.720]   And I am so fulfilled.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   It is humbling.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   When you really get fulfilled, when you really become a man, and that just means following the directive of what a man does, it is amazing.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.720]   And I look around me and I see all these scared men trying to act like tough guys.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.720]   And I realize that they have the potential to be real men.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   But they've got to first humble themselves and realize that they have a duty to stand up for others around them.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   And that means learning what's happening and then taking action and standing up to ridicule, attacks, and persecution.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.720]   Then you will be a man.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   Stay with us.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   Are you prepared to bug out?

[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   I loved my dad, but boy, was he stubborn.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.720]   He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:48.720]   At less than $107 per month, libertyoncall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   [Music]
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:51.720]   Well, whether it's the Turkish government or whether it's some of these U.S. government CIA funded domestic schools that are teaching caliphate,
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   if they think hacking and continuing to hack info wars as they're doing currently right now is going to make us leave them alone,
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   boy, I am coming after you now.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   So, doesn't mean I'm going to defeat you.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:13.720]   But my listeners and all the people that we're going to chain reaction are going to come after you now.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:21.720]   And I'm already after the Turkish corrupt government trying to murder every Christian and get their hands on like they're Armenians or something.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.720]   I'm already going after all of it. Period.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   And I'm going to go after anybody else that defends it like those Young Turks.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.720]   The Young Turk Party folks, do you realize what the Young Turks did?
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   The real Young Turk Party? This is all just sick jokes in our face.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.720]   The more I sit back and look at it.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.720]   And the left, they're all fake laughing like they're friendly and they're good.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   They're sick taking this country down.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   And then they use the radical Islamic attacks on this country to take our freedoms.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   By the way, you know Jerry Brown signed the law, AB 1014.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   This is the KPCC headline. Police in California can seize guns without prior notice starting January 1st.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.720]   It's not a real warrant. It's not a real restraining order.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:18.720]   They just announced that they think you need to have a "wellness check" and they come and grab you and grab your guns.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   And then the way it works is you got to spend 20, 30 grand to get them back.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.720]   I remember that headline two years ago.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   Gun confiscation begins in California, Bloomberg, business, see in New York, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, areas like Chicago, California.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.720]   They're just beta testing stuff outside of law or passing laws.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.720]   I mean, they're coming for our guns.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.720]   They're coming for our basic freedoms.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:50.720]   Police in California can seize guns without prior notice starting January 1st.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   Isn't that just special? Family members who believe a loved one poses a danger.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   Well, if they have proof or any statements, the police already have probable cause.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.720]   But no, no, no. It's just they just feel.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   Family members who believe a loved one poses a danger to themselves or others will be able to ask police to seek a temporary gun violence restraining order from a judge.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:13.720]   But if you actually read, it's these rubber stamps like the blood draws they do.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   Beginning January 1st, the order would allow police to seize a person's guns for 21 days.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   Yeah, right. State lawmakers approve the legislation.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   Gary Brown signed it into law and then it just goes on through it.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   Oh, how about the FBI was trying to stop the two reported shooters in San Bernardino, but was ordered two years ago to stand down.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.720]   And they had a Justice Department racism investigation done on them.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:42.720]   Meanwhile, Roger Stone sent me this article today.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   Donald Trump takes on Bill Clinton's behavior towards women.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:53.720]   He, of course, Trump insider told you a month ago he was here and then again a few weeks ago that he's going to bring up Bill Clinton and all the rape settlements.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.720]   So is Bill Clinton approaching his Cosby moment?
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.720]   Very bold by.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   Mr. Trump.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   And we think it should be brought out. It's a fair game, as he says.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   Hey, how about this one to end the hour?
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   Delusional. They're not delusional.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.720]   The U.S. State Department credits Washington with bringing peace to Syria.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   The State Department actually ran the destabilization of Syria because the Pentagon wasn't wholeheartedly for it.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.720]   Hillary was cheap cook and bottle washer over the whole thing, gave birth to ISIS.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.720]   And now the same State Department comes out and takes credit for bringing peace.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   I mean, these people got a lot of nerve.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   You didn't build that business either.

[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.720]   Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.720]   Kevin Booth, fresh back from Turkey, is going to be in studio with us with major investigative info.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.720]   One reason we may be getting a massive hack attack ongoing right now, it's still ongoing.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   But that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger and helps us learn, so thank you.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   But right now, let's go ahead and go to the special report.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   I'll be back after the break with Kevin Booth in studio.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   Kid Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   Let's talk about so-called white privilege, this notion that white people have advantages in society
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   simply because of their skin color or the fact that their ancestors may have taken land or goods from other ethnic groups in centuries past.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.720]   I'm sure you've heard the phrase before on the internet, particularly mainstream media,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   especially after the recent University of Missouri protests,
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   where protesters demanded that the university president recognize his white privilege.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   But are white people the only ones with racial privilege?
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.720]   I mean, do they have a monopoly on it?
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   And by the way, what exactly is a white person?
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   I mean, in college I had a roommate who was 1/16th African-American.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.720]   So does that mean he only has 15th, 16th white privilege?
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720]   I mean, how do we define that?
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.720]   I mean, are we going to have to use Nazi family tree charts, for example, to determine how white a person is?
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.720]   If their mother or grandmother was white, that means he has this much white privilege.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.720]   How do we define that?
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   There's a notion that you can group people into racial groups that have certain privileges as racist in itself,
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.720]   because at that point you're not even looking at people by their individual qualities.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.720]   You're grouping them by race.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.720]   You're inviting them into races, and that is inherently racist when you judge people by their skin color.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.720]   But for the sake of discussion, let's take the leftist argument that all white people are into one group.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.720]   Does that one group really have all the privileges in the world, or do other groups also have advantages present in the past?
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.720]   I think a couple years ago I saw this video that went viral online of these anti-illegal immigration protesters
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.720]   who were confronted by this Native American who was claiming that, hey, you are all illegals.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   You are all invaders. Go back to Europe. Go back to your own countries.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   You're all illegal. You're all illegal. We didn't invite none of you here.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   And, of course, the leftists took the video to claim that, hey, he's right.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.720]   White people really did come in here and use their privilege to take the land away from the Native Americans.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.720]   But here's what they're not telling you.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   All these Native American tribes back in the day were fighting each other for the same land.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   You had, for example, the Comanches fighting the Wichita and so forth.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.720]   So basically speaking, these Native American tribes did have an advantage.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   They were on this land first.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   They were on this land thousands of years before the first Europeans even set sight on this land.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   So they had an advantage. They had a privilege.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   They had this land before anyone else, and that was a huge advantage.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   And simply put, they fought each other over it.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.720]   So you had this whole conquest mentality that predated the first Europeans setting foot on North America.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   And on the other side of the world, and I'm not talking about white European side of the world,
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   you had the Ottomans and the Persians and the Arabs and so on and so forth,
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   all these non-whites that were fighting each other over the same pieces of land.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.720]   So you see this conquest ethics, this conquest mentality.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   It's not just -- white people don't have a monopoly on it.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   It wasn't just the British Empire and the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire, Roman Empire.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   All these empires that were predominantly Caucasian, so to speak, they didn't have a monopoly on conquest.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   Just about every single ethnic group in the world has had a conquest at a time or two.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.720]   But going back to the Native American example, the current core tenet of social justice is to correct for history.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   For example, let's say that the United States decides to give all its land back to the Native Americans.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   The country is going to shut down and give the land back to who was here first.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   But who do you give it to? Do you give it to the Apache or to the Comanche or the Navajo?
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:51.720]   I mean the point being all these tribes occupy the same land at one point or the other.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.720]   They all fought each other over it.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   So who do you give the land to?
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   I mean you get this complex history, this world history of conquest and divide and conquer and what have you.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   So there is no rectifying history concerning that every single ethnic group in world history is guilty of conquest and oppression.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   And all these leftists and social justice warriors are out protesting against white privilege.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:23.720]   They're complete hypocrites because you never see one of them say that, "Hey, I'm going to quit my job at this company so a misplaced minority can take my place."
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   Or the college kids for example, you never hear them say, "Hey, I'm going to withdraw from the university so that a misplaced minority can take my seat in this classroom."
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   No, you never hear that at all, do you?
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.720]   And that's the sheer hypocrisy of the social justice warrior movement.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   They want to take things from you and give it to minorities they say are being oppressed without doing it themselves.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.720]   And how are they going to decide which minorities are the most oppressed anyway?
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.720]   I mean simply put, every single ethnic group in world history has been oppressed at one time or another.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.720]   So what are you going to do then about all this inequality?
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   Well it's pretty simple.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   Quit dividing people by racial groups.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   Quit judging them by their skin color.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.720]   And instead see people as individuals.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   The actor wins a teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   A wealthy Texas teen who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing four people while driving drunk,
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya, were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenza Teen during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.720]   When a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:42.720]   He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter, a sentence critics saw as far too light.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:54.720]   You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   In the 15 year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   We've always offered five months free.

[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   We forget to use those holiday gift cards.

[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:13.720]   [Music]
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.720]   Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:29.720]   My friends, don't take InfoWars.com and our backup site, PrisonPlanet.com, for granted.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.720]   Please don't take the fact that we're on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube for granted.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.720]   We deal with constant censorship, constant harassment.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   We've been successfully hacked two other times in the last 18, 19 years that I've been an internet presence.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.720]   I was on radio and TV about a year before I had a website. Two years.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:56.720]   But we have had successful hack attacks of InfoWars today, posting the fake article breaking coup d'etat in Turkey.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   Ergun flees to U.S. airbase.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.720]   And they are currently trying to break back in yet again.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:11.720]   And we have two different good IT companies, and they say it's very sophisticated what they're doing.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:18.720]   It is the CIA that has been funding the Turkish government and funding ISIS.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   That, of course, has been exposed by this show and others.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:26.720]   The Syrian Electronic Army, three years ago and then again two years ago,
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   and I can show you some of those articles here if you're a TV viewer,
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:37.720]   took over CNN, you name it, literally hundreds of publications and posted InfoWars.com links.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.720]   We do not endorse that. We do not support that. We're not involved in that.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   But they were links exposing that Al-Qaeda was the main rebel force.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   That, of course, later came out. You now see the Pentagon saying they don't want to be part of this.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.720]   It has been a devastating victory against the globalists in Saudi Arabia and Turkey and NATO
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.720]   trying to overthrow the Middle East and put radical Islamists in,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   who I have stacks of articles today are executing women for free speech, death sentences for poets.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.720]   I mean, I just oppose totalitarianism. I'm not anti-Islam.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.720]   But I'm against funding radical Islam to take over the world.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   And it comes out of Saudi Arabia and then using the threat of it to take my freedoms and my family's freedoms.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   I mean, I'm a real liberal, folks. I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:23.720]   Thomas Jefferson was a liberal. I'm that kind of liberal, not the modern liberals with political correctness saying ban.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.720]   I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. And they're actually doing that and saying if a white person wants to eat Chinese food,
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   it's cultural appropriation. They're actually banning that at universities.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:38.720]   I mean, you cannot, you know, people are resigning under new blacklist at Yale because they said we're not going to ban Halloween.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   Get over it. People being offended by people in cowboy outfits. That's the real tyranny.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.720]   And I'm a real liberal. People call me a libertarian right winger or whatever because I'm pro-gun.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   The definitions are all scrambled. Syrian electronic army hack CNN accounts amid Geneva talks, RT.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   Here's another one. Hackers hijack CBS to claim Obama involvement in Boston bombings.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.720]   Tweet info wars. That was the free Syrian army again. Global websites hacked by Syrian electronic army.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:19.720]   And of course, they tweet info wars. So I believe that this is being done because it looks like something they put out.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.720]   That air guns been overthrown and run to an air base. Fake story. Only up for 11 minutes.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.720]   They took over Paul Watson's Twitter account. They're trying to get into everything right now, which is a good drill for us.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.720]   We're contacting some of the better hackers that have consulted for us and others right now.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   And this will make us better. And again, they want to use these threats as well to pass the whole cyber security system that takes everybody's freedoms.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:51.720]   Now, joining us until the bottom of the next hour is my old friend, TV producer, filmmaker, bestselling author,
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:56.720]   better known for being Bill Hicks's producer, the producer of Ninja Bachelor Party.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.720]   I was in a juice plant the other day. I have a Ninja Bachelor Party type type shake.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.720]   I was getting all those protein shakes. It's actually excellent. It's funny to walk around and see stuff you came up with, Bill, everywhere.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   But we're not here to get into comedy. Normally, you have fun interviews.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.720]   He, of course, was working with the freeway Ricky Ross and the whole Gary Webb situation.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   That new film, how incredible kill the messenger. So important that the truth is coming out on that front.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.720]   Other patriots got persecuted. But you have gone into Juarez, Mexico.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.720]   You've gone to the most dangerous areas that the FBI won't even go.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.720]   You have gone into the most dangerous areas in the Middle East.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:36.720]   You have gone into the most dangerous areas in south central L.A. to Skid Row to make your films that have aired on.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.720]   I mean, you name it, Showtime, HBO, so many other channels.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.720]   American Drug War one and two that I was honored to consult on.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.720]   So folks know Kevin Booth is. But Kevin recently just got back from Turkey.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.720]   He lives in L.A. He's visiting family. He's a Texan visiting family out in Fredericksburg.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.720]   And he said, man, I've got incredible stuff from the Middle East.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.720]   And then I was looking at who he was going to bring bring on the show in about 30 minutes.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.720]   This particular doctor and I was like, wait a minute, Joe Biggs knows who that is.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   This is the guy that's getting ISIS defectors to defect and expose at the West and the Turkish government and others are funding him.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.720]   This guy's in hiding. This guy's really big. He's interviewed him.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.720]   We've got a three minute super cut. We're going to play here in a moment.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:28.720]   But you add this today happening as the hack trying to not just hijack in four hours, but bring it down is happening.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.720]   And so this is the most sophisticated, sustained attack we've ever seen.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   I mean, it's it's it's sophisticated, folks.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.720]   And I'm not going to get into exactly what's going on, but all the really important stuff is secure.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.720]   But I don't know if it's this or we're investigating these Islamic jihad schools.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   The CIA openly got Congress to allow we're talking billions a year to these groups that actually teach caliphate.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.720]   I mean, I'm sorry, my daughters are not going to live in a caliphate over my dead body.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.720]   So this is all going on. And it's just over the top.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:05.720]   And this stuff is so over the top. You hear billions a year of U.S. taxpayer, 500 million dollars of Texas money a year to one group.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.720]   It's the second biggest skilled visa group after Google.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.720]   Tens of thousands of workers brought in a year.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.720]   And they run schools that look like charter schools and they teach caliphate.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.720]   I mean, and I hear that. No, that's not true. That's just crazy right wing stuff.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.720]   It's real. So Joe Biggs is going to pop in with us at the start of the next hour.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.720]   But Kevin Booth, great to have you here. See your lovely wife, Trey.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.720]   We used to hang out so much. You guys lived here in town. How many years have you lived in L.A. now?
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.720]   It's been 10 years now. I've been gone. Hard to believe. Yeah. Brother, time goes fast.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   Let's just get right into radical Islamic terror. You started out, you told me, making a film about mafia and government corruption, crime.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   And it keeps leading you back to radical Islam. Tell us about the upcoming film. What you witnessed in Turkey.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.720]   Well, our story actually started in Bulgaria.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   And we started researching this country based on when communism fell, how they left the KGB, left all these mafias in place to basically take control over all these countries that dropped out of communism at the end of the 80s, beginning of the 90s.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   And how there's all these mafia organizations basically in charge of the government, complete corruption.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.720]   And now they're the ones financing a lot of this.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   And I remember at first you were saying, what do you think about Putin three, four years ago?
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   I mean, sometimes you spend five, six years on a film. You do real research.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   And I was like, no, Putin's not perfect, but the West is starting the fight with him.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.720]   And I think you ought to get that perspective in it as well.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:41.720]   How have your views and your research developed or evolved in your what is it, three years you've been working on this?
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   I just got two years. Yeah.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.720]   So in the last two years or so, how have things changed?
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.720]   You know, a lot has changed. I mean, we just got back from the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.720]   Robert Steele helped us get in there, believe it or not.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.720]   You know, Robert Steele, the CIA guy. Yeah.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:05.720]   He introduced us to a former KGB guy, Oleg Kalugin.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.720]   Ever heard of him? Oh, yes.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.720]   And the reason we linked up with him is because he's the one who is known for the Bulgarian umbrella and all that stuff.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.720]   We were trying to tie in all these stories, but then all these things connect.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.720]   And then Robert ended up getting us into the Russian embassy.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.720]   And so we've actually been meeting with Putin's press secretary.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.720]   And we're that close to getting in a meeting with Putin.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.720]   I'm not sure if it's going to happen or not, but we're we're in the door.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   And so we're not you know, we're by no means out to make a movie to make Putin look bad.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.720]   I mean, it's it seems like it's all becoming one big mass as far as the power goes.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.720]   Yeah, there's global organized crime playing the nations off against each other.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.720]   Exactly. And then you have all these smaller mafia groups that are still being controlled from Russia or so forth.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.720]   But it's no different than American mafia, you know, whatever.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.720]   There's just it's a whole hierarchy.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.720]   And it's who can be the most sophisticated ends up dominating.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.720]   Yeah, absolutely. But it led you into radical Islamic areas.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.720]   I saw the footage in the super cut we're going to play after the break.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.720]   I think I'm going to skip this network break. I just can't help it.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.720]   I mean, this is some powerful info. Tell us about this guest that's coming on a little bit later.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   Well, once again, Robert, still connecting me with Professor Yala.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   He is recently had to flee the country because he was interrogating former ISIS fighters, ISIS fighters that have defected.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.720]   And some people that he were involved with have been hunted down and murdered.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.720]   And so he decided he needed to leave. He's in the United States right now.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   And but back then, we just we didn't know this was going to happen.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.720]   We filmed him. This is about a month ago that we spent quite a bit of time with him over there, just traveling all around.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:48.720]   And we mostly mostly filming him in Istanbul and just getting him to just discuss all the aspects of this thing going on.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   While we were there, there was a shooting. There was a bombing. There's a lot of things that took place while we were there.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.720]   Well, I sent a crew to Istanbul to cover Bilderberg and Jim Tucker.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.720]   It's in the film Endgame. And they were followed from the hotel. They were followed everywhere.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.720]   It's on video. Yeah. At the end of Endgame. I mean, this is not a game. I mean, this is not a free country.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   Yeah. No, Turkey, it's crazy. It's a little bit like New York on some level.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.720]   You know, on some weird level. Certainly beautiful. Yeah. After being in Bulgaria, it was like going to New York.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.720]   Because Bulgaria is a lot more foreign. And then we go to Turkey.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.720]   So on some level, it's there's a lot of money there. It's a modern city on some level.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   But then you have all these mosques everywhere and everybody's just everybody is so afraid of the government.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:35.720]   It's crazy. You can't talk to anybody. We have a lot of bizarre situations with people backing out of interviews at the last second.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.720]   People, you know, of course, nobody wants to be on camera. Nobody, you know, it's just it's just.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.720]   And once you give into that, your future, your prosperity is over.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.720]   Yeah. And another thing, too, is that when we've been filming in throughout Eastern Europe, we were able to have a team of bodyguards with us.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.720]   We were not allowed to bring our team of bodyguards into Turkey. I don't know if I should be saying that on this, but we can't.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.720]   You know, we couldn't cross the Turkish border with our with our bodyguards that we're using in Eastern Europe.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.720]   It's a whole different set of rules over there. And it's also interesting, too, because I've flown into Turkey now.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.720]   And I've also driven into Turkey. And, you know, the border where they have the border crossings is very tight.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.720]   You know, we have one thing we're like looking for refugees and we're trying to like see what it takes to drive from Bulgaria into Turkey and back and forth.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:24.720]   And the border is very tight on these crossings. But then there's just all these other places where people can cross.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:31.720]   And we're trying to, you know, the whole thing about refugees crossing over in the in the you know, the terrorists being mixed in with the refugees and all that.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:37.720]   Which is undoubtedly happening. Yeah, obviously. And then our government knows they're going to hit us and then we're going to have our rights taken away.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.720]   And this is really a simple equation. Yeah. And they've got I mean, and they've got all these guys just doing their jobs.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.720]   Everybody's afraid of getting fired. Everybody working in every structure I looked at.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:53.720]   They're just afraid of losing their jobs. And so they'll just do whatever they're told because everybody is so broke over there.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:58.720]   Everybody's so poor over there. And that's why they want clout and pivot here. Get you in debt. Break you.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:07.720]   Now you can be controlled for chicken feed. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if if looking at Bulgaria and some of these other Eastern European countries is the future of what could happen in America.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:13.720]   I think people better take a look at what's happened to Bulgaria and some of these other little countries over there, even though it's small.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   Getting into this small country of Bulgaria has given us a chance to to to break apart the whole hierarchy because it's such a small country.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:27.720]   It's very fascinating. And the average American is busy watching Caitlyn Jenner or busy watching the Kardashians.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:33.720]   They just have nor the NFL. They have no idea that the world is just descending into chaos right now.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:40.720]   Well, Caitlyn Jenner's a hero. Alex. Oh, what is it? Stunning and brave.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   And then it cuts to Brett Favre. He won't clap. He's like, what? What? ESPN hero. What?
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:52.720]   It's not like we're even against Caitlyn Jenner. It's just like this. This is not stunning, not brave, not attractive.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:59.720]   It's called surgery. It's I mean, what if I want to have a change to a walrus?
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.720]   I don't want taxpayers to pay for it. You're a hero and stunning and brave.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:10.720]   All right. Getting serious here. We've got this super cut from the unnamed upcoming film.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.720]   And I tell you, you are really are an avant garde filmmaker because you just start out with an idea.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.720]   You first told me about this about three years ago, but you've been working on two years and I mean, didn't do it.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.720]   We've been traveling for two years. Did the first American drug war take six, seven?
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.720]   Take the first American drug war took about five years. Five.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.720]   Yeah. But then I guess a couple more to even get it out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   I have seven in my head. Is that wrong? Is my memory. Don't tell me if I'm wrong.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.720]   No, you're right. I mean, I guess, you know, I mean, if you want to add on. Yeah.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   I mean, the years before I actually start filming. Right. I start in my head.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   I start the day that the camera starts rolling. But, yeah, there you make these films because what I love about is you start them.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   And it's true reality TV because you don't even know where you're going to go.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:55.720]   You see, you know, absolutely on this film, this in fact, this film more than ever has been just just heading into the wind.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:01.720]   Like we didn't know we were basically let's go to Eastern Europe and try to uncover corruption.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:05.720]   And it wasn't even our plan to go to Turkey. It wasn't even our plan to talk about terrorism.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.720]   It wasn't even our plan to talk about any of this. It's just where it led us. We're just following.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   Let's be honest. About three years ago, we're out to dinner and you're like, it's a total thug taking over.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.720]   And he's put all these mafias in. And I said, well, that's kind of true.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.720]   But I said, you better see the West and Soros starting all this. Right.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.720]   And so and you're like, and you were. Yeah, I've heard that. Well, don't worry. I'm an investigator at all.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:29.720]   So we're not lionizing Putin. We're not lionizing Soros. The point is, don't you see how the West is starting a lot of this now?
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.720]   Yeah, absolutely. So you have since you've investigated, you've come around to that. Yes.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   Yes. It's not like I mean, listen, I made a film Masters of Terror basically accusing Putin of blowing up apartment buildings.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:44.720]   When he was vice president during the Chechen War to get popular support.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.720]   Now, I didn't say he did it. I just said it was in the Moscow news that police caught.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:54.720]   At a fourth apartment building, the FSB, that's the Federal Security Bureau, planting bombs.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.720]   They said it was part of a drill. Other people say, no, that was a setup to blame Putin.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:05.720]   All I know is Putin isn't attacking America. Putin is, is, is actually the Russian government is under attack.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.720]   And so I don't want to have World War Three with them. We've actually gotten the ban.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.720]   And here I go saying this name Pussy Riot is in our movie to tell the whole Russian story.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.720]   It was quite a big deal to get them in the movie. I just like saying the name.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   Well, whatever. The point is, that's a known CIA funded group. Yeah. Run around and pull stunts.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.720]   Yeah. I mean, you know, I don't know about that. I don't know. I don't know if it's a known CIA group.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.720]   We're still working on that. But it's, it's there in our film. It's a known Soros front group.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.720]   Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. I would interview him. Great. OK.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.720]   But I mean, you can see what the old geezers at the CIA are going.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.720]   We'll get young girls and give them a name and then they'll go into Russia and Putin will arrest them.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.720]   And he'll look like a thug. I mean, the Russians are not buying any of it. Yeah.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.720]   So, no, it's funny getting Oleg Lugin's take on Pussy Riot. So, yeah.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.720]   What do you think about that? That is just all just a stunt for to make themselves popular.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.720]   And, you know, they're touring around with Madonna now.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.720]   Well, yeah, they're playing along with it for their own personal power.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.720]   But I'm talking about what gave birth to all of this.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.720]   No, absolutely. No, I mean, it's been a good ploy for sure.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:13.720]   I mean, it's complicated, you know, because you get, you know, I can't honestly tell you.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.720]   I get it. You fly on the wall or just going to show both sides of the circus.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm not I'm not accusing them of anything like that.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.720]   I'm we're just like putting him in there, hearing what they say and taking it on the next the next level.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.720]   You have done well. Now we've got your guests coming up and we're going to talk about him here in a moment.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.720]   But first, let's go to this short and super cut. You gave us a great like eight minute one.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.720]   But for time constraints, we had it down to about three minutes.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.720]   The visuals here of your radio listener, you got to go to Infowars.com/show.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:48.720]   Be able to see this, but it's powerful. I've been told by folks who have traveled to Turkey, friends and family.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.720]   They say it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Other than, say, areas of Croatia and Bosnia.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.720]   They say it's just just like over the top magic. Yeah, we've crashed many drones on this project.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.720]   In fact, I had to buy this latest drone in the in the Grand Bazaar.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.720]   So it was very there's a funny scene in the movie. By the way, this movie isn't all serious.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.720]   I mean, it's it's a kind of a dark comedy that I look at what's happening with the world right now is a dark comedy.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.720]   But there's a so it is a dark comedy. There's a scene in the movie right now where we actually after crashing the drone,
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:24.720]   we have to go buy another drone so that we can spy like they're selling us the thing that we need used to spy on them with actually in the Grand Bazaar.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:31.720]   So there's like spices and camels and then we go there to buy a drone and we get all these kids to teach us how to fly it and all that.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.720]   But we got some amazing footage there in Turkey with the drone.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:59.720]   Let's go ahead and roll this from the upcoming unnamed project by Kevin Booth.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:08.720]   Without any ideology, a terrorist is someone who is carrying out violent activities towards society.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   Who is killing, who is attacking, who is assaulting without any reason or with any reason.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:20.720]   It doesn't matter because terrorists usually play to two factors.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.720]   First is the ethnicity. The second is the religion.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:30.720]   The third factor could be if there is someone who is killed or imprisoned in their family.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.720]   These three factors are extremely important.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:43.720]   If they exist in your family, you should be very careful among your children because terrorist organizations can reach to your children
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:53.720]   and try to win their hearts from those factors by playing out to those factors as children are very emotional at those ages.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:59.720]   So he shot the judge, you interviewed him directly afterwards.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.720]   Like what did he say? What was just...
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:08.720]   He was so relaxed. He was trained very well and got prepared for this occasion.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   Very relaxed as if he didn't commit a crime an hour ago.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.720]   He is the most innocent guy in the world.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:28.720]   What upsets me the most is the fact that ISIS is being used for an excuse to intervene those lands or the people over there.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.720]   It shouldn't be because what they are doing is not right.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:41.720]   However, by doing their attacks or carrying out those attacks, they are inviting people from abroad to take retaliation against them.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.720]   Now this is blood on top of blood, which is not good and not acceptable.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.720]   But this is the way it is. If you attack people, they are going to come after you.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:28:00.720]   Islam is just like Christianity and Judaism is an Abrahamic religion.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:07.720]   And in all those three religions, killing someone without a probable cause is not acceptable.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   And one of the biggest crimes mankind can commit.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:24.720]   Islam is not like that. ISIS, Al-Qaeda and other radicals are using their ideology to misconduct or misrepresent Islam.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.720]   They are using Islam to recruit for themselves.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:34.720]   Then let me ask you this, why don't we see more Islamic people trying to stop them from doing this?
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.720]   And he goes on to answer the question and I guess intimidation.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:47.720]   Yeah, I mean, this is what is interesting about it. It is just a very odd situation. I don't know. I am trying to figure it out.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.720]   And now it is time for the NPR hour with Kevin Gibbs.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.720]   I am sorry, how loud am I here?
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.720]   Kevin, can you hear me?
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.720]   I am sorry.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.720]   You are the anti-NPR.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   I know, I had to turn it up real loud.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.720]   This is Sam Kennison on the radio.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:06.720]   You should play Sam. You could play Sam.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   You know they are, well as you know, they are trying to now remake it, your book.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:17.720]   I guess Russell Crowe is not involved now or he is a little bit and turn it into a movie.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't talk about that right now.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.720]   It is exciting though.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.720]   Yeah, many exciting things.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:30.720]   Don't let it out of the bag that they are looking at me as being Sam Kennison. Come on. Don't start that rumor.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.720]   All right, folks. Kevin Booth is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   Many irons in the fire.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:45.720]   We are going to get serious though and come back and look at the west backing of Al Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS with a major insider, Dr. Ahmet S. Yael.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.720]   We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:58.720]   Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:07.720]   Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe show to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:13.720]   Coons said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force,
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.720]   Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against ISIS.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:24.720]   The U.S. has spent more than $5 billion on the war against ISIS since August 2014.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:31.720]   The cost is expected to rise considerably now that the Obama administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the group.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:38.720]   Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:45.720]   On Monday, Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who serves as the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security,
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:51.720]   said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's had really minimal impact on ISIS.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:58.720]   You can find more reports on Infowars.com.
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:07.720]   Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   The numbers are staggering.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:21.720]   In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:25.720]   That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.720]   Don't let them win.

[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:03.720]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:08.720]   It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, four hours of hard-hitting radio.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   We have one of our great anchors or hosts, host of the fourth hour.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.720]   Some days I host as well, but I'm always here.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:30.720]   Three hours, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the third hour of Overdrive.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.720]   We have our guest joining us from the United States.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:40.720]   He's had to flee Turkey because of his associates being killed by ISIS groups for exposing what they're really up to.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.720]   Dr. Ahmet S. Yayla will be joining us here in just a moment.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:55.720]   All Hades is breaking loose right now with all sorts of different hack attacks, attempts, successful attempts, in some cases to hack Infowars.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:01.720]   And post stories like breaking coup d'etat in Turkey, Ergun flees to U.S. airbase.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.720]   Not true.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:10.720]   Now the Syrian Electronic Army, of course, has taken over CNN, you know, for and tweeted Infowars articles.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:20.720]   What we've been talking about for four years has now been proven. The West is funding ISIS, al-Qaeda, al-Nusra to take over areas of the Middle East and destabilize it.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:26.720]   Turkey, of course, the government has been caught buying the oil, red-handed.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.720]   They've shot down a Russian jet. They're threatening to blow up Russian ships.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:37.720]   The Russians have moved in S-400 anti-aircraft missiles that can shoot down any aircraft in the world.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:45.720]   Things are escalating quickly. That's why we're so focused on this and not dancing with the stars or the NFL.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:55.720]   That said, we have just incredible ISIS-type behavior happening.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:02.720]   And we have a senior Democrat, we have his clip coming up, calling for surtax the American people to pay for the war against Islamic State.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:12.720]   So they ship Islamic State in, they let them attack, and then they take all of our rights and tax us when Hillary was caught basically creating the organization.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:20.720]   That's all coming up in one moment. But first, we have the biggest special that we've ever offered.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:30.720]   We have the biggest special that we've ever offered when it comes to the Infowars, Nightly News, all of my films, e-books, so much more.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:39.720]   15 years of our 20 years, I've had PrisonPlanet.tv. And PrisonPlanet.tv works absolutely first-rate.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   It is subscriber-based. 20 people can use each membership.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.720]   So your username, you can share it with 20 friends and family.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:55.720]   Normally, it's 60-something bucks for a year. But we normally have a special, so it's 54.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:02.720]   Now it's 36.50. That's 6 months free when you sign up for a yearly membership. A one-time fee.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.720]   Where you can sign up month-to-month is 5.95.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.720]   So instead of 71 dollars a year, it's 36.50.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:20.720]   And that funds an organization that sends reporters around the world, that has other investigative journalists and filmmakers in the studio, that has everybody from Donald Trump to Ron Paul on.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.720]   We're pretty close to the Putin interview as well. Kevin's working on his own. It's exciting.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.720]   We're taking action. We're reaching 20 million people a week and growing.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.720]   And our target audience isn't some demographic for sales. It's the whole world.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.720]   It's to promote freedom and peace in our time.
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   And free-market ideas. Renaissance. True liberalism.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:46.720]   The opposite of the counterfeit fascist liberals and their neocon cohorts and rhinos.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.720]   So we're running the special until the new year.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.720]   We're talking 6 months free right now. There's never been a better time. There's no excuses.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   And the money we get goes to build this organization that just gets more and more effective every day.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.720]   And we are under attack. But we take that as part of the excitement of this.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.720]   Media demonization.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:14.720]   Demonization tactics. Hack attacks. Just so many other things that go on.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   So PrisonPlanet.tv. Infowarsnews.com. Go there. It takes about a minute to sign up.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   And I appreciate your support.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:24.720]   But again, we can get censored on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.720]   Our own platforms though give us more redundancy.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.720]   You get it all there first. You get a lot of exclusive material at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   Also, we're doing 15% off for everybody.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.720]   Because it gets too confusing just saying if you have a gift card you get 15% off. You get that too.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:47.720]   And gift15 is the promo code. 15% off on top of all the other discounts.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.720]   Infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.720]   And then finally, whatever you do, continue to please pray for Infowars.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.720]   Continue to please spread the word about Infowars.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:06.720]   Continue to also tell people in your community, your neighbors, folks on Facebook, Twitter, other platforms, Pinterest, Instagram about Infowars.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:12.720]   It's your word of mouth is the reason we're like a salmon swimming upstream against this tide of demonization and attacks.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.720]   So we can bring you groundbreaking investigative journalism.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.720]   So I'm done talking about that.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.720]   I want to thank you all for your support and salute you for what you've done.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   Kevin Booth, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, award-winning documentary filmmaker,
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   American Drug War 1 and 2 and so many other films.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:30.720]   He's here.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:36.720]   Kevin, I can introduce this guest, but you know the doctor better than I.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:43.720]   He has written the book ISIS Defectors Inside Stories of Confronting the Caliphate.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:52.720]   He testified to the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee and subcommittee on prevention of nuclear and biological attacks as an expert.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.720]   He has spoke to law enforcement groups around the world.
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.720]   I mean, his bio is just amazing.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:09.720]   He's appointed by the official advisor of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security between 2006 and 2007 to advise understanding and building connections with terrorism-targeted international communities living in the United States.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.720]   And he can get into Al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, Hezbollah, PKK.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720]   It's very complex.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.720]   He has a Ph.D. degree from the University of North Texas in the U.S. and his master's in criminal justice.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.720]   You got to know him through one of your CIA contacts.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.720]   Robert Steele.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.720]   Robert Steele.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:33.720]   And he just has so much intel on what's really happening in Turkey, bordering Syria, who the players are and where this is going.
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.720]   So tell us about him and then let's introduce him and get him to crystallize for us what's happening.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.720]   Well, I mean, I think you gave him a pretty good introduction there.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.720]   But recently he's been with a partner.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:49.720]   They've been filming all these interrogations of defected ISIS fighters just trying to understand all this.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.720]   I mean trying to understand the mindset, the psychology, the brainwashing, whatever it is.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.720]   It's very complex.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:02.720]   And, you know, that's why, you know, I've spent a lot of time with him just filming him, filming him talking.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:13.720]   And these videos were basically trying to get the transcripts of it because now there's hours and hours of these ISIS fighters like talking about ISIS and, you know, working on getting it all translated in transcripts.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.720]   Amazing footage.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.720]   I haven't seen anybody else with this material.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.720]   It's pretty -- yeah, it's pretty --
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.720]   Well, doctor, thank you so much for your courage.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.720]   Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   I know that some of your colleagues have been murdered.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.720]   I know that you've had to come to the United States.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.720]   Simply incredible.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.720]   You've got the floor for the rest of the hour.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.720]   Explain to us exactly what's happening, who ISIS is, and where all this is going.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:37.720]   Thank you very much for hosting me.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720]   I really appreciate your comments.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   It's been like a month I have arrived.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   I had to flee Turkey because, as you mentioned, we were interviewing ISIS defectors with a colleague from Georgetown University, Professor Anne Speckhardt.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.720]   She's a psychologist.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.720]   And we were talking to those ISIS defectors to figure out what was really going on.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.720]   What's the reason they were inside ISIS?
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:18.720]   Especially we were trying to understand the whole organization so that we can find out policies or ways to better deal with those people.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:28.720]   It took me like a year to reach them out and to gain their trust and to see if I could persuade them to talk to us.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:37.720]   First, just talking, we spent like ten of them hours.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.720]   And we had a little Skype hiccup with the doctor.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.720]   We'll see if that comes back.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720]   But just really unprecedented.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.720]   I mean, this is big news.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   When Biggs heard you were having this gentleman on, it was like, wow.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.720]   You know, that guy really has been inside ISIS tracking them.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.720]   A pretty big fish.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.720]   And then he's there talking about ISIS is being used to take over Syria and it's wrong.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.720]   This is a top Homeland Security advisor saying what I'm saying, what Colonel Schaefer's saying.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.720]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.720]   Every time I get into U.S. government, they're all like us and don't like what's happening.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:17.720]   So I'm wondering why is this going on if almost everyone I talk to, generals, you name it, are against what's happening.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.720]   I mean, who's directing this then?
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.720]   It's crazy.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:21.720]   >> Well, I mean, he's over there in Turkey.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.720]   I mean, that's just why.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   I mean, everybody in Turkey is so afraid of everything and in all these countries.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:32.720]   So I can see why he came over here and kept it on the down low.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:39.720]   And, you know, it's kind of a weird situation he's in because he wants to get out there and tell everybody that.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.720]   But he also wants to survive and he wants his family to survive.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   And we've spent a lot of times with a lot of refugees too.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:54.720]   And, you know, it's interesting because you want to believe everything the refugees are telling you, but you don't ever know if it's all true or not, you know.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   >> I believe we have Dr. Yaila back again, Homeland Security, Turkish insider.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.720]   Just so much intelligence he's got.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.720]   I don't know where to begin in the time.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.720]   Sir, sorry you got cut off.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:12.720]   You were getting into talking to these defectors and others.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.720]   Please continue.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:22.720]   >> Dr., can you hear me?
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720]   Let's go to telephone.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.720]   If you can't do that, guys, let's go ahead and abort and go to telephone.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   I don't want to jack with the Skype anymore.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.720]   Continuing here, we'll keep it in the next hour if we have to.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.720]   We got bigs coming here.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   We'll have some good questions.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:40.720]   Just all the things this guy has done and the fact that he got recommended to you by Steele, wow, I can't wait to see the film, Kevin.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:42.720]   >> Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:52.720]   I mean, I'm also working with this guy, Asen Jordanoff, I call him the Alex Jones of Bulgaria because he's like this conspiratorial guy.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:44:02.720]   And he's uncovering some of these incredible wiretaps that have been going on between government officials and judges and what's going on with the elections over there and everything.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:04.720]   It's just crazy.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.720]   >> Let's go back to the doctor.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.720]   We do have him.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:07.720]   Sir, sorry about that.
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.720]   Please continue, sir.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   >> It's okay.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:14.720]   So we have started this project after I reached out to ISIS defectors.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   You know, I was based in Sharmurfa, Turkey, by Syrian border.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.720]   Sharmurfa is a population of 2 million people.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:33.720]   Right now there are around 500,000 Syrian refugees in Sharmurfa living alone as refugee.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.720]   >> So there's a lot of refugees there.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.720]   And, of course, there's several -- continue.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:43.720]   >> I'm going to go with my directive, guys.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.720]   Want to go phone.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:46.720]   >> It's what we're doing.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.720]   It's the fun of the show, though.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   It's teleprompter free.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720]   It's real.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   CNN would have two or three backup guests is what they do.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.720]   And when one goes down, they bring the other on.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:55.720]   I mean, this is real.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   This is why people tune in.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.720]   It's what we do.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:58.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:00.720]   >> And we've got Joe Biggs coming in here about this.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.720]   Have you looked into these Islamic schools?
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.720]   Just one of them gets billions a year from the U.S. government, 500 million in Texas.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.720]   It's the biggest charter school group in the U.S.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.720]   And it actually teaches caliphate.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:15.720]   >> Wow.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.720]   >> And then other kids go and don't even know.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.720]   And then they're in an Islamic training school.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.720]   I used to hear this three or four years ago from patriots.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.720]   And it was so over the top, I didn't really look into it because it just sounded crazy.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.720]   There's these big, giant charter schools.
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:29.720]   They teach the caliphate.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.720]   And I'd be like, and some of these people were smart folks.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.720]   I was like, really?
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.720]   And yeah, I look into it.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:35.720]   And there wasn't really a lot of news coverage.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.720]   So I was like, that must not be true.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.720]   Now we've gone out and looked, it's real.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:43.720]   And now they've basically indicted the guy in Turkey.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.720]   Lawsuits have started in the U.S. of these schools, and it's all coming out.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:49.720]   It's like, what else is going on?
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:53.720]   I mean, how infiltrated is this country?
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.720]   >> That's what I'm looking for.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.720]   I don't know.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720]   I mean, I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.720]   I don't know how infiltrated it is.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.720]   I mean, I'd like to hear what your definition is of teaching the caliphate.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.720]   What is your definition?
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:06.720]   >> Radical Islam is going to take over the world.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.720]   >> And that your soldiers are in that politically and physically if need be.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.720]   >> Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.720]   It's crazy.
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.720]   >> And I guess the CIA wants to be able to steer all these organizations, but then they
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.720]   just have them go wreck all these countries that weren't doing anything to us.
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:24.720]   It looks pretty nasty.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.720]   >> So what do you think the CIA's endgame is in all this?
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.720]   >> Well, we always talk about the CIA.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.720]   There's like 16 different major intelligence agencies in the United States alone, and the
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.720]   CIA is probably, from the best minds I've talked to, seven different groups.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.720]   That's from David Steele.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.720]   But others agree with that.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.720]   I mean, there's all these different factions.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.720]   I mean, I'll have one faction of the CIA, you know, give me information.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.720]   It's not classified or secret, just information that's always been accurate.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.720]   And then I have another section of the CIA I know that's been after me.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:56.720]   And then they got other sections that just want to make money.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.720]   You got sections that are over the narcotics trafficking.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.720]   You got the sections, you know, the big sections that are over analysis.
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.720]   They're more like Professor Bookworm types.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:09.720]   And then you've got the people that are the actual boots on the ground for the intelligence
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.720]   agencies, the Army and Navy and other commandos.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:16.720]   And they're all patriots.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.720]   >> So if they're allowing this to happen or even fueling it to happen, what do you think
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:22.720]   they're trying to achieve from this?
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.720]   >> It's chaos.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720]   And then they can come in as the saviors over the chaos.
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:26.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:30.720]   >> Well, I mean, it's one thing if you overthrew some bad guy and then put something good in.
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:32.720]   That's still meddling in the foreign affairs.
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.720]   But you overthrow a good guy and you put in ISIS to kill every Christian you find, and
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.720]   then Obama won't let Christian refugees out?
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   He only lets Sunnis out?
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.720]   I mean, it's like diabolical, man.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.720]   I mean, you really look at it, it's like, wow, what have Christians done for the government
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.720]   to have this giant, look at the IRS persecution.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:51.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.720]   >> I mean, the government has a big giant you know what for Christians.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.720]   I'm sick of it, I'm not putting up with it.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.720]   >> And some of the thing about the refugees, and I'm not saying it's not real, but there's
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.720]   kind of some funny moments in the film where we're watching all these stories about millions
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.720]   of refugees, millions of refugees.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720]   And we get in the van and we go there and they're not there.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.720]   And then we go to this location and we can't find them.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:15.720]   And we're constantly looking for where are all these millions of refugees we keep seeing
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720]   on the news.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.720]   They keep evaporating or changing.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.720]   >> Well, they do, once they get to the parent place with the Germans or whatever, they're
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.720]   dispersed.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:24.720]   >> Yeah, that was crazy.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.720]   But I mean, everywhere we got, we just kept getting to places where they were just here,
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.720]   they were just here.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.720]   >> Well, that's because you see them on their lot across the border, 5,000, and then they
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:35.720]   just run for the hills.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:39.720]   >> Yeah, but I think also the news is having a lot to do with it.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.720]   >> Well, we had reporters over in France and England.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.720]   And every day at the tunnel, there's people trying to hijack cars and just wandering around
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.720]   breaking things.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:48.720]   I mean, it's bad.
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:49.720]   >> Yeah, no, no, I know it's really out there.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:54.720]   But I think the way the news, the way the mainstream media is distorting the way it's really going
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720]   down.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.720]   >> I agree, did we ever get the doctor back?
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.720]   Sure, in fact, this is an important clip.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.720]   Democrat calls for surtax on the American people to pay for war against Islamic State.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.720]   They create it, they fund it, they protect it.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.160]   And then they're actually pitching it.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:18.400]   Let's put a tax on all Americans, a war tax, it'll never go away, on everything to pay
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.320]   to fight the group they're publicly funding.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.600]   They'll probably actually give the money directly to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.640]   Here's the over the top clip.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:31.480]   >> President Obama sent us an AUMF, that's Washington speak for a request for a declaration
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.160]   of war against ISIS all the way back in February.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.180]   And we have not taken it up, debated it, and passed it.
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:42.640]   And we owe that to our veterans and to those serving in the conflict against ISIS.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:46.600]   But we also need to stand up and say, how are we going to pay for it?
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.080]   All the previous wars, as you referenced, before Iraq and Afghanistan, had a dedicated
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.440]   war surtax.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:57.880]   And I think that's one way we could fairly pay for it, with a small surtax that exempted
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.520]   active duty military families and veterans.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.120]   >> Folks, the military industrial complex is the most bloated in the world.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.040]   US defense budget is more than half the world defense budget.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.920]   Now the military industrial complex wants more.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.760]   You people want more.
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.320]   And of course, you'll exempt yourself, saying the troops will be exempt.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.320]   They'll bring that back later.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.920]   You won't even give them healthcare.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:26.160]   We deserve, our troops deserve a new tax, directly to pay to fight the group they created.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.840]   I mean, I have never seen more oxymoron.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.480]   Well, I guess I did, the State Department came out yesterday and said, we have brought
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.840]   peace to Syria when they ran the whole destabilization.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:34.840]   Kevin.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.920]   >> Well, what do you think they're trying to do?
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:40.640]   What do you think the end game here in the States is though, in America?
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.200]   >> Destabilize everything, raise taxes on everybody but the elite, collapse everything,
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.200]   consolidate it.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.200]   Real simple.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200]   >> Yeah.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.040]   >> Just exempt themselves, just bring in terrorists, blow everything up, and then literally stick
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.760]   their hands down our daughter's pants at the airport and run them through naked body scanners.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.600]   >> And to turn everything into a ghetto?
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.780]   >> Yeah, that's it, they love it.
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:01.960]   >> My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:05.120]   Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120]   I loved my dad.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.440]   The boy was too stubborn.
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.400]   He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.580]   His excuse, he simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:14.200]   He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.000]   Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated

[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.660]   Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made

[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:39.520]   But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number

[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.880]   We finally got him on the phone.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.880]   Thank you so much for being with us.
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.160]   About five, ten minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:19.800]   Sir, you've been trying to get started here with your incredible historic interviews with
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:20.800]   these ISIS people.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:21.800]   Please continue.
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:22.800]   Give us the big picture.
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:28.360]   In one of the interviews with Kevin, you talked about the fact that it's just unprecedented.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.560]   I believe you said that ISIS is being used to basically take Syria away.
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:36.280]   I mean, what's the geopolitical aim here?
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.560]   Who's really behind ISIS, sir?
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:45.120]   Okay, we have interviewed around 30 ISIS defectors as of now.
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:50.880]   And this question was one of the questions I asked them with Dr. Antipater during our
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:51.880]   interview.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:55.440]   I have three answers to this question.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:02.240]   Most of the time, the defectors answered in a similar way.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:08.320]   The first, they argued that Syria and Iran is behind ISIS.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.720]   The second, Russia is behind ISIS.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:17.280]   And the third, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey behind ISIS.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:26.800]   The ISIS fighters or the terrorists who have been in the field and fought with ISIS think
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:37.040]   that those three countries are behind the fostering factors behind ISIS.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:43.480]   They think Syria, because Syria and Iran are acting together in the region, and they think
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:49.160]   that Assad is trying to show the whole world that if you do not work with me, you have
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:50.160]   to work with these animals.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:51.160]   So here's a very good time.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.160]   The second-
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.160]   I don't think there's any evidence that Assad's behind ISIS.
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:54.160]   This is what they say.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.160]   I'm right now talking about the research.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:56.160]   That was my next question.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:06.680]   How do you know they haven't defected to you to give you this info?
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:12.480]   This is through our connections and my past experience, because I have interrogated and
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:17.840]   interviewed over 10,000 terrorists over the 20 years of time.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:21.840]   So it is basically based on our experience and the trust.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:29.400]   And also, you can see and understand their stories are true, true what they are talking
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.400]   and true their narrative.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:40.280]   For example, when I asked about Russia, they said there are Russian generals who are at
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:43.600]   the age of around 40, 45.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:50.600]   They claim that they are retired from Russian military as generals.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.440]   They converted to Islam, and right now they are fighting for ISIS.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:02.240]   And when they described those generals, they were the ones who were making the critical
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:05.240]   decisions on the battlefield.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:11.720]   And one of the fighters told me that I never trusted them because they were there in the
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.840]   name of Russia.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:15.240]   I asked them if they were Chechens.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:20.880]   He said, "No, these are real, blunt Russians, and they are the ones who were steering us
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.800]   towards the war."
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:26.920]   So I was kind of like checking through the interview.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:32.320]   Sure, the only line I've seen on that, doctor, is that the Russians in Chechnya and other
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.040]   areas basically try to run the radicals out and just say, "Get out of the country."
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.240]   And then some of them have then been coming to Syria.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.560]   But I don't even think the CIA and others who've been caught up to their eyeballs working
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:47.760]   with ISIS and NATO have said that the Russians, well, that would be full spectrum dominance
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.360]   if the Russians were running ISIS and countering ISIS.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:58:00.360]   I don't say running ISIS, but people in ISIS said that those three countries, or those
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:06.360]   three groups at least, have taken it.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.480]   You know, they were at least using ISIS for their own causes.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.480]   You can say that.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:16.040]   I was about to say, I don't know how ISIS would follow Russians.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:19.760]   I mean, I just, I just, look, I mean, you're there, you've done these interviews.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.880]   Well, 60 seconds, we got a break, sir.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:22.880]   60 seconds, one minute break.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.240]   I want to come back and ask you, summing it all up, because I heard you in an interview
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.200]   with Kevin talking about the plan is to bring down Syria, okay.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:33.280]   Well, who's behind that then from your research?
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.920]   I mean, pretty interesting stuff we're hearing here today.

[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:52.880]   Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:54.800]   have the memory of a goldfish.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.120]   We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:04.000]   Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.280]   steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:12.360]   Instead, use your gift cards to help support the InfoWar and get 15% off when you use the

[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.800]   investigative journalism and promoting freedom.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:29.800]   It's so simple.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.120]   Don't throw those gift cards away.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:37.440]   Use that money to get high-quality products and save 15% in the process, all the while
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:40.560]   funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.000]   That's a 360 win.
