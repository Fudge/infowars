[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.
[00:15.000 --> 00:28.000]  Another world, another time, his life was green and good, until the crystal cracked.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.000]  March your calendars, my fellow Americans, my fellow humans across the planet.
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  Monday, December 9th, 2019, the day the sleeping giant that is free humanity began to really awaken and take action.
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  Something very, very magic happened this morning.
[01:05.000 --> 01:23.000]  As Owen Schreuer just spontaneously decided to confront Nadler right as he began his opening statement, I literally had a shot of energy go through me and I ran out to my wife and I said the answer is hitting the streets, the answer is protesting in Congress, the answer is the silent majority rising up.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  Sure, that's a common sense answer, but I felt the energy.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  Five minutes later the phone started ringing, Owen had just taken over the hearings.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  This is amazing what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  So let's go to some of what unfolded the IG report coming out and so much more.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  I will make an opening statement and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  After that we will hear two sets of presentations.
[01:52.000 --> 02:06.000]  We will hear 30 minute breeze opening arguments from councils for the majority and the minority of this.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country and you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes.
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  You are Jerry Nadler, you're the one committing treason, America is done with this, America is sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  We're not going to sit here and watch you run and receive the treason and remove our vote.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  We voted for Donald Trump and there's people removing it because they don't like it.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  Americans are sick of their treason, they're sick of the Democrat treason.
[02:36.000 --> 02:46.000]  We voted for Donald Trump and it wasn't Trump.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  The committee will come to order.
[02:48.000 --> 03:03.000]  Obviously I shouldn't have to remind everyone present that the audience is here to observe, but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  This is Owen Schreuer from infowords.com.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  What's your name?
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  Owen Schreuer.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  I think it's ironic I'm being pulled out of here when the Democrats are the ones committing crimes.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  Thank you.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  I'm being arrested right now for disrupting the Congress.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  I'm a criminal for my first amendment of Rochester.
[03:22.000 --> 03:48.000]  See you right here, folks.
[03:48.000 --> 04:02.000]  We're here at the Central Texas News Center in Austin, Texas where, with your help, we have helped reignite the awakening of the American Republic against the globalist threat.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  But that just started the war with the deep state, the chocombs and others out in the open.
[04:07.000 --> 04:18.000]  So now, in the next 330 days, we're working seven days a week ahead of this critical election to try to keep our populist president who's under incredible attack, Donald John Trump in the White House.
[04:18.000 --> 04:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be out in the streets peacefully bringing information to the American people, but the Antifa terrorists have gotten very, very violent.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  And so we've had to up our game in the face of the global scourge.
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  We're going to have our crew across the United States in this baby going into areas these terrorists would deny us.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  This is the end of the war.
[04:40.000 --> 04:54.000]  And this is our commitment to you to fight harder than we ever have to get the word out and not submit to these pirates and their chocombs backers that would silence the American people because America is rising in 2020.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Be part of it.
[04:56.000 --> 05:08.000]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars with free shipping store-wide and double Patriot points.

[06:25.000 --> 06:54.000]  If you want to turn this world and turn this planet around, all we have to do is have our voices heard and stop complying with the corrupt forces that are on our planet
[06:54.000 --> 07:13.000]  and promoting the good forces. You are those good forces. You are the light in the dark of the night and you belong in the capital, in the state houses, in the legislatures, in the county commissioners, in the city councils.
[07:13.000 --> 07:27.000]  You belong in the neighborhood commissions. You belong in the churches. You belong instead of hiding out in our homes, watching the NFL mesmerize in a trance while the globalists steal our future.
[07:27.000 --> 07:43.000]  It is Monday, December 9th, 2019 and this morning I was getting dressed, getting ready to come into the office and I just was energized as I was starting to walk out of the bedroom and walk out the front door.
[07:43.000 --> 07:57.000]  And my wife said, man, you look wound up. You look like you're been electrocuted or something. You're just like shining. She said, wow, what's going on? And started trying to drag me back on the bedroom.
[07:57.000 --> 08:06.000]  And that's true story. And I said, we're going to take action. We're going to confront the globalist. We're going to call for people to march on D.C. peacefully now.
[08:06.000 --> 08:16.000]  Now is the time for the march on D.C. And we're going to go into the capital and we're going to go into the meeting rooms and we're going to let these traders and criminals know that they're not going to impeach our president for thought crime.
[08:16.000 --> 08:25.000]  And we're going to do it in the streets. We're going to do it in front of the state capitals. We're going to do it everywhere, whether you're one person or a hundred and more and more and more are going to come out.
[08:25.000 --> 08:37.000]  Just like the movie network saying, I'm mad as hell. I'm not going to take it anymore. You're not going to impeach our president because there's reports out. They've got senators ready to flip on the president. They've got all these excuses for them to turn against him.
[08:37.000 --> 08:48.000]  And there's a very good chance they could remove him. They've got a lot of tricks up their sleeves, but not if we are confronting individuals in swing states with the truth, not if we are active, not if we're in the streets.
[08:48.000 --> 08:58.000]  If they see us in the streets of D.C., everybody's got to get on a plane. I'm going to do it as well. And you've got to go to D.C. So it hit me.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  And I even said to my wife, we need people to hit the streets. We need our voices to be heard. We have a sleeping giant to rise up. And she goes, yeah, that's common sense.
[09:06.000 --> 09:19.000]  That's why this tyranny is happening is because we don't follow natural law and we don't stand up for ourselves. And then I was getting a coffee to go loading up my water bottle.
[09:19.000 --> 09:32.000]  Five minutes later and buzzfeed Washington Times Associated Press. They're like, did you tell Owen to do this?
[09:32.000 --> 09:48.000]  That's how they try to trick you all to see like if it was some directive I gave. And I started saying, do what? They started sending me screenshots and images of Owen standing up to Nadler and pointing out that he's guilty of treason.
[09:48.000 --> 10:03.000]  And that one small thing, if more people did it, if more people did it around the Capitol and around the White House and all these live media events with these gaggles of so-called media reporters outside.
[10:03.000 --> 10:12.000]  If people take over these live events, it's over for them because the majority is already awake and upset and angry and knows what's happening.
[10:12.000 --> 10:29.000]  But we are a silent majority, so we have to stop being silent, whether it's a bumper sticker on your car or whether it is calling into a talk show or whether it is posting online or sharing an article or video.
[10:29.000 --> 10:42.000]  Or going to Congress. These are the people's house. The seats weren't even full when Owen and the cameraman Drew got in. And they banned Drew from being there. And this is why the media sort of called me.
[10:42.000 --> 10:56.000]  They said, oh, did you direct this? And I didn't. I told you we were going to be in D.C. Whenever I go into these events, I don't disrupt them because I'm already being attacked at these hearings in many cases, the hearings we show up for.
[10:56.000 --> 11:04.000]  And I'm already not allowed to face my accusers. So I like to sit there and it points out in the media that I'm being attacked, but I can't speak.
[11:04.000 --> 11:13.000]  And I specifically told Owen, don't get arrested when you're in D.C. and also at the Hershey, Pennsylvania event tomorrow night.
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  Owen did this as a citizen. And I'm proud of him. And now is the time for civil disobedience.
[11:19.000 --> 11:28.000]  But they did what I thought they'd do. They barred our camera person as if he'd done something wrong when he didn't even know it was going to happen.
[11:28.000 --> 11:38.000]  Drew didn't even know it was going to happen until Owen did it. They came in. They sat down. That was sort of talking. And Owen couldn't control himself.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  And I probably couldn't have at that point either. You can see Owen coming in right there. It's on C-span. He is hot. He is sick of it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  And then boom, it happened. There's Drew behind him, a young handsome Phel Castro clone.
[11:51.000 --> 12:00.000]  And he's Hispanic. He doesn't look like Phel Castro. He's the biggest Phel Castro. He's like, that's a big Mexican.
[12:00.000 --> 12:10.000]  The point is that he's not allowed to be in there either now. Total discrimination. Owen did that as a citizen.
[12:10.000 --> 12:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, and I'm proud of it. But they can't stop you, ladies and gentlemen, for having your voice heard, however you're going to do it.
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.000]  And the left piled on and said, how dare him do that? Or others say, oh, you're pathetic. You know, you're not going to have any effect.
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.000]  Those are going to make you feel small. It's all military propaganda. Laydown, GI, Tokyo rose. You're going down. We're going to defeat you.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  But the truth is these criminals have overplayed their hand. They're going down unless we don't stand up to them.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  They could push and daring greatly. Fortune favors the bold. They could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[12:50.000 --> 13:02.000]  Now, just before we went live, minutes ago, we got the call. Owen just got out of jail. He is driving back to the Capitol so that we can do a live feed with him from outside.
[13:02.000 --> 13:10.000]  He was in about 15 minutes or so live on air. And he did get arrested. They were saying they were going to charge him with disrupting Congress.
[13:10.000 --> 13:22.000]  Most of the time when leftists fall down and yell and scream, they don't get charged. But we'll see what happens because the crime of being an American standing up to treason is the highest crime to the globalist.
[13:22.000 --> 13:32.000]  So that's all coming up. But I'm telling you, now is the time if you were ever going to go to DC. Now is the time if you were ever going to travel to Congress.
[13:32.000 --> 13:44.000]  They're open public houses to the people. Everyone's so intimidated to be near this that Owen and Drew, I was talking to Drew earlier, had to wait in line about 10 minutes.
[13:44.000 --> 13:52.000]  And they walked in. There were still seats available, not many, but still seats available because everyone's so intimidated of the people's house.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  They're not royalty. It's not Windsor Palace. It's our house. We built it. It's ours.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  Everybody else was in their videotaping. One of the top trending things on Twitter is this video and the truth is getting out.
[14:05.000 --> 14:20.000]  Again, if you decide this is the trigger, like in Fifa Vendetta, at the end of the movie, when the people cross the line and the soldiers stand down, if you decide, then we can en masse go to DC and let these criminals know we're not putting up with it.
[14:20.000 --> 14:31.000]  When the president tweets when lying individuals like Fiona Hill are saying, I don't know, George Soros, I'm not a globalist when she runs his major foundation and writes for theglobalist.com.
[14:31.000 --> 14:40.000]  They say that when he tweets and says I'm innocent, they say that's intimidating witnesses. They say your speech is illegal. They say the president's speech is illegal.
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.000]  And he's surrounded by traders and cowards. He's isolated, sinking into the swamp. We're not. And if we stand here like a bunch of damn spectators, we get what we deserve.
[14:50.000 --> 15:09.000]  So I was downtown at the Capitol last night from 7 to 9 at night, talking to people in bullhorning and speaking out about the war on Christmas and the war on Christianity and the Islamic attack on Christmas events all over the world, from Asia to Europe to Canada to the U.S.
[15:09.000 --> 15:23.000]  And I'm just going to start hitting the streets every day for the next 329 days. You have my confirmed confirmation. I'm going to be in public places for the next 329 days every day.
[15:23.000 --> 15:40.000]  I'm physically able to, not just on air, not just doing more live shows. And I told you last Friday with that video we aired earlier, the armored vehicle rolling out of our garage to go meet our crew in D.C. It's all there right now. We've got lots of peaceful resistance to tyranny planned and that armored vehicle.
[15:40.000 --> 15:54.000]  I'm so glad we were renting it at first that we got it because it just touched over the news media and our topics coming to the mainstream every time with that. So it's another blessing. Thanks to all of you supporting us and keeping us in the game so much taking place.
[15:54.000 --> 16:21.000]  The Special General Report set to drop any minute now. We'll cover it all now.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:55.000 --> 17:10.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:10.000 --> 17:25.000]  Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:25.000 --> 17:37.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:37.000 --> 17:49.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:49.000 --> 18:01.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:01.000 --> 18:14.000]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech. I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago and I've found a few places where it's mentioned, but if you can find it, please send it to showtipstemforewords.com.
[18:14.000 --> 18:23.000]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War II the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[18:23.000 --> 18:37.000]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep. There's a third time when you know you're going to lose but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[18:37.000 --> 18:46.000]  That's a paraphrase. But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit, find our focus and don't give up and take action.
[18:46.000 --> 18:58.000]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three. That's a fact. They fear Info Wars because we are alive. It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[18:58.000 --> 19:12.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate Info Wars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not giving up.
[19:12.000 --> 19:21.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[19:21.000 --> 19:37.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[19:37.000 --> 19:52.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive.
[19:52.000 --> 20:11.000]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  You are Jerry Nadler, you're the one committing treason. America's done with this.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party.
[21:01.000 --> 21:10.000]  We're not going to sit here and watch you run in the streets and remove our vote. We voted for Donald Trump and they're simply removing us and they don't like it.
[21:10.000 --> 21:17.000]  America's sick of their treason, they're sick of the Democrat treason. We know who committed the crimes and it wasn't Trump.
[21:17.000 --> 21:24.000]  It wasn't Trump. It wasn't Trump.
[21:24.000 --> 21:50.000]  It wasn't Trump. It wasn't Trump.
[21:50.000 --> 22:00.000]  They walk in, they sit down a few minutes and Nadler starts talking and Owen just says, this is treason.
[22:00.000 --> 22:09.000]  You're the ones that are engaged in impeachable offenses and that's even what respected liberal law professor Jonathan Turley said, it's cut and dry.
[22:09.000 --> 22:25.000]  They're saying that even if the president didn't do quid pro quo, even if he didn't do anything wrong, it's if they think his intent was something, a thought crime that he's going to be removed.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  Mike Adams said it right. Democrats are summoning the demon of political violence.
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.000]  The next phase of their criminal coup will unleash blood in the streets. That's what's going to happen because if they have the fake trial in the Senate, which is going to happen now, it looks like a sure thing.
[22:40.000 --> 22:50.000]  As I said months ago, it's all rigged. Even if Trump doesn't get removed by the two thirds, because they are death threading and blackmailing those senators.
[22:50.000 --> 22:59.000]  Even if that doesn't happen, then the Democrats are going to get more enraged when Trump, like Kavanaugh escapes their hoax.
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  And I've got a big article up on infowars.com that is beyond critical.
[23:04.000 --> 23:13.000]  Only 19 senators are a firm no against impeachment and there are whispers. Some Republicans may turn on Trump. Of course they are.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  The neocons are the greater threat to Trump than the Democrats.
[23:18.000 --> 23:32.000]  So while everybody laughs at the Democrats, they've taken over most of the major cities and have bankrupted the country and are bringing in millions of quote migrants from Islamic countries that literally hate our guts.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  They've been kicking the live and snot out of this country and fly over country.
[23:38.000 --> 23:52.000]  You know, I love fly over country. I love Missouri and Kansas and Oklahoma and rural areas of Illinois and South Dakota and North Dakota and Tennessee and Louisiana and everywhere.
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  Good people everywhere. Good people in New York. Good people in West Virginia. Good people in upstate California and Oregon.
[23:58.000 --> 24:07.000]  They all run the states. They do the damn work. A bunch of welfare heads, sitting in the cities, running everything telling us how to live our lives and trying to have sex with our children.
[24:07.000 --> 24:22.000]  I couldn't watch those hearings last week. I tuned in a couple times and the professors other than Turley were always bad mouth and fly over country saying people live in the country because they don't like other people.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  Democrats live in the cities because we like people.
[24:27.000 --> 24:39.000]  I mean, they couldn't even shut their mouths about how much they hate rural America on TV. These people hate us, folks.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  Because they live off of us.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  And they know that we're not domesticated like them.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  And so here's the headline up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  World exclusive. The silent majority is no longer silent. The populace uprising has begun.
[25:00.000 --> 25:11.000]  Marker calendar December night 2019 as the date the sleeping giant awoke and tyrants everywhere shook in fear. I wrote that about 30 months ago before he went live.
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  It's now time for you to peacefully and lawfully rise up against the establishment at any event that you can.
[25:18.000 --> 25:31.000]  Even if it's a local city council meeting, it's time to let the government know that it's operates only at the consent of the people.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  Now, why am I making a bold statement like that?
[25:34.000 --> 25:52.000]  Because I felt it this morning as Owen, I checked the time as Owen was confronting Nadler and getting arrested. I literally felt it and got all energized and said, we're going to rise up.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  We're going to take America back. I just envisioned people everywhere doing this.
[25:57.000 --> 26:08.000]  It was also because I just read an article that was going to come start the show, not with impeachment, not with the IG report, but with this.
[26:08.000 --> 26:17.000]  I sent this minutes before Owen stood up in Congress in the middle of the impeachment hearings, which no one else has done.
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.000]  It's only the leftists that go and do that and they're allowed to scream and yell to wherever they want. They don't get arrested most of the time.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  They're going to leave with this and say, this is what they fear already before Owen did this.
[26:28.000 --> 26:37.000]  And again, I know I'm stating the obvious. That's why we need to do it. And then we're going to win instead of sitting here and being victims.
[26:37.000 --> 26:50.000]  Never, Trump or Rick Wilson suggests, he didn't suggest, he says, do it, putting anti-vaxxers in reeducation camps, taking their children from them if they don't take the hundreds of vaccines Big Pharma wants to make us take.
[26:50.000 --> 27:01.000]  And then it goes on to say, we've got to stop the anti-vaxxers. They're moving the fight offline, crashing media coverage events, harassing doctors and private citizens.
[27:01.000 --> 27:09.000]  One group stood with signs outside of Petrus's office, accosting parents and infants in their arms.
[27:09.000 --> 27:22.000]  He calls for anti-vaxxers are a scourge and a strong argument for reeducation camps, the immediate seizure of their property and putting their children into protective custody.
[27:22.000 --> 27:30.000]  The never-trumping monster said. That's what's happening worldwide. That's their operation. What are they scared of? Us saying no to them.
[27:30.000 --> 27:39.000]  You know, they tell you safe and effective. Here's just three vaccine inserts. We went and got this morning at Walgreens.
[27:39.000 --> 27:51.000]  So small, you've got to read it with a magnifying glass. The MMR shot, the blue shot and the Gardasil shot.
[27:51.000 --> 27:59.000]  And I'm going to highlight these today after the show with a magnifying glass I had to buy just to get it done.
[27:59.000 --> 28:07.000]  They made the print even smaller. Here's the flu shot print. Even with a magnifying glass, you can't read it.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[28:11.000 --> 28:23.000]  Where it says can kill you, give you guillon berets, give you cancer, cause type 1 diabetes and they want to make you take this and not have you ask questions about it.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  So now they've censored folks offline. Now they want you and your property taken, your children taken, and you put in a reeducation camp.
[28:30.000 --> 28:41.000]  That's a communist term because you question big pharma with its giant corrupt evil history that has a secret vaccine damage fund paying out billions to damaged people.
[28:41.000 --> 28:51.000]  Rick Wilson. I think he should volunteer to take 100 shots at once, just like the Monsanto guy said he drank roundup that when people asked him to he wouldn't actually drink it.
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  I think Rick Wilson ought to be liable for everybody that gets damaged by vaccines. I think Rick Wilson ought to get what he's calling for.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.000 --> 29:41.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:41.000 --> 30:00.000]  Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 at 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[30:00.000 --> 30:12.000]  My fellow Americans, many of you will have been following the impeachment proceedings brought against me by the Democrats. This political witch hunt is tearing our country apart and not in a good way.
[30:12.000 --> 30:22.000]  While I truly believe that I'm completely innocent of all charges, I have nonetheless decided to make the following announcement. Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[30:22.000 --> 30:32.000]  What you just heard was not President Trump. It was a deep fake that just went live on the internet yesterday. President Trump did not save.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  Now the audio can fool you, but the video really does.
[30:38.000 --> 30:53.000]  If you tune in to us, we'll tell you what's real and what's fake when it's mainstream media that famously has been caught doing thousands of deep fakes like ABC and the supposed curd attack footage that was really not Creek Machine Guns shootout or stuff that Megan Kelly has done to me with deep fakes.
[30:53.000 --> 31:08.000]  These people are sick. Info wars has the history of exposing deep fakes, not being involved in them.
[31:23.000 --> 31:35.000]  We fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see.
[31:35.000 --> 31:53.000]  You have to make the effort 110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stand the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[31:53.000 --> 32:08.000]  That's my ass with everything I got for us, for myself, my family, your family, because we're in this together infowarstore.com.
[32:23.000 --> 32:28.000]  Check in every day to find the new deals.
[32:53.000 --> 33:01.000]  Our stack is also at cost at $29.95 with free shipping and over 100 others at infowarstore.com and support the infowar.
[33:23.000 --> 33:51.000]  A consortium of globalist bullies of multinational corporations that have had their way with countless third world countries who've killed millions, who openly back the Chai comms and the UN is adopting the Chai comm global credit system and face scan to buy and sell as of last week announced by the UN.
[33:51.000 --> 34:03.000]  Carried by Reuters. And Americans have to fight to have free speech online. So now they're, now they're hitting the streets like Owen Shroyer did. I sent him up there to cover the impeachment hearings.
[34:03.000 --> 34:13.000]  Nadler kept it very close to the vest when he's even going to have these events. So the Republicans aren't ready for it. Owen was there. They flew in last night.
[34:13.000 --> 34:27.000]  He just couldn't help himself. He said, you're the ones that are guilty of treason. Maybe we should try to find that video of Jonathan Turley last week saying, you're the ones that are engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors.
[34:27.000 --> 34:40.000]  You're the ones that are involved in abuse of power. If a president can't go to courts and try to block what you're doing to him, then he doesn't even hold the office of president.
[34:40.000 --> 34:50.000]  The citizens have that right. And now you want to impeach him because you say he's not running the country right? That's not a high crime or misdemeanor.
[34:50.000 --> 35:00.000]  Go to drugsreport.com. You can see right there in the middle column, the link, full video, reporter arrested after calling impeachment hearings a scam and you scroll down.
[35:00.000 --> 35:09.000]  We've got the live feed of the show right there. If you'd like to be participants and share the broadcast with people and folks are going to know why he was protesting.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  But bigger than what Owen did spontaneously is what are you going to do because they're trying to impeach him right now.
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.000]  And they'll probably vote by the end of this week or early next week on the indictment of the president that will go to the Senate.
[35:24.000 --> 35:35.000]  Are you going to show up for that? Are you just going to let George Soros and Facebook now this and hundreds of groups run around and do whatever they want?
[35:35.000 --> 35:48.000]  That's a question that you've got to ask yourself. That's a question we all have to ask ourselves. What are we going to do?
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  Our crew is going to be out there tomorrow in Pennsylvania and it has been threatened to kill people.
[35:54.000 --> 36:07.000]  Local Patriot Group had a local restaurant bar rented out to have an event. Antifa's bomb threaded it. Just got the word so they had to cancel that event because conservatives and patriots can't even meet in any city now without Antifa calling in bomb threats.
[36:07.000 --> 36:18.000]  Communist terrorists who want to silence us, but they can't silence you at sporting events, college, NFL, collegiate.
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  They can't silence you at these congressional hearings. They can't silence you outside the hearings.
[36:24.000 --> 36:32.000]  They can't silence you at city council meetings and state house meetings. They can't stop you on street corners or at your church.
[36:32.000 --> 36:39.000]  Now is the time to get out of the coma and to get aggressive and get active, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:39.000 --> 36:55.000]  We're now have Owen. You can see him there on the screen. We'll put him up there. We're going to him here in just a few moments. We've got him hunched up on the sky.
[36:55.000 --> 37:14.000]  Now, we're going to talk to Owen. And then when I start the next hour, I'm going to get into the top story I was going to cover today because it ties into all of this.
[37:14.000 --> 37:27.000]  And it's a life and death situation and it's paramount to what we face as a culture and a civilization. And I've got my crack team of present focused crew in there that are watching for the minute the Inspector General Report comes out.
[37:27.000 --> 37:42.000]  And the second that happens, we're going to be covering it live here today as well. But let's put Owen up on the screen right here. Let's just look at this patriot and the great work he's done and how hard he's fighting.
[37:42.000 --> 37:57.000]  Yeah, we'll put that Skype feed up there because that's an American patriot. That's an American patriot that's taking action.
[37:57.000 --> 38:11.000]  That's simply going on and exercising his free speech in the face of these tyrants that have had a rigged event that created their articles of impeachment months ago and then had it in the bowels of the intelligence committee with the rogue intelligence groups.
[38:11.000 --> 38:21.000]  Admittedly saying we're going to have a coup against the president from the lawyers to the fake whistleblowers to the former CIA directors Brennan and others bragging on television that they were having a coup of the president.
[38:21.000 --> 38:34.000]  Going from denying there was a deep state and a rogue government bureaucracy to bragging about it. And now they believe they can force your will not just on Trump, but on the American people and the world.
[38:34.000 --> 38:42.000]  I think they've jumped the shark. I think you're going to stand up to him. I think you have a right and a duty to. And I think they need to go to prison.
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.000]  They're used to never getting in trouble because the big corrupt system wants to look like it's invincible and they never never send anybody to jail so they can all just have a giant crime spree.
[38:52.000 --> 39:04.000]  And now they've gone too far and that crime spree is coming to an end because they could have just backed off and let us fix the country and turn things around. But they believe they can beat us and silence us one more time.
[39:04.000 --> 39:14.000]  They think they can bully us and sue us and threaten us and arrest us and intimidate us until we submit to them and just go away and just shut up. But we're not doing that.
[39:14.000 --> 39:25.000]  You know, President Trump was reportedly asking Jared Kushner and others, where's Drudge? Why isn't he supporting me as much as he used to?
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.000]  I think the answer is, President, you've not been supporting your supporters that have been persecuted and we understand the swamp isn't following your orders.
[39:32.000 --> 39:42.000]  But we need you to come out against big tech censorship and racketeering and election meddling and voter suppression. We need action from you against the deep state.
[39:42.000 --> 40:01.000]  And we do support you. Now I'm going to go to break and come back with Owen Schreuer here today. But I cannot build up enough how important it is, what he did, how amazing it is, what Owen did, how critical what Owen did is.
[40:01.000 --> 40:15.000]  Because if we don't stop watching football every weekend instead of going and being heard, if we don't start getting very, very active, the globalist, as sure as the sun came up, are going to remove the president.
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.000]  And then once they've done that, they're going to come after everyone because they want to destroy flyover country. I'm going to go to break and come back with Owen.
[40:22.000 --> 40:34.000]  But please, another way you can stand with us in this fight, as we are planning to do a lot of things out there in the streets of America to hopefully trigger you to take more action, is fund us.
[40:34.000 --> 40:56.000]  Do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com. All the big corporations from Amazon to Dix to Walmart to Target's the worst are literally targeting our children with transgenderism, with pedophilia, with open borders, with anti-gun, with anti-Americanism.

[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  Just as important as word of mouth and prayer is the financial support. M4warstore.com.
[42:59.000 --> 43:07.000]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping store-wide and double-patriot points.

[44:00.000 --> 44:10.000]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war for its actual survival, and we're a war against a group that's trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence.
[44:10.000 --> 44:18.000]  That's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families, trying to literally poison us physically and psychically at a spiritual level.
[44:18.000 --> 44:29.000]  Well InfoWars is fighting back, but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught and to be able to put the reporters on the ground and build the infrastructure to tell the truth in the face of their lies.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  That's why we're running Giant Cyber Week Specials, the biggest of the year, the biggest of our history.
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.000]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores that hate your guts and are financing gun control and all the rest of it.
[44:41.000 --> 44:53.000]  Don't do your shopping with the New World Order, Amazon. Do it with InfoWars store. Get high quality supplements, get high quality air filtration, water filtration, Patriot Apparel, and so much more in every order.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.000]  It's a whole bunch of free InfoWars bumper stickers to spread the word. Take action, folks.
[45:00.000 --> 45:12.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do. It's the healthy thing to do. It's the thing that makes all of our lives better, and that's taking care of our individual health.
[45:12.000 --> 45:30.000]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[45:30.000 --> 45:39.000]  But then, of course, it also funds the InfoWars that is so incredibly critical. Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that's a true 360 win?
[45:39.000 --> 45:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[45:48.000 --> 46:00.000]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings, and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfoWarsStore.com. That's InfoWarsStore.com. Please make the right decision.
[46:00.000 --> 46:11.000]  My phone has been ringing off the hook. Dozens and dozens of people have called me. I've gotten all these text messages. The office phone's ringing off the hook. Emails are flooding in.
[46:11.000 --> 46:19.000]  They're saying, can you believe it? 300 Trump ads that were going to run tens of millions of times were pulled by Google.
[46:19.000 --> 46:26.000]  And then it turns out it was done over the summer. Folks, I live this every day. I read the news like nobody else probably.
[46:26.000 --> 46:33.000]  And they have been hitting hundreds of congressional candidates and members of Congress. They've been going after governors, state reps.
[46:33.000 --> 46:40.000]  It's been a rain of terror. Last week they wouldn't let Melania Trump images be sent out saying it was hate speech.
[46:40.000 --> 46:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond censorship. It's total information control. It has to all go through a filter, and that's what AI allows, is what I call information singularity.
[46:51.000 --> 46:59.000]  Not empowering information, but holding it all in like the one ring of Mordor. Trump must act now or they will steal this election.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  This is the rise of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:35.000 --> 47:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, your host, Owen Schreuer, got on an airplane last night with Drew and more of our crew.
[47:45.000 --> 47:52.000]  The armored vehicle was driven up by a crew member by a truck driver. We've got hired to do it to D.C.
[47:52.000 --> 48:03.000]  It's there right now, and they're linking up to go to the Hershey, Pennsylvania, Trump Pence event tomorrow night, and then they're going to be back in D.C.
[48:03.000 --> 48:10.000]  They're also having an event in Hershey tomorrow. I just heard from the event organizers. There's been bomb threats and more, so they've canceled that.
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  The Communist terrorists, again, are pushing us offline with the help of big tech, and they're now trying to silence us on the ground.
[48:17.000 --> 48:25.000]  That's not going to work. Everyone needs to hit the streets and be in the face of the globalists, whether it's in your small town or whether it's in the nation's capital.
[48:25.000 --> 48:33.000]  Owen Schreuer is here to break down what happened today, why he did it, what happened behind the scenes, and what it was like.
[48:33.000 --> 48:49.000]  It's a big national story right now and is really dangerous for the globalist. If it triggers more people to go, cover the events, and legally and lawfully from outside the committee room, let their voices be heard to the media,
[48:49.000 --> 48:57.000]  jumping in front of live feeds, things like that. Again, this is the time for action, Owen.
[48:57.000 --> 49:08.000]  Yeah, and Alex, that's what they're really afraid of. They can arrest Owen Schreuer and put me in jail for a couple hours and make me show up to court and try to intimidate me, but they can't do it to everyone.
[49:08.000 --> 49:17.000]  And that's how we can change the world, Alex, but you know, I've had Congressman Al Green inside a riot against me last night calling me a racist.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  I showed up today. I spoke out during the impeachment scam hearings. I got arrested. I went to jail.
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  I'm standing out here in the freezing rain filing reports. There's nobody that can do this, folks, only at Info Wars. Are you going to see covers like this?
[49:31.000 --> 49:41.000]  But Alex, you know, I have to say, I'm a little ticked off at the fact that I get arrested for disrupting Congress, okay?
[49:41.000 --> 49:50.000]  60 seconds or less of my disruption in Congress. I go to jail. I'm booked. They had to take my fingerprints and everything, gave me a search.
[49:50.000 --> 50:01.000]  I'm doing court in a month. But Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats get to disrupt Congress for three plus years and not a single person has been arrested.
[50:01.000 --> 50:08.000]  Now, look, I don't need President Trump to say that he knows me. I don't need a notification or anything from Trump.
[50:08.000 --> 50:16.000]  But man, President Trump, if you don't do something about these damn treasonous Democrats, then I'm going to be pissed, man.
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  I don't care. I'll come take the slings and arrows just like Trump is doing right now at the very top of this deal.
[50:21.000 --> 50:33.000]  But man, if I get arrested and I had to go to court and all this crap for less than 60 seconds, disruption of Congress, when Congressman Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff are doing that every day,
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  man, that's not how this country works. That's not justice. That's backwards, Alex.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.000]  But letting it happen is aiding and abetting it and expanding on that.
[50:46.000 --> 50:56.000]  They knowingly lied during the election and after they had illegal wiretaps. They lied to Congress and now they've got new lies to obstruct the operation of our country.
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.000]  They've admittedly been trying to plunge the economy to sabotage our populist uprising to peacefully take our country back.
[51:03.000 --> 51:13.000]  And you're absolutely right. And putting up with this and the Justice Department doing nothing and really catering to all this has encouraged the type of criminal activity we've seen
[51:13.000 --> 51:23.000]  until now Democrats are everywhere calling for violence and Trump supporters to die and for Trump to die and for his family to die and his son to be attacked in the damn Congress.
[51:23.000 --> 51:28.000]  So we're telling Trump, take the gloves off. We're taking them off. Aren't we going?
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  Well, that's the question. When is the break back moment here, Alex? I mean, it could have been today. I know there are patriots in that room with me.
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  I know that there's probably patriots that are inside the police force that don't like what's going on.
[51:39.000 --> 51:46.000]  You know, today they decided not to rise up and, you know, let me get arrested and hauled out of there and Jerry Nadler have me arrested probably and, you know.
[51:46.000 --> 51:52.000]  But when is the break back moment? When are people going to say, you know what? No, Owen Schreuer is not the criminal here.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  No, Owen Schreuer is not the one disrupting Congress here. No, Trump is not the problem.
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  Somebody's got to take the whiskey bottle away from the Democrats.
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.000]  When is it going to happen? And look, I didn't expect it to happen today, but it could have. I know there are patriots in that room.
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.000]  Dozens of people could have stood up and started shouting down Jerry Nadler for the treason that they know.
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  I want to be clear. This is this is fruit of the poison tree. They admit it was done in secret in the wrong committee.
[52:16.000 --> 52:24.000]  Now it's come out that SHIF was wiretapping people, then leaking it illegally and acting like the wiretap shows something criminal, which it doesn't.
[52:24.000 --> 52:32.000]  The ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Nunez, his colleague that sits a foot from him talking to Trump.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.000]  They're now leaking members of the Intelligence Committee talking to the president acting like that's illegal.
[52:38.000 --> 52:46.000]  The crime is the fricking spying on the president and Congress, you little chicken net devil worship or SHIF.
[52:46.000 --> 52:59.000]  Yeah, and beyond, Alex. So again, you know, people saw what I did today and hopefully it's enough inspiration to make a real call to action or a desire to take action, because that's what it's going to take.
[52:59.000 --> 53:05.000]  If it's one person every time, then the system's going to win. They can haul me away, put me in jail, put me in court.
[53:05.000 --> 53:12.000]  If it's one person every time, the system will win every time. But if it's one person and then two people, they would have had to shut that hearing down.
[53:12.000 --> 53:22.000]  If 20 people, one after the next, got up and said, you've been obstructing America, you've been lying, you've been using your investigative power for fraud, you need to go to prison.
[53:22.000 --> 53:27.000]  If the FBI, the Justice Department won't do their job, the American people are going to start doing it.
[53:27.000 --> 53:34.000]  But Alex, let's be clear here. There is nothing that Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff fear more than the American people's right to free speech.
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.000]  They don't fear violence. We're not violent revolutionaries. They know that. We're not going to commit them violently.
[53:39.000 --> 53:49.000]  No one's threatening Jerry Nadler. Nobody's threatening with violence. But oh, if people show up to Jerry Nadler's rigged hearings and start shouting him down, guess what?
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  Jerry Nadler's going to start pooping his oversized pants.
[53:52.000 --> 53:59.000]  That's right. The Democrats' official policy is to go to Republican events and shut them down and to have universities ban speech and everything else.
[53:59.000 --> 54:06.000]  But they get 60 seconds from you saying what Professor Turley said that what they're doing is illegal. What they're doing is impeachable.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Oh, then you've got to be arrested and indicted.
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  So that's the action. That's the answer, Alex.
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.000]  Someday, I don't know when it's going to be, but someday someone is going to feel inspired enough to stand up and say, you know what?
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  No, I agree with that man. You're trying to arrest right now who's innocent.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  And then another person. And then it's a tidal wave, Alex. And then there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[54:26.000 --> 54:34.000]  And then all of America's awakened and the crooks like Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, they'll be the ones hiding from police.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  Oh, and I want you to stay there for a couple more segments. I know you got to get back to work there.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  And I'm not going to let folks even know the next moves because I told you guys do whatever it is you think's best.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  But we've got a lot planned there in Hershey, Pennsylvania tomorrow and more.
[54:45.000 --> 54:58.000]  But Owen, when we come back, I want to talk about why you decided to do that today and then their response and the fact you said a grassroots level that I was literally telling my wife while you were doing it.
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.000]  I have a feeling that the uprising is going to begin today and that people are just going to hit the streets and then I have faith in the American people.
[55:04.000 --> 55:12.000]  It's going to happen. We're going to beat them. And I literally was electrified. My wife was like, whoa, you know, you are like on fire.
[55:12.000 --> 55:20.000]  She said, you're like an electricity coming through you. But that was the very minute I checked because I learned five minutes later, people sort of calling me that you were doing that.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  I could feel the literal spiritual force. But I want to point something out.
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  Alex, that's because it's God. It's not me. Absolutely. And I can feel the disturbance of the force.
[55:30.000 --> 55:38.000]  We're going to talk about when we come back. But we have a multimedia operation, radio, TV, internet, drugs linked to us that helped boost it massively.
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  It was something like a half million people on the page right before we went live. I don't even know what it is right now. The page he's linked to, the drugs linked to right in the middle column.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  People keep asking, what's going on with Drudge? He wants action. He wants resistance. He wants us to take the left on.
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.000]  If Trump's going to sit there and just have everything's okay, then why not go ahead and run with the leftist headlines?
[55:57.000 --> 56:05.000]  That's what this is coming down to. We need to get out of the mud. We need to take action. And the fact that info wars even exist.
[56:05.000 --> 56:14.000]  They hate it so much that we can show you what's really happening, that we can let people know that the only voice is not the corporate, globalist, deceptive, chai, combat voice.
[56:14.000 --> 56:30.000]  So this is an amazing time. I'm standing in the listeners. Ladies and gentlemen, we have the hyaluronic super silver skin cream that has the vitamins, the minerals, and women that know about this, that go to Ulta and get high-end brands that are twice the cost for just hyaluronic acid.
[56:30.000 --> 56:47.000]  Read this and they go, oh my gosh, coconut oil, and it's got the silver solution, and it's got the other high-quality essential oils in it, and the hyaluronic acid, the 3.4 ounce tubes are back in stock.
[56:47.000 --> 57:00.000]  Great gifts for your wife, great gifts for your husband, because this isn't just about skin looking good. This is a silver barrier patented that protects you from the viruses and the bacteria at the skin level.
[57:00.000 --> 57:10.000]  It really is next level. Look at those 100% reviews. We have it without the essential oil. We have it with the essential oil. We have it in the smaller 1 ounce tubes as well.
[57:10.000 --> 57:18.000]  That's discounted 25% off. When we do it at 50% off, that was a mistake. That's at cost when we do that. We can't run everything at cost anymore.
[57:18.000 --> 57:30.000]  A lot of the items you see being sold at cost right now is because we're clearing inventory of great products just to fund ourselves in the next year, and the next year prices have to go up because I've actually been doing the accounting and the modeling just to keep us on air through 2020.
[57:30.000 --> 57:49.000]  So please get products you need at infowarsstore.com, get your bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, it's the strongest out there, get your fish oil, get your krill oil that's back in stock, get your brain force or turbo force, double patriot points, free shipping, huge deals, too many to list, infowarsstore.com.
[57:49.000 --> 58:04.000]  Twilight is here. The sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020, only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[58:04.000 --> 58:22.000]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection. He's completely surrounded and to pray for him to have discernment and to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[58:22.000 --> 58:39.000]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office and that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down, but that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him that the globalist could win.
[58:39.000 --> 58:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for infowars and please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalist. Thank you and God bless you all.
[58:50.000 --> 58:58.000]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Infowars with free shipping store-wide and double Patriot points.

[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  All right, I am really fired up. If you just joined us, Owen Schwerer got arrested this morning, our great reporter. He just spontaneously, as a citizen, had to say something to Nadler at the beginning of this illegal process.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  They say they've got the votes. They're going to go to the Senate. The others say they may have the votes in the Senate. I sense danger. I see it. Lord Vader is in danger.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  I'm not the floor of the segment the next because I was interrupting. I'm so wound up. Why did you do it? What was it like? What happened behind the scenes? And then what is your message to the American people?
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Well, Alex, anybody who has been following me knows that I'm not afraid to confront a crowd of people or congressmen or really anybody.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  But specifically in this incident, I had, I was harboring some regrets, Alex, because we were down here in DC about a month ago and forgive me if I'm shivering. There's freezing rain happening right now.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  By the way, no one else will sit out here and do this report, folks. Only Infowars. You can check me on that, guaranteed.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  But Alex, I had was harboring some regret because I didn't stand up during the Roger Stone hearings. I didn't stand up during the Roger Stone trials. And I knew that was a rigged trial.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  We knew what they were doing to Roger. We knew they were rigging the jury and rigging the prosecution and the judge and everything. And I sat there and I obeyed the system.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  And I was a good little slave and a good little peon. And I didn't say anything. And I regretted it. And I didn't want to take that same regret back to Austin, Texas with me this time.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  And it was probably providential. Obviously, I love Roger Stone and he's an innocent man and we want him freed and we hope he gets a presidential pardon. But on the overall aggregate of things, the impeachment against Trump is just a little bit bigger than the Roger Stone rigged case.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And so I knew that there was no way I could come back to Austin, Texas without confronting Jerry Nadler and the Democrats. And there's another element to this, Alex. Infowars, people don't want to give us the respect we deserve.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And that's fine. We'll be the dark night. But, you know, I hope that people in the media and Republicans in Congress saw what we did here today. And they realize, guess what? There's people that are still out there.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  There's people that are ticked off. There's people that are fed up. And if you're a Republican in Congress and you're fed up, well, it's time to speak up. It's time to take action.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And so maybe this one little act of resistance today can inspire 10 acts of resistance tomorrow. And then those acts can inspire 1000 next week and so on and so forth.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  And then we won't have to deal with these rigged hearings and fake impeachment scams and Jerry Nadler's and Adam Schiff's.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  But we got a long way to go, Alex. But unless you take that first step, I forget the old adage.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  The journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step. Exactly. So this was maybe not a single step for me today. Perhaps maybe a long stride or one in many strides.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  But I just hope that people realize you have the power, folks. I mean, yeah, you're going to, I mean, don't get me wrong. The system is going to try to crush you.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  I mean, look at what's happened to us. I don't need to go into details. But again, look at the censorship we endure. Look at the attacks that we endure.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  But America and the world has gotten into this because nobody wants to put skin in the game. And we've laid down to so much that now don't say mother and father teach five year olds how to have sex with adults.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  I mean, true eagles out in the open because it has a hunger and we haven't had a hunger for freedom. Well, guess what? The hunger is back.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  We're going to break here in a minute. I want to come back and talk more about this. You're not allowed in the Capitol right now.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I guess they'll let you back in. I was the one saying shoot live in front of the Capitol. Sorry, you're freezing to death out there.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  But it is a powerful shot. But when we come back, I want to set the table here for what's coming next if we don't take action.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  But the fact that almost no one is actually confronting these people and no one's calling them on it. That's why it makes it so big when you said you're the one's guilty of treason.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  No one's selling the nation out. As Professor Turley said, that's why it's all over the news. It's so huge right now and why a million people are on that article.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  The DrudgeReport.com link to right there in the middle. It's got the live feed of the show and what you did because in a nation of people not taking action, the man that does stand up is king.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  I mean, look at how you took action right there. It's like the emperor's new clothes. Little kid that stands up and says the emperor is naked. You just did that.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Well, they're right back. Owen Schroyer.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  My fellow Americans, many of you will have been following the impeachment proceedings brought against me by the Democrats, this political witch hunt is tearing our country apart and not in a good way.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  While I truly believe that I'm completely innocent of all charges, I have nonetheless decided to make the following announcement. Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  What you just heard was not President Trump. It was a deep fake that just went live on the Internet yesterday. President Trump did not say.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  Now the audio can fool you, but the video really does.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Soon into us, we'll tell you what's real and what's fake when it's mainstream media that famously has been caught doing thousands of deep fakes like ABC and the supposed curd attack footage that was really knob Creek machine gun shootout or stuff that Megan Kelly has done to me with deep fakes.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  These people are sick. Info wars has the history of exposing deep fakes, not being involved in them.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  The energy level on this planet and this country is off the charts. We are at the crossroads right now deciding the future destiny of humanity at a level never before done.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  The lawyer arrested this morning for simply getting up for 60 seconds. He didn't resist and just saying you're the ones that are guilty of treason. You're the ones that are obstructing this nation. You're the ones that are lying about the president. You're the ones that want to impeach him for thought crime.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Judiciary committee. It's all began in the intelligence committee down in the basement. That's exactly what liberal law professor Jonathan Turley said last week what Owen said to their faces, the evil citizen exercising his speech in that rig kangaroo event. Here it is.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  We can't emphasize this enough and I'll say it just one more time. If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime in misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it isn't abuse of power. It's your abuse of power.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the president for doing. We have a third branch that deals with conflicts of the other two branches. And what comes out of there and what you do with it is the very definition of legitimacy.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Now, here's what Owen said this morning and the left calling for him to be imprisoned. They're calling for his death on Twitter. I mean, it is just insane. They're telling him you don't have any power. We're going to indict your president. He's going to be removed. We're coming for you next.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  I'm so angry that nationalists and the silent majority, the sleeping giant might actually wake up, might actually take action that you might peacefully, legally and lawfully take action. Here's what Owen had to say.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country. And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes. You are, Jerry Nadler. You're the one committing treason. America's done with this.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  America's sent to the trees. We're committed by the Democrat Party. They're not going to sit here and watch you run in the streets. They're going to remove our vote. We voted for Donald Trump. And their people are going to remove this because they don't like it.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  America's sent to the trees in China. They're sent to the Democrats' region. We all committed crimes and it wasn't Trump. Trump is innocent.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Those of us who we were hit with on solar panels just had hundreds and thousands of employees, think society is greater than what we think it is.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Obviously, you don't wanna get in any of them, but you don't want to be in any of the dictatorial spheres.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Next I have a question about Moran Sand.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:50.680]  rally in Pennsylvania. It's a battleground state. It's not too far from DC and the East
[1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:57.000]  Coast. So you assume that the left is going to bus Antifa or Trump protesters out there.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.480]  But you know, back to what happened today, I think that probably Jerry Nadler had more
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:07.320]  fear today than he ever had in his life. And that's because not because of anything physical,
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:11.340]  not because we're going to be violent, but because he saw someone stand up against him.
[1:10:11.340 --> 1:10:15.560]  And these people are not used to that. They're used to just running America over. They're
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:19.400]  used to just defying American law. It's amazing. Once you get in Congress, you can just do
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:24.000]  whatever the hell you want. You're above the law, apparently. So they can disrupt Congress,
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:31.800]  but I'm not allowed to do so. Maybe this starts a wave of citizen activism against this Democrat
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:37.640]  treason. And that's what it deserves. Because if, look, folks, I mean, we can sit here and
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:41.600]  ask Trump to do stuff all day long. And believe me, I get it. But if we're not going to take
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:46.200]  action, then can we really blame Trump? If you're not going to take action, can you really
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:50.320]  blame Trump for anything? I don't know if that's really, I don't know if that's really
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:54.520]  fair. And yeah, it's frustrating to see this going on. But again, this is our country, Alex.
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:11:00.360]  I mean, this is America. This is the American citizens who run this country, not Jerry Nadler
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:05.720]  or Adam Schiff or Nancy Pelosi. Okay. They work for their constituents, but it hasn't
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:09.560]  been that way because their constituents have been asleep for so long. So they've been
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:14.680]  doing whatever they want. But you know, Alex, as we're standing out here, the rain keeps
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:18.280]  coming down harder. It keeps getting colder. But I just want to say this to the Info Wars
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:25.320]  audience. You know that you have our commitment. And I said before I left, I want to fund
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:32.400]  this trip with the audience going to infowarstore.com and just buying the limited edition Space
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:36.320]  Force t-shirt. I wanted to sell 10,000 or however many we have left. It's limited edition
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:41.160]  t-shirt. But this is how we do what we do. And I'm just going to be perfectly clear right
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:46.600]  now. I'm going to be perfectly honest with the audience. Alex Jones has offered me a
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:51.120]  lot of raises and a lot of bonuses. And I turned them down, folks, because I want him
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:56.520]  to invest in the company and look at how far it's come. We're still here despite all the
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.960]  censorship. And I'm thankful because, hey, I've been censored. It's no secret all the
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:03.720]  platforms that I've been banned off of too. So I thank God for this audience supporting
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:08.080]  Info Wars so that I can have that platform where I can do events like this and have my
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:12.760]  free speech. But it's only possible with your support at infowarstore.com. So folks, whether
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:17.000]  it's a Space Force t-shirt limited edition, whether it's the nascent iodine life changing
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.680]  survival shield X2, whether it's the bodies for soreness and inflammation after physical
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:27.480]  activity or if you just have achy joints, it's all at infowarstore.com. And it literally
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:32.160]  funds this. I mean, it literally funded my flight here, our rent a car. I mean, all of
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:36.800]  it. It's going to fund the car to get to Pennsylvania. And we're building an independent
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:42.320]  true media organization that the globalist fear and we're the model of what will bring
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:46.560]  down the globalist. And that's why we're so critical. And we've got the armored vehicle,
[1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:50.440]  which doesn't just protect us from antifa as we can pull into crowds of them. Then whenever
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:55.960]  we show up, it dominates the news. And so then what we're talking about dominates the news.
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:00.920]  And it's another way to pull these stunts. And we've done it with helicopters. We've
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:04.880]  done it with aircraft. We've got to we're going to be projecting lasers legally up on
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:12.280]  walls with big messages this year, 329 days out. I am putting my house on the market so
[1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:18.920]  I can sell my house to expand and hire some more crew through 2020. And that's great.
[1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:23.360]  I want to do that. That's why I always did that to have backup money that this is the
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:28.640]  total commitment, the big fight. It's on there's no future. If we don't defeat your globalist,
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:33.640]  it's easy to do what we're doing. It's easy to take action because laying down and taking
[1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:39.440]  it is the worst thing on earth. Getting on our knees, sucking on globalist boots is impossible.
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:44.560]  People say, Alex, thanks for not selling out. I physically cannot do it. You understand
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:49.480]  folks, Owen can't stop. I was out working again till 10 o'clock last night. So is Rob
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:55.520]  do. We love it. Owen. Well, and Alex, I don't even know if you've seen that. But last night
[1:13:55.520 --> 1:14:02.040]  we arrived in DC, uh, uh, somewhere around midnight and I confronted Congressman Al Green.
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:06.200]  And he literally stirred up an entire crowd of people at the airport, inside of the whole
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:10.400]  crowd of people at the airport against me, calling me a racist, literally calling me a
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:14.560]  racist for five minutes. I have a whole thing on tape. So we're relentless. And if people
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:19.120]  are asking, how can you take action? We're showing you the model. I don't expect people
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:22.960]  to go out there and be Owen Schreuer showing up at every event with their loud obnoxious
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.600]  pompous ass voice, but you can do something. You can do something locally. You can travel
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.680]  and do something maybe once a year. I mean, by the way, you keep running into Al Green
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:35.280]  because he comes from Houston. You're from Austin. You keep running into him at the DC
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:40.560]  airport. And yeah, uh, I saw the last time it happened. He called you racist and literally
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:45.040]  he's trying to inside a mob with that thinking black people are dumb. Of course it didn't
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:49.960]  work. Oh, and, uh, but I mean, this guy is a terrorist and it shows who the left is.
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:55.080]  Where do people find the latest video? Well, you know what, Alex? Honestly, I'm not even
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:58.680]  going to say because they'll go and ban it and we're just lucky that it's even out there,
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:02.840]  but I'm putting it all out on my Twitter and I know info wars.com is where you can find it too.
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:06.440]  But you know, we don't want to out some of these channels that upload our stuff at the risk of
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:10.760]  them getting censored, but we always carry it at info wars.com. So you can find it there.
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:16.120]  But, but the sad thing is, Alex, Al Green is a congressman and he sounds exactly like some
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:21.720]  low IQ Trump protester out on the streets of a Trump rally. And this is a congressman.
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:26.040]  I mean, this is how far our Congress has fallen. These are our leaders,
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:30.840]  nitwits and low IQs like Jerry Nadler and Al Green. I happen to like Al Green. I like the fact
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:35.880]  he talks to me, but is he really that immature and low IQ that he just discounts what I'm saying
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:41.000]  to him by calling me a racist? That's pretty sad if that's the case. And if not, if these people
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:47.160]  are actively and consciously engaging in these lies in this treason, in this sedition, then folks,
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:50.680]  we're dealing with a whole nother issue. And if you don't take action, well, you know what's
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:53.800]  going to happen. You won't have America. You won't have freedom anymore. That's right. Now's the time
[1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:58.520]  to take action. We salute you all and stay there. I'm going to say bye to you. We can all agree.
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:04.120]  These are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a

[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:11.960]  Bitcoin. Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:16.840]  equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace. Inspired by entrepreneurs
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:21.000]  who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.440]  manufacture dozens of critical digital assets. Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:32.040]  have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:37.000]  deposited into your bank account each month. Don't miss this one, stake your claim today.

[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:51.560]  Call now 800-600-3388. 800-600-3388. Equipment offer poses a financial risk
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:54.520]  to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell
[1:17:54.520 --> 1:18:01.480]  a security which requires an offering document. Driving into the operations center this morning,
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:06.520]  it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I need to reach directly out of the audience and just spell
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:11.800]  out the facts. When you spend your money at places like Dick's Sporting Goods, you're financing a
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:17.080]  group that gives huge amounts of money to gun control disarming you and your family. Then when
[1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:21.400]  you go down the list and look at these companies like Walmart, did you know they're doing the same
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:26.040]  thing now? Did you know that almost every big box store, including Target, they're the worst,
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:32.200]  are actually funding the transgender movement targeting children? Do you know what Jeff Bezos
[1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:39.320]  and Amazon's up to? Ladies and gentlemen, it'll make your head spin. Why in the hell are we supporting
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:43.960]  these people? Why are you going to buy your Christmas presents for your family from these

[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:23.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:44.120]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:47.320]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:56.040]  You notice that they're all wearing American flag pins now and American flag style ties and
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:02.280]  we love the Constitution. We love America and we're the moral authority. And as a Catholic,
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:09.000]  I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:14.360]  in a way that is full a heart full of love and always prayed for the president and I still
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:20.280]  pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So don't mess with me when it comes
[1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:26.200]  to words like that. This is the Democrats that want God out of the schools and have done it,
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:31.480]  that want to abort babies, want to keep them alive, want to kill old people with euthanasia,
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:35.320]  the case for killing, granting. These are the people that are allowing Namblood to go,
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:41.320]  have events with children unannounced in public schools in many cases, convicted child rapists
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:46.040]  running it. And we're told that, oh, the void, I see this all over the news, the void once filled
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:51.400]  by evangelicals, that's a new talking point, and Christians is now filled by the Democrats.
[1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:56.360]  Mike, it seems to me that Nancy Pelosi is doing a lot more than serving a speaker at the house.
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:22:01.800]  She's filling a void, a leadership void and a moral void in this country. By the way,
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:07.880]  by the way, a moral void that evangelicals used to fill, a moral void now that they do not fill.
[1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:11.720]  You're like, well, Jerry Nadler, an America hater, just because he wore a red, white and
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:16.120]  blue tie to the day doesn't mean that. He loves the country. No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:20.120]  America was never great. It's never going to be that great. Cuomo. We're not going to make
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:27.480]  America great again. It was never that great. All of them say that, all of them do that. They've
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:33.160]  sold the country out. They're globalist. But now they're going to protect America in due process
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:42.600]  from that foreign Russian agent. Oops, record skips. I mean, Ukrainian agent, Donald Trump.
[1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:47.400]  People are like, this doesn't make any sense. They don't care. They just want a spectacle to
[1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:51.480]  legitimize their attempt to remove the president. People say, well, they didn't get him on Russia
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:55.320]  gate. They're not going to get him on this. They're getting him by distracting and diverting
[1:22:55.320 --> 1:23:00.520]  and not getting in trouble themselves by changing the subject. And they say, we don't want this
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:08.520]  impeachment, but it's with great moral authority. We have to. It's the right thing for America.
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:16.360]  Sadly, but with confidence and humility was allegiance to our founders and a heart full
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:23.880]  of love for America. Today, I am asking our chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:30.680]  I do not wish this moment on the country. It is not a pleasant task that we undertake today, but
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:36.520]  we have each taken an oath to protect the Constitution and the facts before us are clear.
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:41.960]  The Speaker of the House instructed House Committee chairs to begin drafting articles
[1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:50.200]  of impeachment against the president of the United States. That is a very solemn duty and solemn
[1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:55.240]  undertaking. Meanwhile, the day Trump got elected impeachment begins now, we'll get him
[1:23:55.240 --> 1:24:01.080]  out of the insurance policy. The coup starts now. But now they're, this is very solemn.
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:08.280]  Reporters like, do you hate Trump? How dare you say that? I'm a Christian. I love everyone.
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:16.520]  I am your moral authority. I run the capital of baby parts sale sale San Francisco,
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:21.160]  where we arrest investigative reporters that expose that we keep babies alive and deliver
[1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:27.080]  them with their hearts still beating to be dissected in medical experiments. I'm Nancy Pelosi.
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:38.520]  I am your Lord and Savior. I'm your moral authority. I'm Nancy Pelosi.
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:48.200]  Ha. Ladies and gentlemen, the IG report just dropped. That's why I was running that special
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.960]  report. I'm going to play a few more minutes of important information. I'm going to come back
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:58.120]  from break. I'm reading it right now. So I'm out of breath because I've just been running back
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:04.440]  and forth from my office. So we're going to go to this report and then we're going to come back
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:09.800]  on the other side and we'll get into the specter general report and so much more that's happening
[1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:14.040]  today. And then they're calling for the arrest and imprisonment all over the place of anybody
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:19.000]  that refuses vaccines, which is so amazing and so criminal. This is secret testing on the public's
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:24.040]  what it is. That's all coming up as well. There is just so much we're going to be doing today.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:30.760]  We'll also open the phones up and get your take on all of this. Let's let's look at the mainstream
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:40.360]  media, though, that really wants to shut down your voice. Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:45.080]  theorist Alex Jones. I am now completely banned. Now, one of the wars, of course, is that web show
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:49.800]  and website led by Rachel Hollick, Alex Jones. I want them shut down. I want them silent. I want
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:54.120]  them muted. I think they are horrible for our society. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:58.760]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying,
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:02.680]  can you ban this person? These are very extreme individuals. And no matter what anyone tells
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:07.480]  you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them. Basically,
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:11.800]  they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook is saying. Those individuals
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:16.280]  include people like right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Organizations like Media Matters have
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:24.440]  pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other info wars pages had just simply circumvented any
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:29.480]  ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram. If you don't like someone on Facebook,
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:33.960]  don't follow them. It's not that hard to figure out. Facebook, are you going to do something about
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:39.480]  the liberals who call me the n word? No, because big tech is only interested in going after
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:43.640]  conservatives. You know, the really dangerous ones. Dangers as in saying things that Mark
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:48.680]  Zuckerberg doesn't like. President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:54.440]  info wars. Billy Weaver social media's hall monitor Frank Stelter was not very happy about it. He is
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:58.840]  promoting the same alternative universe as info wars. Back to your point, though, about the info
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:03.800]  wars presidency. I want to know and I tweeted this other day, what is the difference at this point
[1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:10.600]  between Trump's Twitter feed and info wars.com info wars content is useful to him info wars
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:15.480]  personalities align with them. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:20.760]  I think they are horrible for our society. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:28.920]  muted. Don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it's a
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:37.640]  500 page report. And it's printing right now. DOJ inspector general releases report on FBI
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:45.800]  conduct finds clear abuse of FISA process. It's posted up on info wars.com. Obviously, zero
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:52.840]  hedge.com is posted at dredgerport.com has got it posted as well. USS department inspector general
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:59.080]  finds opening of FBI probe into Trump campaign advisors was legitimate. We told you that was
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:10.200]  coming told you properly authorized congressional source. And then it goes on FBI overstated its
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:15.560]  confidence in steals reliability has contributing the FBI investigation.
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:21.400]  The evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory. Nevertheless,
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:25.960]  investigation surveillance was pushed towards the duration of the campaign even the president's
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:29.560]  administration. So everything was showing Trump was innocent, but they didn't care.
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:39.080]  The first FISA application drew heavily upon not entirely upon reporting to support the
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:43.240]  government's position that page was an agent of a foreign power, which of course he wasn't.
[1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:48.680]  So yeah, it's what we've known for years. What we told you two years ago from the courts inspector
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:53.800]  general that it was that it was all based on a lie. But they whitewashed it like we told you
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:29:02.040]  they would. We told you fellow patriots. My name is Todd Savage founder of black rifle real estate

[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:11.160]  to talk about one of your product a little bit about me i'm 245 pounds i work about 10 to 13 hours
[1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:17.240]  a day at ups and make a long story short i used to have a problem with aterol i do have adhd but
[1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:21.240]  you know i was taking aterol for its energy boosting properties you know i kind of got a
[1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:25.160]  little out of hand and you know i listen to you religiously in my truck every day so i tried
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:30.040]  your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product changed my life but turbo force really

[1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:17.160]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak you think just let me think even now
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:21.960]  orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns supposed to be on their way it's chance
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:29.640]  to settle down why because while the truncheon may be used loo of conversation words will always
[1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:35.160]  retain their power words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen the
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:41.880]  enunciation of the truth the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:45.720]  that you decided sir you wanted it through a proof you told me every television in longer
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:51.320]  cruelty and injustice intolerance and depression and where once you have the freedom to object
[1:33:51.320 --> 1:33:57.080]  and think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:04.200]  conformity and selecting your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame well certainly
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:09.160]  there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but again
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:16.360]  truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror i know why you
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:24.360]  did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a myriad of problems
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:30.920]  which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:36.600]  and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor adam subtler he promised you order
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:48.440]  he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:55.880]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:13.000]  come we are the resistance we are the info war well we told you we kept hearing from fox news
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:20.280]  that every two weeks that in another two weeks we're going to get the inspector general report
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:24.600]  and then it's going to call for all these indictments and it's going to say it was all
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:35.560]  criminal and obama and hillary clinton ran it and now we have the inspector general report
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:44.040]  and it does exactly what i predicted it would it says a couple of low-level fbi agents and people
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.880]  didn't follow procedures you know like washing your hands after you go to the bathroom
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:58.280]  or look in both ways and you cross the street but that the investigation was legitimate when it was
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:08.040]  opened and they've exonerated these criminals so there it is a doj ig report finds russia probe
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:15.320]  wasn't politically motivated but separate from serious performance failures oh it was all just a
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:21.240]  big mess up those illegal warrants and lying to congress and the spying fbi director raised
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:27.640]  response to inspector general report the report can close the fbi crossfire hurricane
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:31.800]  investigation they later said didn't didn't exist remember a few years ago that i made that up
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:36.520]  and related investigations of certain individuals were opened in 2016 for an authorized purpose
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:43.640]  and with adequate factual predication the illegal spying on the campaign the report
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:50.040]  also detailed instances in which certain fbi personnel at times during 2016 2017 period reviewed
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:57.400]  the oig did not comply with existing policies neglected to exercise appropriate diligence
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:01.960]  or otherwise failed to meet the standard of conduct that the fbi expects of its employees and that our
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:08.360]  country expects of the fbi we are vested with significant authorities and it is our obligation
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:14.040]  as public servants to ensure that these authorities are exercised with objectivity and integrity
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:19.400]  anything less falls short of the fbi's duty the american people so you shouldn't talk about
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:25.320]  insurance policies and hillary's gonna win by a million points and all the rest of it and we're
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:29.160]  digging through it right now but it's it's already what we knew they already got us ready for it
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:37.400]  it's not what mysterious eight-chan boards told us that the millions of indictments everybody's
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:42.440]  going to prison trust the plan you know by the end of 2017 they'll all be arrested
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:46.440]  sessions is the greatest crisis slice bread
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:57.640]  and you see trust the plan hope and change well guess what we are the plan our audience of activists
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:04.360]  we got trump elected we've exposed globalism and world government we're taking action we're moving
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:09.560]  forward and we're not going to back down we're not going to take it lying down
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:15.640]  and no employer did but many americans know they need to do and that's going to congress and these
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:20.280]  fake impeachment hearings that have been done illegally that are the crime and said you're the
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:24.520]  traders you're the criminals bringing down america trying to sabotage our economy our border our
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:29.640]  sovereignty because you're not going to get it out of the swamp appointed by bush senior
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:41.800]  him two terms of the clinton's two terms of bush and two terms of barack obama
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:53.240]  you know that's a lot of years that's 20 what is it 28 29 years of just as the clinton's
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:59.640]  and you add george w on we're up there at 30 something years of having really bad evil people
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:06.680]  and they're bringing their people in and selling the nation out and engaging illegal spying and
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:17.240]  just oppression of the people and now the demonization of america even existing
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:26.600]  and now we're going to see all the anonymous groups tell us go to sleep lay down don't hit the streets
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:32.280]  trumps gonna win trumps invincible trust the plan as we one go we all go
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:42.840]  and trumps saying you know oh no sessions is horrible and oh these people are horrible and
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:47.000]  and this is treason and this is crazy and the justice department needs to take action
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.640]  but the anonymous groups go oh that's all a cover everything's fine the president's sneaking up on
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.520]  him no we're the ones getting snuck up on
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:07.000]  and watching election meddling take place and voter suppression and the president with 328 days
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:15.240]  and change left it's 329 today now needs to understand just how out of control all of this
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:21.080]  is and of course the system's going to protect itself and they're going to move ahead with their
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:25.080]  fake impeachment all done illegally and they're going to go to the senate and this signals
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:31.400]  weakness of the president now we've got this report up on info wars dot com it's so important and i
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:41.000]  agree with michael steider only 19 senators are a firm no against impeachment and there are whispers
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.560]  some republicans may turn on trump then it goes into their statements and the type of blackmail
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:51.000]  and arm twisting and payoffs that are going on you don't know the pressure they'll push you under
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:54.520]  believe me i've been through it and have not wavered
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:41:04.040]  but the system wants you to believe everything's fine trump is invincible you don't need to rally

[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:07.800]  find that at a young age as well and the more they can be accepted at this age you're not going to
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:12.920]  face it further on because the children will be accepting now and we'll be accepting this diversity
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:16.840]  around them look at that cult leader she's going to make you accept islam she's going to make you
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.040]  accept writing love letters to the same sex these children shouldn't be made to write love letters
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:28.200]  to anybody this is sexualization of children at point blank range but it's the it's the less
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:33.960]  lie ruining the innocence the plan is to reduce population so a large number of people don't
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:40.840]  have same sex or different sex relationships that then produce offspring that's in my film
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:45.640]  in game it's in the government documents it's the plan how do you get people to sterilize
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:52.200]  themselves call it transgenderism and it comes to you from liars like pocahontas that told you
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:57.640]  she was a native american when she knew she wasn't a native american and now she tries to backtrack
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:03.880]  and says she shouldn't do that here she is in oklahoma and my three older brothers and i've
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:10.920]  learned about our family the same way most people do from our mom and from our dad uh my family's
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:19.800]  very important to me and that's why uh many years ago i sometimes identified as native american
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:25.800]  boston glow did a big investigation about this um gosh for about a year and a half ago never had
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:34.040]  anything to do with any job i ever got or any benefit um but uh even some i shouldn't have done it
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:38.200]  that's another lie she got into law school on it it was on her bar card
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:45.560]  that's how she did all of that she's a complete and total liar like these white men and white women
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:50.600]  that say they're black and dye their skin and frizz their hair to get tuition and all the rest of it
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:55.160]  it's it's it's it's ridiculous but again that's who's telling us they're going to sexualize our
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:50:02.120]  children and cnn's got headlines man who had baby loses right in court to be called father
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:07.240]  on birth certificate because it's not true you're a woman that calls herself a man
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:13.800]  that has a vagina and a uterus and had a baby but this is how they're going to get around
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:18.200]  the laws against pedophilia and the rest of it you see brian williams he's back on the news
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:23.960]  he's all over the place as the man telling us trump's a traitor and impeachment's needed
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:27.960]  remember when he lied about being shot down by the helicopter or being shot down on the helicopter
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:35.720]  i apologize i said i was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by rpg fire
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:42.200]  i was instead in a following aircraft we all landed after the ground fire incident and
[1:50:42.200 --> 1:50:49.800]  spent two harrowing nights in a sandstorm in the iraq desert this was a bungled attempt by me to
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:55.560]  thank one special veteran and by extension our brave military men and women veterans everywhere
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:51:01.960]  those who have served while i did not i hope they know they have my greatest respect and also now
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:08.040]  my apology when we come back here tonight and then of course he had to change the story later
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:12.440]  and admit that there were no helicopters there was no sandstorm because like hillary said she got
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:19.480]  shot at landing in bosnia hersa covena this is what they do we already know that and
[1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:27.800]  i know everybody wants to hear positive news but i refuse to lie to you the positive news is
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:32.280]  globalism is corrupt and evil and unpopular if we expose it and fight it and if we promote
[1:51:32.280 --> 1:51:36.840]  populism and freedom and americana people will choose it the good news is a lot of people are
[1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:42.600]  awake and involved in very race color and creed and want freedom the bad news is most people don't
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:47.480]  actually want to roll their sleeves up they think the animating contest of liberty is something that's
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:57.400]  bad and so they want to just believe propaganda that i've seen for 25 years on air about white
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:52:02.840]  knights and don't worry imaginary groups are going to handle it all and who every bad thing that goes
[1:52:02.840 --> 1:52:09.320]  on is really just a cover story for something really good that's about to happen and you've
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:15.160]  heard from all these groups and organizations that trust the plan as one goes we all go all this crazy
[1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:21.800]  cult crap and that this ig report was going to have all the indictments and that you know durham's
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:29.480]  coming and all this and and yes you might see struck or page indicted and there have been
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:33.480]  indictments not thousands of them but there have been indictments out there that have gotten shut
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:41.800]  down because the justice department has that power and it's wrong so the ig reports out
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:46.280]  out and it's everything that was in the inspector general the courts report two years ago that we
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:51.240]  broke they got zero coverage the courts came out and said we were given false info to do this
[1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:55.640]  to the trump campaign it was wrong and it continued on news administration and admiral rogers went and
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:00.360]  told trump that and we told you how they were spying specifically and i can play you all the cnn
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:05.080]  clubs saying i'm a liar and made it up and nobody was spying on trump remember all that
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:11.640]  remember congressional hearings saying shut us down arrest us just last week two weeks ago
[1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:15.480]  because we're real folks
[1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:23.400]  and we'll tell you like it really is oh and did a great job this morning spontaneously
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:26.840]  standing up to the globalist and pointing out the treason of this illegal impeachment operation
[1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:31.880]  that's been carried out an unconstitutional way making the whole thing a fraud even according to
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:37.400]  constitutional liberal lawyers like jonathan turley the professor but the ig report dropped
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:43.880]  and olin had predicted exactly as i had they'd say well no official fbi malfeasance it was a good
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:48.200]  investigation it was open but a few people didn't follow policies and procedures right and
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:52.840]  barl spin it back and say well it does show they were spying on him for political purposes but the
[1:53:52.840 --> 1:53:58.600]  report doesn't say that so exactly what we said happened so we're the bad guys again for being
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:04.760]  dead on elwin shroyer what do you want to say to that well it's the swamp winning again alex is
[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:10.120]  really what it is i mean we know who i we know who the inspector general horowitz was came from
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:16.120]  the obama administration we know who uh william bar is he came from the bush administration
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:23.080]  that's that's about as swampy as it gets now i still had some hope i wanted to and i still
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:29.080]  don't want to pass full judgment on bar i never had any hope for horowitz i guess there's maybe
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:34.120]  some hope for uh for john durham's investigation that's ongoing but again alex it's the same
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:40.520]  thing i said earlier which is why i took action today nothing matters if you don't take action
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:46.120]  horowitz is not going to save america bill bar is not going to save america john durham is not
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:52.600]  going to save america america has to save america so you can sit and beg and plead on your knees
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:57.720]  for uh for you know whatever report or someone from the swamp to drain the swamp but it's not
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:03.560]  going to happen now trump was the one that we thought would be different trump was the outsider
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:09.320]  that that we voted in so that we wouldn't see the same types of calamities happening over and over
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:14.200]  sure as hell shook him up he shook him up but all he did was get him off their asses to organize
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:20.280]  against us alex i mean he can shake him up and keep shaking him but they shouldn't be
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:24.440]  shaking up at all they should be in jail that's what they should be in jail is where they should
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:29.240]  be so until they're in jail nothing's gonna change and i don't know if trump is is that
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:36.360]  committed to this mission to actually see these people arrested but i think the american people
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:40.680]  are just gonna get more fed up alex they don't respect him because he doesn't come from government
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:44.280]  and so they've paralyzed him he you know he's been wanting them indicted he's been given the right
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:48.120]  orders we know that that's why they're so scared of him and coming for his throat but he just doesn't
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:54.840]  have real men around him he's got a bunch of damn cowards well and i think america is just reaching
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:59.160]  a point again alex it's like the same thing with the impeachment scam america's sick of it
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:03.960]  they're they're sick of it they've been through this for two years now they're done they're over it
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:08.600]  they're sick of government corruption they're sick of the two-tiered justice system so i i mean i
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:13.800]  think there's enough americans i mean politically you know maybe it's a different measurement but
[1:56:13.800 --> 1:56:19.560]  i think there's enough americans that really genuinely and rightfully expected the ig report
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:26.920]  to wind up with eventually some justice for some criminals that politicize the federal
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:33.720]  bureaucracies and once they realize oh that's not happening once they realize you know oh the swamp
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.280]  isn't going to get drained like you flush a toilet and bill bar or durham is just going to flush it
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:43.480]  once they realize that they're going to realize that either i take action to take america back
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:51.240]  or nothing is ever going to change well you're right oh and and the election fraud the election
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:56.920]  meddling with big techs doing trump doing nothing has just green lit all this and we're just seeing
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:57:01.400]  things happen under trump that they were happening under hillary people wouldn't put up with and it's
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:07.240]  all well trump's in there so it's a real dereliction of duty and they're going to destroy him they want
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:12.200]  to destroy him to discredit populism trump is a real president he is trying to do the right thing
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:18.120]  and he's being pro-life and he's going after the pedophile rings and he's trying to he's done a lot
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:22.200]  of good things he's blocking the un running our refugee program and bringing in millions of those
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:27.320]  folks so i think i've been trapped every day but letting these crimes continue on is just incredible
[1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:31.400]  also final comments from elin shroyer we're opening the phones up for first time callers
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:35.480]  specifically quick comments on the ig report what do you think's coming next from the durham
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:45.000]  report you know more of the same is my view 877789 alex 8777892539877789 alex we'll be right back
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:52.840]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[1:57:52.840 --> 1:58:00.600]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:06.120]  of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:11.720]  they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:17.160]  these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they
[1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:23.160]  do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:29.880]  destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep
[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:37.240]  dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:44.200]  they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever
[1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:52.280]  have to know is that god is in charge the last few days i've been online looking for the speech
[1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:56.520]  i actually read it in a book about winston church hill many years ago and i've
[1:58:56.520 --> 1:59:01.720]  found a few places where it's mentioned but if you can find it please send it to showtipstemforewords.com
[1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:05.800]  and he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of world war two the fact that there
[1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:10.120]  have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:14.440]  assured of victory then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:19.960]  the chances of winning are pretty steep there's a third time when you know you're going to lose
[1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:25.000]  but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much much worse that's
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.520]  a paraphrase but ladies and gentlemen we are in the position now of being able to win this easily
[1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:35.560]  if we find our spirit find our focus and don't give up and take action but if we don't stand up
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:41.000]  and get involved we're going to skip number two and go right to number three that's a fact they
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:46.280]  fear info wars because we are alive it's time for the world to awaken and take back our future
[1:59:46.280 --> 1:59:53.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:11.160]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:17.240]  yeah we got the attorney general statement here that's exactly what i would expect i'll read some
[2:00:17.240 --> 2:00:24.680]  of the next segment go to your phone calls get your take on this 8777892539 8777892539
[2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:30.680]  and i had this all this vaccine news i want to get to but because of this all breaking today
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:37.320]  i'm either going to shoot this live on air tomorrow or i'm going to take time and do it
[2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:42.440]  like a powerpoint presentation up here tonight tell them and see my children some this afternoon
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:48.120]  come back tonight because they're talking about arresting people that don't vaccinate now and
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:53.160]  they're lying saying there is no bad reactions that's i mean this is really dangerous and it's
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:57.320]  about secret experimentation on the population so i have all these folders all these documents all
[2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:03.800]  these admissions big article up on info wars dot com never trump or rick wilson says put any
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:09.320]  vaxxers in concentration camps for reeducation take their children and their property so they're
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:13.960]  coming to put something in your body that has liability protection its own inserts they can kill
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:20.120]  you and they're now not letting inserts be online they don't want you to read an insert
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:24.280]  used to that give them to you we went down to uh wall greens today to get fresh ones
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:28.440]  they tried to not give them to us because they know
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:34.600]  no because i've got a bunch of them that i already highlighted years ago but i thought i'd get the
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:38.920]  new ones from different makers and highlight these for you too you got to get a magnifying
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:43.480]  glass out on them though because they've made the print even smaller you can have 2015 vision you
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:49.320]  still can't read it uh so look for that this is a real public service announcement that you wonder
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:52.520]  why the IQ is going down you wonder why the life expectancy is plummeting straight down
[2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:56.760]  they're they're they're doing it it's a chemical lobotomy i would destroy your finishing up my
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.840]  friend you're there in dc you're going to hershey pennsylvania for the big trump rally tomorrow night
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:08.040]  um i i mean i got to tell you reading bar statement and others here uh this is uh no
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:12.040]  action this is the deep state protecting itself and that's why they're so arrogant why they're
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:17.800]  all still trying to remove the president right now this is very dangerous here's what the president
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:26.840]  needs to realize alex if he wants to be successful in his mission he can't rely on on bar or Durham
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:33.800]  or Horowitz or quite frankly anybody from dc anybody from the political class the only people
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:40.600]  that trump can rely on is his voters the only people that trump can rely on is his base and the
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:46.440]  american citizens and you know i don't know trump personally i've never talked to trump so it's hard
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:51.480]  for me to get a gauge as far as his character and his psyche is concerned um but i wonder if he's
[2:02:51.480 --> 2:03:02.520]  realized that yet and i wonder i want to make some really great points but um start over your
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:08.520]  skype was best you said you wonder well i just wonder if the president or or when the president
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:12.760]  is going to cross the threshold and realize he can't rely on anybody from the swamp it doesn't
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:20.120]  matter what they think that's going to be uh uh in early november in about 329 days when he loses
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:27.640]  the election well and that's a whole separate issue that with the democrat election fraud
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:31.880]  that's going on right now that yeah i guess if he doesn't want to address that and he's his own
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:37.880]  worst enemy but you know maybe we'll get a gauge out alex and i don't i don't want to take too much
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:43.880]  stake into what trump says at his rallies because he says a lot but maybe tomorrow at the rally we
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:49.880]  can get a gauge on where president trump is at as far as dealing with this because let me tell you
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:59.960]  alex while trumps voting base is obviously loyal while his base is obviously loyal skype problems
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:05.000]  again elwin's really making some great points right now while his base is loyal they're not
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.720]  going to put up with lack of action like this and it's just it's just frightening to see the power
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:13.400]  of the swamp but it wasn't going to be easy you're saying his his base is loyal elwin but
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:20.040]  but i think that even his base is going to reach a point where they're so fed up and
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:26.440]  attack and the base getting attacked and attack attack the censorship and everything where
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:32.440]  they're either i don't know if they'll turn their back on trump per se but that energy to get out
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:38.200]  vote for trump might not be there again and so that's the big measurement right there now
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:43.320]  again does it matter if they're committing blatant election rigging with electron voting
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:48.680]  machines and illegal voting and then you know no voter ID yeah action has to be taken on we'll
[2:04:48.680 --> 2:04:52.920]  check in with you more you'll be covering that live event tomorrow evening from the armored vehicle

[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:39.560]  for the majority and the minority of this jerry madler and the democrat party are committing
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:44.920]  treason against this country and you can kick me out but he's the one committing crimes you are
[2:06:44.920 --> 2:06:50.440]  jerry madler you're the one committing treason america's done with this america's sent to the
[2:06:50.440 --> 2:06:54.920]  treason committed by democrat party they're not from the city and they want you running
[2:06:54.920 --> 2:07:00.440]  the treason and remove our vote we voted for donald trump and they're simply removing this
[2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:04.840]  because they don't like it america's are sent to your defense channel they're sick of the
[2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:16.040]  democrat treason we don't mean to crime and it wasn't trump trump is innocent
[2:07:16.040 --> 2:07:21.640]  the committee will come to order obviously i shouldn't have to remind everyone present
[2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:29.000]  that the audience is here uh to observe but not to demonstrate not to indicate agreement or
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:34.760]  disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee yeah i'm oh insurer from info wars
[2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:41.240]  dot com yeah what's your name oh insurer i think it's ironic i'm being holed out of here when the
[2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:49.880]  democrats of the ones committing crimes okay so i'm being arrested right now for disrupting
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:08:05.800]  tundish i'm a criminal for my first amendment roster see it right here folks
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:26.920]  i know one thing with the inspector general report coming out and stating exactly what we
[2:08:26.920 --> 2:08:33.000]  knew it would saying oh it was a legal investigation of the candidate trump in his campaign and then
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:37.640]  once he was president sure we lied to congress and sure people under us said it was an insurance
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:42.200]  policy but that's all okay a few agents didn't follow all the rules didn't dot a few eyes cross
[2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:48.600]  few t's but everybody's done a great job and then jerry nadler can move forward with his fake
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:53.960]  illegal impeachment cooked up by the intelligence agencies in the bowels of the capital and then
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:59.480]  can send that on to the senate so the senate can be blackmailed and threatened by the deep
[2:08:59.480 --> 2:09:04.600]  state to vote against trump because trump signaling weakness in all of this by not being able to get
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:10.600]  the justice department to prosecute clear crimes by its own agency but here's the good news we got
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:16.440]  trump elected this audience got trump elected we're the american people and we know the swamp's bag
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:21.000]  and we forced the swamp out in the open and they're not going to be easy to defeat but the process
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:25.320]  of exposing them and how they're against the country's very existence and how their criminals
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:31.240]  is happening they are being incredibly damaged right now and their attempts to remove trump
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:35.400]  and to censor and bully the american people and that's the good news but i'll tell you it's going

[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:22.680]  fake committee illegal hearing we're fighting now harder than ever thank you for keeping us on the
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:27.880]  field and provisioning us in this fight you've got our commitment to bust our ass for our family
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:32.600]  and your families because we're all in this together so again redouble your efforts now
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:41.560]  we're gonna win you expect the swamp and the global assess pool to be where we get our redemption
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:49.800]  no my friends redemption comes from god and us working with god's spirit and us do the right thing
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:54.840]  that's why the enemy knows their whole pedophilic religions coming out that's why in the u.s and
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:59.480]  europe they're teaching five-year-old children to write love letters to the same sex and telling
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:04.440]  them hey would you like to be another sex so that they can be taken from the parents their rights
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:09.880]  can be taken from the parents and the child can be set on a course to have their testicles cut off
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:15.640]  and little girls can be set on course to take male hormones this is the blasphemy this is the
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:21.160]  evil this is the open sexualization of your children and it's only gonna get worse one month
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:25.880]  ago in austin they said children as young as five in the public schools will be taught how to have
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:31.320]  anal sex and will be taught that they're another sex and then once your child gets confused the
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:37.160]  social workers come in and the process of taking your children from you they'll still live with you
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:42.680]  but they will now be attacked with the chemical warfare by the cult members of quote diversity
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:48.920]  that are really carrying out a eugenics sterilization program so again keep them for us on the year
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:53.000]  we'll continue to expose these people i've been told by the globalists don't talk about the trans
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:58.600]  agenda don't talk about islam and don't talk about the pedophilia because that's everything
[2:11:58.600 --> 2:12:03.560]  they're into and who they are and i'm gonna talk about it a lot and i'm never selling out i'm never
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:08.120]  backing down but we could give out the only way we're on air and then we stay on air is you keep
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:12.760]  us on air by spreading the word by supporting those local am and f m affiliates and by buying
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:19.160]  products at infowarstore.com and finally your prayers take action now okay i want to go to your phone
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:27.480]  calls i've got the attorney general statement here he's like yeah it's bad what they did politically
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:31.320]  and it shouldn't happen everybody should be worried and the current directors worried about it
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:36.360]  but nobody's getting in trouble so they're just going to keep doing it and be more encouraged to
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:40.840]  be more aggressive and more out of control because why would a bureaucracy take power from itself
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:45.400]  when it's already presided over the evil you see systematically being carried out everywhere
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:51.480]  the only question is will people just still sit there going oh i heard online everything's handled
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:55.800]  and there's a hundred thousand secret indictments they're all going to guantanamo
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:01.560]  you know i didn't get where i am fighting the globalists because i live in la la land i don't
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:08.360]  buy lottery tickets i don't sign on the nigerian email scams and you know i'm not knocking folks
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:13.320]  that like lottery tickets if you got the money to buy them knock yourself out but i know scams
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:19.240]  when i see them ladies and gentlemen and this whole thing of trust the plan is a scam you could
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:26.680]  trust me i've been around 25 years on there my dad went and gave speeches when he was in
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:29.720]  high school against the communist party around the united states
[2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:37.720]  i'm an american i'm a patriot i'm from texas i've got a track record i fight hard
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:41.160]  and
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:48.440]  we're steering you straight but you don't need to be steered by anybody you already know what's
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:53.720]  going on and we've gotten a lot done in a beachhead that's president trump but if you think
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:58.360]  he's got it all handled when he's totally surrounded and you think you can just sit there
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:03.480]  everything's gonna be okay that's a damn lie we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back right out
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:08.040]  out of the break with jay and mike and michael and alex and logon and christian and jason and
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:15.400]  josh and so many others and we got a guest popping in towards the end of the hour i'll host a little
[2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:19.480]  bit in the next hour let's fill in tano i'm grabbing 15 minutes the first hour to continue with calls
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:27.640]  and i didn't get to this today because look at it look at the vaccine inserts just off three

[2:19:55.720 --> 2:20:11.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:21.320 --> 2:20:25.240]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host taking your phone calls the it report came out about an
[2:20:25.240 --> 2:20:33.080]  hour ago and it is beyond a dud there's little typos and things where it doesn't say comey it
[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:42.520]  says carney this that means like a carnival bar hero sideshow conman and bar has undermined his
[2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:47.080]  own doj ig report which we set was going to come he'll say oh that's not enough it didn't do enough
[2:20:47.960 --> 2:20:51.240]  and then that's supposedly the other side of the equation but there's no teeth behind it there's no
[2:20:51.240 --> 2:20:59.240]  power behind it so i didn't get suckered by this and i know our audience in general didn't get
[2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:03.640]  suckered by it and i'm not depressed about it globalism is being discredited nationalism is
[2:21:03.640 --> 2:21:08.360]  rising christians now know they're under attack people understand what's going on people are
[2:21:08.360 --> 2:21:12.040]  guarding their children more from the state and the corrupt system and we're withdrawing our
[2:21:12.040 --> 2:21:17.400]  support from hollywood and all these systems but tens of millions of children are still captured
[2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:23.880]  in the system and need to be saved a lot of us know what's going on that gives us limited protection
[2:21:23.880 --> 2:21:29.720]  but a lot of folks don't know so the information war is person to person at point blank range like
[2:21:29.720 --> 2:21:36.600]  it always is at the grassroots and we're grassroots we're not globalist astro turf so without further
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:45.160]  ado let's take some phone calls let's go ahead and go to jay in wisconsin you're on the air jay
[2:21:45.160 --> 2:21:51.720]  hi alex before i jump right into it i want to say i appreciate you more than just about anyone
[2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:57.400]  else in the world i think that you are a super patriot and i do have a couple of things that
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:03.000]  i'd like to say that i think would help info wars when it comes to getting the word out and funding
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:09.560]  the operation when it comes to donations to info wars i think that you should give a choice that
[2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:14.920]  allows for a custom amount currently they're all preset amounts i have about four suggestions here
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:19.800]  as part of the shopping cart i think maybe if you were to allow customers to round up their payment
[2:22:19.800 --> 2:22:25.560]  amount in order to spur potential donations that would be helpful i think you should give people
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:30.920]  the option to forego the free shipping in order to make further contribution to the info wars bottom
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  line and the last thing i would say is when you plug i think you should also suggest people who
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:41.080]  may feel they don't need product that you would greatly appreciate they're just making a direct
[2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:46.680]  donation all they need to do is a google search with the words info wars donations to find the
[2:22:46.680 --> 2:22:53.800]  donation choices and in that case 100 of such contributions go to the battle well you're absolutely
[2:22:53.800 --> 2:23:01.960]  right because i've been calling for this i've been working on this and maybe maybe maybe now's the
[2:23:01.960 --> 2:23:07.240]  time to do it i don't know um you know i don't feel sorry for myself just a certain point i get
[2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:10.760]  tired telling people what to do around here you know i mean but i'm gonna try to get that done i really
[2:23:10.760 --> 2:23:14.920]  appreciate i've actually made all these recommendations and i i don't know why it hasn't happened but
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:19.960]  we'll work on it right now keep going all right and and again to everybody that's listening listening
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:26.120]  right now or listening to a podcast later on or whatever just google info wars donations and go
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:33.640]  and make a direct donation info wars is key to us being able to set back the globalist to get rid of
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:38.840]  the uh well exactly and you know my son wants to have a podcast show called i'm not bragging as
[2:23:38.840 --> 2:23:43.640]  i said i'm not bragging they have hearings all the time in intelligence committees and the house
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:48.840]  arms services committee saying we're the enemy of america and shut us down that's the globalist
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:53.320]  of hijack the government saying we're the main enemy because we know who they are and they do
[2:23:53.320 --> 2:23:57.560]  want to software folks i'm not trying to act all fancy pants here we really are the damn tip of
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:05.320]  the spear and boy rag tag we are let me tell you oh it's all projection too everything they do is is
[2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:12.680]  is a salvo it's a preemptive strike basically is what it comes down to these things they've done
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:18.760]  that are frozen trump in so many ways it's all projection and and because of the doj not being
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:23.640]  sufficiently under trump's control well i guess that's kind of the segue to what i really wanted
[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:29.400]  to say all of us who are constitutionalists want to see these coup plotters charged and prosecuted
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:34.360]  in order to keep this kind of garbage from ever happening again effective prosecutions are the
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:39.480]  only possible deterrent and maybe the reason trump isn't directly acting to have these deep
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:44.760]  staters and coup plotters removed by legal process is because he knows the doj is still
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:50.280]  largely an enemy hand and he fears that prosecutions will be quietly handed off to rogue elements
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:56.360]  for fake prosecutions so in other words mere show trials with combi-like exonerations as the end
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:01.240]  result you know like when a combi exonerated hillary basically this you're right i mean the deep
[2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:08.440]  state has got a hundred benches deep they can rig trials they can let people go look at the senator
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:12.200]  you know in the caribbean with all the 14-year-old girls and they had him dead to rights didn't get
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:19.080]  in trouble for that so somehow trump needs to gain the proper control over the doj i mean he's been
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:25.560]  so poorly advised since the start i mean right previous stacked him with so many all day these
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:31.320]  lawyers will lie to your face in ways you can't even imagine i've experienced it and uh it's it's
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:36.840]  just this country is just at the at the professional level is just full of a bunch of scum and the
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:41.320]  average good hard-working person out there just doesn't want power and so they haven't been involved
[2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:46.520]  and my god you start plowing into the swamp you just the people you find and i mean i'm talking
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:51.800]  half of them are pedophiles i mean they have they have really promoted pedophilia recruited people
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:57.400]  and made it to where if very soon it should be the new national symbol is a man raping a baby
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:01.560]  and i'm not kidding i mean the new american flag should be like a two-year-old baby with a man with
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:06.760]  a bunch of men raping it and that should be our new symbol alex alex i have one last thing to say
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:11.880]  and that's i need to talk with you or one of your very top lieutenants about a huge funding
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:17.480]  source that dovetails with what you're doing in so many ways i have fought some of these same battles
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:22.680]  back in the early 2000s so i hear you let me put you on hold and then guys give me his name and number
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.000]  myself on a piece of paper and then i'll do that because believe me i'm up here 18 hours a day a
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  lot of days now we just have to push the boulder up the hill i have to innovate i have to find out
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:35.080]  what's going on i have to just i'm digging into everything around here i'm involved in the satellite
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:40.440]  contracts i'm involved in the trash pickup i'm involved in the just everything now i mean i take
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:45.160]  the trash out of the refrigerators i clean the toilets man because it has to be done by somebody
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:50.600]  and uh god bless you i appreciate your call don't don't hang up on jay get his name and number for
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:56.200]  me please thank you uh let's go ahead and talk to steven illinois steve you're on the air hey alex how
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:02.040]  you doing i'm just you know i knew this was coming yeah i hear you hey something i haven't really
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:06.920]  heard a whole lot of people say and i mean i'm all for trump and what he's doing doing a great job
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:13.640]  for the country but could he possibly be like the guy at the fall guy like he could be in on this
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:20.440]  like he needs like to take you back and on what the last scholar said like we all say he needs to
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:25.960]  do more doesn't seem like he's really well i mean where he has the power he's made the right he's
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:30.840]  trying to end these wars he's trying to do peace deals he's trying to bring troops back he's he is
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:35.160]  going after the petafall rings he's trying to secure the border he's trying to cut the taxes
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:39.880]  he's trying to uh to stand up to china and one side of trade deals i mean he's done a fabulous job
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:44.600]  the problem is the deep states going after the american people and taking our liberty away to
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:48.840]  undermine him and getting ready to take him out with election fraud that's why we're so pissed at
[2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:55.000]  trump yeah no i get it but man like there's no way they should be getting away with what they get
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:59.800]  away with like you said he was gonna get rid all those people like this is like bar why didn't he
[2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:05.080]  get rid of him get his own guy in there well bar came to him and told him sir we'll get the swamp
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:08.920]  we'll drain him and went and said the right things during the hearings and had it has been
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:15.560]  rhetoric wise it's been the right thing but notice the actual report does nothing it's toothless
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:22.840]  to toothless report and maybe we'll see an indictment of lisa page or strock or something but see
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:28.760]  they were given orders from on top all the way up to obama and to brennan and so that's why they
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.440]  can't do it you fact you're not going to see any any indictments go forward i i predict nothing
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:40.120]  is done i predict durham does nothing nothing you heard it nothing that's what my predict and
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:44.520]  that matter we're gonna go out and confront the globalist we're gonna work hard we're gonna promote

[2:32:19.560 --> 2:32:25.880]  and to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and
[2:32:25.880 --> 2:32:30.680]  that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office they're trying to remove
[2:32:30.680 --> 2:32:38.680]  him regardless because they know that god put him in office and that he's going to continue his work
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:43.080]  and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down but that if he doesn't execute in

[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:06.280]  i don't want to have to lay people off and again i'm happy to do it i'm selling my house
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:09.880]  uh because that's where i invested the money to make sure out of backup i don't trust the banks
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:13.240]  so that i'd have extra money someday if we ever needed it to run things i'm going to hire people
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:17.960]  and expand and put on full sale as they'd say in the back of the sailing ship days you know when
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:22.600]  you got the wind it goes fast as you can we're putting everything in we love it we enjoy it it's
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:27.800]  fun i just don't want our missiles to impact on the surface to use a cheesy star wars analogy
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:32.680]  on to go down the reactor tubes and go right into the main engine of the globalist operation
[2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:37.560]  politically and defeat them and you saw another big victory by Owen schroyer today taking action
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:43.320]  hopefully an example to others and just quit hoping on mysterious eight tan you know people uh
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:48.200]  but it's not real folks it's it's this is real you're real when you go take action that's real
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:52.760]  the knights in shining armor aren't coming the closest thing you're going to get is you doing
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:59.320]  it info wars doing it together i'm not even let down by this inspector general report
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:05.080]  or i know there have been some indictments uh of andy mccabe and others uh but the justice
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:09.560]  department could kill those and they foregoed blocking prosecution of him a few months ago
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:14.840]  that almost always means that the indictment had happened but they can just leave those indictments
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:19.960]  sitting there should the justice department have the power to kill indictments by Ranjuri's i don't
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:25.800]  think so that just shows how this rogue government's gotten um and so now the media to make the
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:30.680]  report look even more legitimate will act like it's illegitimate that bar has come out and
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:35.320]  criticized it and said it didn't go far enough but that is toothless
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:45.000]  so again even his criticism means nothing and we knew that was coming so we nailed it 100 percent
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:52.440]  exactly as it is here's the report right here by all 500 pages of it we nailed it exactly as we said
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:37:01.000]  but you know what the q people will do they'll go line up the report on the first word of every
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:09.960]  line and make up hidden messages in it or the globalist will put
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:18.440]  can i have a document shop thanks uh the globalist will put messages in there just to
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:25.720]  jerk your chain oh don't go to congress and confront nadler just look for codes they'll
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:32.040]  save us secret codes don't send info wars video out don't send an article out don't warn people about
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:37.400]  all the pedophilia or the schools teaching five-year-olds to write same-sex love letters to each other
[2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:42.600]  you know the schools save a little boy hugs little girl or kids shake hands that's
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:47.560]  harassment and assault but you can learn how to give a blow job you can learn how to have anal
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:53.480]  sex when you're five we can teach third graders how to do things i can't even say on air
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:01.160]  we're trying to arrest people that don't vaccinate now everything's okay trust the plan
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.400]  well info wars launched a plan to believe in america and challenging globalism and it's been
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:13.880]  picked up all the world 1776 worldwide it's active people believe in freedom they want it because
[2:38:13.880 --> 2:38:21.480]  it's real and so this audience got trump elected you got trump elected action and voting and speaking
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:26.280]  out and making donations and getting the word out and running for office you did it folks
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:32.280]  not nebulous imaginary intelligence agencies where they appoint people because they're yes men
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:37.560]  and do what they're told the resistance and leadership comes from the grassroots and people
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:44.280]  that care about freedom that's where our victory against tyranny's coming
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:50.920]  gator in north carolina thanks for holding her on the air
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:57.400]  yeah alex uh thanks for taking my call first i want to say that um oh and shroyer is what we
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:03.000]  always knew he was one heck of a warrior out there doing what most emasculated american men do not
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:08.680]  have the temerity or the tenacity whatsoever to do i speak from experience having made up many
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:13.080]  t-shirts in my days wearing them around the country condemning the deep state and obama all
[2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:17.000]  the other operatives and having grown men come up to me shake my hand and virtually cry because
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:21.480]  they thought i was so brave for wearing a t-shirt but the purpose of my call is that at this point
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:27.800]  i believe that um donald j trump is irrelevant um i believe that looking for a political solution
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:33.800]  into this battle on the human side the earthly side is is never going to come is never going to
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:39.400]  happen and whether trump is or is not part of this ruse whether or not he's a foil or not
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:45.880]  doesn't matter what matters is according to the declaration of independence in 18 us code 242
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:50.520]  we have full legal authority and jurisdiction to go up there and arrest these people and you
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:55.720]  and take this this government out and replace it for one is better suited to our well-being
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:40:11.640]  and to freedom based on common law is that the nature of my point
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:41.640]  so
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:54.200]  yeah i don't know what's going on around here but it's a daily occurrence now
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:59.960]  that boards go out equipment no matter how new they are what it is just every day audio cuts out
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:07.960]  earpieces go out and i love it i enjoy it uh so um i don't know that caller still there i guess he's
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:14.120]  gone now because that happened and i apologize the stations there was all that dead air um
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:18.120]  we're going to drill on the fact that we have this new occurrence where the microphone goes out
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:22.120]  we're going to get quicker that when it goes off first we go through the motions that is alex
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:27.720]  really not not having audio so i have to prove that i'm off air that once that happens and i'm
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:32.760]  mad i understand i'm the bad person then we can go to rebroadcast um i'm going to try as hard as
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:36.840]  that can we come back from break to take more your calls i'm going to move that guest i just can't
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:39.640]  handle it right now we're going to take the calls like i said i was we'll have that guest on another
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:43.560]  day i had a lot of importance to apologize that guest been moving them back for a while today
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:49.480]  but that's just what it is just what where the cow at the cabbage here so that's that um i am pretty
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:55.960]  upset right now uh with the fact that this inspector general report did exactly what we
[2:41:55.960 --> 2:42:00.520]  said it would do i mean that is a bunch of criminals up there a bunch of scumbag lawyers
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:05.800]  that are narcotics trafficking and child molesting i mean my god let me explain some to you half those
[2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:10.440]  people at that level have sex with children and a lot of them stabbed children to death and drink
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:15.800]  for damn blood okay so i mean you think a bunch of people that kill small children on routine
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:21.240]  bases for their holidays you think they're going to turn around and do this no they love it and
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:26.120]  they're going to kill your children as soon as they get a chance to andy in florida thank you andy go

[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:36.840]  to talk about one of your product a little bit about me i'm 245 pounds i work about 10 to 13 hours
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:43.000]  a day at ups and make a long story short i used to have a problem with adderall i do have adhd but
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  you know i was taking adderall for its energy boosting properties you know i kind of got a
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:50.920]  little out of hand and you know i listen to you religiously in my truck every day so i tried
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:55.800]  your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product changed my life but turbo force really
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:00.760]  changed my life and it was a day i no longer take adderall and i get by literally the 13 hours a day
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:06.120]  i work on a half of a packet of your turbo force and if you take a half a packet that's literally
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:11.160]  a dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know a monster which is what 499 and i you know
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:15.160]  i just had to call and tell you guys uh how great turbo force is and if anybody's on the fence they

[2:46:53.000 --> 2:47:01.320]  no person is above the law no one is above the law no one is above the law no one is above the law
[2:47:03.080 --> 2:47:07.640]  he's certainly not above the law nobody's above the law no one is above the law no one is above
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:10.860]  Not even the President of the United States!
[2:47:10.860 --> 2:47:14.460]  No one is above the law, not even the President of United States!
[2:47:14.460 --> 2:47:16.740]  —This president believes he is above the law!
[2:47:16.740 --> 2:47:17.620]  —And no one!
[2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:20.320]  Not even the President should be above the law.
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:22.500]  —No one is above the law!
[2:47:22.500 --> 2:47:24.120]  It's certainly not the President.
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:25.120]  —Oh my god!
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:26.280]  —Again, I'll repeat.
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:28.460]  No one, not even the President is above the law.
[2:47:28.460 --> 2:47:29.460]  —Oh my God!
[2:47:29.460 --> 2:47:30.700]  Do you know what this means?!
[2:47:30.700 --> 2:47:32.600]  We finally got him!
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:34.400]  —We have a president who believes he is above the law.
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:37.180]  —The President is not above the law.
[2:47:37.180 --> 2:47:39.580]  The President who believes he is above the law.
[2:47:39.580 --> 2:47:42.480]  He is not, as some people have tried to suggest, above the law.
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:44.580]  The President is declaring himself above the law.
[2:47:44.580 --> 2:47:49.380]  No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.
[2:47:49.380 --> 2:47:53.280]  Donald Trump has tried to put himself above the law.
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:54.480]  And that's not how it works.
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:56.380]  That's not how any of this works.
[2:47:56.380 --> 2:47:58.080]  You are above the law.
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:01.180]  In my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical President
[2:48:01.180 --> 2:48:04.580]  who believes they are above the law.
[2:48:04.580 --> 2:48:11.480]  The American people do not want a President who believes that he is above the law.
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:12.580]  No one is above the law.
[2:48:12.580 --> 2:48:14.280]  Nobody is above the law.
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:16.780]  We must ensure that no one is above the law.
[2:48:16.780 --> 2:48:21.880]  I mean, dear God, this guy cannot in any way be allowed to be above the law.
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:24.180]  This is the United States of America.
[2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:27.080]  No one is above the law.
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:27.980]  No one.
[2:48:27.980 --> 2:48:28.680]  No one.
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:30.380]  No one is above the law.
[2:48:30.380 --> 2:48:32.180]  No one is above the law.
[2:48:32.180 --> 2:48:35.780]  President Trump and his administration are not above the law.
[2:48:35.780 --> 2:48:38.180]  There is big news that just came out.
[2:48:38.180 --> 2:48:41.080]  Looks like Donald Trump may have broken the law.
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  No one is above the law.
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:46.580]  No one, not even the President is above the law.
[2:48:46.580 --> 2:48:48.480]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:50.280]  That's your answer.
[2:48:52.580 --> 2:48:53.580]  Breaking the law.
[2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:54.680]  Breaking the law.
[2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:55.680]  Breaking the law.
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:56.880]  Breaking the law.
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:48:59.880]  But the new IG report comes out and says they can spy illegally.
[2:48:59.880 --> 2:49:00.880]  They can lie.
[2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:01.880]  They can send people to prison.
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:03.880]  They can lie about it to Congress.
[2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:05.880]  They can break the law.
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:14.880]  When I told everybody don't get bummed out, when it comes out and all the magic indictments
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:18.880]  and the Guantanamo Bay doesn't happen because that's made up.
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:22.880]  Trump is drawing from the swamp.
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:28.880]  There have been some grand juries that have handed down indictments, not hundreds, not thousands.
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:30.880]  And those have obviously been killed.
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:34.880]  So you keep holding your breath for the Durham investigation.
[2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:35.880]  Not me.
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  I'm not holding my breath.
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:37.880]  Oh, no, sir.
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:40.880]  I'm going to be hitting the streets and I'm going to be working hard.
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:45.880]  I'm going to get more radio affiliates for this show to keep energizing the American people
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:49.880]  to run more people for office to say we're not going to handle this.
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:55.880]  And more people for office to say we're not going to have five-year-olds learn how to give blowjobs.
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:49:59.880]  And I'm going to show the newscast where it's being taught.
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:02.880]  And then we're going to take over our government and we're not going to do that.
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:07.880]  And we're going to expose that we don't want 60 plus percent of the refugees that come here
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:11.880]  never getting a job or getting off welfare.
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:14.880]  And we're going to continue to support the president and the things he's doing that are right.
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:19.880]  But we're not going to go to sleep.
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:21.880]  Look at that mainline headline.
[2:50:21.880 --> 2:50:22.880]  Put that back up, please.
[2:50:22.880 --> 2:50:23.880]  Texas School District.
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:25.880]  That's Austin.
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:28.880]  Mandates teaching kids out of anal sex.
[2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:36.880]  Seven-year-olds.
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:38.880]  I mean, I'm not even trying to cover this.
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:42.880]  It's just flooding in.
[2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:44.880]  We had a great guest coming on.
[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:47.880]  He was on Tucker Carlson last week, last Friday.
[2:50:47.880 --> 2:50:49.880]  He's been a frequent guest here.
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:50.880]  He's running for Congress.
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:55.880]  He's exposing that the sanctuary city is the rest of it.
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:50:59.880]  We just have to stop it completely because the Democrats are bringing folks in to hate America
[2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:02.880]  and organizing them around bringing the country down.
[2:51:02.880 --> 2:51:03.880]  We're not against immigrants.
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:05.880]  We're against the way the left's doing this.
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:07.880]  There used to be a total moratorium on it.
[2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:12.880]  There's one mayor's asked Trump to import more refugees to the U.S. for cultural diversity.
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:15.880]  We're going to get that guest on tomorrow.
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:17.880]  And I appreciate him holding over to tomorrow.
[2:51:17.880 --> 2:51:18.880]  And I apologize.
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:20.880]  We had some big things break today.
[2:51:20.880 --> 2:51:25.880]  Peter Dabrosko, if you pronounce that right.
[2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:27.880]  Pete for NC.com.
[2:51:27.880 --> 2:51:29.880]  He'll be joining us tomorrow if he can.
[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:34.880]  We just had the Owen thing in Congress and impeachment hearings and all the rest of it and so much more.
[2:51:34.880 --> 2:51:36.880]  But we will get him on tomorrow.
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:43.880]  A powerful interview he did with Tucker Carlson.
[2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:44.880]  But I'm beyond angry.
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:47.880]  I am in action mode.
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:51.880]  I mean, when you see them on the news saying vaccines are safe and effective, have no side effects,
[2:51:51.880 --> 2:51:53.880]  no one has ever been hurt by them.
[2:51:53.880 --> 2:51:59.880]  That's like saying nobody's ever been killed by bullets or fires never burned down any trees.
[2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:01.880]  I mean, it's whopper leveled.
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:05.880]  It's a bigger lie than saying men can have babies.
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:13.880]  But they're all over the news saying arrest people that don't take all their vaccines.
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:24.880]  Even though the people that have taken them are supposedly protected, even though they're not.
[2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:26.880]  You know, last week my kids don't get sick very often.
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:32.880]  But two of my daughters, the oldest one in the middle one, got fever, threw up.
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:36.880]  They went to the local doctor and the doctor said, oh, you got a virus.
[2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:38.880]  And I said to my daughter, is it test you for a virus?
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:40.880]  No, they just said it's 24-hour virus.
[2:52:40.880 --> 2:52:44.880]  And three days later, I said, you're going to the doctor again.
[2:52:44.880 --> 2:52:46.880]  You got bacterial infection.
[2:52:46.880 --> 2:52:49.880]  And my wife got sick.
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:51.880]  And I said, no, it's bacterial.
[2:52:51.880 --> 2:52:52.880]  You don't.
[2:52:52.880 --> 2:52:57.880]  And then they went and got tested and they have all have a bacterial infection today.
[2:52:57.880 --> 2:53:02.880]  I told them, tell the doctor, do his job and do a damn test.
[2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:05.880]  And an hour later, it came back.
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:13.880]  And they've all got strep.
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:17.880]  Probably from some food they ate or something.
[2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:22.880]  But you just have to stop believing the system constantly and just going along.
[2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:24.880]  Because the average person is on total autopilot.
[2:53:24.880 --> 2:53:31.880]  The average doctor is thinking about when they're going to go play golf and how they're going to cram their mistress in with their wife.
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:36.880]  And that's if they're a nice guy.
[2:53:36.880 --> 2:53:38.880]  America is decadent and evil now.
[2:53:38.880 --> 2:53:40.880]  We're a cursed nation.
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:45.880]  I'm going to go to Josh, Jordan, Jessica, Michael, Alex, Christian, Jason before the show ends.
[2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:47.880]  Let's go to Josh right now in Ohio.
[2:53:47.880 --> 2:53:48.880]  Thanks for holding Josh.
[2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:49.880]  Welcome.
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:50.880]  How are you, Alex?
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:51.880]  How are you?
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:53.880]  You know, I knew this was coming.
[2:53:53.880 --> 2:53:55.880]  I didn't want to be right about the IG report.
[2:53:55.880 --> 2:53:58.880]  But I'm telling you, it's just exactly what we thought it would be.
[2:53:58.880 --> 2:54:01.880]  I know I feel the same way with you.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:03.880]  And I want to say something.
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:06.880]  I commend Owen and I commend him for what he stood up and did today.
[2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:15.880]  That just shows that all of us Americans that are sick of all the bullshit that Congress and everybody plays every system and points the finger game.
[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:18.880]  There needs to be action done.
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  We've got a bunch of crooks up there that have been robbing and selling the richest nation in the world off for at least 40, 50 years.
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:29.880]  And they can't even stop their own corruption selling out the ship that they're living on.
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:31.880]  So part of them want to fix things.
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:33.880]  Part of them know it's gone too far.
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:35.880]  The other side is completely insane.
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:40.880]  I mean, the Democrats are frothing at the mouth drugged out zombies.
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:41.880]  They're demons.
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:46.880]  They are just demons and they want to help their pocketbook instead of helping us American people.
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:49.880]  What our president wants to do is help us American people.
[2:54:49.880 --> 2:54:58.880]  And I think the reason why they hate our president so much is because he is one of the closest people to our founding fathers and he doesn't play no bullshit with them.
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:02.880]  All right, I got to let you go with the cussing because you do it once.
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:04.880]  We can delay it out.
[2:55:04.880 --> 2:55:05.880]  You do it again.
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:07.880]  I got to let you go because our stations can get fines.
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  And I know CNN gets the cuss.
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:10.880]  They're liberals.
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:12.880]  All these court rulings.
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:19.880]  People can contract to kill ice agents on air and tell people I want to pay, you know, money if you kill ice agents and then the jury says, oh, that's okay.
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:22.880]  You're a liberal.
[2:55:22.880 --> 2:55:25.880]  I wouldn't say kill ice agents.
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:28.880]  But if I did, I'd go to prison and I should.
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:30.880]  So there's a there's a double thing here.
[2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:32.880]  Okay.
[2:55:32.880 --> 2:55:36.880]  And everybody knows that Jessica in Illinois, you're on the air.
[2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:39.880]  Welcome.
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:40.880]  Hello.
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  Can you hear me?
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:42.880]  Nice for calling.
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:44.880]  I guess you're calling on WLUV.
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:46.880]  I should plug what stations people call in on.
[2:55:46.880 --> 2:55:47.880]  Go ahead.
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:49.880]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:53.880]  I just wanted to say, you know, we listen to you guys in the household.
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:55.880]  We drive with the baby in the car.
[2:55:55.880 --> 2:55:58.880]  It's one of the best ways she falls asleep.
[2:55:58.880 --> 2:56:02.880]  I mean, she's sitting here smiling at your voice and, you know, looking at the radio in the kitchen.
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:04.880]  I mean, she knows your voice.
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:06.880]  Oh, yeah, she's talking to you right now.
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:10.880]  But I wanted to say that, you know, we spend money on all your products.
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:11.880]  I love them.
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:20.880]  You know, we tried to have a baby last year and until I started taking my iodine and, you know, ultimate female force, you know, we couldn't have a baby.
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:24.880]  And this year we just had our baby on October 1st.
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:29.880]  I want to say thank you so much for having these great products because I would have never been able to meet my first child.
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:33.880]  And, and you know what to say about the impeachment about Trump.
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:38.880]  I say, if you don't like the president that you have at the current moment, go out and vote.
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:40.880]  Don't just sit on your couch and complain about it.
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:42.880]  Get out there and vote.
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:48.880]  Because I hear about a lot of people who just sit around and say, oh, you know, I'm not going to vote because I don't like who's there.
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:51.880]  What's going to help if you just do nothing?
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:52.880]  Stay there, Jessica.
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:54.880]  I want you to be able to finish up with this point.
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:56:55.880]  You're absolutely right.
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:56:57.880]  People say, oh, well, voting, there's a lot of fraud.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:56:58.880]  Yes.
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:00.880]  And the research is clear.
[2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:02.880]  Landslides, they have trouble stealing.
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:04.880]  Close races, they can steal easily.
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:06.880]  We need a landslide for Trump.
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:12.880]  In fact, with the fourth hour, I'll get to all your calls, finish up with Jessica, and then Gerald St. Lente's coming up.
[2:57:15.880 --> 2:57:18.880]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:21.880]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago.
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:24.880]  And I've found a few places where it's mentioned.
[2:57:24.880 --> 2:57:27.880]  But if you can find it, please send it to showtipstem4words.com.
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:35.880]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War II, the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on.
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:36.880]  And we're assured of victory.
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:42.880]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:50.880]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  That's a paraphrase.
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit, find our focus, and don't give up and take action.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:05.880]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:06.880]  That's a fact.
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:08.880]  They fear info wars because we are alive.
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:11.880]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:21.880]  My fellow Americans, many of you will have been following the impeachment proceedings brought against me by the Democrats.
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:29.880]  This political witch hunt is tearing our country apart and not in a good way while I truly believe that I'm completely innocent of all charges.
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:33.880]  I have nonetheless decided to make the following announcement.
[2:58:33.880 --> 2:58:36.880]  Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:39.880]  What you just heard was not President Trump.
[2:58:39.880 --> 2:58:43.880]  It was a deep fake that just went live on the Internet yesterday.
[2:58:43.880 --> 2:58:48.880]  President Trump did not say Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[2:58:48.880 --> 2:58:52.880]  Now, the audio can fool you, but the video really does.
[2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:53.880]  Tune in to us.
[2:58:53.880 --> 2:59:07.880]  We'll tell you what's real and what's fake when it's mainstream media that famously has been caught doing thousands of deep fakes like ABC and the supposed curd attack footage that was really not Creek Machine Guns shoot out or stuff that Megan Kelly has done to me with deep fakes.
[2:59:07.880 --> 2:59:08.880]  These people are sick.
[2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:13.880]  Info wars has the history of exposing deep fakes, not being involved in them.
[2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:16.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:43.880 --> 2:59:46.880]  I'm going to go right back to your calls.
[2:59:46.880 --> 2:59:51.880]  And if I seem angry and bummed out sometimes here on there, it's not with the audience.
[2:59:51.880 --> 2:59:53.880]  It's not with our listeners, the crew.
[2:59:53.880 --> 2:59:56.880]  It's just that I do care.
[2:59:56.880 --> 3:00:01.880]  And it's not from some goody to shoot bleeding heart place.
[3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:08.880]  It's from a place when I know that a bunch of innocent people are being hurt by diabolical conscious evil.
[3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:17.880]  And they're openly announcing the human animal clones and gene edited babies and Beijing and the communist Chinese are running the global internet standardization.
[3:00:17.880 --> 3:00:22.880]  Now it's official.
[3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:27.880]  And all this political correctness has been to destroy freedom of speech and the families under attack.
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:29.880]  I believe in humanity.
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:35.880]  And I can't enjoy my daily life.
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:38.880]  And we're being overrun like this.
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:41.880]  And here's the way evil works.
[3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:45.880]  It's either taken over or it's on its heels.
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:46.880]  There's not an equilibrium.
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:50.880]  It's a luminati thing about balance and some good, some evil.
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:55.880]  That is the total creed of evil.
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:01:01.880]  Of course, there's always going to be good and evil in the universe.
[3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:07.880]  Until God decides to end that experiment.
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:16.880]  But the idea that we just let it flourish because it's supposed to already be there like some species of animal is not the case.
[3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:21.880]  And so if you're not upset and pissed off or something wrong with you, we're supposed to be angry and upset about this.
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:22.880]  This is not normal.
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:23.880]  It's going on.
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:25.880]  It's not natural.
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:28.880]  We're being overrun by evil.
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:30.880]  It doesn't want to allow us to exist.
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:32.880]  It doesn't live in equilibrium with good.
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:37.880]  It wants to extinguish it.
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:40.880]  All right, Jessica in Illinois finishing up.
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:46.880]  I'm intrigued by you saying you couldn't have a baby how long you were trying and what happened.
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:52.880]  And it's well known that iodine deficiency causes massive infertility, causes all sorts of thyroid problems.
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:53.880]  People die without iodine.
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:56.880]  I mean, it's an essential thing like vitamin C or oxygen.
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:01.880]  It just takes longer to die without it and say oxygen. Oxygen takes a few minutes. Water takes a week or so.
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:03.880]  Food takes about a month depending on the person.
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:08.880]  But yeah, they work to take it out of the food and put the bad halogen into everything.
[3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:10.880]  Fluoride, it really is amazing.
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:11.880]  It's just briefly because I'm intrigued by it.
[3:02:11.880 --> 3:02:12.880]  I get a lot of these calls.
[3:02:12.880 --> 3:02:14.880]  We get a lot of letters.
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:17.880]  We see it in the comments on the website in the reviews, the products.
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:22.880]  Like what happened to you in just a minute or two and then how long you were taking the products and what happened?
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:25.880]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:30.880]  I started taking them after our first miscarriage last year in October.
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:32.880]  And I started feeling better.
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:38.880]  And we tried again and about four months later, we got pregnant again.
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:43.880]  And we kept getting the ultrasounds and more and more ultrasounds.
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:46.880]  And I kept thinking, this one's going to happen too.
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:48.880]  We're going to miscarry again.
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:54.880]  And the doctors, when we had our 20-week ultrasound, they said, your baby, she's perfect.
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:56.880]  She's absolutely perfect.
[3:02:56.880 --> 3:02:59.880]  And I had her October 1st.
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:05.880]  And she came out and immediately she is the best child I've ever taken care of.
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:07.880]  She's not fussy.
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:10.880]  She doesn't have all the problems that I see that most kids have.
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:11.880]  She's smart.
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:15.880]  She's only two months old and she's already trying to make words.
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:18.880]  She mocks me and that kind of thing.
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:20.880]  And I don't see that with a lot of kids nowadays.
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:27.880]  I see a lot of kids with ADHD and problems and growth defects, that kind of thing.
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:33.880]  Well, ma'am, there is no doubt that this is a chemical biological weapons program
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:36.880]  to reduce the population and dumb people down to be more orderly and controllable.
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:40.880]  And they admit they're doing it in all these globalist documents.
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  And you're absolutely right.
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:42.880]  And the IQ is dropping.
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:43.880]  The life expectancy is dropping.
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:46.880]  The neurological disorders are off the chart.
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:50.880]  And you can tell when children are vibrant and healthy that they're not vaccinated.
[3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:52.880]  And again, it's what they're adding to the vaccines.
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:55.880]  It's not that we don't know that vaccine technology is real.
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:58.880]  It's that we have a government in the system with a history of secret testing.
[3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:01.880]  We know they have liability protection, secret payoff funds.
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:04.880]  And now they have hundreds of vaccines they want to make us take
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:09.880]  because they got away with giving us deadly Gardasil that's killed thousands of people and maimed hundreds of thousands.
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:11.880]  All these other governments have banned it.
[3:04:11.880 --> 3:04:12.880]  So they're testing.
[3:04:12.880 --> 3:04:13.880]  What can they get away with us?
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:16.880]  So thank God you've got that great baby, a true gift from God.
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:17.880]  Now, war on others.
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:18.880]  Thank you, Jessica.
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:20.880]  And thanks for talking about our local station.
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:49.880]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[3:04:50.880 --> 3:04:59.880]  Secure a bottle of the good halogen X3 at cost at $29.95 and get a free bottle of Biotru Selenium.
[3:04:59.880 --> 3:05:05.880]  Buy real red pill plus and real red pill at 65% off and get a free bottle of Selenium as well.
[3:05:05.880 --> 3:05:07.880]  Silver bullet is only $9.95.
[3:05:07.880 --> 3:05:13.880]  Ultimate female force and superfemale vitality combo are at cost at $29.95.
[3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:23.880]  Eight-pack power stack is also at cost at $29.95 with free shipping and over 100 others at M4store.com and support the M4.
[3:05:23.880 --> 3:05:46.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:59.880]  Did you think that the Inspector General appointed by Obama, Horowitz, did you really think he was going to go after the deep state that he's a big fish in?
[3:05:59.880 --> 3:06:02.880]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that didn't happen.
[3:06:02.880 --> 3:06:08.880]  And Barr was brought in as a big insider to clean things up and to get the deep state war to stop.
[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:16.880]  And Trump offered olive branches to the system to just let America be great again and don't sell us out and try to explain how these policies would be better for our nation.
[3:06:16.880 --> 3:06:19.880]  They said, we want America to go away in the globalist paradigm.
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:21.880]  We've already invested in China.
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:24.880]  Lloyd Blank fine three years ago bragged about that.
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:41.880]  Xi Jinping went with Yunker to the Debo's event two years and 10 months ago in January of 2017 and said, we will defeat America, Trump and the populist.
[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:43.880]  They declared war on us.
[3:06:43.880 --> 3:06:53.880]  And yeah, we've come a long way from the coma we were in, so I want to be positive.
[3:06:53.880 --> 3:07:00.880]  But the swamp is deep.
[3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:09.880]  And I'm ashamed that more Americans, when China runs the UN global standardization for the Internet surveillance, the Internet ID, it's all being announced.
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:13.880]  The face scanning systems on your phone is run by China.
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:17.880]  Agreed to the policy is set by them.
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:20.880]  They're running the planetary government now.
[3:07:20.880 --> 3:07:24.880]  It was always meant to be that way and that more Americans don't rally against that.
[3:07:24.880 --> 3:07:33.880]  It's so dangerous for their own interest because there's a spirit of evil that wants to see us go down.
[3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:35.880]  Alex and Michigan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:36.880]  Go ahead.
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:37.880]  Hello.
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:38.880]  Yes, sir.
[3:07:38.880 --> 3:07:44.880]  Hey, I wanted to talk about impeachment at first, but I think you guys basically covered it.
[3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:52.880]  But I think something more important, I just want to get through this quickly because I've called like eight times and I've gotten cut out every time.
[3:07:52.880 --> 3:08:05.880]  A couple of days ago, you were talking about how some people, they can't handle like God and the universe and they just like, they end up like curling up.
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:06.880]  Yes.
[3:08:06.880 --> 3:08:15.880]  I just, yeah, I was just like, I'm like that and I wanted to know what I should do to counter that or to be to stand up for myself.
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:23.880]  That's because the Holy Spirit, God's transmission is unable to fully penetrate or something blocking that.
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:31.880]  You've got to pray for God to remove that and you've got to ask God, the real God of the universe, the real Creator.
[3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:40.880]  And God knows who that is to step in and to push the transmission blocking that away.
[3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:44.880]  You've got to ask God in your heart and just keep praying that.
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:53.880]  And then you've got to deal with what comes in the process of that because the enemy will try to discourage you, will attack you up front to scare you into submission.
[3:08:53.880 --> 3:08:56.880]  But then you're going to know God's real more intensely.
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:01.880]  And then like a storm blowing off, God's going to push you aside because you've opened up.
[3:09:01.880 --> 3:09:06.880]  And because God's free will though, God's not going to rape you, rape you psychically.
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:09.880]  And then you'll experience that.
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:16.880]  Man, I hope so because it's been like three years and just every time it's about something is about to happen.
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:22.880]  I just get overwhelmed with fear and I guess just keep praying and you don't need to work.
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:27.880]  You need to be afraid of not getting with God and say, I don't care about the fear and that threat.
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:30.880]  You feel that block there saying, you know, you don't want to do this.
[3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:33.880]  It'll be a lot better if you just know, no, don't go with that.
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:36.880]  No, no, just bad things are going to happen.
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:38.880]  You don't want to go with God.
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:41.880]  We'll be nice to you if you just don't go with God.
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:44.880]  That's literal entities, my friend.
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:46.880]  You need to just say, no, I want Jesus.
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:49.880]  Jesus protect me. Jesus help me.
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:55.880]  Cry out to Jesus Christ. Get on your knees and cry out to Jesus Christ to save you and protect you.
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:57.880]  And God will save you.
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:09:58.880]  100% man, thank you.
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:03.880]  And I appreciate the soliloquies you go on about this God and consciousness.
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:06.880]  You never know who's watching and that helps me a lot, man.
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:07.880]  I appreciate you a lot.
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:08.880]  Well, that helps me a lot too.
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:13.880]  Believe me, I've been through a lot of my life.
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:15.880]  I've seen a lot of things and so I understand.
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:21.880]  But there'll come a day when you've been close to God so long that none of their stuff even matters anymore.
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:23.880]  And there's no threats, no fear of them.
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:26.880]  But it's sad that other people aren't strong enough to just beat this quicker.
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:28.880]  I mean, it's so pathetic.
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:31.880]  It's just like the Bible says at the end and the devil's chained up in a cage.
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:34.880]  And people are saying that's who got away with all this.
[3:10:34.880 --> 3:10:36.880]  That's the master villain.
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:39.880]  When people can see what we really are compared to the devil.
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:43.880]  The devil is jealous of you.
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:48.880]  Satan wants to destroy you because you're so powerful.
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:51.880]  But once you realize you have that power, you're not going to want the power anymore.
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:59.880]  Because you're going to realize it's all part of a larger plan.
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:01.880]  All right, let's go to Christian and Missouri.
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  Christian, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:07.880]  Owen Shroyer, the delusion destroyer.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:08.880]  I know.
[3:11:08.880 --> 3:11:09.880]  I know.
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:10.880]  I know.
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:11.880]  I know.
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:12.880]  I know.
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:13.880]  I know.
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:14.880]  I know.
[3:11:14.880 --> 3:11:15.880]  I know.
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:16.880]  I know.
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:17.880]  I know.
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:18.880]  I know that.
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:19.880]  I know.
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:21.880]  I know the man I called him to the show once about a week ago.
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:23.880]  I tell you what, we do appreciate him in the Midwest.
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:24.880]  He's an inspiration.
[3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:26.880]  At nine oh nine this morning, I don't.
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:30.880]  Think it was the same time, but nine oh nine this morning I said to my wife, I said,
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:32.880]  today is going to be a big day.
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:33.880]  And I can feel it.
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:34.880]  There was a surge.
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:35.880]  I could feel that surge.
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:39.880]  And it was just someone finally standing up to those monsters.
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:41.880]  And it sure was a little thing.
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:43.400]  He's able to get out there and do this.
[3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:46.760]  But brother, when you spread the word about us,
[3:11:46.760 --> 3:11:48.360]  brother, when you spread the word about us
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:50.840]  and when you financially support us and get great products,
[3:11:50.840 --> 3:11:51.920]  Christian, you were there.
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:53.200]  That was you today.
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:56.040]  You guys put Owen in the field today.
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:11:57.040]  She meant to that.
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:11:59.280]  It blamed me.
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:02.360]  Hey, on today's subject though,
[3:12:02.360 --> 3:12:03.680]  I was talking to my wife about this.
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:06.000]  I said, one of three things is probably gonna come out.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:07.440]  They're all gonna go to jail.
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:08.280]  There's gonna be something in the middle
[3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:09.440]  to make us all happy.
[3:12:09.440 --> 3:12:10.880]  That's what I predicted.
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:12.240]  Are there's gonna be something on the opposite end
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:13.760]  where nothing really happened?
[3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:15.120]  They just made a mistake.
[3:12:15.120 --> 3:12:16.520]  They just inspired me.
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:17.600]  I'm mad.
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:19.040]  I ain't gonna put up with this.
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:20.880]  It was, if it was all of them,
[3:12:20.880 --> 3:12:22.680]  we probably all went back to sleep maybe kind of.
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:24.920]  I don't know, we've all been happy and, you know,
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:27.400]  it would have felt kind of empty.
[3:12:27.400 --> 3:12:29.240]  But now we've got a reason to fight.
[3:12:30.680 --> 3:12:31.520]  You're right, Christian.
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:32.360]  God bless you.
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:33.200]  I appreciate your call.
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:35.320]  Yeah, I felt a surge this morning, literally,
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:36.480]  and thought we're gonna take action.
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:37.640]  We're gonna march on Congress.
[3:12:37.640 --> 3:12:38.840]  People are gonna hit the streets.
[3:12:38.840 --> 3:12:41.720]  That's the answer is empowering people to do that.
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:44.680]  And then five minutes later, it was happening,
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:45.680]  and I told the reporter on the phone,
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:46.840]  I go, how long ago it happened?
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:47.800]  About five minutes ago.
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:50.080]  And I went and looked at the time,
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:50.920]  looked back on it.
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:53.320]  It was like literally, I felt the surge of that happening
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:55.080]  because that little action was so big.
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:58.200]  If you let one aunt stand up, they might all stand up.
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:00.800]  Jordan and Louisiana, then Jason, go ahead, Jordan.
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:04.720]  Hey, Alex, I've been listening to you
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:06.880]  since 2011, 2012.
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:09.480]  You're right, spreading the word of mouth,
[3:13:09.480 --> 3:13:11.840]  by word of mouth is the best way to get across.
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:14.880]  I had a customer that introduced me to your show,
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:16.680]  and I've been listening ever since.
[3:13:17.840 --> 3:13:20.080]  I just wanted to say that I think
[3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:24.440]  Inspection Report is exactly written
[3:13:24.440 --> 3:13:27.240]  by the same people who wrote the Mueller Report.
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:30.680]  It's a nothing burger on purpose.
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:32.920]  And it's completely ridiculous.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:36.240]  It's a farce.
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:41.240]  And I've been introduced to the legal process by Judge Dale
[3:13:41.960 --> 3:13:43.560]  about how America was corporatized,
[3:13:43.560 --> 3:13:47.080]  run by all these large corporations.
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:49.720]  And you've been saying that for a long time.
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:54.200]  And just reading that and seeing what happened today,
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:13:58.760]  it's time for everybody to take action.
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:01.600]  It's we the people, we don't worship the government.
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:03.560]  We are the government.
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:04.400]  That's right, brother.
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:08.600]  And they can't report on the corruption
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:10.920]  because they're all corrupted at a certain point.
[3:14:10.920 --> 3:14:12.880]  And so they're all blackmailing each other.
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:14.120]  And then foreign governments come in
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:15.840]  and they totally roll over them for money.
[3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:18.360]  And because the foreign governments are unified,
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:21.080]  China's unified, they don't allow this kind of stuff
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:21.920]  at their governmental level.
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:25.320]  They're taking over because we're run by a bunch of scum.
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:26.880]  I bless you, I appreciate your call.
[3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:28.200]  Jason, real fast at California.
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:30.280]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:32.240]  Hey, Alex, first time caller.
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:33.600]  Thank you for taking my call.
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:34.680]  Welcome.
[3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:38.680]  I have a little more faith in the IG report
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:39.640]  than you at the moment,
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:41.760]  although I understand the frustration.
[3:14:42.640 --> 3:14:44.800]  Faith is the only thing keeping me going.
[3:14:44.800 --> 3:14:48.920]  And I believe that most Americans with the brain
[3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:51.360]  will see the impeachment scam that's going on.
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:56.440]  They'll see the IG report and all the Brennan
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:00.320]  and all the corrupt FBI officials that were behind it.
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:03.240]  And I saw Durham and General Barr,
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:05.680]  they came out and said that they disagree
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:07.640]  with what the IG report put out.
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:10.240]  So I'm hoping that people will connect the dots
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:14.560]  and see that the IG report, you know.
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:17.640]  Well, hey, all I'm saying is I'm not gonna wait for Durham.
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:18.880]  I'm gonna expose and fight the globalists,
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:19.720]  but God bless you.
[3:15:19.720 --> 3:15:21.000]  I appreciate your call, great point.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:22.520]  I'm gonna introduce Charles Salante.
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:25.480]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:28.000]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:29.160]  I actually read it in a book
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:31.200]  about Winston Churchill many years ago
[3:17:31.200 --> 3:17:33.680]  and I've found a few places where it's mentioned
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:34.760]  but if you can find it,
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:36.680]  please send it to showtipsdemphalewords.com
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:38.480]  and he talked about in the darkest hours
[3:17:38.480 --> 3:17:40.000]  at the beginning of World War II
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:41.920]  the fact that there have been times in history
[3:17:41.920 --> 3:17:43.880]  where people had a chance to stand up
[3:17:43.880 --> 3:17:45.960]  and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:47.480]  Then there was a second point in history
[3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:48.920]  where folks have to fight
[3:17:48.920 --> 3:17:52.080]  even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:54.920]  There's a third time when you know you're gonna lose
[3:17:54.920 --> 3:17:58.080]  but you have to fight because being enslaved
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:17:59.800]  and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:01.080]  That's a paraphrase.
[3:18:01.080 --> 3:18:02.360]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[3:18:02.360 --> 3:18:05.520]  we are in the position now of being able to win this easily
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:07.600]  if we find our spirit, find our focus
[3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:09.360]  and don't give up and take action.
[3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:11.440]  But if we don't stand up and get involved
[3:18:11.440 --> 3:18:14.800]  we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:15.800]  That's a fact.
[3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:18.360]  They fear infowars because we are alive.
[3:18:18.360 --> 3:18:21.360]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:25.400]  If you understand why the globalist,
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:27.960]  why the servants of Satan hate infowars
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:32.480]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate
[3:18:32.480 --> 3:18:35.080]  and we're not giving up.
[3:18:35.080 --> 3:18:38.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:39.960]  of the New World Order's plans
[3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:42.040]  to not get down when they attack us
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:44.560]  and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:46.200]  That's what we should expect
[3:18:46.200 --> 3:18:49.120]  because we are hurting these scumbags.
[3:18:49.120 --> 3:18:52.360]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:55.040]  and they do what they do because they're slaves
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:58.120]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[3:18:58.120 --> 3:19:00.560]  and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:02.680]  It is up to us who are awake,
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:04.920]  not the sheep and not the wolves
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:08.000]  but the sheep dogs to stand firm
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:10.520]  and resist these wicked tyrants.
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:13.280]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:15.880]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:18.920]  They fear the fact that we love God
[3:19:18.920 --> 3:19:21.000]  and that's all we ever have to know
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:22.800]  is that God is in charge.
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:28.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:34.720 --> 3:19:41.080]  The New World Order
[3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:47.080]  I'm Alex Salante, a selling author, good friend of mine.
[3:19:47.080 --> 3:19:49.720]  PatriotTrendsResearch.com is taking over right now
[3:19:49.720 --> 3:19:52.040]  and I know he's got a lot to cover.
[3:19:52.040 --> 3:19:54.120]  But I wanted to just state
[3:19:54.120 --> 3:19:55.200]  because I heard the last callers say,
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:19:57.400]  hey, let's not be too down, let's be optimistic.
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:19:58.240]  I'm optimistic.
[3:19:58.240 --> 3:20:00.160]  America is waking up to globalism.
[3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:04.280]  Nationalists and populists are getting elected all over
[3:20:04.280 --> 3:20:07.840]  and so that's a lot better than we were five years ago.
[3:20:07.840 --> 3:20:11.440]  But I don't expect an inspector general appointed by Obama
[3:20:11.440 --> 3:20:13.720]  to expose Obama and his illegal operation
[3:20:13.720 --> 3:20:16.800]  with Hillary against Trump in the campaign.
[3:20:16.800 --> 3:20:19.480]  Now, maybe Durham's gonna be different,
[3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:20.960]  but I'm not gonna sit here and hold my breath.
[3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:22.880]  You know, this was supposed to discredit the impeachment
[3:20:22.880 --> 3:20:25.000]  and be the big punch in the gut to all this
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:26.080]  and of course it's not.
[3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:30.560]  But Durham is running the investigation,
[3:20:31.360 --> 3:20:32.720]  one of the criminal investigations
[3:20:32.720 --> 3:20:35.160]  of the fake Russiagate operation says,
[3:20:35.160 --> 3:20:37.440]  this is today, I have the utmost respect
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:40.280]  for the mission of the office of inspector general
[3:20:40.280 --> 3:20:42.960]  and the comprehensive work that went into the report
[3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:44.720]  prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff.
[3:20:44.720 --> 3:20:46.960]  However, our investigation is unlimited
[3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:48.760]  to developing information
[3:20:48.760 --> 3:20:51.800]  from within component parts of the just department.
[3:20:51.800 --> 3:20:54.840]  Our investigation has included developing information
[3:20:54.840 --> 3:20:57.120]  from other persons and entities,
[3:20:57.120 --> 3:20:59.240]  both in the US and outside of the US
[3:20:59.240 --> 3:21:01.040]  based on the evidence collected to date.
[3:21:01.040 --> 3:21:03.200]  And while our investigation is ongoing,
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:05.960]  last month we advised inspector general,
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:09.440]  who we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions
[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:14.440]  as to the prediction and how the FBI case was open.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  Again, last month we advised inspector general
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:21.720]  that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:26.720]  as to predication, excuse me, how they started it
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:29.120]  and how the FBI case was opened.
[3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:32.400]  And that's what he has to say.
[3:21:32.400 --> 3:21:36.680]  So I'm just not betting on people from the deep state
[3:21:36.680 --> 3:21:39.480]  because you can have the deputy attorney general
[3:21:39.480 --> 3:21:41.720]  kill indictments that Durham calls for.
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:45.320]  Now, Gerald Salente is a smart guy.
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:46.760]  I can't wait to eat my lunch
[3:21:46.760 --> 3:21:49.520]  and listen to the rest of this hour and hear what he has
[3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:51.840]  to say, Trump's doing a great job
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:53.280]  trying to end these wars and new peace deals.
[3:21:53.280 --> 3:21:54.440]  He's doing a great job in many fronts,
[3:21:54.440 --> 3:21:57.000]  but letting the censorship go on
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:58.280]  and letting all this unfold,
[3:21:58.280 --> 3:21:59.960]  what is your report card on this Gerald?
[3:21:59.960 --> 3:22:02.080]  And please take over, I appreciate you being here today
[3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:04.720]  and what are you thinking is gonna really unfold
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:06.920]  and what are your trends for 2020 election
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:09.120]  with 329 days out, my friend?
[3:22:10.160 --> 3:22:13.000]  Well, we're coming out with our top trends for 2020.
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:14.720]  They're gonna be out tomorrow.
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.240]  And one of them is Trump by default in 2020.
[3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:20.960]  And all we do is look at the numbers
[3:22:20.960 --> 3:22:25.960]  and you know, we were the first magazine back in May of 2016
[3:22:26.760 --> 3:22:29.040]  to forecast Trump a winner.
[3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:30.680]  And not a political atheist
[3:22:30.680 --> 3:22:32.880]  that don't take sides on these things.
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:35.560]  But when you look at who he's running against,
[3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:39.840]  if Biden comes up, it's gonna be a lot of dirt coming out
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:42.600]  about all the dirty deals that Biden's got
[3:22:42.600 --> 3:22:44.720]  for his little boy, Hunter.
[3:22:44.720 --> 3:22:49.720]  And this impeachment inquiry in the process going on
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:54.480]  is going to backfire on them in a very harmful way
[3:22:54.480 --> 3:22:56.280]  to the Democratic Party,
[3:22:56.280 --> 3:22:58.880]  because it's going to show the amount of corruption
[3:22:58.880 --> 3:23:01.400]  that goes on and all the dirty deals.
[3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:04.120]  And the same thing with the repulsive gins, by the way.
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:06.360]  If you go back to all the dirty deals that happened
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:09.200]  during the Iraq war, the Afghan war,
[3:23:09.200 --> 3:23:11.760]  and went to the military industrial complex,
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:13.400]  but this is gonna make it really clear.
[3:23:13.400 --> 3:23:14.240]  So Biden-
[3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:15.320]  By the way, I totally agree with you,
[3:23:15.320 --> 3:23:16.880]  but let me just ask this question then.
[3:23:16.880 --> 3:23:18.240]  What are the Democrats thinking
[3:23:18.240 --> 3:23:20.000]  where they can rig it in the house,
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:21.640]  but it's all gonna come out in the Senate.
[3:23:21.640 --> 3:23:23.960]  What the hell are they thinking?
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:26.480]  Well, that's why I call them the demo craps.
[3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:30.680]  What they don't understand is who they're fighting against.
[3:23:30.680 --> 3:23:32.480]  Trump is a New Yorker.
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:35.200]  This guy doesn't go down.
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:37.960]  You know, you like him, hate him, whatever he is,
[3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:41.440]  the dirty deals, he fights to the end.
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:46.360]  I know people that know him personally at a business level.
[3:23:46.360 --> 3:23:50.160]  This guy is, they totally underestimate them.
[3:23:50.160 --> 3:23:53.680]  They're a bunch of rookies in the politicians.
[3:23:53.680 --> 3:23:54.520]  I agree.
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:56.200]  All these white chuboys may have hijacked the country
[3:23:56.200 --> 3:23:57.320]  for the last 40 years,
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:23:58.800]  but they don't know how to fight their way
[3:23:58.800 --> 3:24:00.880]  with a wet picker bag, they've never run anything real.
[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:03.400]  They don't like to work 20 hours a day like Trump does.
[3:24:03.400 --> 3:24:05.800]  They don't get that they're also summoning
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:08.240]  the grassroots of America out of their slumber
[3:24:08.240 --> 3:24:10.440]  and really pissing people off.
[3:24:10.440 --> 3:24:12.920]  It's exactly it, because as you point out,
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:15.720]  it's ridiculous that this is moving forward.
[3:24:15.720 --> 3:24:18.080]  Being that it's going to go into the Senate
[3:24:18.080 --> 3:24:21.600]  and the Senate is already a majority Republican,
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:23.560]  there's certainly not going to get
[3:24:23.560 --> 3:24:26.360]  two thirds of the votes to convict him.
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:30.000]  So it's a total waste of time and energy.
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:33.040]  And this is very important because,
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:34.960]  let me finish before I go into that.
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:39.160]  So now if Biden's not there, he's left with what?
[3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:42.680]  Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.
[3:24:42.680 --> 3:24:44.800]  They're not going to win the swing states.
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:45.880]  It's as simple as that.
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:46.720]  I agree.
[3:24:46.720 --> 3:24:48.600]  What is the point of Bloomberg?
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:51.600]  Bloomberg is there because of his ego.
[3:24:51.600 --> 3:24:53.920]  And he knows it clear.
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:24:57.760]  He said they don't know what it takes to beat Trump.
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:24:59.680]  And he thinks he does.
[3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:02.960]  But Bloomberg's going to go nowhere in our opinion
[3:25:02.960 --> 3:25:06.160]  because the stop in Frisk is going to kill him,
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:08.240]  show him what a fraud he is.
[3:25:08.240 --> 3:25:11.240]  I mean, could you imagine freedom in the United States?
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:12.880]  You're walking down the street.
[3:25:12.880 --> 3:25:16.680]  You don't like the way that black guy, that Latino looks.
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:18.080]  Hey, get over here.
[3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:19.480]  Put up your arms.
[3:25:19.480 --> 3:25:21.720]  Let me Frisky to see what you got.
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:25.880]  Over a million people is dirty, lousy, Bloomberg.
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:28.760]  And he wants to tell people what to eat and what to drink.
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:30.640]  I mean, the guy's a control freak.
[3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:31.640]  Exactly.
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:33.640]  Because he's a multi-billionaire.
[3:25:33.640 --> 3:25:35.200]  And he got the dough to do it.
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:39.120]  So now, like all lowlife people, when they get caught,
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:43.960]  this little slimer was defending his stop in Frisk actions
[3:25:43.960 --> 3:25:47.520]  until weeks before he announced his candidacy.
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:50.320]  And then he comes out with, well, I'm sorry.
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:25:53.680]  Hey, you're sorry you got caught and you got to face up to it.
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:59.160]  So going back to the other ones and in the election cycle,
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:04.240]  there's nobody in that process that's going to beat Trump
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:07.240]  on the swing state issues.
[3:26:07.240 --> 3:26:08.600]  They're not going to get it.
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:12.200]  So that's why we're forecasting, minus the wild card.
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:13.840]  And Trump is a wild card.
[3:26:13.840 --> 3:26:15.800]  There's a lot of wild cards out there.
[3:26:15.800 --> 3:26:18.400]  Minus the wild card is Trump 2020.
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:20.400]  Well, I can't wait to see your trends.
[3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:21.880]  I didn't know they were coming out tomorrow.
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:23.280]  This is the Alex Jones show right now.
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:24.280]  This hour is as big as any hour.
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:26.680]  But if you've got 30 minutes to pop on tomorrow,
[3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:28.680]  I'd love you to come on and go with the trends with us tomorrow.
[3:26:28.680 --> 3:26:31.200]  But I know you're going to preview some of those right now.
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:32.680]  And people should definitely visit your website.
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:34.400]  So, Gerald, thanks for letting me steal some of the time.
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:35.400]  God bless.
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:36.400]  Oh, thank you.
[3:26:36.400 --> 3:26:40.400]  Thank you for all that you do.
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:45.400]  So here we are, moving into the elections.
[3:26:45.400 --> 3:26:49.400]  It's a waste of time, as I was beginning to say with Alex,
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:52.400]  to keep tuning into this impeachment garbage.
[3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:55.400]  That's all you're getting from the major media.
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:26:59.400]  Let's forget about what's going on over there in France.
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:00.400]  Yeah.
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:02.400]  Oh, the girls in France.
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:05.400]  So that was an old song when I was a young guy.
[3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:07.400]  What's going on in France?
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:12.400]  First, the yellow vest movement a year ago, November.
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:15.400]  And that was because they raised petrol prices.
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:17.400]  But that's not what it was about.
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:21.400]  It was about the rich getting all the dough and the people getting nothing.
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:25.400]  And they can't stand that arrogant Macron, the little god son.
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:28.400]  So now they have a strike going on.
[3:27:28.400 --> 3:27:32.400]  300 mile backup on the roads.
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:35.400]  Nothing going on.
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:38.400]  Trains stopped, only two of them running.
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:43.400]  Big strike picking up from where the yellow vest left off.
[3:27:43.400 --> 3:27:45.400]  People don't know what this means.
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:47.400]  It's bigger than France.
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:49.400]  Take a trip to Lebanon.
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:54.400]  All around the world, one place after another,
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:57.400]  riots, protests, demonstrations.
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:27:59.400]  What does it mean?
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:01.400]  Where is it going?
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:03.400]  What's next?
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:05.400]  And that's what we're coming back to.
[3:28:05.400 --> 3:28:06.400]  What's next?
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:11.400]  Because this is a whole new world disorder.
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:16.400]  And that's one of your top trends also, the 2020.
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:38.400]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:01.400]  That's it.

[3:29:10.880 --> 3:29:16.200]  That's 1-866-509-5817 or flashrouters.com.
[3:29:16.200 --> 3:29:19.680]  Protect your wireless home network today with flash routers.
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:27.080]  I don't have to tell you that America is in a war
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:28.720]  for its actual survival.
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:30.400]  And we're a war against a group that's
[3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:33.760]  trying to conquer our very spirit, our very essence,
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:36.320]  that's trying to break our will, trying to destroy our families,
[3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:40.560]  trying to literally poison us physically and psychically
[3:29:40.560 --> 3:29:41.680]  at a spiritual level.
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:43.040]  Well, Info Wars is fighting back,
[3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:46.400]  but it takes money to stand against the globalist onslaught
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:48.760]  and to be able to put the reporters on the ground
[3:29:48.760 --> 3:29:51.240]  and build the infrastructure to tell the truth
[3:29:51.240 --> 3:29:52.960]  in the face of their lives.
[3:29:52.960 --> 3:29:57.040]  That's why we're running Giant Cyber Week Specials, the biggest
[3:29:57.040 --> 3:29:59.760]  of the year, the biggest of our history.
[3:29:59.760 --> 3:30:02.200]  Don't do your shopping with the big globalist box stores
[3:30:02.200 --> 3:30:04.480]  that hate your guts and are financing gun control
[3:30:04.480 --> 3:30:05.400]  and all the rest of it.
[3:30:05.400 --> 3:30:08.840]  Don't do your shopping with the New World Order, Amazon.
[3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:10.520]  Do it with Info Wars Store.
[3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:12.200]  Get high quality supplements.
[3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:14.480]  Get high quality air filtration, water filtration,
[3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:16.480]  Patriot apparel, and so much more.
[3:30:16.480 --> 3:30:19.400]  And every order gets a whole bunch of free Info Wars
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:20.800]  bumper stickers to spread the word.
[3:30:20.800 --> 3:30:23.400]  Take action, folks.
[3:30:23.400 --> 3:30:25.320]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[3:30:25.320 --> 3:30:27.160]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[3:30:27.160 --> 3:30:30.680]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[3:30:30.680 --> 3:30:32.720]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[3:30:32.720 --> 3:30:36.600]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:39.200]  where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[3:30:39.200 --> 3:30:43.200]  Your bang for your buck here gets you great products
[3:30:43.200 --> 3:30:47.240]  at great prices that literally fund the system
[3:30:47.240 --> 3:30:49.960]  where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home
[3:30:49.960 --> 3:30:50.560]  to the enemy.
[3:30:50.560 --> 3:30:51.640]  And so it's very simple.
[3:30:51.640 --> 3:30:53.520]  If you don't want to be slaves and you
[3:30:53.520 --> 3:30:56.800]  want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants
[3:30:56.800 --> 3:30:58.880]  to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[3:30:58.880 --> 3:31:01.720]  110% God will finish the move.
[3:31:01.720 --> 3:31:04.440]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack,
[3:31:04.440 --> 3:31:05.400]  attack, attack.
[3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:06.360]  I want to attack.
[3:31:06.360 --> 3:31:07.880]  I want to go after the globalists.
[3:31:07.880 --> 3:31:09.440]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:11.440]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[3:31:11.440 --> 3:31:13.000]  to fight for all of our futures together,
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:15.080]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[3:31:15.080 --> 3:31:17.040]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything
[3:31:17.040 --> 3:31:19.880]  I got for us, for myself, and my family, and your family.
[3:31:19.880 --> 3:31:20.960]  Because we're in this together.

[3:32:26.680 --> 3:32:29.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:47.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:32:47.520 --> 3:32:59.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:32:59.520 --> 3:33:03.960]  Hello, hello, glad to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:03.960 --> 3:33:07.360]  So I was just talking about what's going on in France
[3:33:07.360 --> 3:33:10.040]  that hardly makes the media here.
[3:33:10.040 --> 3:33:12.200]  You've got over a million people taking to the streets,
[3:33:12.200 --> 3:33:14.480]  strikes, big time.
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:17.360]  They call Macron the little cots on over there,
[3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:20.000]  the prime minister, or president,
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:22.120]  whatever you want to call them.
[3:33:22.120 --> 3:33:24.280]  The president, I believe.
[3:33:24.280 --> 3:33:30.600]  He's a, they call him arrogant and disconnected
[3:33:30.600 --> 3:33:31.920]  to the people.
[3:33:31.920 --> 3:33:33.680]  He has a Rothschild boy.
[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:36.680]  That's right, worked for the Rothschild man.
[3:33:36.680 --> 3:33:39.160]  Totally disconnected.
[3:33:39.160 --> 3:33:42.040]  And then you look at what's going on in Hong Kong.
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:44.840]  This weekend again, and nearly a million people
[3:33:44.840 --> 3:33:45.840]  to the streets.
[3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:49.880]  A million people in a place of 7.5, 7. something
[3:33:49.880 --> 3:33:51.560]  million people.
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:54.720]  In America, how many people you get out for a protest?
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:57.360]  A 325 million.
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:33:59.440]  Lucky to get a million out.
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:02.600]  There's no fight left back in this country.
[3:34:02.600 --> 3:34:05.400]  Then you take a look what's going on in Chile.
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:08.240]  Every week, more demonstrations going on.
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:11.000]  The billionaire running the show, Panera.
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:14.080]  Yeah, not the bread company, another piece of bread.
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:18.720]  Yeah, another billionaire.
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:26.320]  One country after another, Romania, Algeria, Lebanon,
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:36.200]  Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Cameroon, Sudan,
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:44.440]  Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guinea, one nation after another.
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:48.120]  The people are revolting because it's
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:51.240]  revolting for what they're going through.
[3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:53.840]  All the money's gone to the top.
[3:34:53.840 --> 3:34:55.360]  Like the Bloomberg.
[3:34:55.360 --> 3:34:57.640]  You'd think Bloomberg would be anywhere
[3:34:57.640 --> 3:35:04.520]  if you didn't have all that dough with a personality like his.
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:07.800]  What is he spending, depending on whose numbers you're looking
[3:35:07.800 --> 3:35:13.440]  at, he spent about 50 million bucks already.
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:18.880]  He spent more than all the demo craps he's spent already.
[3:35:18.880 --> 3:35:21.440]  That's what America has turned into.
[3:35:21.440 --> 3:35:26.320]  And put a K on that, get rid of that C. It's America.
[3:35:26.320 --> 3:35:31.160]  Going back to what's going on in all these countries,
[3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:33.360]  they're rising up against the losses of freedom.
[3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:35.240]  Spain, that's what that's about.
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:37.080]  Catalonians want their freedom.
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:40.400]  Hong Kong, it's about freedom.
[3:35:40.400 --> 3:35:47.600]  Algeria and all the rest, it's about money, the bottom line.
[3:35:47.600 --> 3:35:50.800]  And the rich having everything and nobody else having anything.
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:53.080]  And you know my saying, when people lose everything
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:55.440]  and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:35:57.520]  And they're losing it big time.
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:01.840]  This is going to be my 40th year in the trend forecasting
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:05.880]  business, began in 1980.
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:09.360]  Never have I seen what's going on around the world like now.
[3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:14.080]  And most people are totally disconnected.
[3:36:14.080 --> 3:36:15.760]  They're watching the impeachment stuff,
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:17.360]  talking about impeachment.
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:19.440]  It means nothing.
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:22.880]  And Trump knows it.
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:26.200]  But I forgot to tell Alex, the other reasons
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:30.360]  why Trump is going to win, it'll lower interest rates
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:33.920]  to zero with negative interest rate policy by this time
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:34.440]  next year.
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:37.080]  So the economy will still keep coming.
[3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:41.400]  Next, peace treaty.
[3:36:41.400 --> 3:36:46.400]  That's right, with North Korea and Afghanistan.
[3:36:46.400 --> 3:36:49.920]  End, end a trade deal.
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:36:52.280]  It's the odd at a deal.
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:56.320]  And Trump knows how to do it better than the rest.
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:36:58.160]  He's a pro at this.
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:02.160]  He's a presidential reality show champion.
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:04.960]  And I should say a reality show champion.
[3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:07.600]  He knows how to play the game.
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:11.280]  He's up against a bunch of rookies.
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:12.480]  You don't believe me.
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:14.920]  Just watch a little bit of that freak show
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:18.280]  called the impeachment hearings.
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:20.320]  So that's what we're looking at.
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:22.440]  Now, going back to what I'm talking about,
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:26.760]  with all these protests going on around the world,
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:30.080]  you're going to start seeing violence, corruption being
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:34.840]  attacked off with their heads, 2.0.
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:37.080]  That's going to be another trend.
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:41.920]  They're going to want to take out the bigs at all the levels.
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:43.880]  I've never seen this happen before.
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:47.640]  The implications are going to be horrendous.
[3:37:47.640 --> 3:37:53.680]  Again, no one in the media is talking about this
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:58.760]  and putting it all together.
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:04.520]  What it means, what's going on, and what's next.
[3:38:04.520 --> 3:38:09.040]  And the what's next are going to be horrendous.
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:11.800]  The world is not prepared for this.
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:14.440]  The governments aren't prepared for it.
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:16.840]  They're ignoring it around the world.
[3:38:16.840 --> 3:38:18.200]  Oh, it's only happening in France.
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:19.360]  It's only happening in Chile.
[3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:21.040]  It's only happening in Bolivia.
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:22.360]  It's only happening in Ecuador.
[3:38:22.360 --> 3:38:26.560]  It's only happening in Argentina.
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:28.320]  Oh, yeah, their currency.
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:29.440]  What is it?
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:34.960]  Oh, it's down only 57% this year.
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:35.480]  Iran.
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:40.400]  Iraq.
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:42.880]  Look what's going on in Iraq.
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:48.920]  It killed about 500 people since the protests began in October.
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:51.240]  And what are they protesting against?
[3:38:51.240 --> 3:38:55.360]  Corruption, violence, lack of jobs,
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:38:57.760]  the elites running the show.
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:00.560]  Well, you know what they're not talking about in any of this?
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:03.200]  Who caused the problems in Iraq?
[3:39:03.200 --> 3:39:09.040]  How about the war criminals, the Dick, Cheney, and the Bush?
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:12.560]  Dick and Bush, yeah.
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:16.560]  Dick and Bush lied us into that war,
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:19.320]  destroyed an entire nation, an estimated cost
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:23.440]  to we the taxpayers of trillions of dollars,
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:26.960]  killed an estimated million people.
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:29.680]  Hey, wonder why they have radical terrorists?
[3:39:29.680 --> 3:39:30.720]  We wouldn't be radical.
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:36.000]  I could never imagine anyone, anyone,
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:41.160]  working with Alex Jones in four wars,
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:46.920]  wanting to get even if a foreign nation came in here,
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:51.320]  destroy the country, turn Austin into dust,
[3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:56.160]  kill everybody that you love, and you have no future.
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:39:59.360]  Oh, you wouldn't want to fight back?
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:01.240]  No.
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:06.400]  Your info wars, you just keep your mouth silent
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:10.160]  and just be good little boys and good little girls.
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:11.760]  Of course not.
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:14.440]  You'd be out leading the charge.
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:16.760]  And that's what's going on.
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:19.160]  As I say, payback's a bitch.
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:24.280]  And you reap what you sow.
[3:40:24.280 --> 3:40:28.160]  In America, what America is sowing with these wars,
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:30.520]  we're going to be reaping.
[3:40:30.520 --> 3:40:33.280]  Terrorists, guess what?
[3:40:33.280 --> 3:40:35.560]  If you came to my country and destroyed
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:42.080]  and killed everybody I love, I'm back at you, Jack and Jill.
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:46.800]  Yeah, I'll attack the attacker.
[3:40:46.800 --> 3:40:49.280]  So going back to Iraq, no one's
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:53.040]  talking about why it's happening and what's going on,
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:55.400]  except to say, oh, the Iranians are influencing.
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:58.800]  The Iranians, they got a game, play in a game.
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:02.760]  But people forget that under Reagan and that other guy,
[3:41:02.760 --> 3:41:05.880]  Carter, they started, they planned the war,
[3:41:05.880 --> 3:41:08.320]  Iraq against Iran in the 1980s.
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:12.120]  They killed over a million Iranians.
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:14.080]  So yeah, they're influencing their neighbors over there.
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:15.960]  They got stuff going on.
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:19.200]  None of my business, I'm an American.
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:21.480]  No foreign entanglements.
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:23.640]  So going on around the world, the countries
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:25.320]  are not prepared for what's going on.
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:28.040]  The people are not going to prepare for what's going on.
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:30.360]  And we're going to talk more about it tomorrow.
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:33.400]  I'm going to try to be on Info Wars tomorrow at 12 o'clock.
[3:41:33.400 --> 3:41:36.000]  And I'm going to feed you, fill you in with more
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:38.840]  of the top trends for 2020.
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:45.600]  And they connect very deeply to the New World Disorder.
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:48.200]  And that's what we have now.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:51.760]  I've never seen anything like this before.
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:54.080]  And one more important element.
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:57.840]  All of these places that I've mentioned around the world,
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:05.600]  from Zimbabwe to Chile, from Colombia to Lebanon,
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:07.880]  you know who's leading it?
[3:42:07.880 --> 3:42:09.840]  Not one leader.
[3:42:09.840 --> 3:42:12.640]  It's led by we the people.
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:13.600]  That's right.
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:17.200]  The people are in charge, not the leaders.
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:18.520]  So lead the way.
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:20.160]  You're one of the people.
[3:42:20.160 --> 3:42:22.240]  Right back.

[3:43:22.880 --> 3:43:24.960]  My fellow Americans, many of you
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:27.560]  will have been following the impeachment proceedings brought
[3:43:27.560 --> 3:43:29.480]  against me by the Democrats.
[3:43:29.480 --> 3:43:32.600]  There's political witch hunt is tearing our country apart
[3:43:32.600 --> 3:43:33.960]  and not in a good way.
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:36.320]  While I truly believe that I'm completely
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:39.400]  innocent of all charges, I have nonetheless decided
[3:43:39.400 --> 3:43:41.320]  to make the following announcement.
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:44.280]  Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[3:43:44.280 --> 3:43:47.400]  What you just heard was not President Trump.
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:50.880]  It was a deep fake that just went live on the internet
[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:52.000]  yesterday.
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:53.720]  President Trump did not say.
[3:43:53.720 --> 3:43:56.240]  Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:43:59.800]  Now, the audio can fool you, but the video really does.
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:00.520]  Tune in to us.
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:02.200]  We'll tell you what's real and what's fake.
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:04.440]  When it's mainstream media that famously
[3:44:04.440 --> 3:44:06.840]  has been caught doing thousands of deep fakes,
[3:44:06.840 --> 3:44:10.760]  like ABC and the supposed curd attack footage that was really
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:12.800]  Knob Creek machine gun shootout, or stuff
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:15.240]  that Megan Kelly has done to me with deep fakes,
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:16.840]  these people are sick.
[3:44:16.840 --> 3:44:19.760]  InfoWars has the history of exposing deep fakes,
[3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:23.480]  not being involved in them.
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:27.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:28.960]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:32.480]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better,
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:35.280]  and that's taking care of our individual health.
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:37.720]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:41.480]  this Christmas season than to go to infowarstore.com
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:43.960]  and get the highest quality supplements that
[3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:47.520]  are life changing in what they will do for you
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:50.720]  and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus,
[3:44:50.720 --> 3:44:53.520]  your health, your stamina, your libido.
[3:44:53.520 --> 3:44:55.680]  But then, of course, it also funds the InfoWars
[3:44:55.680 --> 3:44:57.360]  that is so incredibly critical.
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:00.160]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:02.640]  knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:04.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:08.000]  with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:09.800]  who literally are working against you
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:11.000]  and your family's future.
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  Spend your money on high-quality products
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:15.560]  and have huge savings, and don't fight the big crowds
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:18.840]  and the traffic at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:20.640]  That's infowarstore.com.
[3:45:20.640 --> 3:45:22.440]  Please make the right decision.
[3:45:22.440 --> 3:45:24.840]  It's shocking but true.
[3:45:24.840 --> 3:45:31.400]  2019 is almost a memory in the rear view mirror.
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:36.360]  And Cyber Week is here, the best deals of the year.
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:38.840]  Store-wide free shipping, triple Patriot points

[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:44.320]  Many of these products are lost leaders.
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:51.200]  We are only 330 days out from the 2020 election.
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:53.200]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:55.200]  It's an incredible time to still be on the air
[3:45:55.200 --> 3:45:57.800]  where almost everybody else has been shut down and censored.
[3:45:57.800 --> 3:45:59.600]  Yes, we were the first to be censored
[3:45:59.600 --> 3:46:01.200]  because we're such a threat to the globalists,
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:03.600]  but now, thanks to the infrastructure and your support,
[3:46:03.600 --> 3:46:04.800]  we're still on air.
[3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:08.200]  But bigger attacks are already happening, more are coming.
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:10.200]  So please spread the word about the broadcast
[3:46:10.200 --> 3:46:12.200]  and fund our operation while getting great products

[3:47:50.400 --> 3:47:53.400]  at InfoWarsStores.com.

[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:00.400]  because one of our top trends for 2019 was censorship
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:02.400]  2019.
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:06.400]  And it's gotten a lot worse everywhere.
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:09.400]  So do what you can to keep the truth alive.
[3:48:09.400 --> 3:48:11.400]  Support InfoWars.
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:14.400]  Oh, and by the way, it is Christmas time.
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:18.400]  And I know people talk about, you know, the Black Friday
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:25.400]  and discounts and what will retail sales be?
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:28.400]  But it is the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[3:48:28.400 --> 3:48:32.400]  And I am a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:37.400]  And that's why I launched Occupy Peace to fight evil
[3:48:37.400 --> 3:48:40.400]  because war is evil.
[3:48:40.400 --> 3:48:44.400]  The wars that we have, this is not in the doctrine
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:46.400]  of the Prince of Peace.
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:51.400]  So during this holiday season, may you consider a gift of peace
[3:48:51.400 --> 3:48:56.400]  by going to Occupy Peace because the more peace money
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:01.400]  that we get, the more we can do to change the tide.
[3:49:01.400 --> 3:49:05.400]  And we will not elevate to a higher society in a state
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:07.400]  of war and terror.
[3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:10.400]  You can't be creative in that kind of atmosphere.
[3:49:10.400 --> 3:49:14.400]  And you can see it going down around us, how we've declined
[3:49:14.400 --> 3:49:17.400]  since the war on terror began.
[3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:20.400]  And the Trends Journal, by the way, is a weekly.
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:22.400]  Went from a quarterly to a monthly to a weekly.
[3:49:22.400 --> 3:49:25.400]  I was just working on it before I got on the air.
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:27.400]  It goes out tomorrow.
[3:49:27.400 --> 3:49:33.400]  And I was writing about what happened in Afghanistan
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:36.400]  when the United States declared war against it
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:40.400]  under George, war criminal Bush.
[3:49:40.400 --> 3:49:43.400]  And again, he lied us into the Iraq war.
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:47.400]  And a lot of us knew it was a lie when it was going on.
[3:49:47.400 --> 3:49:50.400]  The story's right there.
[3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:53.400]  First it was to get that Osama bin Laden.
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:56.400]  And then it became, we got to bring freedom and democracy
[3:49:56.400 --> 3:49:58.400]  to the Afghan people.
[3:49:58.400 --> 3:50:01.400]  18 years of war keeps going on.
[3:50:01.400 --> 3:50:04.400]  Of course, we the taxpayer trillions.
[3:50:04.400 --> 3:50:07.400]  And with all the wars we're fighting, killing millions.
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:12.400]  So that is not what I believe in the Prince of Peace.
[3:50:12.400 --> 3:50:15.400]  And as a Catholic, I like to hear the Pope come out
[3:50:15.400 --> 3:50:18.400]  and all these Catholic priests come out
[3:50:18.400 --> 3:50:21.400]  and start preaching what the Prince of Peace preaches.
[3:50:21.400 --> 3:50:24.400]  But I don't hear it coming from them.
[3:50:24.400 --> 3:50:26.400]  So where are they?
[3:50:26.400 --> 3:50:29.400]  Anyway, moving on, the economy.
[3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:31.400]  I'm talking about what's going on globally.
[3:50:31.400 --> 3:50:33.400]  It's a global economic slowdown.
[3:50:33.400 --> 3:50:37.400]  America's picking up because the Trump tax cuts
[3:50:37.400 --> 3:50:40.400]  really boosted the economy in a lot of ways.
[3:50:40.400 --> 3:50:43.400]  But it didn't really boost real wages.
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:47.400]  But we have the multinationals just doing fine.
[3:50:47.400 --> 3:50:49.400]  They're still turning out the dough
[3:50:49.400 --> 3:50:54.400]  because everybody becomes a plantation worker in slave landia.
[3:50:54.400 --> 3:50:56.400]  The economy in America is stronger.
[3:50:56.400 --> 3:50:58.400]  We have interest rates that could go lower.
[3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:01.400]  When you go around the world, they can't lower them anymore.
[3:51:01.400 --> 3:51:03.400]  So what are they doing?
[3:51:03.400 --> 3:51:07.400]  Well, over there in Japan, they're dumping in
[3:51:07.400 --> 3:51:14.400]  a couple of hundred billion dollars into fiscal spending.
[3:51:14.400 --> 3:51:16.400]  It's not going to work.
[3:51:16.400 --> 3:51:20.400]  We have a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 256.
[3:51:20.400 --> 3:51:23.400]  America's is under 100.
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:25.400]  China's is over 300.
[3:51:25.400 --> 3:51:28.400]  Debt-to-GDP ratio, gross domestic product.
[3:51:28.400 --> 3:51:34.400]  India costs sales down in India this year 25% for the whole year.
[3:51:34.400 --> 3:51:37.400]  Over 100,000 workers have lost their jobs.
[3:51:37.400 --> 3:51:44.400]  Over in Europe, 50,000 workers, auto workers lost their jobs.
[3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:46.400]  These are real numbers.
[3:51:46.400 --> 3:51:48.400]  Go back to India.
[3:51:48.400 --> 3:51:49.400]  Trade war?
[3:51:49.400 --> 3:51:51.400]  Nothing to do with a trade war.
[3:51:51.400 --> 3:51:57.400]  The phony economies that they juiced up are slowing down.
[3:51:57.400 --> 3:51:59.400]  There's a global economic slowdown.
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:07.400]  Hey, south of the border, down Mexico way, recession.
[3:52:07.400 --> 3:52:11.400]  Nothing to do with a trade war.
[3:52:11.400 --> 3:52:17.400]  Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Brazil.
[3:52:17.400 --> 3:52:22.400]  Yeah, Brazil's popping up a little bit.
[3:52:22.400 --> 3:52:25.400]  It's one country after another.
[3:52:25.400 --> 3:52:29.400]  There's a global economic slowdown.
[3:52:29.400 --> 3:52:32.400]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:52:32.400 --> 3:52:34.400]  I mentioned about India.
[3:52:34.400 --> 3:52:35.400]  What's going on?
[3:52:35.400 --> 3:52:38.400]  Remember they annexed, they took away the autonomy,
[3:52:38.400 --> 3:52:41.400]  the semi-autonomous place of Kashmir,
[3:52:41.400 --> 3:52:44.400]  and the Pakistanis are fighting for that as well,
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:46.400]  because they say they own half of it,
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:51.400]  or whatever they want to make up, any of them.
[3:52:51.400 --> 3:52:58.400]  So as economies go down, war talk is going to heat up.
[3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:03.400]  I was just with a woman at a wonderful Latin jazz festival
[3:53:03.400 --> 3:53:08.400]  and a son put on. She's 89 years old.
[3:53:08.400 --> 3:53:11.400]  And she moved to her and her husband from New York.
[3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:16.400]  They moved to England right after World War II.
[3:53:16.400 --> 3:53:18.400]  And she told me how bombed out the place
[3:53:18.400 --> 3:53:21.400]  was and how poor the people were.
[3:53:21.400 --> 3:53:23.400]  That's not ancient history.
[3:53:23.400 --> 3:53:27.400]  We're talking 1946, 47.
[3:53:27.400 --> 3:53:31.400]  I'm born in 46.
[3:53:31.400 --> 3:53:35.400]  And then I was with somebody the other night from Holland
[3:53:35.400 --> 3:53:37.400]  and telling me what her grandparents were telling her
[3:53:37.400 --> 3:53:40.400]  when the Nazis invaded and occupied it.
[3:53:40.400 --> 3:53:43.400]  Think about it.
[3:53:43.400 --> 3:53:47.400]  The most advanced civilizations at the time,
[3:53:47.400 --> 3:53:56.400]  Germany, France, England, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
[3:53:56.400 --> 3:54:00.400]  these aren't backwarded places.
[3:54:00.400 --> 3:54:05.400]  They were bombed, occupied in war.
[3:54:05.400 --> 3:54:08.400]  That's not ancient history.
[3:54:08.400 --> 3:54:11.400]  If we don't stop what's going on now,
[3:54:11.400 --> 3:54:15.400]  this will be the beginning of the Third World War.
[3:54:15.400 --> 3:54:19.400]  They asked Eisen Einstein,
[3:54:19.400 --> 3:54:23.400]  how will the Third World War be fought?
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:25.400]  He said, I don't know.
[3:54:25.400 --> 3:54:26.400]  He said, but the Fourth World War
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:29.400]  will be fought with sticks and stones.
[3:54:29.400 --> 3:54:33.400]  In 2000, I was asked to be the keynote speaker
[3:54:33.400 --> 3:54:36.400]  at Virginia Military Institute
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:40.400]  to talk about new millennium warfare to the generals.
[3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:43.400]  Matter of fact, that General Anthony Zinni,
[3:54:43.400 --> 3:54:47.400]  we stayed in contact.
[3:54:47.400 --> 3:54:50.400]  Anthony Zinni was the general
[3:54:50.400 --> 3:54:58.400]  that was the number two guy running the First Gulf War.
[3:54:58.400 --> 3:55:01.400]  He asked to talk about new millennium warfare.
[3:55:01.400 --> 3:55:05.400]  Generals are always fighting the last war.
[3:55:05.400 --> 3:55:07.400]  And that's what America is fighting now
[3:55:07.400 --> 3:55:11.400]  with these aircraft carriers and his F-35s,
[3:55:11.400 --> 3:55:12.400]  wasting our money.
[3:55:12.400 --> 3:55:16.400]  FU know what, 35s?
[3:55:16.400 --> 3:55:24.400]  Hypersonic weapons, cyber wars, chemical warfare.
[3:55:24.400 --> 3:55:29.400]  Imagine 10,000s or thousands of drones flying over
[3:55:29.400 --> 3:55:32.400]  with weapons of mass destruction.
[3:55:32.400 --> 3:55:37.400]  You're not going to blow these things out of the air.
[3:55:37.400 --> 3:55:48.400]  Remember, sophisticated societies were destroyed 75 years ago.
[3:55:48.400 --> 3:55:52.400]  The most sophisticated societies on the planet.
[3:55:52.400 --> 3:55:54.400]  It was an ancient history.
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:55:58.400]  So we have to stop this march to war
[3:55:58.400 --> 3:56:02.400]  and have parades for peace.
[3:56:02.400 --> 3:56:04.400]  Because if we don't, this thing is going down.
[3:56:04.400 --> 3:56:06.400]  I'm giving you the economic numbers
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:10.400]  and showing you what's going on all around the country.
[3:56:10.400 --> 3:56:12.400]  Excuse me, all around the world.
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:15.400]  Because it's going down big.
[3:56:15.400 --> 3:56:18.400]  Gerald, I totally agree with you and you're out of time today,
[3:56:18.400 --> 3:56:20.400]  but you've been gracious enough with your big report
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:23.400]  that everybody always waits on to join me tomorrow
[3:56:23.400 --> 3:56:25.400]  at noon central, 1 p.m. Eastern.
[3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:29.400]  So thank you so much for hosting the last 40 minutes or so.
[3:56:29.400 --> 3:56:32.400]  And I really look forward to you being on in the second hour
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:34.400]  tomorrow, trendsresearch.com.
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:35.400]  Thank you, Gerald.
[3:56:35.400 --> 3:56:36.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:38.400]  All right, there goes Gerald Salente.
[3:56:38.400 --> 3:56:40.400]  He's on with me at the start of the second hour tomorrow.
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:42.400]  I'll have open phones in the first hour tomorrow
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:44.400]  and other guests after Salente leaves us.
[3:56:44.400 --> 3:56:47.400]  But I'm about to go host a employer show
[3:56:47.400 --> 3:56:49.400]  after what he just did in Congress today
[3:56:49.400 --> 3:56:52.400]  with Savannah Hernandez in, like, two minutes.
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:56:54.400]  I'm going to walk over to the other studio.
[3:56:54.400 --> 3:56:56.400]  The War Room, infowars.com.
[3:56:56.400 --> 3:56:58.400]  It's my show and band.video.
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:00.400]  We're going to get the IG report,
[3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:03.400]  Barr's response, Durham's response, and so much more.
[3:57:03.400 --> 3:57:05.400]  And Durham is actually bucking it.
[3:57:05.400 --> 3:57:07.400]  So hopefully this is for real.
[3:57:07.400 --> 3:57:08.400]  We'll see.
[3:57:08.400 --> 3:57:09.400]  I'm not going to hold my breath.
[3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:11.400]  Stay with us, War Room, coming up.
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:14.400]  My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:16.400]  Dozens and dozens of people have called me.
[3:57:16.400 --> 3:57:19.400]  I've gotten all these text messages.
[3:57:19.400 --> 3:57:21.400]  The office phones ringing off the hook.
[3:57:21.400 --> 3:57:22.400]  Emails are flooding in.
[3:57:22.400 --> 3:57:24.400]  And they're saying, can you believe it?
[3:57:24.400 --> 3:57:27.400]  300 Trump ads that were going to run
[3:57:27.400 --> 3:57:31.400]  tens of millions of times were pulled by Google.
[3:57:31.400 --> 3:57:33.400]  And then it turns out it was done over the summer.
[3:57:33.400 --> 3:57:35.400]  Folks, I live this every day.
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:38.400]  I read the news like nobody else probably.
[3:57:38.400 --> 3:57:40.400]  And they have been hitting hundreds
[3:57:40.400 --> 3:57:42.400]  of congressional candidates and members of Congress.
[3:57:42.400 --> 3:57:44.400]  They've been going after governors, state reps.
[3:57:44.400 --> 3:57:46.400]  It's been a rain of terror.
[3:57:46.400 --> 3:57:48.400]  Last week, they wouldn't let Melania Trump
[3:57:48.400 --> 3:57:51.400]  images be sent out saying it was hate speech.
[3:57:51.400 --> 3:57:54.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond censorship.
[3:57:54.400 --> 3:57:56.400]  It's total information control.
[3:57:56.400 --> 3:57:58.400]  It has to all go through a filter.
[3:57:58.400 --> 3:58:00.400]  And that's what AI allows, is what I call
[3:58:00.400 --> 3:58:02.400]  information singularity.
[3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:05.400]  Not empowering information, but holding it all in
[3:58:05.400 --> 3:58:07.400]  like the one ring of Mordor.
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:14.400]  Trump must act now or they will steal this election.
[3:58:14.400 --> 3:58:17.400]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[3:58:17.400 --> 3:58:20.400]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill
[3:58:20.400 --> 3:58:21.400]  many years ago.
[3:58:21.400 --> 3:58:23.400]  And I've found a few places where it's mentioned.
[3:58:23.400 --> 3:58:25.400]  But if you can find it, please send it
[3:58:25.400 --> 3:58:26.400]  to showtipstemforewords.com.
[3:58:26.400 --> 3:58:28.400]  And he talked about in the darkest hours
[3:58:28.400 --> 3:58:30.400]  at the beginning of World War II,
[3:58:30.400 --> 3:58:32.400]  the fact that there have been times in history
[3:58:32.400 --> 3:58:34.400]  where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on
[3:58:34.400 --> 3:58:35.400]  and were assured of victory.
[3:58:35.400 --> 3:58:38.400]  There was a second point in history where folks have to fight
[3:58:38.400 --> 3:58:41.400]  even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[3:58:41.400 --> 3:58:44.400]  There's a third time when you know you're going to lose
[3:58:44.400 --> 3:58:47.400]  but you have to fight because being enslaved
[3:58:47.400 --> 3:58:49.400]  and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[3:58:49.400 --> 3:58:50.400]  That's a paraphrase.
[3:58:50.400 --> 3:58:53.400]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now
[3:58:53.400 --> 3:58:56.400]  of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit,
[3:58:56.400 --> 3:58:58.400]  find our focus and don't give up and take action.
[3:58:58.400 --> 3:59:00.400]  But if we don't stand up and get involved,
[3:59:00.400 --> 3:59:04.400]  we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[3:59:04.400 --> 3:59:05.400]  That's a fact.
[3:59:05.400 --> 3:59:08.400]  They fear info wars because we are alive.
[3:59:08.400 --> 3:59:37.400]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
