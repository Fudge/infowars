[00:29.760 --> 00:32.120]  despised America's apparent diversity.
[00:32.120 --> 00:36.240]  We're actually hunkering down in communities of like-mindedness.
[00:36.240 --> 00:40.840]  At the conference, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, who supported Senator Barack Obama, says it
[00:40.840 --> 00:45.400]  was difficult choosing between the two candidates and then making an endorsement in the Democratic
[00:45.400 --> 00:46.400]  Party.
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.040]  Everybody who declared feeling some sense of loyalty to at least one of the other candidates
[00:51.040 --> 00:52.040]  may be more.
[00:52.040 --> 00:55.440]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.

[00:59.440 --> 01:03.320]  just to buy gas, you might want to consider starting a home business.
[01:03.320 --> 01:05.440]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.040]  This is Andy Willoughby with the Three Step Plan Home Business System.
[01:10.040 --> 01:13.480]  If you build a home business with a three step plan, you would walk to work every day.
[01:13.480 --> 01:17.800]  It would only take about 10 seconds, you wouldn't have to deal with any traffic, and it wouldn't
[01:17.800 --> 01:18.800]  use any gas.
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.000]  Of course, some three step plan members keep their jobs and start a home business part time.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.280]  That's one of the great things about the three step plan, you get to make the choices.

[02:05.680 --> 02:08.120]  shut down by the massive blaze.
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.520]  Rain in the forecast may bring more help against the wildfires, but it could create fresh worries
[02:13.520 --> 02:19.120]  about landslides, especially in fire-scarred parts of the state.
[02:19.120 --> 02:22.480]  Forecasters say Bertha has weakened to a tropical storm.
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.320]  Bertha has been hovering over the Atlantic with little movement.

[03:30.800 --> 03:31.800]  Here's Mark Levy.
[03:31.800 --> 03:35.800]  The exchange will take place Wednesday, according to the Israeli government, two years after
[03:35.800 --> 03:38.840]  Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody one-month war.
[03:38.840 --> 03:40.600]  Israel gets back two soldiers.
[03:40.600 --> 03:41.800]  Israel believes they're dead.

[04:06.320 --> 04:07.320]  Here's Connie Lawn.
[04:07.320 --> 04:12.160]  President Bush said Tony was one of our nation's finest writers and commentators.
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.740]  He earned a loyal following within cites of radio and television broadcasts.
[04:16.740 --> 04:21.520]  He was a gifted speechwriter who served in my father's administration, and I was thrilled
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.120]  when he agreed to return to the White House to serve as my press secretary.
[04:26.120 --> 04:30.120]  The president said it was a joy to watch Tony at the podium every day.
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.480]  He brought wit, grace, and a great love of country to his work.
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.160]  President Bush also said one of the things that sustained Tony Snow was his faith, and
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.880]  Laura and I joined people across our country in praying that this good man has now found
[04:43.880 --> 04:46.520]  comfort in the arms of his creator.

[04:55.640 --> 05:00.640]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[05:00.640 --> 05:02.320]  a third-world nation.

[05:13.680 --> 05:14.680]  planet.
[05:14.680 --> 05:19.160]  Organ electro-medicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.

[06:26.160 --> 06:31.960]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[06:31.960 --> 06:40.320]  All right, my friends, it is Sunday the 13th of July, 2008, we're gonna be live here for
[06:40.320 --> 06:42.320]  the next two hours.
[06:42.320 --> 06:48.040]  This is Bob Chapman, who has in the past been the biggest gold and silver broker in the
[06:48.040 --> 06:49.040]  world.
[06:49.040 --> 06:53.760]  He's also had the largest precious metals and financial newsletter in the world.
[06:53.760 --> 06:58.040]  He retired, came back and again has one of the biggest in the world.
[06:58.040 --> 07:05.360]  He of course is also in army intelligence before that, he covered operations, he of
[07:05.360 --> 07:11.600]  course has been predicting a financial complete meltdown and a depression, a hyperinflationary
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.760]  depression in this country, along with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of ergonomics
[07:16.760 --> 07:21.920]  on my show, Joseph Stick, let's know about prize winner, former head of the World Bank,
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.440]  and of course the head of the New York Business School.
[07:25.440 --> 07:32.320]  These are the type of people, former White House analyst, Richard Cook, by the way let's
[07:32.320 --> 07:37.040]  get Cook back on this week, coming up on the weekday show and they've all been saying the
[07:37.040 --> 07:42.440]  same thing, it's all by design to once and for all destroy the liberty and freedom in
[07:42.440 --> 07:45.200]  this country and make us debt channel slaves.
[07:45.200 --> 07:49.440]  Now everything we've been talking about, you've heard me for about five, six years hot and
[07:49.440 --> 07:54.520]  heavy saying they are devaluing the dollar, they are devaluing the dollar, they are devaluing
[07:54.520 --> 08:00.120]  the dollar, I mean I was freaking out when they devalued it 10% in one year.
[08:00.120 --> 08:04.840]  And now here we are with the devaluing more than 60% globally, the fellow that owns one
[08:04.840 --> 08:08.680]  of the radio networks that syndicates the weekday show, Ted Anderson, took his fiance
[08:08.680 --> 08:17.040]  down, he's got divorced and remarried, took his fiance down to Argentina, down in South
[08:17.040 --> 08:21.120]  America for a week, but I've been interviewing him while he's been down there, and they do
[08:21.120 --> 08:27.960]  not want to take dollars in Argentina folks, the dollars always been king, and now in Europe
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.200]  they don't want to take dollars, I've had family that's been over there, foolish Americans
[08:32.200 --> 08:36.160]  go over to Europe and it costs eight bucks for a beer and they think, oh the Europeans
[08:36.160 --> 08:40.920]  have really got it bad, these poor schmucks, I saw a neocom of this website saying that,
[08:40.920 --> 08:44.440]  they don't understand, the Europeans aren't paying that in their currencies, it's the
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.920]  dollars, it's like if you have pesos in the past and tried to come up here and buy things,
[08:49.920 --> 08:54.680]  and if Americans could realize that the elites were devaluing our currency by design, and
[08:54.680 --> 08:59.880]  we have the IMF World Bank documents from March of 2002 that leaked with Joseph Sticklett's
[08:59.880 --> 09:05.000]  departure from the World Bank, we could have stopped all this, that's why every show, I
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.760]  warn you, I beg you, I plead, and I even walk up to reporters I know on TV and radio and
[09:10.760 --> 09:15.080]  they just say, Alex, the dollar's not devalued, we're not going to report that, and I can
[09:15.080 --> 09:21.920]  hand them a stack of foreign, hey, Reuters, French news agency, financial times, and they
[09:21.920 --> 09:27.320]  just say, nope, that's not what's going on, there's been a problem with some mortgages,
[09:27.320 --> 09:32.280]  and that's why, and so, okay, hey, you want to let them totally destroy your financial
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.240]  future, then I'm going to get out of your way and just, have, just enjoy yourselves.
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.320]  I mean, the people of this country are willfully ignorant.
[09:42.320 --> 09:49.400]  You will hear nowhere on our media that they are devaluing the dollar, if I hear one more
[09:49.400 --> 09:57.240]  time that we are paying $4.20 something cents an average for a gallon of 87 octane unleaded,
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.400]  I'm going to scream, but I know I'm going to hear it, it's all I hear, it is not the
[10:02.400 --> 10:09.520]  speculation, it is that the dollar is imploding 70 plus percent of the cost increase, remember
[10:09.520 --> 10:16.240]  it doubled five years ago and then it quadrupled, it's quadrupled in prices in five years, they're
[10:16.240 --> 10:21.560]  talking about another doubling by next summer, okay, and if they attack Iran, you can forget
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.200]  a year from now, you're going to be paying $8 a gallon within a month of that attack
[10:26.200 --> 10:33.520]  taking place, so let's go ahead and just go over some of what's happening right now.
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.360]  Run on bank spells big trouble for U.S. Treasury, now I've got the Financial Times of London,
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.360]  I've got the City Morning Herald, I've got Reuters, I've got a French news agency all
[10:44.360 --> 10:50.560]  saying, and it's press releases from the Treasury Department, saying please don't, don't stop
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.600]  triple A rating our government bonds, folks, third world countries get triple A rating
[10:55.600 --> 11:03.480]  on their bonds, and the world is now considering completely dumping the dollar in U.S. securities,
[11:03.480 --> 11:09.120]  and then, ladies and gentlemen, it will mean road warrior death race 2000, okay, I mean
[11:09.120 --> 11:17.280]  if that happens, it will make 1929 Germany look like Valhalla, heaven compared to what
[11:17.280 --> 11:22.400]  is going to happen, now if we don't politically address what's happening, the bankers will
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.680]  rape us to the wall, they will gut you, forget shearing you, sheep just get sheared, doesn't
[11:28.680 --> 11:33.120]  hurt them in the summer, but they don't like it, you're being gutted, okay, you're not
[11:33.120 --> 11:36.840]  being sheared, you're being strung up like a pig by your hind legs, having your throat
[11:36.840 --> 11:43.080]  slit, you're being cut up for bacon, there is one publication out of hundreds, and I
[11:43.080 --> 11:47.440]  have read hundreds since this happened Friday afternoon, hundreds, I've spent three or four
[11:47.440 --> 11:53.760]  hours every day studying this, only one U.S. publication told the truth, it is the Los
[11:53.760 --> 11:58.880]  Angeles Times, as much as I hate these gun grabbing, open border loving socialists, they
[11:58.880 --> 12:03.760]  occasionally will tell the truth, and it says here, when faith is frayed, and then it just
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.000]  gets into foreign governments are considering dumping the dollar, and it says, this flare
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.320]  up in the financial forest fire that is far beyond anything we've seen before, said Christopher
[12:13.320 --> 12:17.800]  Lowe, Chief Financial Investment Firm, FTN Financial in New York, see, I mean, all the
[12:17.800 --> 12:21.280]  analysts are saying this, she's not allowed to be in our media, you can't tell the cattle
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.800]  what's going on, they might actually stampede and stop what's happening, and it is triggering
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.360]  worries that would have been unthinkable even a year ago, including the U.S. Treasury debt
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.520]  might lose its triple A credit grade, because of heavy blows to the nation's financial
[12:35.520 --> 12:44.800]  health from the housing mess, so one U.S. publication, one, one, one, will just give
[12:44.800 --> 12:50.960]  you a little window into what we face, and I don't want to hear from all the cheerleaders
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.480]  out there that, well, Alex, we've just got to say everything's fine, because if we come
[12:54.480 --> 12:59.480]  out and say it and find confidence will be lost, this is a global system, the confidence
[12:59.480 --> 13:05.200]  has been lost, bozos, we have to have the government raise interest rates now, we have
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.280]  to say strong dollar policy now, we have to start tariffs now, and of course they will
[13:10.280 --> 13:16.080]  then try to blame that like they did with the smooth haulings thing, as we were already
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.860]  going in, it took six months in 29 for the real depression to kick off, and the stock
[13:20.860 --> 13:25.360]  market went up and down like it is now, and there was a liquidity crisis, and then they
[13:25.360 --> 13:28.600]  put up the tariffs too late and then tried to blame it on that, and it had nothing to
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.880]  do with it, so actually I don't want having tariffs when we go into depression being blamed,
[13:33.880 --> 13:40.560]  so let's not do that so the yuppies can't say tariffs did it, again, people will invest
[13:40.560 --> 13:44.040]  here if they know we're not going to be financially stripped mind, and we're going to build the
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.160]  industry and have a future and not just have a fiat currency, that's all the country has
[13:48.160 --> 13:55.880]  left is a fiat currency, that's all we had left financially, and let me tell you something
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.440]  folks, the government is going to tax you at 80 something percent, they're already saying
[13:59.440 --> 14:04.560]  it, the OECD saying it, it doesn't matter what party comes in, you're not going to like
[14:04.560 --> 14:09.000]  what's about to happen, you better politically tell them now we're not going to pay back
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.960]  these debts, because these debts are owed to central banks that are private that created
[14:14.960 --> 14:21.520]  these currencies and liquidity out of nothing, it is a monumental fraud, and they literally
[14:21.520 --> 14:26.360]  on the globalist on our credit and our name bought the infrastructure of the world, they're
[14:26.360 --> 14:32.280]  all in secure assets and commodities, okay, and everybody else is headed to the door,
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.520]  there's tens of trillions in U.S. notes, greenbacks and securities out there, they're all dumping
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.080]  them as fast as they can into commodities, and that's the 25 percent increase you've
[14:42.080 --> 14:48.040]  seen in oil, that's the doubling you've seen in gold, that's all of that, that's why corn
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.200]  and grain, I mean there's other factors that feed in, but the main reason that you're seeing
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.640]  commodities explode in price is that people are looking for safe havens to dump their
[14:58.640 --> 15:04.000]  dollars, and the big money even writes about this, I saw this a year ago, the Financial
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.640]  Times of London, when the country wide stuff in the Northern Rock and all this was just
[15:07.640 --> 15:13.480]  starting about actually about 10 months ago, and they said we just better hope that institutional
[15:13.480 --> 15:19.000]  money and the wealthy, that means billionaires, can position our money where it isn't lost
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.520]  because this implosion is so big, it threatens to even bankrupt the elite, they so greedily
[15:26.520 --> 15:32.840]  raped us to the wall because we are mindless chump smucks in this country, that their greed
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.800]  has created an implosion black hole financially that threatens to even suck their greedy bucks

[17:11.640 --> 17:16.320]  numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the man and bringing
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.200]  them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over, they are
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.680]  called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the new world order, they oppose everything that
[17:26.680 --> 17:32.120]  is God and truth, they are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything
[17:32.120 --> 17:36.080]  they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.840]  established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[17:40.840 --> 17:45.880]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us, visit our website
[17:45.880 --> 17:55.640]  at unveilingthem.com, that's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com, the message of his kingdom.

[18:00.320 --> 18:04.520]  fast, would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely, if so when you

[18:08.960 --> 18:12.960]  why, a new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.600]  90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever, the insider secrets revealed allow
[18:17.600 --> 18:21.760]  you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're
[18:21.760 --> 18:27.080]  cheating, but they're not, the secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical,
[18:27.080 --> 18:30.160]  it's just that bankers, debt collectors and credit card companies don't want you to know
[18:30.160 --> 18:34.360]  about these loopholes, learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.400]  by beating them at their own game and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing,
[18:39.400 --> 18:47.360]  get control, get relief, get some sleep, go to www.outin90.com, that's www.outin90.com
[18:47.360 --> 18:55.720]  or call 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365.
[18:55.720 --> 19:00.320]  It's a fact, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United
[19:00.320 --> 19:04.640]  States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.040]  late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically
[19:09.040 --> 19:13.240]  impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.600]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally
[19:17.600 --> 19:21.800]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts
[19:21.800 --> 19:24.080]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[19:24.080 --> 19:28.240]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment
[19:28.240 --> 19:30.280]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.200]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[19:34.200 --> 19:35.560]  eliminated their debt.
[19:35.560 --> 19:39.480]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[19:39.480 --> 19:40.480]  around.
[19:40.480 --> 19:49.480]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600, that's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.

[19:51.960 --> 20:18.360]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[20:18.360 --> 20:23.160]  Israeli airplanes have been confirmed by the Israeli Air Force to be stationed and
[20:23.160 --> 20:28.200]  massing in Iraq for strikes on Iran.
[20:28.200 --> 20:35.720]  OPEC says that oil will go to unlimited prices, conservatively $500 a barrel, if there is
[20:35.720 --> 20:39.520]  a tax, that means you'll be paying close to $20 a gallon.
[20:39.520 --> 20:44.520]  According to them, the economy, which is completely based on petrochemicals, will completely
[20:44.520 --> 20:50.440]  implode, but they've got their New World Order shock troops, FEMA camps built, the real
[20:50.440 --> 20:54.600]  target of all of this is the United States.
[20:54.600 --> 20:59.200]  The New World Order wants to launch an attack on defenseless Iran so they can then claim Iran
[20:59.200 --> 21:04.400]  is launching terror attacks inside the U.S., which will actually be launched by the Pentagon.
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.040]  The true target is the American people and setting up a police state.
[21:08.040 --> 21:12.840]  Congress and the Homeland Security Committee in the House have discovered the martial law
[21:12.840 --> 21:16.920]  plans for six months, I've interviewed multiple members of Congress, we have articles up
[21:16.920 --> 21:22.840]  there today where they're now trying to subpoena the White House about the martial law plans.
[21:22.840 --> 21:27.720]  Carl Rove also was subpoenaed by Congress and fled the country and is now under indictment.
[21:27.720 --> 21:32.080]  You will never hear that on your national news though, but if you Google it, it's all
[21:32.080 --> 21:37.080]  over the foreign press and there's videos on YouTube of Congress and the indictments.
[21:37.080 --> 21:41.800]  Of course, that doesn't really matter because Barack Obama and John McCain are totally owned
[21:41.800 --> 21:45.320]  by the New World Order as well.
[21:45.320 --> 21:52.520]  Run on Bank spells big trouble for U.S. largest bank run since the Great Depression in the
[21:52.520 --> 21:56.920]  early 1930s here in the United States, kicking off in 1929.
[21:56.920 --> 22:02.440]  That is the mainstream headlines, U.S. Bank, Indie Mac seized amid intensifying crisis.
[22:02.440 --> 22:08.120]  75% of the value has been lost the last six months, 50% of that loss was just Friday of
[22:08.120 --> 22:14.960]  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, total money laundering scams themselves, oil now above 150 a barrel
[22:14.960 --> 22:20.640]  in weekend trading, gold exploding, the rest of the hour were joined by former Army intelligence.
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.120]  He of course lived all over the world from France to South Africa, the largest gold and
[22:24.120 --> 22:26.360]  silver broker in the world at one time.
[22:26.360 --> 22:32.560]  He owned all the big newsletters including the other just so many of them, but the Gary
[22:32.560 --> 22:38.040]  Allen report and so many others and he's Bob Chapman been forecasting all this, his websites,
[22:38.040 --> 22:39.040]  internationalforecaster.com.
[22:39.040 --> 22:45.120]  Bob, you've been forecasting total depression along with Joseph Stickles and others, a hyper
[22:45.120 --> 22:47.360]  and flushing depression within two and a half years.
[22:47.360 --> 22:51.480]  Are you revising that or are things accelerating and deteriorating faster?
[22:51.480 --> 22:56.720]  You said we could, I mean it could blow a gasket any day, but you said sure thing within
[22:56.720 --> 22:57.720]  three years.
[22:57.720 --> 22:58.720]  What do you say now?
[22:58.720 --> 23:07.400]  I think it's about the same and the reason I say that is that these are deflecting events
[23:07.400 --> 23:09.240]  that are happening.
[23:09.240 --> 23:15.360]  We're talking about the massing of Israeli jets in Iraq for an attack.
[23:15.360 --> 23:19.880]  They want an attack on a friend number of reasons, but one of them is the same kind
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.000]  of reason that they invaded Iraq and Afghanistan.
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  The first place is to get everybody thinking about what's going on over there and not what's
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.960]  going on over here.
[23:28.960 --> 23:35.480]  And of course as you said, in order to control the American people and to enslave them.
[23:35.480 --> 23:37.280]  And that's what really this is all about.
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.760]  And you are right about that.
[23:39.760 --> 23:46.040]  And this whole economic event has been planned ahead of time.
[23:46.040 --> 23:51.840]  The taking down of the U.S. economy and its finances and the world economy for that matter
[23:51.840 --> 23:56.120]  is all part of a larger plan to bring about world government.
[23:56.120 --> 24:02.120]  And so what we're seeing here is a continuum.
[24:02.120 --> 24:08.960]  And the continuum for them has turned into them being the Illuminati, the Alitas, whatever
[24:08.960 --> 24:13.000]  you want to call them, has turned into a route for them.
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.960]  They are in serious trouble because as you said earlier in your initial dissertation
[24:19.960 --> 24:27.680]  that the economic and financial collapse that we're facing could very well bring them down
[24:27.680 --> 24:30.760]  as well, the richest and the most powerful.
[24:30.760 --> 24:32.680]  And I think you're right about that.
[24:32.680 --> 24:38.840]  And I think they're absolutely terrified because once that happens, these indictments
[24:38.840 --> 24:48.320]  and subpoenas and grand juries and the bringing forth of trials for these people are going
[24:48.320 --> 24:50.960]  to denude them of their wealth and power.
[24:50.960 --> 24:52.800]  And I think that's the way it's headed.
[24:52.800 --> 24:57.280]  And quite frankly, even though it's going to be a dreadful thing to contemplate and
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.760]  to face individually and as groups throughout the world in different countries, it's a
[25:02.760 --> 25:08.240]  good thing that the whole thing's coming down because finally it can be exposed and
[25:08.240 --> 25:11.640]  we can show the people what they haven't been listening to.
[25:11.640 --> 25:15.040]  And maybe it won't happen again for a long time.
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.200]  And we'll dig our way out of it and it's just going to be very difficult.
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.720]  Now the Los Angeles Times is the only U.S. publication, of course, as you know, all
[25:24.720 --> 25:29.880]  the foreign are admitting the truth, that foreign governments and others are considering,
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.600]  including the IMF and World Bank, no longer giving our Treasury bonds a triple A rating.
[25:34.600 --> 25:40.480]  A, do you think that's going to happen and B, what will that precipitate?
[25:40.480 --> 25:47.000]  Well, first of all, the chances of it happening are not great.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.600]  These ghouls are in this thing together.
[25:49.600 --> 25:56.320]  Now the only thing that could cause that would be a real hard and fast split between the
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.200]  European and the U.S. interests behind the scenes.
[26:00.200 --> 26:01.200]  And that could develop.
[26:01.200 --> 26:07.960]  They're very, very disturbed with getting bagged with 40% of the losses that occurred
[26:07.960 --> 26:13.920]  in subprime and also loans and other loans as well in the real estate region, we'll call
[26:13.920 --> 26:14.920]  it.
[26:14.920 --> 26:20.160]  And so maybe they are going to split, they've shown some signs of that.
[26:20.160 --> 26:26.480]  And the BIS letter that was put out last week alluded to that.
[26:26.480 --> 26:30.320]  And that's probably, in fact, what you're talking about or reflecting on.
[26:30.320 --> 26:31.320]  Yes, yes.
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.440]  The Bank of International Settlements, but remember Bob, for the layman out there, they
[26:34.440 --> 26:40.360]  listen to these fake financial reporters who just feed them an entire line of bull, a false
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.320]  paradigm of disinfo in layman's terms.
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.000]  And two minutes before we go to break, boil down what we see happening, what's being
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  engineered here.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.760]  And I want to come back and talk about if you or Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or somebody
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.520]  else was in the catbird seat, what you would do to try to avert this, if it could be averted
[26:56.520 --> 26:58.520]  from the inflationary depression.
[26:58.520 --> 27:01.320]  Well, first of all, it can't be averted.
[27:01.320 --> 27:04.560]  There's just no way that can happen.
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.760]  It's now the degree of the pain.
[27:07.760 --> 27:10.280]  And what is the solution is pretty simple.
[27:10.280 --> 27:11.640]  You purge the system.
[27:11.640 --> 27:16.560]  You raise interest rates and you stop creating enormous amounts of money and credit.
[27:16.560 --> 27:23.320]  And banks and insurance companies and corporations and individuals are going to fail.
[27:23.320 --> 27:25.120]  And you're going to have unemployment at 35 percent.
[27:25.120 --> 27:27.680]  Well, you're going to get it there anyway.
[27:27.680 --> 27:29.960]  So there's no way out of this thing.
[27:29.960 --> 27:32.440]  This is classical economics.
[27:32.440 --> 27:35.920]  And that is the solution, purging.
[27:35.920 --> 27:38.080]  And we all got to go through it whether we like it or not.
[27:38.080 --> 27:41.440]  And if we don't purge, I mean, explain to people if we don't purge and all the top
[27:41.440 --> 27:42.440]  experts agree about it.
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.040]  We'll just never hear them on U.S. media.
[27:44.040 --> 27:47.040]  If we don't purge, it's 10 times worse, isn't it?
[27:47.040 --> 27:48.040]  Absolutely.
[27:48.040 --> 27:51.960]  Because you see Japan in 1992, they didn't purge.
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.720]  They went on and on and on and had a depression up until now.
[27:56.720 --> 28:04.320]  I mean, the stocks fell 70 percent, a land fell 80 percent, homes fell 75 percent.
[28:04.320 --> 28:06.040]  And they still haven't recovered.
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.720]  They did wipe out a $1.2 trillion debt that down to a couple of hundred billion.
[28:10.720 --> 28:13.440]  But still, they didn't take the medicine.
[28:13.440 --> 28:14.440]  Why?
[28:14.440 --> 28:16.280]  Because the Fed told them not to.
[28:16.280 --> 28:17.680]  So we've got to reboot now.
[28:17.680 --> 28:19.200]  We've got to reboot the system.
[28:19.200 --> 28:22.960]  We'll come back, talk about what you would do, Bob Chapman, the internationalforecaster.com.

[28:39.040 --> 28:41.040]  We'll be right back after this quick news.
[29:09.040 --> 29:13.880]  But because of the polluted world in which we live is unable to remove all toxins.

[32:54.760 --> 33:12.800]  You're listening to GCA, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[33:12.800 --> 33:15.560]  We have a criminal government.
[33:15.560 --> 33:19.840]  It's run by cocaine and heroin dealers, literally.
[33:19.840 --> 33:25.960]  They laundered the money to the banks, they made the decision, arrogantly, to issue unlimited
[33:25.960 --> 33:31.600]  liquidity to themselves and everybody else, and to buy up all the infrastructure.
[33:31.600 --> 33:34.040]  They've leveraged the world thousands of times.
[33:34.040 --> 33:38.960]  That is, there's thousands of times of fiat money compared to real assets.
[33:38.960 --> 33:43.360]  They wrote IMF World Bank documents, White House memos, about how they had set up a police
[33:43.360 --> 33:47.320]  state, this happened decades ago, so that when the people found out, we couldn't punish
[33:47.320 --> 33:51.280]  them for their criminal actions, because we are going to be left holding the financial
[33:51.280 --> 33:52.680]  bag.
[33:52.680 --> 33:58.120]  The OECD and others, the big global management groups, are saying that we are going to have
[33:58.120 --> 34:04.160]  to pay 87% taxes just to pay off the debt on this so they can then own all the real
[34:04.160 --> 34:05.160]  assets.
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.080]  But as Bob Chapman was saying, top expert on the stock market, the commodities, you name
[34:09.080 --> 34:12.400]  it, the internationalforecaster.com, I went through his bio, it would take hours, we can
[34:12.400 --> 34:16.400]  go read it if you want, and we're honored to have guests of his caliber, and people
[34:16.400 --> 34:20.400]  like the father of ergonomics, former head of the treasury, Paul Kirk Roberts, and others,
[34:20.400 --> 34:21.680]  they're all saying the same thing.
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.720]  We are cooked, unless we raise interest rates and do some other things.
[34:26.720 --> 34:31.800]  What could lessen the crash landing, Bob Chapman, and I want to go back into what we're seeing
[34:31.800 --> 34:33.760]  happen right now.
[34:33.760 --> 34:41.760]  Well, I think probably a slow upward movement in interest rates, and that wouldn't have
[34:41.760 --> 34:44.880]  to come from the Federal Reserve.
[34:44.880 --> 34:49.280]  It could come by the market itself, and it really is underway.
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.280]  It's already started.
[34:50.280 --> 34:52.160]  Well, that's what Europe's doing, right?
[34:52.160 --> 34:59.000]  Right, and I think that you're going to see more of this in the real marketplace, and
[34:59.000 --> 35:05.560]  sooner or later, the Fed will have to raise rates, but it's not going to be any time soon.
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.480]  They sent out that false signal a couple of months ago in order to keep the stock market
[35:11.480 --> 35:12.480]  up.
[35:12.480 --> 35:23.840]  But I kind of think that except for expeditionary moves into the market, I think they've come
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.680]  to terms with the fact that the stock market's going down, and they can't do an awful lot
[35:28.680 --> 35:29.680]  to stop it.
[35:29.680 --> 35:36.120]  And I think they're at the same crossroads with gold and silver, and so this is all part
[35:36.120 --> 35:38.200]  of a crumbling process.
[35:38.200 --> 35:39.880]  This whole thing is coming unglued.
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.960]  And just like Fortis, the banking group in Europe said, you know, the 6,000 banks, you
[35:44.960 --> 35:46.720]  know, how many are going under?
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.840]  And I had projected 300 in the next couple of years, but maybe it's super conservative.
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.360]  I mean, we won't know until we get there, but it's not going to be good.
[35:56.360 --> 35:59.720]  And of course, we just had Indy Mako down.
[35:59.720 --> 36:02.120]  It should have gone down eight months ago.
[36:02.120 --> 36:09.520]  They were keeping alive on whole blood or something, and so that's gone now.
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.880]  And hopefully, people didn't have more than $100,000 earlier accounts, because otherwise
[36:13.880 --> 36:15.600]  they'd be stuck.
[36:15.600 --> 36:26.800]  But we are just continuing to evolve in a system that is continuing to be floated by
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.480]  the amount of money and credit that the Fed can feed into the system to offset the deflation
[36:32.480 --> 36:34.800]  of the falling value of real asset.
[36:34.800 --> 36:40.120]  Okay, let's walk through that because, remember, Bob, to us, this is just like breathing, but
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.360]  to the general public, they're never allowed to hear this.
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.560]  We have people listening all over the place in Kansas City and San Diego and Austin, Texas
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.880]  and Niagara Falls and Tampa, Florida and all over the place, and they're saying, what is
[36:53.880 --> 36:54.880]  devaluing assets?
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.120]  I mean, they literally, all they've been told is lies and disinformation, as you know,
[36:59.120 --> 37:07.640]  and false economic models by design to where they can't recognize what we're saying.
[37:07.640 --> 37:10.760]  For those that don't know, the only thing that would save the dollar would be raising
[37:10.760 --> 37:16.840]  interest rates, and the dollar has dropped again, oil has risen with that.
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.680]  Can you speak to what that means and what more failing banks and more Federal Reserve
[37:22.680 --> 37:23.680]  bailouts mean?
[37:23.680 --> 37:28.120]  That is, private banks get bailed out with our tax money.
[37:28.120 --> 37:33.600]  And the workers' business and the investment business and the insurance business and eventually
[37:33.600 --> 37:37.760]  the corporate business, because that's what happens in a corporate-as-fascist state, and
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.440]  that's what we've got.
[37:39.440 --> 37:45.120]  But the Fed's in a box if they raise interest rates, the economy collapses, so they really
[37:45.120 --> 37:46.400]  can't do anything.
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.520]  Now, that's why I said it'll be a couple of years before they're going to raise interest
[37:51.520 --> 37:52.520]  rates.
[37:52.520 --> 37:57.000]  Everybody else will, and the real market for interest rates will rise, but their official
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.280]  position won't.
[37:58.280 --> 37:59.680]  Why are they buying time?
[37:59.680 --> 38:00.680]  I mean, why?
[38:00.680 --> 38:04.880]  Because they don't want to be caught at what they're doing.
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.280]  They want to pass it on to Barack Obama.
[38:09.280 --> 38:11.560]  They want to pass it on to other administrations.
[38:11.560 --> 38:20.480]  Well, that's true in part, and George W. Bush gets out with his proverbial skin, but his
[38:20.480 --> 38:24.640]  rating now, I don't know that it's going to make much difference.
[38:24.640 --> 38:34.960]  I think it's lower now than Richard Nixon's was after he resigned, but the problem is
[38:34.960 --> 38:41.760]  one that they're trying to extend, and in that extension, they're making the problem
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.360]  worse, but they don't know what to do because they're caught.
[38:46.360 --> 38:50.800]  Now, you referred to how this is happening.
[38:50.800 --> 38:58.120]  The diminuation of assets, we have homes, commercial real estate, businesses falling
[38:58.120 --> 39:00.320]  in value.
[39:00.320 --> 39:10.440]  We have mortgages and other such lent instruments, such as credit cards and so on and so forth.
[39:10.440 --> 39:12.720]  The failure rate continues to rise.
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.520]  Those are all loss of assets.
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.320]  And we're having diminishing assets while the dollar is devalued and inflation, what
[39:19.320 --> 39:22.320]  is running about 14% a year?
[39:22.320 --> 39:27.240]  My figure is a 12.875 right now, just under 13.
[39:27.240 --> 39:33.520]  I expect 15 by the end of the year, and I think that the M3, which is the issuance of
[39:33.520 --> 39:39.440]  money and credit in one way or another by the Fed, I think that it's around 17% right
[39:39.440 --> 39:40.440]  now.
[39:40.440 --> 39:47.720]  It fluctuates every couple of weeks, and I see that over 20% next year, maybe as high
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.640]  as 25 or 30 to keep the engine going.
[39:51.640 --> 39:52.640]  Let's be clear.
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.480]  They're going to devalue the dollar outside the country by 25 or 30% while 15%, but that's
[39:57.480 --> 40:03.040]  compounded annually, so we've already lost half the dollar's value at conservative 10%
[40:03.040 --> 40:05.840]  loss per year in the last five.
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.280]  Well I think ultimately we'll lose 50% of the value from here.
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.840]  And that's because the issuance of money and credit will grow that great before the
[40:14.840 --> 40:15.840]  system collapses.
[40:15.840 --> 40:17.840]  I'm putting this in layman's terms.
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.600]  If they raise interest rates, put in tariffs, as Dr. Roberts has called for, honestly, if
[40:22.600 --> 40:23.600]  you agree with that.
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.600]  I sure do.
[40:24.600 --> 40:25.600]  Okay.
[40:25.600 --> 40:30.480]  I didn't know anybody else had the guts to get out front on that.
[40:30.480 --> 40:36.120]  I've been the only one for the last five or six years, and I'm happy to hear he is because
[40:36.120 --> 40:38.520]  tariffs made America great.
[40:38.520 --> 40:45.400]  We went through a very difficult time after the Declaration of Independence in trade because
[40:45.400 --> 40:48.920]  we had a free and open merc until this economy.
[40:48.920 --> 40:53.320]  And what happened was that it was a disaster because the Chinese were making things cheaper
[40:53.320 --> 40:58.000]  than they could ship to us than they are now.
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.080]  And so we went to tariffs, and the tariffs were fair, and everybody else used tariffs.
[41:03.080 --> 41:12.800]  And it was a level playing field in as much as you produced the broom in China for 50
[41:12.800 --> 41:16.000]  cents, and it was produced in the United States for a dollar.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.920]  So the tariff on brooms from China was 50 cents.
[41:19.920 --> 41:20.920]  It's pretty simple.
[41:20.920 --> 41:22.960]  And then you could decide what you want to end there.
[41:22.960 --> 41:23.960]  That's right.
[41:23.960 --> 41:30.800]  They would compete on the value of the product itself.
[41:30.800 --> 41:33.800]  And then that ups quality.
[41:33.800 --> 41:34.800]  By quality.
[41:34.800 --> 41:35.800]  Instead of the global assistance.
[41:35.800 --> 41:39.320]  The Chinese didn't have quality in those days, believe me, neither did Japan.
[41:39.320 --> 41:42.840]  And so that though incentivizes quality.
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.440]  Now again, Bob Chapman, for laymen out there that don't understand, they are going to continue
[41:47.440 --> 41:51.760]  to devalue the dollar and keep interest rates where they are for a while longer.
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.320]  That will ensure destruction of the dollar and the economy instead of saving the dollar
[41:57.320 --> 42:01.680]  and letting the economy fall apart, where we at least still had some value in our fiat
[42:01.680 --> 42:02.680]  currency, correct?
[42:02.680 --> 42:12.080]  Which they should be doing, and the only answer as an anecdote for that is an insurance policy
[42:12.080 --> 42:19.320]  and food filters, things to defend your family with, and gold and silver, the only place
[42:19.320 --> 42:20.320]  to go to.
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.720]  Now, when we come back, we're going to take some calls for you, Bob Chapman, but I want
[42:23.720 --> 42:26.920]  to ask you the question, you know, this is gyrating out of control, even they're out
[42:26.920 --> 42:31.560]  of, you know, losing control of it, and a lot of their writings, they say they wanted
[42:31.560 --> 42:34.520]  to kill the dollar to bring in the world currency.
[42:34.520 --> 42:36.080]  But is this happening too soon?
[42:36.080 --> 42:38.720]  We'll talk to Bob Chapman on the other side.
[42:38.720 --> 42:42.320]  The New World Order engineered this to rape you, okay?
[42:42.320 --> 42:46.960]  But in the process, they've even endangered their own ghoulish butts, as Bob Chapman was
[42:46.960 --> 42:47.960]  just saying.

[44:31.000 --> 44:34.200]  People in Asia have used Guava for centuries to keep the body healthy.
[44:34.200 --> 44:38.960]  Now, scientific research shows taken Drink and Mate before, during, or immediately after
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.120]  drinking helps prevent queasy stomach, headache, and dehydration.
[44:43.120 --> 44:48.160]  So keep your body in tune and still have fun while having a few drinks with all-natural
[44:48.160 --> 44:49.160]  Drink and Mate.

[44:52.760 --> 44:55.840]  Drink and Mate at holiday stores.
[44:55.840 --> 44:59.920]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[44:59.920 --> 45:01.880]  energy and vibrant health?
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.080]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.

[45:35.280 --> 45:36.440]  of your body.
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.520]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[46:00.160 --> 46:05.000]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[47:00.400 --> 47:13.400]  Tomorrow on the weekday show I'm going to have Bob on longer than 45 minutes or take
[47:13.400 --> 47:16.080]  a few of your calls for him here in just a moment.
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.800]  Got Jordan Maxwell for an hour coming up next, talk about who the guys are that run this
[47:20.800 --> 47:30.880]  whole thing, my whole esoteric agenda, had him scheduled weeks ago.
[47:30.880 --> 47:37.640]  Bob there's so much to cover but I mean you and all the other experts I talk to keep saying
[47:37.640 --> 47:41.400]  it's going to really get bad in the next few years but things are already bad, they're
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.560]  getting worse, people are finally starting to see the inflation on the ground, not just
[47:45.560 --> 47:52.760]  overseas, how do you see this playing out and then also who do we blame, I mean we know
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.880]  it's the globalist engineering that we have our own plans but you know we need to get
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.400]  this out to the public now so that the people that have engineered this in the establishment
[48:01.400 --> 48:03.360]  don't pose as the saviors again.
[48:03.360 --> 48:06.760]  We already have the private Federal Reserve wanting a global government, wanting global
[48:06.760 --> 48:11.040]  carbon taxes as their next Ponzi scheme to get control of us.
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.040]  Break that down.
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.240]  Well I think the main cog and I'm sure Craig Robbins will agree with me is doing away with
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.800]  the Federal Reserve and that would be a good start and then we can take the people who
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.960]  belong to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the known builder
[48:27.960 --> 48:34.080]  burgers and start running investigations on them and at the same time also go after the
[48:34.080 --> 48:41.160]  people who have been in the last two administrations not only in the Treasury Department but also
[48:41.160 --> 48:47.040]  in Justice and in the Pentagon and start tearing apart what they've done and then start bringing
[48:47.040 --> 48:48.040]  criminal charges.
[48:48.040 --> 48:52.560]  I mean this is the best way to solve the problem to get rid of these people once and
[48:52.560 --> 48:53.560]  for all.
[48:53.560 --> 48:54.560]  And this is criminal.
[48:54.560 --> 48:55.560]  They have looted us.
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.000]  Can you explain to the layman out there how we've been systematically looted?
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.200]  Well they control everything and the only people who make big money are the ones who
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.760]  are in control and they do what they want to do as you've seen the administration and
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.200]  Congress blatantly just move along around the law.
[49:16.200 --> 49:24.080]  They defy the Constitution, you saw the FISA which is passed last week which is blatantly
[49:24.080 --> 49:26.000]  unconstitutional.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.600]  The ACLU filed a law so it'll probably get into the Supreme Court in about a year and
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.960]  a half and the legislation won't be nullified.
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.560]  But it's just the blatancy of what they're doing and so they all know each other.
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.240]  They're all hooked up and connected and if something's going down where you can make
[49:44.240 --> 49:51.280]  money or go around the law or if some event like 9-11 is planned you stay away from the
[49:51.280 --> 49:54.080]  building and they know all that stuff.
[49:54.080 --> 49:56.120]  And this is what we've got to prove.
[49:56.120 --> 50:02.400]  We also have to show how they have violated the intent of the working group and financial
[50:02.400 --> 50:14.080]  markets which is the executive order which was signed by Ronald Reagan in August of 1988.
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.520]  The plunge protection team, explain what that does.
[50:16.520 --> 50:20.040]  I mean that's insider trading right there.
[50:20.040 --> 50:22.800]  Every day, 24 hours a day in every market in the world.
[50:22.800 --> 50:25.520]  It's admittedly rigged but the public doesn't know that.
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.680]  Explain to them briefly and I want to take a few calls.
[50:27.680 --> 50:38.400]  Well what the President did at the time was set up the framework that a group within government
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.320]  and outside government as well because the Fed's not in government, they're a private
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.600]  corporation, that they could go in emergencies and do things that they wouldn't normally
[50:47.600 --> 50:49.200]  do.
[50:49.200 --> 50:56.080]  What they have bastardized this thing into is the interpretation which is distorted like
[50:56.080 --> 51:03.720]  everything else that they do is when we think there's any kind of a threat whatsoever because
[51:03.720 --> 51:09.000]  of terrorism in this case, we can rig the markets 24 hours a day all over the world.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.920]  And they selectively go into global markets, the NASDAQ, Standard & Poor's, whatever stocks
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.920]  they want.
[51:16.920 --> 51:22.720]  And then they some days put tens of billions in to select funds that they like, total criminal
[51:22.720 --> 51:26.640]  cronyism and they've been caught doing it, I mean do Americans know that Richard Grasso,
[51:26.640 --> 51:32.160]  the former head of the New York Stock Exchange went to Columbia and publicly at a press conference
[51:32.160 --> 51:35.040]  said invest your cocaine money with us?
[51:35.040 --> 51:39.360]  The average American doesn't even know they're drug dealing in front of everyone but they
[51:39.360 --> 51:44.120]  know the public is like Miss North Carolina, you know I was watching Beavis and Butthead,
[51:44.120 --> 51:47.080]  they were re-airing it the other day on TV and I hadn't seen it in decades and I was
[51:47.080 --> 51:51.200]  watching Beavis and Butthead and did you know they are smarter in that cartoon than
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.960]  the average American now?
[51:52.960 --> 51:56.680]  I mean actually watch Beavis and Butthead and then watch the average college student
[51:56.680 --> 51:58.680]  and they can't even talk Bob.
[51:58.680 --> 52:06.320]  I know it's tragic and what you say about Grasso is true and that's why he won his
[52:06.320 --> 52:13.560]  lawsuit because that was the part of the mafioso money laundering deal and that's all they
[52:13.560 --> 52:17.240]  were doing was laundering money and he was down to get that money to run it through the
[52:17.240 --> 52:18.720]  New York Stock Exchange.
[52:18.720 --> 52:26.080]  I mean why else would the head of the New York Stock Exchange be in the jungles of Columbia
[52:26.080 --> 52:31.520]  with FARC which supposedly is a Marxist organization?
[52:31.520 --> 52:34.240]  Well he was publicly hugging him, it was in the news at the time.
[52:34.240 --> 52:41.040]  No I saw it, I saw the pictures, no you're absolutely right but that's why he was there.
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.960]  All the great fortunes in the last thousand years have been made from the proceeds of
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.600]  drugs.
[52:47.600 --> 52:51.840]  The position of the royal families of Europe which are called the black nobility, they
[52:51.840 --> 52:55.560]  were the ones that started it and that's why they're filthy rich.
[52:55.560 --> 52:58.480]  That's right exactly and those routes out of Asia.
[52:58.480 --> 53:02.800]  For those that don't know the mafia in this country for the nine years of prohibition
[53:02.800 --> 53:09.440]  they lobbied in some cases 10% of their proceeds to keep that law in place and then they literally
[53:09.440 --> 53:14.720]  through fits and threatened people and did everything when prohibition was ended.
[53:14.720 --> 53:18.440]  Once you understand the big drug cartels folks, what drugs illegal?
[53:18.440 --> 53:21.720]  It puts money into it, it gets the criminal element involved.
[53:21.720 --> 53:26.160]  When cocaine and heroin were sold on store shelves hardly anybody was on it.
[53:26.160 --> 53:29.400]  But again you can't explain that to people, they want to be slaves.
[53:29.400 --> 53:34.400]  Let's take a few calls for Bob Chapman, learn more at theinternationalforecaster.com.
[53:34.400 --> 53:39.320]  Let's go to Jay and Cape Cod, question for Bob Chapman, you're on the air.
[53:39.320 --> 53:40.320]  Go ahead Jay.
[53:40.320 --> 53:42.720]  Hey thanks a lot guys for taking my call.
[53:42.720 --> 53:43.720]  Go ahead.
[53:43.720 --> 53:48.240]  I have a question, I was going to purchase some gold but I was wondering in a situation
[53:48.240 --> 53:52.960]  like that if there's some sort of like inflationary depression how would it be useful even on
[53:52.960 --> 53:53.960]  gold?
[53:53.960 --> 53:59.240]  Well I mean you have to ask yourself, the gold you can always shell for whatever the
[53:59.240 --> 54:04.720]  rate of the fiat currency is at the time and Bloomberg is talking about gold at 5,000.
[54:04.720 --> 54:11.040]  I'm not saying that but it's certainly going up at what 1980s levels it's like 2,300 is
[54:11.040 --> 54:16.360]  what it should be for inflation and so the fiat currency they can totally devalue.
[54:16.360 --> 54:20.040]  They can sell your paper, your stocks, your bonds are all worthless tomorrow.
[54:20.040 --> 54:22.480]  Bob you want to explain this to him?
[54:22.480 --> 54:28.200]  Well when the dollar goes down especially in an inflationary environment and that's
[54:28.200 --> 54:35.360]  what we have right now even though the economy is stagnant so you call it stagflation.
[54:35.360 --> 54:41.160]  When you have that situation when the dollar is going down because of that inflation some
[54:41.160 --> 54:43.840]  assets will go up in value to offset that.
[54:43.840 --> 54:47.560]  We've seen that happen in commodities and it's happening in gold and silver.
[54:47.560 --> 54:51.720]  The only reason the gold and silver are not higher is that the working group in financial
[54:51.720 --> 54:58.600]  markets, the Plunch Protection Team, has been suppressing it since 1988 and they will continue
[54:58.600 --> 55:00.280]  to do so as long as they can.
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.680]  By the way in real financial circles listeners that is common knowledge.
[55:05.680 --> 55:06.680]  Go ahead Bob.
[55:06.680 --> 55:13.480]  Absolutely and so as the value of your currency, the dollar goes down, the value of gold and
[55:13.480 --> 55:20.120]  silver are going to go up and that's going to continue until inflation ends and we have
[55:20.120 --> 55:27.080]  a deflationary collapse and then let's say that gold is $5,000 an ounce.
[55:27.080 --> 55:32.320]  It could come back down to $4,500 but that's the extent of it but at the same time the
[55:32.320 --> 55:37.720]  stock market which was $14,100 might be $4,000 on the Dow.
[55:37.720 --> 55:41.320]  We know the house prices have already come down precipitously and they've got a long
[55:41.320 --> 55:42.520]  way to go.
[55:42.520 --> 55:43.520]  That's right.
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.600]  Gold and precious metals historically will maintain or get more value during an inflationary
[55:48.600 --> 55:49.600]  trend.
[55:49.600 --> 55:50.600]  Correct, sir?
[55:50.600 --> 55:51.600]  Right.
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.800]  Usually numismatic coins will do twice as well if not more.
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.680]  Let's take a quick call and we've got to let Bob Chapman go.
[55:58.680 --> 56:01.520]  Let's go real fast to another call for him.
[56:01.520 --> 56:03.000]  Let's talk to Sam in Deutschland.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.320]  You're on the air from Germany.
[56:04.320 --> 56:05.320]  Quickly, Sam.
[56:05.320 --> 56:06.320]  All right.
[56:06.320 --> 56:07.320]  Hey, Bob.
[56:07.320 --> 56:08.320]  I have a cool question.
[56:08.320 --> 56:11.520]  The question is, I was wondering how you see the economic depression or collapse in
[56:11.520 --> 56:16.120]  the United States affecting Western Europe and also do you think there's going to be
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.280]  a real high rise of anti-Americanism here in Europe and maybe it's safer for Americans
[56:20.280 --> 56:22.800]  to go back home or what's your views on that?
[56:22.800 --> 56:28.040]  Well, first of all, I can understand the anti-Americanism because of the antics of the United States
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.120]  government and it's not only in Europe, it's all over the world.
[56:32.120 --> 56:37.440]  I think in Germany, it's probably around 65 to 67 percent, but you go into some South
[56:37.440 --> 56:42.360]  American and Eastern European countries and Asian countries as well and you'll have it
[56:42.360 --> 56:43.360]  over 80 percent.
[56:43.360 --> 56:44.360]  Bob, real fast.
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.320]  You know, Ted Anderson was in Buenos Aires down there with his fiance and I had him on
[56:48.320 --> 56:49.320]  the show Friday.
[56:49.320 --> 56:53.080]  He said they're not wanting dollars in Buenos Aires.
[56:53.080 --> 56:54.080]  That's correct.
[56:54.080 --> 56:55.080]  They're taking euros.
[56:55.080 --> 56:56.080]  Oh, my God.
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.080]  And that's the currency.
[56:59.080 --> 57:09.520]  And another program will get into the euros, but the PMI, the producer, the Purchasing
[57:09.520 --> 57:16.000]  Manages Index in Europe dropped below 50 several months ago and it's headed lower and it's
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.120]  affecting the whole world.
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.880]  Bottom line, we're going into an inflationary depression.
[57:19.880 --> 57:22.880]  Is that 100 percent with the current policies?
[57:22.880 --> 57:23.880]  Yes.
[57:23.880 --> 57:24.880]  Bob Chapman.
[57:24.880 --> 57:27.800]  No one's going to escape, believe me.
[57:27.800 --> 57:28.800]  No one's going to escape.
[57:28.800 --> 57:29.800]  Okay.
[57:29.800 --> 57:30.800]  Bob, let me put you on hold.
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.760]  Make sure you're set up for tomorrow and God bless you, theinternationalforecaster.com.
[57:34.760 --> 57:35.760]  Great info.
[57:35.760 --> 57:36.760]  Check it out.
[57:36.760 --> 57:37.760]  Thanks, Bob.
[57:37.760 --> 57:38.760]  Thank you.
[57:38.760 --> 57:39.760]  All right.

[58:45.640 --> 58:49.560]  In this age of advanced electronics, we have many new amazing technologies.
[58:49.560 --> 58:53.440]  Smartphones, intelligent credit cards, even cars that talk and park themselves.
[58:53.440 --> 58:58.440]  In 2004, John Wright Laboratories perfected the technology known as the Rife Machine.
[58:58.440 --> 59:03.840]  The new JW Labs Model A is a compact, solid-state, battery-powered personal therapy device that's
[59:03.840 --> 59:05.160]  in a class by itself.
[59:05.160 --> 59:09.560]  Larger than a cell phone, smaller than a CD player, the Model A has power and accuracy

[59:44.800 --> 59:46.960]  It's the life of a man this morning.
[59:46.960 --> 59:48.960]  Details just ahead on those stories.
[59:48.960 --> 59:52.960]  You are listening to GCN.
[59:52.960 --> 59:55.120]  Texas, check your watch.
[59:55.120 --> 59:56.120]  It's five o'clock.
[59:56.120 --> 59:59.760]  Benedict has arrived on his 10-day visit to Australia.
[59:59.760 --> 1:00:05.320]  His schedule includes the World Youth Day Festival, which has attracted more than 200,000 people.
[1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:10.160]  The president of the group, Broken Rights, Chris MacIsaac, says the Catholic Church must
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:12.160]  do more to support abuse victims.
[1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:17.400]  They are abused by priests and brothers sexually, and then they take their claim to the church
[1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:18.640]  and face more abuse.
[1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:22.400]  In Hurricane Bertha, it could be back down to Tropical Storm Bertha by the end of the
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:23.400]  day.
[1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:27.000]  The slow-moving storm is spinning about 220 miles from Bermuda.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:31.040]  The island is under a Tropical Storm warning because of high surf and a lot of rain expected
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:32.440]  in the next few days.
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:36.240]  Jack Bevan with the National Hurricane Center says you can expect some bad weather along
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:37.240]  the coast.
[1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:41.920]  That could start in the next 12 to 24 hours, spinning on how fast the storm actually moves.
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:45.760]  Well, right now, not likely to move very fast, but maybe Monday or Tuesday before they see
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:46.760]  those conditions.
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:49.320]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:50.320]  psoriasis.
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:55.920]  The itching, flaking, and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can be even more
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:56.920]  devastating.
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:00.120]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:01.120]  I felt self-conscious.
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:04.920]  Nobody knows what that flaking is, and people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're
[1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:05.920]  dirty.
[1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:06.920]  I don't want people knowing I have this to bear with me.
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:07.920]  Of course I felt self-conscious.
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:09.600]  It's not very attractive to look at.
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.400]  The solution is new and improved, SkinZinc Advanced, the number one OTC treatment for
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:15.400]  psoriasis.
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:17.480]  SkinZinc turned out to be the perfect answer.
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:22.200]  SkinZinc has changed my life the third day I saw that my psoriasis was disappearing.
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:24.960]  One week I noticed that the rashes on my arms were going away.
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:27.040]  My elbows are completely cleared up.
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:28.040]  You have to try it.
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:29.880]  SkinZinc will make your psoriasis go away.

[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:54.960]  Firefighters in California have been making progress during this historically busy fire
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:59.160]  season, especially around the Sierra Nevada town of Paradise.
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:02.360]  And the fire near Vixur is about 61% contained.
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:06.480]  A new concern may come from a forest for heavy rain.
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:10.680]  Flashlight watches have been issued in southern and central California, including many fire
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.040]  scarred areas that are ripe for mudslides.
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.120]  Barack Obama is revealing some details about his upcoming trip.
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:20.000]  He'll be heading to Europe by Iraq and Afghanistan.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:24.480]  He says he'll travel with two Senate colleagues, Republican Chuck Hagel and Democrat Jack
[1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:25.480]  Greed.
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:28.320]  The two have been mentioned as possible running mates.
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:32.560]  And an Israeli official says Prime Minister Ehud Almert has agreed to release more Palestinian
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:33.560]  prisoners.
[1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:38.320]  The move is seen as an overture to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as the two sides try
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:40.320]  to move ahead on peace talks.
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:45.000]  Meanwhile, Israel says a prisoner's swap with Hezbollah will take place Wednesday.

[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:54.320]  Did you know the average household owes over $25,000 in credit card debt, and 65% of those
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:56.520]  households can only afford the minimum monthly payment?
[1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:57.520]  Are you in a debt trap?
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:02:58.520]  You can't get out of.
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:02:59.520]  I can't keep this up.
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:00.520]  I need relief.
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:04.480]  The U.S.A. has helped thousands of people just like you if you owe more than $10,000
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:05.480]  in credit card debt.
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:09.720]  Call the debt specialist at Debt Relief U.S.A. 800-425-5601.
[1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:13.240]  Debt Relief U.S.A. saved me half of what I owe on my credit card.
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:14.240]  800-425-5601.
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:20.720]  That's 800-425-5601 for Debt Relief U.S.A.
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:25.280]  Former President Bill Clinton is told a governor's convention in Philadelphia that despite America's
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:30.360]  apparent diversity, we're actually hunkering down in communities of like-mindedness.
[1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:35.240]  He warns that such polarization affects our ability to manage difference.
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:40.360]  At the conference, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, who supported Senator Barack Obama, says it
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:44.640]  was difficult for Democratic politicians to decide which candidate to support during the
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.400]  party's presidential primary.
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:49.680]  This was a hard campaign in that sense because I think the Democratic field was as deep a
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:51.080]  field as we've ever seen.
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:55.960]  Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weese says he welcomes a chance to talk with Alderman
[1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:56.960]  this week.
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:04:01.560]  Weese met with individual Alderman, angry about a rise in the city's murder raid last
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:05.960]  week in private, but will go before a public city council hearing Tuesday.
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:09.160]  Weese will ask help from the public in stopping gun violence.
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:11.640]  Keeping the streets safe, keeping crime down.
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:16.120]  It is not just a law enforcement function, it is a function of the community.
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.800]  And the Screen Actors Guild and Major Hollywood Studios are in limbo at the bargaining table
[1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:25.880]  as the two sides try to iron out their differences in contract negotiations.
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:30.760]  Sam Fair is the deputy national director for strategic planning of the Screen Actors Guild.
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:32.680]  We lived through this process before.
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:37.960]  They went through it with DVDs, they went through it with cable and saw what was the
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:43.280]  little baby industry that virgined and we accepted terms that really turned out to be
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:45.160]  inadequate as the market grows.
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:49.400]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:54.400]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:56.080]  a third world nation.
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:00.360]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:01.360]  solutions.
[1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:03.400]  Introducing Orgon Products.
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:07.800]  Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material
[1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:08.800]  planet.
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:12.920]  Orgon Electromedicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:17.600]  Will Helmreich Orgon use cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:20.200]  energy savings of up to 25 percent?
[1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:24.240]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:27.880]  For less than the cost of a doctor's visit, you can have a device that could lead to the
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:29.760]  end of all your problems.
[1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:32.400]  Health doesn't need to be expensive or complicated.

[1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:28.840]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:33.840]  Well he is an icon in the movement to awaken people to the fact there's a shadow world
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:39.400]  government, a power behind the throne, a system of control that's now becoming more and more
[1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:40.400]  evident.
[1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:45.200]  We talk about world government 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, people like him would be
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:46.200]  laughed at.
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:47.200]  Now it's out in the open.
[1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:50.200]  We do this for the rest of the hour, and at the bottom of the hour, we're going to be
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:54.440]  up on the phones up on really any subject, because he's an expert on them all.
[1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:57.480]  Jordan Maxwell promised to have him on the Sunday show.
[1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:58.480]  Here he is.
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:00.320]  We'd have him longer, but he only wanted to do an hour.
[1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:03.720]  Jordan doesn't do a lot of interviews anymore.
[1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:11.160]  So he is our guest for this hour, toll free number to join us, 877-590-5525.
[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:12.160]  And I know we've got folks holding him.
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:13.160]  We'll get to you.
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:15.440]  At the bottom of the hour, we've got a lot of stuff to cover.
[1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:21.760]  Before we go to Jordan, Maxwell will be clear, the same government, the same private banks,
[1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:26.800]  the same private fellow reserve that told you it was all fixed with Northern Rock and
[1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:33.040]  countrywide collapsing, U.S. regulators take control of a struggling bank, and they go
[1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:38.840]  on to say in this article that the feds are promising that everything is fine.
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:44.480]  The politicians rally behind Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac as well, as if companies fail, which
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:51.960]  are leveraged in the thousands of trillions but are worth over $50 trillion on paper.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:52.960]  You heard me.
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:53.960]  I said trillion.
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:55.800]  In fact, here it is in the Associated Press.
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:08:01.400]  The two companies own or guarantee more than $5 trillion of home loans, about half of all
[1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:04.520]  the mortgage debt, and it's leveraged many times that.
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:05.920]  No one really knows.
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:07.640]  It's just we know thousands of times.
[1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:09.960]  So what's thousands of times $5 trillion?
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:15.040]  And with that, they bought lake houses and coal mines and gold mines, and that's why
[1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:16.160]  they set up the police state.
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:17.320]  We have the IMF documents.
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:21.240]  They said, my God, when the public finds out we've done this, they are going to go ape
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:25.680]  when we tell them they're all slaves of government, which slaves to pay the debt that we created
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:27.000]  to get real assets.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.720]  Oh, my God.
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:30.200]  But they tell you everything's fine.
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:31.200]  Everything's wonderful.
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:32.200]  The dollar's strong.
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:36.440]  Now, going to deeper debt, let's keep cutting interest rates.
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:41.040]  Bush is saying he backs Israel's striking Iran, and he says, this is the times of London,
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:46.920]  that if Iran defends itself in any way, that is terrorism and nuclear weapons will be used
[1:08:46.920 --> 1:08:47.920]  against them.
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:49.800]  Right here, I have the news.
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:53.800]  Imagine, we're going to blow the daylights out of you, and if you fight back in any way,
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:58.920]  our cattle will be told that we're attacking you for that reason, and then oil prices will
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:01.600]  more than quadruple, according to OPEC.
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.640]  So you think things are bad?
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:07.440]  The government is doing everything it can to push us in to this.
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:11.240]  The private banks are doing everything it can to push us into this.
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:14.880]  Shifting gears and going to Jordan Maxwell, there's so many things to talk about.
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:18.960]  I thought we could go from the current and what's happening to really the history and
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:24.280]  then today's master plan, why the elite are doing this, what they plan to set up here
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:29.800]  on planet Earth, and we have links to his website up on infowars.com, as Jordan Maxwell.com.
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:31.720]  Jordan, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.560]  I'm always happy to be with you.
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:40.640]  You're doing one hell of a job that very few other people have the courage or the wherewithal
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:44.720]  to do, so I really applaud you for what you're doing.
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:50.320]  And I've said publicly that I'm not the man that you are because you've shown yourself
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:54.400]  to be very brave, and I'm not sure I'm not brave at all, really.
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:01.560]  I'm just more scared than I am anything else because I realize the absolute dimensions
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:04.680]  of how big this problem really is.
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:06.480]  It's not just America.
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:12.560]  The whole world is in trouble, and so goes America, so goes the world.
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:18.800]  This stuff is really, really frightening, and that's why I don't do much radio anymore.
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:26.960]  The joy of doing radio, I used to really enjoy doing radio, I've had my own show seven times.
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:33.800]  My last show was the best of the seven, I was doing a pretty big show here in Los Angeles
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:40.960]  on ABC affiliate Saturday nights, had a huge audience, and got in trouble, and the thing
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:44.440]  went shut down.
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:51.000]  So since then, I have not been, especially since 9-11, I have really shied away from
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  the public.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.120]  Well, since you bring this up, let's just go ahead and talk a little bit about it, it's
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:56.120]  okay.
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:11:00.000]  Everybody says the three top hosts on Coast to Coast are you, myself, and David Icke,
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.760]  of course, and you even a lot of times don't go on that show now.
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:08.200]  You have been visited by the feds and threatened to shut up, they know.
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:12.200]  We even have had the feds drop by and try to threaten us.
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:13.800]  They don't even make bones about it now.
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:18.240]  They know we're exposing their criminal operation, they are very upset, I don't like to do the
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:22.720]  enemies intimidating for them, but folks, if you don't know how real this is, and the
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.680]  death threats that Jordan Maxwell has gotten, Jordan, I think you're going to get more though
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:30.480]  because they know it's getting to you, and I know you're a wise guy, I've been doing
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:35.040]  this for 50 years, but me, I just say, hey, I'm committed, I've already gone all the way
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:40.680]  into this, the Congress has a 9% approval rating, Bush has won 5 points below Nixon,
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:44.000]  both parties are hated, I think we're kicking their butt, that's why they're threatening
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  us.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:50.680]  Well, I'm sure you're right, I'm sure their whole world is falling apart, which it goes
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:56.360]  back to the laws of God, so to speak, I mean, there are laws in the universe that basically
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:01.560]  have set from time in the beginning that what you do comes back on you, you know, what
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:08.480]  you sow, you reap, and these people have been sowing violence and corruption and lies and
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:14.400]  deception from day one, I mean, it goes all the way back to even the founding of this
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:19.800]  country and goes back to the British East, India Company, and the hidden corporations
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:26.680]  and all the machinations going on in Europe at the time, and the founding of this country
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:33.080]  and the wars and the bloodshed, the whole thing is in commerce, the whole thing is basically
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:40.160]  boils down to the wars between crypts and the bloods for who's going to eat up and
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:41.680]  own the human race.
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:45.920]  And the gangs agree to never let the slaves in on what's happening.
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:51.120]  That's exactly right, cannot allow the people to know what the name of the tune and how
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:58.240]  this thing is really being played, and I was aware of it as a kid, I was already aware
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:04.360]  of the dimensions of the thing in my life, and you know, the older I got the more I began
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:10.360]  to see, you know, it was bigger than what I thought it was, it's bigger than our state
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:15.120]  that we lived in, and then I began to see, you know, it's bigger than this country, and
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:24.640]  by the time I really got going, about 1959 and 60, I realized this is a monumental struggle,
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:32.280]  not just for America, I don't see it any longer as a struggle for America against tyranny.
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:35.320]  I see it for the human race.
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:42.760]  The human race itself is now in jeopardy, and its very existence has been called into
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:48.960]  question as far as I'm concerned, because the problems that this country and the good
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:56.840]  people of the world face is so horrendous in its dimensions, and so awesome in scope
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:03.360]  that it's absolutely frightening, and that's why so many people think, and I've had people
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:09.720]  tell me that, that you're making a lot of noise about, you know, just politics as usual,
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:10.720]  just...
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:16.320]  So, it's intensifying, it's at warp speed, every expert I talk to in every genre, everybody
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:21.800]  can feel it, something big is happening, and the FEMA camps, that they're announcing,
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:26.240]  they built camps on the news, and the preachers have been hired to be spies, and they're
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:30.520]  poisoning the water and the food and putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, and it comes
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:34.720]  out in Canadian news that they're currently murdering the children of Native Americans
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:39.480]  up there, the government is, and the government says we're not going to stop, and it's just
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:40.880]  hell is being released.
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:48.520]  That's why I said, what is happening now on the earth is calling into question the ferocity
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:54.640]  of the human experiment on earth, I mean, we are now at a point to where we're not,
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:15:01.240]  I don't even think in terms of saving America as opposed to the rest of the world, I'm thinking
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:07.360]  in terms, because I've been looking at this for so long, the entire world is in trouble
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:08.360]  now.
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:10.880]  Let's talk about their master plan.
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.000]  What do top corporate leaders, top scientists say?
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.960]  They say that their main plan, publicly in hundreds of books, government documents, is
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:25.400]  to kill 80 to 90% of us, and then to engineer a suboid servant class to serve the elite
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:26.400]  who will go to the stars.
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.560]  We're going to talk about that with Jordan Maxwell when we get back.
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:50.000]  The biggest secret on the other side, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:16:00.080]  Question is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:06.240]  Question are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:15.440]  Question do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:55.160]  energy and vibrant health?
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:17:00.320]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:05.280]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.

[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:14.240]  Alkalizing plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping

[1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:29.560]  of your body.
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:34.800]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:00.600]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:01.600]  Let's go look.
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.720]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:07.480]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:08.480]  Take them out.
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:09.480]  Let's see them.
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:13.920]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:14.920]  Don't worry.
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:16.680]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:21.040]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:23.680]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:24.680]  Great.
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:28.160]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:35.440]  Don't let Non-X-Man find you with unsightly toenails by diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:37.040]  Non-X nail gel.
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:43.440]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Longs, Meyer, Giant Eagle,

[1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:49.080]  That's right.
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:52.520]  I'm going to Karen.
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:57.000]  I'm going all the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  I am committed.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:04.640]  No, not going to let them catch the midnight rider.
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:09.640]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to Jordan Maxwell, an amazing individual, JordanMaxwell.com.
[1:21:09.640 --> 1:21:13.640]  Jordan, let's get into who the globalist are.
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:15.760]  They understand how humans operate.
[1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:21.280]  This is our own species who understands what makes people tick, how to mesmerize, how to
[1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:27.240]  use basically magician-like trickery sleight of hand to control the population, to change
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:30.560]  the language, to bring in systems of control.
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:35.480]  They own the earth and as a lot of top scientists and the owners of Sun Microsystems and so
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:40.520]  many others, I cover this in end game, they say the plan is to get a world government
[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:42.920]  in to start the extermination.
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:47.880]  But then they will also have a suboid, I guess, kind of a Blade Runner-like genetic-engineered
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:48.880]  replicant.
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:54.360]  It's not an android in the classical sense, it's an engineered humanoid using its flesh
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:59.920]  and blood grown in the wombs of cows, that's BBC, to serve them and they say the plan
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:02.280]  is to split our species into two.
[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:08.120]  And that's the main directive of the Pentagon is, of course, first, our implantable brain
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:09.120]  ships.
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:10.120]  This is official.
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:11.120]  It's in my book.
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:12.120]  It's sent into tyranny.
[1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:13.120]  I'm crazy.
[1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:14.240]  I'm not the one saying all this.
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:19.600]  And then, of course, our orderly extermination, except for a suboid servant class.
[1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:20.600]  Can you speak to that, sir?
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:28.440]  I mean, as far back as 1948, we're talking a long time ago, there was a movie came out
[1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:33.080]  called Island of Lost Souls with Charles Lawton.
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:40.000]  And then in 1965, 1966, I think it was, Burt Lancaster remade the movie and called it the
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.680]  Island of Dr. Moreau.
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:48.240]  And then just a few years ago, the last movie, I believe it was, that Marlon Brando made
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:54.320]  before he died, was The Island of Dr. Moreau, a remake.
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.200]  And which the whole story, and we're talking about three times Hollywood has presented
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:00.200]  this, as far back as 1948.
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:01.200]  Well, there's another one.
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:03.360]  The island just came out where they grow these humanoids.
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.840]  Oh, well, that's the fourth one then, where Hollywood is telling you that they have that
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:16.840]  concept and the idea of crossing humans with animals is a very old idea.
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:21.280]  They were talking about this kind of thing back in pre-Nazi Germany.
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:25.960]  As a matter of fact, there was a lot of talk about it in pre-communist Russia.
[1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:28.640]  And I told you last time, we talked about A.R.
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:33.520]  Luria and Ivan Pavlov with the Pavlonian dog.
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:41.680]  There has been an ongoing effort to completely redesign the human race, and it's taken
[1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:47.640]  from, the concept is taken from and mistakenly taken from the Bible, where the scripture
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:51.960]  talks about the new man that will be created.
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:58.760]  The idea in the Bible, of course, is that if you begin to understand spiritual, important
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:03.520]  things spiritually, that it will begin to change your life, and you will no longer be
[1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:07.200]  the old man that you were, now you will be the new man.
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:12.000]  And so these people who understand scripture, they understand all the ancient writings of
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:18.040]  the ancient world, they understand things like that far better than we shall ever begin
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:19.040]  to.
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:20.040]  Well, let me stop you.
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:26.200]  For those that are laughing at us right now, I just Googled Human Calc Lone, BBC, AP Reuters.
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.040]  They made these 10 years ago, now they're just now telling us about it.
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:35.680]  You can go read it, or read Human, Animal, Hybrid, thousands of articles.
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:38.800]  But I have people every time I talk about this, and I mean emails laughing, because
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:42.640]  they've been preconditioned to not understand we're in 2008, Jordan.
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:43.640]  That's right.
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:45.680]  And as you said, they were cloning rabbits 60 years ago.
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:46.680]  They just kept it quiet.
[1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:47.680]  It wasn't there.
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:48.680]  It wasn't there.
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:52.120]  A sheep that was half, that had human.
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:54.280]  Yeah, that was a decade ago, too.
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:55.280]  Yeah.
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:57.360]  We were talking 10 years ago.
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:58.360]  That's what they admit.
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  Yeah.
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:00.360]  And then you actually read the...
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:01.360]  Well, here's an example.
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:04.400]  Washington Post, five years ago, admitted they have human chimpanzee crosses, and they
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:08.760]  say they don't have rights so they can take their organs, and they say they're in Argentina,
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:11.120]  but in labs, but you're not allowed to see them.
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:13.000]  I mean, it's done, folks.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.200]  It's going on.
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:16.760]  It's going on for sure.
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:22.480]  And if some of these things which are happening would be so frightening to the world of mankind
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:27.960]  generally, and they know that, that's why it's always been behind the scenes.
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:33.080]  But there's no doubt in my mind that these stories that we hear about human sacrifices,
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:39.280]  child sacrifices, satanic cults, all of this is in point of fact actually happening.
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:47.360]  But it implies something even far, far more darker, if you can imagine that, that whoever
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:55.960]  it is that is running this earth are totally out of control, or maybe we as humans are
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:00.880]  totally misunderstanding what's going on, and we're thinking that there are humans that
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:05.200]  are running this earth, but maybe there's something else going on.
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.800]  I'm totally, for myself, I am totally convinced that there is something too, this biblical
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:16.240]  concept in the Old Testament, of angels that look like men.
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:22.560]  Yeah, the Nephilim, and it talks about genetic engineering in a bunch of, and again, I never
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:24.560]  get into these stories, but you're right.
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.640]  And certainly the elites do believe, and I've been to Bohemian Grove, it kicks off tomorrow
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:32.160]  by the way, I've been to a lot of these other things and covered them, the elites, whether
[1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:37.040]  you believe it or not, they do believe in this, and I've had high level NASA people
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:39.120]  on, they're all into the occult.
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:44.840]  This stuff is going on, and they believe that they are becoming more human than human.
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:47.200]  These God-men through genetic engineering.
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:49.760]  That's exactly right.
[1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:55.720]  Look at, just to take for a moment, if you believe the Bible, and if you have any respect
[1:26:55.720 --> 1:27:04.400]  for the Bible, and the book of Genesis 18 talks about when three men come walking up
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:10.200]  into the camp of Abraham and Sarah, and Abraham immediately, those scriptures says, ran out
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:15.960]  and bowed down to the three men, and said, what is my Lord saying to his servant?
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:22.680]  Then the men told Abraham that they were on their way on business and were just coming
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:29.680]  by on their way, and Abraham invited them to stay for dinner to have something to eat.
[1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:34.960]  They said no, and they were busy and had to go, and he insisted, so they said, all right,
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:36.480]  but make it quick.
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:44.160]  So the scripture says in Genesis 18 that the four men sat under a tree, had dinner, then
[1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:51.240]  two of the men got up and left, and the third one sitting there was the Creator God himself,
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:57.120]  Almighty God in the capital letters, himself sat there with Abraham under the tree.
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:59.560]  That's Michael's a deck, right?
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:00.560]  Yes.
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:06.160]  But the point is that the two men that got up toward the end of the 18th chapter are
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:11.280]  the same two men at the beginning of the 19th chapter, which are the two angels that went
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:16.160]  into Sodom and Gomorrah, where the homosexuals thought they were good-looking, handsome men.
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:17.160]  Bizarre.
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:18.160]  It's just incredible.
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:24.320]  Look, here it is, National Geographic, Animal-Human-Hybrid Spark Controversy, January, 2005, but you
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:28.520]  tell the public they're crossing humans with spiders, goats, everything else, they just
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:29.520]  laugh at you.
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.520]  Yes, it's really going on to exploring some of the more bizarre beliefs of the elite with
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:37.600]  George Maxwell, and they're now manifesting their ancient beliefs and actually creating
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:38.600]  it.
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:49.600]  Stay with us.

[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:00.680]  Be safe.

[1:29:49.720 --> 1:29:51.240]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:54.960]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:59.240]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:00.960]  huge political voting block.
[1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:05.000]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:08.800]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:10.000]  of conscience.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:13.480]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:14.480]  kept separate.
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:18.580]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:21.160]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:25.040]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:26.440]  intolerance resulted.
[1:30:26.440 --> 1:30:30.320]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:33.120]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:35.600]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:37.400]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.

[1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:55.240]  And terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages
[1:30:55.240 --> 1:30:57.800]  already destroying millions of American families.
[1:30:57.800 --> 1:31:01.880]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:05.800]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:59.240]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control reports
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:01.880]  of suffering from internal parasites.

[1:32:51.720 --> 1:33:06.280]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard hitting talk radio.
[1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:10.600]  Yep, I have my own little syndicated broadcast reaching millions every day, Monday through
[1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:11.600]  Friday.
[1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:17.760]  I come back here on Sunday, 4-6 PM Central.
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:18.760]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:19.920]  We've got about 27 minutes left.
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:26.800]  I will be taking your calls for Jordan Maxwell, hearing about 5 minutes at 877-590-5525.
[1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:30.480]  It is the 13th day of July, 2008 if you're wondering.
[1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:31.480]  We're live, 877-590-5525.
[1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:38.560]  We have a lot of callers, Jim, Mark, and many others, whatever subjects you want to talk
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:41.680]  about we will get to you.
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:42.680]  Here's another one.
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:46.920]  I just typed human, animal, hybrid, thousands of articles.
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:53.080]  Here's MIT Technology Review, technology published by MIT is the website.
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:57.920]  Human pig hybrid for human body parts.
[1:33:57.920 --> 1:34:03.920]  They get around the legalese, they grow humanoids, they just change, they're really human.
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:07.320]  They change a small amount of their genetics and it doesn't look like a human, it looks
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:08.320]  like a spider.
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:09.320]  It's got spider genetics.
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:12.080]  In the case of spider goats, they've had for more than 15 years.
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:18.480]  The udders actually are stupid-ish webs so that they have the same cell gangliae that
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.600]  produce the spinoff rats that a spider has in their udders.
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:28.840]  There are actually cases where parts of the animal are completely alien to their original
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:29.840]  genome.
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:32.960]  It gives rise to superviruses and other things that are already spreading throughout the
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:37.720]  genome, killing all sorts of trees and animals, but don't worry, they're not going to stop
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:38.720]  all that.
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:39.720]  They're going to continue that.
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:44.200]  They're going to tax carbon dioxide that is what the plants breathe and it needs to
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:50.080]  be higher for a larger biomass be able to support.
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:52.920]  But there are going to be anything about all the real environmental destruction, the overfishing
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:54.480]  and cutting down to the rainforest.
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:59.880]  That's all going to continue and it's going to hurt us who are on this planet as well.
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:03.160]  Fake environmentalism for the real one.
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:10.480]  Going back to Jordan Maxwell, Jordan, why do the elite want to exterminate the vast majority
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:11.480]  of us?
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:15.920]  I mean, even before they could claim we were overcrowded, Plato, as you've reported in his
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:20.520]  Republic, said the elite needed to kill the vast majority of the population and then
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:24.600]  breed the rest to work in insects and specialized areas.
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  I mean, this has been going on for 2400 years then.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:36.640]  Yeah, I'm afraid so, but as well as I do, the ancient world is filled with the reports
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:40.920]  and stories of aliens and extraterrestrial influences.
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:42.400]  The Bible is filled with it.
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:46.200]  So I'm of the opinion that we've been under attack.
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:52.880]  The human family has been under attack ever since this creation by an otherworldly force.
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:59.960]  And if you think that's foolish, you know, I have my webman, while you were on the break,
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:05.640]  put up quickly a picture on my website on the home page of a book I've had for a long
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:09.320]  time put out by the U.S. Army War College.
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:13.800]  It's called The World 2010, A New Order of Nations.
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:18.200]  You can't find this thing anywhere, I've had a copy of it.
[1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:21.720]  And you can go on my website just for today for the moment and see it.
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:25.840]  I just had him put it up for just a few minutes ago.
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:31.240]  And it's really interesting, talks about how the whole world is going to be changed.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:37.600]  The U.S. Army War College has been preparing the whole world for the new order of the world
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:41.480]  that's coming and the U.S. Army has been planning it.
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:44.560]  They've been planning the whole thing, they've got it all figured out, how they're going
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:46.360]  to carve up civilization.
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:51.560]  And now we have the British Ministry of Defense report last year saying they will use neutron
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:57.240]  bombs on rebelling populations in the West, race-specific bio weapons, and admitting in
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:01.200]  official policy that the state is waging war on their own people.
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:02.200]  Well, I know.
[1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:05.960]  I mean, for the listeners, though, that that's all, you can go find that right now.
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:09.560]  So you believe in your research and all the ancient texts and what the elites believe
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:12.560]  in it, and I know they believe it, I don't know if it's real, I know they believe they're
[1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:17.840]  in contact with what you call, you know, they call spirits or you call extra-trestrials.
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:21.440]  You believe and they believe, and I know they believe that they're being directed in some
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:22.440]  master plan.
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:24.360]  I mean, there's no doubting they believe that.
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:29.080]  Well, I mean, look at, here's the bottom line on that as far as I'm concerned.
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:31.280]  They are in power.
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:32.880]  We are not.
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:34.320]  They believe it.
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:35.320]  We do not.
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:37.280]  What does that tell you?
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:44.360]  And so I'm thinking that not only do they believe it, they damn well know it's true, period.
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:50.440]  That's why they have the power, because they have thrown in with the dark side of world
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:51.440]  occultism.
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:55.000]  They, they not only know- And occult just means hidden, so-
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Yeah, of course.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.920]  Well, I mean, I know you know that, but the listeners don't.
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:37:58.920]  Yeah.
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:02.160]  So you're saying from your 50 years of study and getting into the libraries, reading the
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:10.800]  elite text, that this earth spinning through the cosmos is being manipulated by an outside
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:11.800]  force.
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:12.800]  That's my belief.
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:13.800]  Totally.
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:16.680]  Well, the Bible says it's Satan, but you're saying Satan, Satan isn't that ancient image
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:17.680]  we have.
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:18.680]  It's something else.
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:23.600]  Well, no, because as far as, but, but the concept is there in the Bible and in Christianity
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:31.000]  is Satan, but it's also even the, in the Old Testament, but it is also in all the ancient
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.760]  holy writings of the world.
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:35.920]  Talk about the other side, the dark side of the world.
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:42.360]  The dark side are generally speaking occult powers in the world.
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:46.720]  Almost every nation in the world has taught that there is something else going on on this
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:53.760]  earth besides us, and that we have some kind of a connection with other world entities
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:55.880]  from someplace else.
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:39:01.400]  Like any six-year-old child in a Christian nation, where is God?
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:03.400]  And they will point straight up.
[1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:08.600]  You ask anybody, any Christian Jew that believes in the angels of the Bible, ask them, well,
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:11.400]  where is God, and where do angels come from?
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:13.000]  Well, they'll point out there.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  Well, if you're...
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:17.440]  But every culture, they just went into the middle of the Amazon and found the new group
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:19.440]  of people and they have the same cosmology.
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:20.880]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:26.360]  The whole world has always been aware that we are not alone on this earth.
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:32.560]  It's only our elite masters who try and put it down and act like it doesn't happen.
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:36.200]  But they not only believe it, they know it.
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:41.760]  That's the point I'm making, is that the world is being led not by the normal people you
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.760]  think they are.
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:45.480]  Well, Jordan, I know this.
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:48.080]  The elite do believe what you're saying.
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:52.080]  I mean, it's in mainstream British news that Prince Philip, you know, Queen Elizabeth's
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:55.120]  husband is totally obsessed with this and believes it.
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:56.680]  Prince Charles believes it.
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:57.960]  All these big wigs believe it.
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:39:59.760]  The astronauts say it.
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:03.880]  And so regardless of whether it's true or not, and I understand all the ancient texts
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:09.320]  and the rest of it say it, I cover what I can prove, I know that they believe it.
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:13.240]  And do you believe that they're creating fake events like Richard Hoagland believes in its
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:16.160]  secret government stuff, or is it a mix of that?
[1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:24.080]  Well, you know what, a long time ago, a dear friend of mine, Norio Hayakawa, used to talk
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:29.680]  about that all the time, about how he thought that the U.S. government and other governments
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:37.760]  with it were planning on having a fake UFO event that would frighten the world, kind
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:44.960]  of like what the movie Independence Day portrayed, and that there would be a fake landing of
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:49.320]  UFOs or something, and it would scare the whole world, and they would all join into
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:50.320]  one world.
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:53.760]  Well, I mean, I've now seen you classify Pentagon plans to do that.
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:58.680]  But I, at the time, I heard this many years ago at the table that with a bunch of other
[1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:05.840]  speakers and researchers, I suggested to Norio that I could look at the same facts that he's
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:08.960]  using and come up with a different scenario.
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:15.680]  I said, at that time, and this is about 20 years ago, I said, suppose in point of fact
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:23.320]  there is going to be an alien invasion, and it's not going to be a put up job by government,
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:31.200]  but let us assume for the moment that there is going to in fact be an alien invasion from
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:36.560]  somewhere out there, and that the people in power on this earth have known that for a
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:41.560]  long time, and are trying to prepare the human race for the human race.
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:45.720]  Well, if you look at all the movies and all the culture and three football-sized long
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:51.600]  things, hovering over Denton outside Dallas, I mean, my problem is I can't get the public
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:55.640]  to admit FEMA camps are real when it's in the Houston Chronicle, or that they're creating
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:00.240]  half human, half other animal creatures when I've got thousands of mainstream news articles.
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:05.800]  So, I mean, no doubt they're hyping it, they're pushing it, no doubt the elites believe it,
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:09.280]  no doubt we're a planet hurtling through space, it's just, it's wild.
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:14.120]  Wow, Jordan Maxwell, folks, really covering some interesting things here with us today.
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:18.360]  We're going to come back and talk to Jim, Mark, and a few other people on the other
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:25.120]  side in the final segment, and I know this, the stock market is certainly plunging, and
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:28.720]  they certainly are devaluing the dollar, and I can't even get the public to realize they're
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:32.680]  devaluing the dollar, and what it's going to mean once it finally implodes completely.
[1:42:32.680 --> 1:42:37.480]  So, that's why I don't ever try to tackle other things that are so esoteric.
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.840]  Well, go on the, go on my website, that's a deal on the homepage, because it's not going
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:42.840]  to be there very long.
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.360]  Jordan, stay there, we're going to come back, final segment, stay with me.
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:49.480]  We'll come back and plug that.

[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:05.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:08.880]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:13.360]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:14.360]  and mucous membranes.

[1:46:54.640 --> 1:47:05.360]  Well, time has really flown past us quickly.
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:11.840]  We covered the imploding dollar and the banks falling one by one by design as they inflate
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:16.920]  the currency more and devalue it to pay off the debts.
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:19.920]  Torton Maxwell, final segment, I'm on his website, TortonMaxwell.com.
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:20.920]  It's amazing.
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:28.160]  Yeah, I've never seen this particular Army War College official strategic studies released
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:29.160]  for the year.
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:37.880]  This is their battle plan, their prospectus, a world by 210, the world in 2010, a new order
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:42.000]  of nations with a, the world is a cake, and they're cutting it up.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:45.800]  It's very funny, and they're cutting you up in the process, and they'll just put an American
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:50.720]  flag on your face or tell you, oh, I'm, I'm Eric Prince from Blackwater.
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:55.760]  I'm a Christian, and the left hates him and thinks he's a Christian, and the right sees
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.440]  the left attacking him and thinks, oh, he must be a conservative, kind of like we call
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:03.760]  Barack Obama a communist, and the left sees that and loves it, meanwhile it horrifies conservatives.
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:08.360]  It's all about keeping you in your left-right false paradigm, but the people are breaking
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  out of that.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:12.800]  Let's take a few calls here in closing and then let him have some closing comments.
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:15.640]  Torton Maxwell, let's go to Jim in Los Angeles.
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:19.480]  You can bring up any subject you want Jim, I know you've been holding for a while.
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:21.000]  Go ahead Jim, you're on the air.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:22.640]  Oh, hey Alex, how you doing?
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:27.560]  I was just calling in regards to the fake bin Laden tapes that I know you've mentioned
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:28.560]  in the past.
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:32.200]  I actually, I work in the visual effects industry out here in Los Angeles.
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:33.800]  I'm not a producer or director.
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.160]  I'm actually on the computer making all the effects, and all I have to say is those videos
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:44.400]  are pretty horrible, and they're, I definitely think from my train to I, I definitely think
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:47.000]  that there is definitely some manipulation going on there.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.760]  Here the last one they put out that looked like, like something out of a video game.
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:54.280]  It was such a bad animation, and it was clearly an, it's an insult.
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:58.480]  I mean, they do that on purpose, kind of like they announced number two in Al Qaeda was killed
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:03.400]  14 times, and they always announced the next month he was killed again and never retract
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:04.400]  the last one.
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:08.200]  And for those that don't know, Wired Magazine had this big top special effects guy look
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:13.920]  at it, and the, the Intel Center that supposedly got the tape uploaded their logo in the same
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:20.200]  layer as the supposed Al Qaeda layer, and you've got this Adam Gadon guy who's connected
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:25.600]  into U.S. intelligence, who's American Al Qaeda, Jordan, why do they make the propaganda
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:26.600]  so obvious?
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:30.920]  I mean, is that to just throw it in our face or, or to kind of dull our senses?
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:36.080]  I think, I think it's just an in-house joke among the powerful people of the world.
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:40.800]  It's just an in-house joke that you can throw stuff in America's face and, and call them
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:45.040]  any name you want, play, play them for fools, and they, they love it.
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:47.960]  The Americans are so stupid, they'll buy anything.
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:49.160]  So I think that's what they did.
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:54.200]  I think they just, it's kind of like a bullfighter, you know, just marching up to the ball and
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:59.440]  getting the rep as close as possible, knowing that the ball could turn on you and kill you.
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:03.440]  But no, the ball is so stupid, you'll just sit there and look at the red flag, and then
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:08.240]  you'll put on a sword in his head, and so they're just playing us for fools.
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:10.840]  Man, Jordan, I'm going to steal that analogy.
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:11.840]  That is perfect.
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:12.840]  Exactly.
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:16.560]  They have the sword, you know, they stick a few barbs in our back, 9-11 throws a barb
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:21.640]  to get us enraged, and then, you know, Oklahoma City's another barb, and then the War on Drugs,
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:25.120]  which they're throwing the barb, and then we get all mad and crazy.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:28.640]  They start imploding the economy, and then they just hold out the red cape with a sword
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:33.840]  and then just skewer us for the New World Order oligarchy sitting in the, in the stands.
[1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:37.560]  And they know that they can do it because they've always done it, and we've always
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:39.560]  reacted the same way.
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:41.160]  We always react the same way.
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:46.000]  We're just surprised and shocked, and then we go on and out and do our shopping and watch
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:52.040]  basketball, and they know that now America's so far gone mentally and intellectually that
[1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:58.560]  they can say anything, do anything, present anything, and you know, anything at all, and
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:50:59.560]  America will buy it.
[1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:00.560]  Listen, listen.
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:01.560]  They'll buy it.
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:05.800]  I hardly ever, and I mean, Jim, I want you to finish your moments, but I have to admit,
[1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:10.520]  I bought a Beavis and Butthead CD at Best Buy like six months ago, because I don't watch
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:15.720]  a lot of TV, but I like to buy stuff I saw 10, 15 years ago, plus I know Mike Judge is
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:16.720]  a fan of the show.
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:20.080]  So I said, well, let me, let me, let me watch a Beavis and Butthead.
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:23.560]  So I'm on the treadmill today watching Beavis and Butthead, and I was watching Beavis and
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:27.000]  Butthead give a, give a class report.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:32.680]  And then I remember watching real class reports and then watching Miss South Carolina, and
[1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:37.240]  I realized that Beavis and Butthead's report, which was meant to be an example of low grade
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:42.320]  moron idiots, they were more eloquent and intelligent than the average person.
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:43.320]  I know.
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:44.720]  That's incredible.
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:48.280]  So I want to do a piece where I take Beavis and Butthead doing that report on the web
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:55.240]  and then compare it to Miss South Carolina and show how literally this is not a joke.
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.640]  Listen, Jim, we need people like you.
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:52:00.560]  You know, Mike Rivera is doing a great job as a special effects guy for loss.
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:02.640]  He's helping us analyze videos.
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:07.920]  He's, he's in Jason Burmes's upcoming film I'm making entitled Fabled Enemies.
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:12.520]  You need to make a YouTube video to use your name and just say, I'm a special effects guy.
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:15.160]  Here's examples and show people how it's a fraud.
[1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:16.560]  I mean, I've made videos like that.
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:20.040]  I'm not even a special effects guy showing people how it's a fake.
[1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:22.800]  But you know, some of them are fake computers and erasions.
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:26.000]  Others are a fat guy with the light turned down and the camera blurred.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.120]  As you know, but I mean, we need you to do that.
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:29.600]  We need you in the fight, Jim.
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:30.600]  Absolutely.
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:34.480]  And I couldn't agree with you more and that's why I've jumped in the fight and that's why
[1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:39.160]  you know, I've helped get, you know, you helped me wake up and then I've spread the message
[1:52:39.160 --> 1:52:41.440]  and I've gotten other people to wake up.
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:44.680]  And it, you know, I couldn't agree with both of you anymore that it's just a lot of the
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:45.680]  general public.
[1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:50.720]  Unfortunately, they just don't have, they just don't have the capacity to understand.
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:53.280]  And that goes along with what I do for a living.
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:56.920]  We step out of the movie theaters and I try to explain to people the stuff that they just
[1:52:56.920 --> 1:53:01.760]  saw that I just worked on and they don't understand that it was fake no matter how fantastical
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:05.320]  and unbelievable it is that we watched and it just sort of scratched the head and they
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:06.320]  don't get it.
[1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:10.400]  And then all I have to say is if you don't believe me, go look up on the internet.
[1:53:10.400 --> 1:53:15.760]  I know it's out there how they recreated Marlon Brando for the Superman movie that was out
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:16.760]  a couple of years ago.
[1:53:16.760 --> 1:53:17.760]  Right.
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:19.400]  How they recreated his face and made it work and made it work.
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:24.880]  Well, I mean, how did they show Kennedy 12, 14 years ago shake hands with Forrest Gump?
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:25.880]  That's it.
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:26.880]  Exactly.
[1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:27.880]  Right.
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:28.880]  I mean, whatever.
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:33.640]  That newest fake that came out six months ago, I mean, that is the, the same computer
[1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:38.160]  model that's even cheap that anybody can buy for like 10 grand or so last time I checked.
[1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:42.600]  And that's the model they use in films like Final Fantasy.
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:46.400]  I mean, it's that same model, you know, they only have like 10, 10 guys that it's one of
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:47.400]  them.
[1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:51.840]  Alex, you'd be surprised how many people in Hollywood over at Universal and especially
[1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:56.120]  Warner Brothers have called me, they're professionals working in the movies.
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:54:00.920]  They said, Jordan, we know what, what they're doing where we've been working on major, major
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:06.520]  movies, major television shows, people in the studios, they know what's going on.
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:07.520]  They know, they know.
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:08.920]  Well, I mean, yeah, I know a lot of folks in Hollywood.
[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:09.920]  So do you.
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:15.280]  You know, George Lewis, quite a few others, but the point is, is that you're absolutely
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:18.200]  right that, that, that they know this stuff.
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:22.880]  And by the way, our guests are so big, Bob Chapman last hour, Jordan Maxwell, who has
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:27.520]  comic books and movies with all this stuff in it, I mean, I don't want to, I mean, you,
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:31.240]  you've done stuff for Disney, everybody, and our guests are so big, we don't even have
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:35.120]  time to tell you how big our guest star folks, Jordan Maxwell.com.
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:36.120]  Final call for him.
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:37.120]  Benny.
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:38.120]  No, no.
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:41.680]  I just had another caller that goes, that was before Benny.
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:42.680]  You know what?
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:43.680]  I don't think we're going to go any more calls.
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:46.480]  I'm sorry to all the callers, but we're just out of time here.
[1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:49.240]  And now that I look at the clock and we've got four minutes left, I apologize, but that's
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.240]  it for calls.
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:54.600]  I mean, Jordan Maxwell, in closing, what can humanity do?
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:57.600]  Start questioning, start questioning the information that are being fed.
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:03.360]  I mean, what can we do to try to avert and get out of this global fascist dictatorship
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:04.360]  we're going into?
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:09.600]  Well, I think the, the, the scripture is, is the answer that where the Bible has Jesus
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:15.600]  saying, go into your inner chamber, talk to the spirit, talk to God, so to speak.
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:24.640]  It works, I believe that if we need to turn to our spiritual, you know, our spiritual
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:25.640]  beginning.
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:26.640]  Wavelength.
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:27.640]  Yes.
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:34.000]  And, and, and just turn off the television and just understand the entire thing was made
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:42.600]  for you to, to manipulate your thinking and stop buying into all the religious, silly
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:50.800]  nonsense, the fascist, Nazi stuff that's being promoted out there as religion and start
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:52.040]  using your head.
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:54.240]  Go to a library and read and study.
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  I get so many people asking me, well, what can you tell me about this?
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:00.080]  What can you tell me about that?
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:04.680]  And I'm saying, why don't you just go to the library and look up the subject yourself
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:06.040]  instead of coming to me?
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:07.040]  That's how I got it.
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:10.240]  I just spent my whole life reading and studying and researching.
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:11.240]  Absolutely.
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:12.240]  You can do it.
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:13.720]  You can just jam in one call.
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.680]  You got 30 seconds, Forrest.
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:16.680]  Forrest in California.
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:17.680]  Go ahead.
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:18.680]  Yes, sir.
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:24.240]  I can tell that you, Alex Jones and Jordan Maxwell are Americans who love this country
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:25.480]  very much.
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:31.880]  And I believe that through radio, we're actually creating a ritual where we understand the
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:37.640]  trouble that the nation's in and we're just putting forth all this like positive faith
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:40.640]  energy towards the USA being around for many more generations.
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:44.840]  Well, I hope that's the case, but I mean, you know, past energy or whatever, I'm just
[1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:49.440]  about getting people to realize how many times has government corporations lied to you?
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:51.480]  How many times have you been conned?
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:54.120]  And that's just the stuff you know about and it's getting worse.
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:55.120]  It's out of control.
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:57:00.960]  The last thing I would say as quickly is I've got a lot of information, stuff on the downloadables,
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:07.320]  all kinds of information on the links page, even on the home page.
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:11.600]  JordanMaxwell.com and Jordan, hopefully we can have you back up in the near future.
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:13.520]  Thank you for spending time with us on this Sunday.
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:14.520]  Jordan Maxwell.
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:15.520]  Thank you.

[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:18.520]  Ah!
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:19.520]  That was a crazy show.
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:22.160]  We're kind of, you know, getting into some of the wilder topics, getting people thinking
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:23.160]  outside of the box.
[1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:24.680]  That's always healthy.
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:28.920]  My new film, Truth Rising on 9-Eleven's An Inside Job, totally documented.
[1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:29.920]  Available at infowars.com.

[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.080]  Take care, folks.

[1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:13.080]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:15.640]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:18.760]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:19.760]  It is liquid.
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:20.760]  It is private.
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:22.260]  It owes no one.
[1:58:22.260 --> 1:58:26.800]  It cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[1:58:46.640 --> 1:58:51.280]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and
[1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:55.560]  the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil
[1:58:55.560 --> 1:58:57.080]  unrest and panic.
[1:58:57.080 --> 1:59:01.600]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:06.800]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:08.400]  of corn alone.
[1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:12.840]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[1:59:12.840 --> 1:59:18.000]  Paul Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 for a free catalog.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:22.840]  Larry Matlack, president of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6 that
[1:59:22.840 --> 1:59:28.120]  the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.
