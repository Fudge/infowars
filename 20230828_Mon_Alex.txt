[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.880]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.880]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWar and say, I don't know what's going
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.880]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight? You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:15.420]  In 1972, The Limits to Growth was published by the Club of Rome. The book suggested that
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.500]  swift human depopulation would save the planet. In 2018, The Limits to Growth co-author Dennis
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.500]  Meadows explained how we need to murder billions of people.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:39.220]  The planet can support something like a billion people, maybe two billion, depending on how
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.300]  much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have. If you want more liberty
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.420]  and more consumption, you have to have fewer people. Conversely, you can have more people.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.660]  We could even have 8 or 9 billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.900]  is smart. Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships. They're always stupid.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.780]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, we want to have freedom
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.300]  and we want to have a high sentence, so we're going to have a billion people. We're
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.140]  now at 7, so we have to get back down. I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow,
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.660]  and that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.300]  Overpopulation is a lie. With old-school sustainable farming and the end of big government,
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.660]  there is enough room on this planet for several billion. And while the Earth's
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.020]  climate does change, most of what we are seeing is contrived. The fires breaking out
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.660]  all across the world are being blamed on climate change, even though hundreds of
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.740]  arsonists have been caught starting them. Most recently, 79 people were arrested for
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.060]  starting fires in Greece. Direct energy weapons, or DEUs, are able to start fires
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.300]  from above and can utilize microwave technology to burn homes from within.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.380]  In 2013, the mainstream media reported that we were able to make rain and lightning.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.500]  I mean, lasers, really, to change the weather?
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.140]  By firing trillion-watt lasers, you rip apart the electrons, creating what are called ions,
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.660]  and these ions act like seeds, like dust particles, bringing down rain and even lightning.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.740]  This week in Michigan, residents reported a strange strobe-like lightning. The event
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.620]  was captured on weather radar, which showed a very unnatural-looking spiral.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.380]  That's some conspiracy theory shit right there.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.740]  Making it rain has been possible for decades, and we have come a long way since then.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.300]  With the high-frequency active auroral research program, known as HAARP, we can now create
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.940]  hurricanes. And we can control their direction with next-generation weather radar transmitters,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.580]  known as NEXRAD. By building up an electromagnetic charge and dispersing it underground
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.460]  as direct current VLF waves, or very low-frequency waves, the NEXRAD radar transmitters
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.820]  are able to trigger earthquakes. Earthquakes and explosives can trigger tsunamis.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.620]  These are the technologies that we know of, and that only leaves volcanoes and tornadoes.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.780]  Funded by Peter Thiel, AVE Tech Energy Corporation began work in 2012 on a device
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.660]  to produce a 130-foot-tall tornado. And a former US intelligence officer recently told
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.540]  State of the Nation that the US has already triggered a volcano. Climate change is not only
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.460]  a hoax, it's a depopulation program, and our entire government is going along with it.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.220]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Ries.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.780]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing,
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.180]  high-quality coffee has not been available. And that's because the prices went up too high
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.420]  for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.820]  that wanted to work with us. But now we have brought back the coffee, and it's even better
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.060]  from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated. It's powered by the company
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.980]  Minuteman Coffee. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.220]  that I have ever drank. It is game-changing. All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.580]  I know you're gonna be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.

[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.260]  the strongest. The amazing medium-roast wig of America. And finally, the best-tasting,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:59.700]  dark roast tip of the spear, now exclusively available at infowarsstore.com. Get your coffee now.
[00:05:59.897 --> 00:06:06.897]  Breaking through the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:41.897]  Well, my plate, ladies and gentlemen, is full. Like it's Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.
[00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:50.497]  Had a couple guests scheduled today, but we've rescheduled them for tomorrow so that we got
[00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:56.937]  time to cover all this incredible news and take your phone calls on this live Monday,
[00:06:56.937 --> 00:07:07.097]  August 28th, 2023 transmission. Well. Even the government of allies had to come out and admit
[00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:13.496]  that BlackRock that owned the power company did not update the power lines, did not cut
[00:07:13.496 --> 00:07:20.937]  back the trees and let the power on. And that's what burned down. But since then,
[00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:28.697]  we've learned even more. And the locals are calling it choreographed disaster or choreographed
[00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:35.177]  mass murder. I've been calling it administrative mass murder. And we have some of those locals
[00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:39.657]  coming on the show tomorrow, but they're too busy with disaster relief and helicopter
[00:07:39.657 --> 00:07:46.937]  missions to be on today. But if you watch the city council
[00:07:46.937 --> 00:07:53.496]  and county council meetings, it's like you're tuned into the show. The people are really awake.
[00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:59.897]  They're really informed. Democrats climate change blame game for a wildfire confronted by reality
[00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:10.537]  after Maui identifies the cause. Power lines. In all the video they default didn't follow with
[00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:18.057]  any other power district in the country does when 60 mile an hour winds hit.
[00:08:20.537 --> 00:08:27.097]  Turn the power off and when they subside, you turn it back on because it becomes a fire bomb.
[00:08:27.097 --> 00:08:31.577]  If you don't, that's why the power always goes out when a bad hurricane hits your town.
[00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:38.937]  Folks live in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia. They know that.
[00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:45.896]  People that don't don't understand that. The people in Hawaii, they get hit by high winds too.
[00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:53.817]  They get hit by typhoons and hurricanes. Whether it's hurricanes spin one way, typhoons
[00:08:53.817 --> 00:09:01.656]  spin the other. It's the same thing though. Though typhoons have been recorded going 200
[00:09:01.656 --> 00:09:09.177]  miles an hour. And the fastest of hurricanes ever been recorded going is 160 miles an hour.
[00:09:09.177 --> 00:09:18.457]  So typhoons are worse. This was a hurricane coming up under Hawaii with another storm coming
[00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:24.697]  down hitting it that caused this. And it's unbelievable now that we have the eyewitness
[00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:29.817]  reports and the police admitting that they were told to block the town off on both ends
[00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:35.337]  even though power lines were not yet even down on the main highway and where they finally did
[00:09:35.337 --> 00:09:40.297]  fall down, they were not blocking traffic. The locals have said, let's not blame the police.
[00:09:40.297 --> 00:09:45.577]  They were following orders. The police are very upset. They just were told to do this. What
[00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:50.537]  are we supposed to do? They don't know. They're not omnipresent. I'm still blaming them some,
[00:09:50.537 --> 00:09:53.737]  but who really needs to get in trouble is the people that gave those orders
[00:09:54.537 --> 00:10:00.137]  because they couldn't give them all that ineptly, that perfectly. And that's why.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:30.420]  The locals are calling it choreographed disaster. We've got some excerpts of some of what the locals are talking about now coming up. This is one of our top stories because not just because they're now estimating 1500 to 2000 children are missing. There's a cover up of that. It's a Rosetta Stone or really a keyhole we can look through.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:11:00.420]  And get a wider view of how the globalists plan to shut down civilization. And. Speaking of that. I said this three years ago, I said, when they give the pilots these covered shots and a large percentage of them start having heart attacks and dying.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:23.420]  Which they've now introduced regulations to do. And they're finally going to move completely to AI pilots. Sure enough, it's all a big push that a bunch of news articles them pushing that today. So we're going to be laying all of this out.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:33.420]  And that ties into a huge victory we've all had against tyranny that I want to talk about at the start of the next segment.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:48.420]  And I came in this morning. It's so important. I shot a special report that will be done towards the end of the show today that will also air that can go viral that can be chock full of all the video clips and documents and things because.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.420]  There's so many facets to this. We'll talk about it next segment, but.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:12.420]  Turns out three fact checking groups came out and attacked me. Ten days ago, eleven days ago, when I came out and said, I've talked to whistleblowers and they've been told middle of next month, they're going to start trying to phase in the covered restrictions again, starting with the new vaccine on the 15th of September.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:25.420]  And new mask mandates and new vaccine mandates to go to school or college and more closures of events. All of it began to happen the afternoon after I reported it.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.420]  I had no idea that I was. I got the info on Tuesday, didn't nail it down till Thursday since I was busy.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:42.420]  So I'd have been days ahead of it. Instead, I was right under the wire and then they opened up during the evening on all the channels, propagandizing the corporate media.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.420]  And it was everything I said was coming. Well, of course, it came right from the feds who were just a few days ahead of the public and to tell them it was coming.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:13:01.420]  So now we're in this paradox where they're admitting all this and schools have closed in New York and Texas and closed because of supposed COVID cases.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:13.420]  The mask are all coming back. They're talking about having to have the shots to be able to get into stores. Biden put forward 1.4 billion to come out with a new booster that just so happens to match this variant.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:22.420]  Now there's three more variants. And Biden talked to the press when he was in Nevada a few days ago. We'll play that clip coming up.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:31.420]  And he says, oh, yeah, this time it works and everybody needs to take it and it's going to protect you.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:39.420]  First time you fooled me, shame on you. Second time, shame on me. Well, they never fooled me when it came to this because I don't know how bad they were.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:55.420]  But a lot of the public's awake now is not going to put up with this. So they've had the CDC, the TSA and the Biden administration all come out and say Alex Jones is full of crap.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:04.420]  Nobody's trying to bring back COVID restrictions of any type. While they're very agency say, no, we're looking at bringing them back. And I have the articles.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:14.420]  So they want to be able to incrementally bring this out so that you never form opposition to it. Successful approximation.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:22.420]  We don't have a debate about it beforehand. They want to sneak up behind us. Well, I'm watching my six. I'm watching your six.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.420]  And you're watching my six as well. Together we're going to beat this. And they are royally pissed.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:37.420]  And I do need prayer because I'm not a macho guy. I do this because I have to. It's the right thing to do. I don't enjoy facing danger for no reason.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.420]  There's a big reason to do this, but this is the type of stuff we'll get them to go ahead and finally kill me or set me up or something.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.420]  So I do want to stay in the game. I need your prayers, please. Because we scored up together.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:15:00.420]  The audience of activists, you spreading the word Friday morning. And then them going viral. And then six hours later, they opened up with their propaganda campaign.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:11.420]  It was perfect timing. I mean, we hit a hole in one on that. We slammed their brains out, basically. I mean, we pile drove them politically.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:21.420]  And they are royal pissed. Royal pissed. So this is all God. I get no credit. It's all God.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.420]  It's like you don't get the credit either, but you care. You took action. God appreciates you. But it's God has to work through us. This is all God.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.420]  Because you don't get a hole in one. You don't have timing like this on yourself.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:39.420]  You might think this is us. It's delusional. It's God. But praise God. Devastating. Devastating.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:49.420]  I mean, it's like doing an uppercut and breaking somebody's jaw in three places. I mean, it is just, it is, we literally beat the living shit out of the New World Order politically.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.420]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's the day.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:16:05.420]  Coffee has not been available at Infowars.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:14.420]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us. But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.420]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best I have to offer available to you right now.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:25.420]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted. It smells amazing. And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:32.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available at Infowars.com exclusively.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:38.420]  Escape the Prison Planet light roast. Tastes great. It's the strong one. Really strong.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:44.420]  But these are all close second and thirds. Medium roast. Wake of America. Woo! That's what my go-to.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:50.420]  Dark roast. Tip of the Spirit tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong. Gives you that pep.

[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.420]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:10.420]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:23.420]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine. The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.420]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family. We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.

[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.420]  Silver Bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:58.420]  And while you're there get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:05.420]  In the early 1900s certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:13.420]  The surrounding communities began to get sick. Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.420]  To convert these gases into fluorescent acid. Still highly toxic but containable.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.420]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:32.420]  Lucky for them one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:41.420]  And by 1950 the US government began buying this toxic untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.420]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:52.420]  With the Alexa Pure Pro you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.420]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:05.410]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:49.330]  Alright folks, this is really hardcore information because it's proven truth that has devastated
[00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.290]  the enemy.
[00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:59.450]  And it'd be kind of like if you, to use a hunting analogy, shot a big old stag, a big old buck
[00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:07.290]  deer with an arrow and it shoots right through the stag and embeds in a hill a hundred yards
[00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:14.450]  away and you go and get that arrow and are able to use it again, it's got special value.
[00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:19.810]  But you know, this arrow hunts, this is a lucky arrow that you're able to get back.
[00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:25.210]  The secret of most arrows is bows are so high powered, you shoot through animals, wild hogs,
[00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.090]  you name it, you hardly ever find them.
[00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:37.210]  I once shot through a buffalo with a compound bow at 50, 60 yards, shot it side on, through
[00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.890]  the heart, through the lungs, ran about 20 feet, fell over dead, looked like a geyser
[00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:48.050]  of blood shooting up his nose, delicious meat by the way, he had it butchered, made
[00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.990]  it and couldn't find the arrow.
[00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.970]  One time I did shoot a buck at about a hundred yards and the arrow went right through
[00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.370]  it and it embedded in a hill about 50 yards away and I'm going off into hunting
[00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.370]  analogies and I apologize, I shouldn't be doing that, don't have time to hunt these
[00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:11.450]  days but they're going to continue to try to roll out these protocols but they
[00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:18.810]  don't want us resisting them while they do it so they gaslight us and say oh, nobody's
[00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.650]  trying to bring masks back, nobody's trying to make you take a shot when colleges
[00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.490]  all over the place are saying the masks are back on, hospitals all over the place,
[00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.610]  a bunch of elementary and middle schools are shutting down and Texas and New York
[00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:37.370]  and Arizona and a whole bunch of places.
[00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:49.130]  They've got grocery store chains and hospitals and all these other facilities as well as
[00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.770]  hotels saying no, employees, you've got to wear your mask.
[00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.330]  You're in callers a week ago saying oh, we just got told, now it's in the news,
[00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.330]  it's happening.
[00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:05.530]  So they flipped a light switch five hours after I talked about this on Friday and
[00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.210]  they didn't do that because of us, they had this all pre-planned, all pre-loaded
[00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.530]  weeks before, it's sent to the stations, they've already scripted it, they've already
[00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.490]  practiced it, that's why it was whether it was CBS or NBC or Fox, it was the exact
[00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.850]  same garbage, exact same order, exact same script.
[00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.410]  You've all seen the compilation videos where they do that.
[00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:33.090]  But here's the bad news and here's some footage that, this is Breitbart, not this,
[00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:39.810]  they're now in New York and places setting up the COVID systems again and the little
[00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.930]  cages around the hospitals so they can have people in hazmat gear out there doing their
[00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:49.030]  little theater dance telling you the hospital's overwhelmed and totally full while it's almost
[00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:54.170]  totally empty and the nurses and people are dancing around doing TikTok videos and
[00:23:54.170 --> 00:24:01.610]  then they're keeping families away from their beloved ones that are being murdered.
[00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:07.970]  So everything we saw three and a half years ago, they're trying again.
[00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:15.050]  But the good news is we came out and pointed it out, you pointed it out and so now it
[00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:22.450]  is a massive, massive, massive story and they're simultaneously trying to roll it out
[00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:27.810]  and get the sheep to get in line but they don't want to have another fight with us
[00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.890]  politically because we just won the last one.
[00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:36.210]  They know the courts are on our side now, the public's awake now to a great extent.
[00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:41.210]  So by stealth, quasi-stealth, they want to just roll it out in their blue cities,
[00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:47.170]  have their mind control victims going to the control but they don't want to stir up
[00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:52.770]  those of us that are awake so that we speak up and say no.
[00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.770]  That's the answer.
[00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.250]  When people bully you to wear a mask or bully you to take a shot, you need to politely
[00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.090]  but in a focused way get back in their face, educate them, which an employee call
[00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:07.330]  for a manager and make a big scene out of it.
[00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.610]  So let's go through some of these headlines.
[00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.850]  Conspiracy theorists spread false information about the return of COVID-19 mandate says
[00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:22.430]  the Associated Press and of course the AP has its director previously on the board
[00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.210]  of Pfizer.
[00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:29.010]  Same thing with the head of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer.
[00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.450]  They don't tell you that and they go on to attack me and say that there's no such
[00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:37.890]  announcement the TSA says that's coming.
[00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.650]  So see now we've cornered them because that did come from high level TSA.
[00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.890]  But now they don't want to give credibility to us saying it was coming because they
[00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.070]  want to be able to roll it out the way they want.
[00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.530]  They're having to then hold off on their plan.
[00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.370]  This is exactly how you stop them.
[00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.670]  This is the methodology of truth.
[00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.530]  It's the power of the whistleblower.
[00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.510]  It's the power of getting ahead of things.
[00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.330]  It's the power of realizing they're attacking us incrementally.
[00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:10.450]  So you've got to when they come out incrementally go A leads to Z and explain to people the
[00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:16.170]  compendium of the operation.
[00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:20.090]  And people have already been through this once so they know you're telling the truth.
[00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.210]  So they're like, oh, okay.
[00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.770]  They just said we should all wear a mask again.
[00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.250]  I bet they cancel school next.
[00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.810]  Oh, next day, cancel school.
[00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:27.810]  Oh, they cancel school.
[00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.210]  Next, they're going to say a new shots coming out.
[00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:40.730]  Oh, five days after I said they've been told that on the 15th of September, the TSA
[00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:47.450]  has the mask back on themselves and that Biden will then announce a new vaccine.
[00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.530]  That was not in the news then.
[00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:55.650]  Five days later, I guess six days later, it was Friday, we did it.
[00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.810]  Biden comes out and says, we've got a new vaccine that covers this.
[00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.930]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.490]  UMass Memorial reinstate staff mandates.
[00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:19.250]  After a dramatic increase in COVID cases, look at this, Biden administration eyes mid-September
[00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:27.010]  for new COVID-19 booster shot rollout that just broke on Friday, U.S. News and World Report.
[00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:33.230]  Talk about nailing it, yeah, because they were senior TSA managers in a meeting with
[00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:41.830]  their boss. You know where there's only like one manager per shift and they're all in there
[00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:47.750]  and they're talking to the boss on the Zoom? They didn't tell me what meeting software,
[00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.950]  but there they are telling hundreds of managers of 47,000 employees what they were about to
[00:27:52.950 --> 00:28:01.670]  do. That's exactly what they did. CDC denies COVID restrictions coming after bombshell
[00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.870]  Alex Jones explosive Biden lockdown plan.
[00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:17.649]  Again, CDC denies COVID restrictions coming after bombshell Alex Jones exclusive exposed
[00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:20.490]  Biden's lockdown plan.
[00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.810]  Biden to fund new COVID vaccine for everybody, whether they've gotten it before or not.
[00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.490]  But he says this time it works.
[00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.810]  We'll play the video when we come back.
[00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.050]  So they've got a real problem on their hands.
[00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.970]  This blew up in their face about as bad as it could.
[00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:44.530]  I give this about, I'll put you this way, we've never had something this successful to thwart
[00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.530]  the enemy.
[00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:50.490]  I mean, this is praise God and stuff.
[00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.530]  This is past the ammunition of the info war.
[00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.970]  But it wouldn't have happened if you wouldn't have spread the word folks, so you get the
[00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:56.810]  temporal credit.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:08.180]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:14.180]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:20.180]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:25.180]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:04.180]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.

[00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:07.330]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:22.879]  The year is 1995, and Infowars launches the last of America's counter globalist probes.
[00:33:22.879 --> 00:33:29.320]  In a freak mishap, Infowars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:36.200]  orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200]  later.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.560]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuance, or full spec says, where people are extremely
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.680]  lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.440]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.000]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.680]  and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.700]  that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed,
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.680]  it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.680]  Infowars.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.680]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.680]  Alright, so the reason the globalists want us off air, and that means this whole family
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.680]  of listeners and crew, is obedience to God.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.680]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.680]  The reason they want us off air is they don't want us challenging the narratives
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.680]  they roll out for their global deindustrialization collapse of civilization plan.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.680]  And that's why it's a life and death situation, that's why I'm so thankful to all of you
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.680]  for listening to me two Fridays ago, and getting that big story out,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.680]  and the enemy launched their operation that same day in the afternoon,
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.680]  and it just blew up in their face.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.680]  It absolutely blew up in their face.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.680]  And it's really hurt their global roll out of hysteria and fear,
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.680]  and they're still pushing for new lockdowns, and more masks, and force injections,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:17.680]  and new poison boosters, while they're saying it doesn't exist at the same time.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.680]  This is not going to work for them now.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.680]  So, I am extremely pleased, I'm extremely satisfied,
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.680]  but I wish somebody else would have broke this,
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.680]  because it's almost always us that's at the very tip of the spear,
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.680]  that's the game changer that brings in the new awareness,
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.680]  and that's what makes this job so dangerous.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.680]  And I don't say that to brag or try to sound important, the enemy knows that.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.680]  I want listeners to realize how important you are supporting this operation,
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.680]  because that's the way God's got it, that most of the time,
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.680]  other than like a Project Veritas, who's just incredible,
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.680]  you saw what they've been through, the feds, and the arrests, and the infiltrations,
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.680]  and we've got all the same crap going on here.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.680]  I just want you to know, we are doing some dangerous stuff here,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.680]  and I just appreciate you knowing that, and I don't want your thanks,
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.680]  I want your support, I need your support.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.680]  Use another military analogy, non-violently, as an analogy.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.680]  We can be a 2,000 pound cruise missile warhead,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.680]  with an armored tip on it, designed to go into some enemy bunker,
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.680]  and take out their general staff.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.680]  But if you don't have the fuel that's two-thirds of that missile,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:47.680]  it's not going to be able to fly the thousand miles and hit its target.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.680]  So what's more important, the warhead in the missile,
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.680]  the avionics in the missile, or the fuel?
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.680]  And the truth is, they're all just as important.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.680]  That's what I keep trying to hammer through people's brains,
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.680]  but you're not just the fuel when you support us,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.680]  you're the eyes and ears, you're the avionics,
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.680]  you're the ground tracking radar, you're the GPS,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.680]  and you're the explosive force on the ground to stand up,
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.680]  and to boycott, and to bicot, and to pray to God,
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.680]  and to vote, and to file lawsuits, and to educate your children right,
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.680]  and to grow good produce, and to help your neighbors,
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.680]  and a thousand other things.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.680]  You're the fuel, you're the avionics,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.680]  you're the explosive,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.680]  and really if you pull back you're not the missile at all.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.680]  You're the missile controller sitting thousands of miles away
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.680]  at their desk in control of the whole thing.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.680]  And I want that to sink in.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:14.680]  And I want you to recognize that if they go ahead
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.680]  and just flatten me for this, that that's okay,
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.680]  that'll be a big exclamation point on what we just did,
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.680]  because I don't think even the crew, or any of the listeners,
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.680]  even myself, get how big this was ten days ago.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.680]  I saw Steve Bannon call it the scoop of a lifetime.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.680]  Jack Posobick, a bunch of others, I was like, yeah it's big,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.680]  we knew it was already rolling out, okay our source is great,
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.680]  but it's the way they started denying it that just blew up even bigger,
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.680]  while they're like, yeah lockdowns are coming back,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.680]  COVID restrictions are coming back all over the news,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.680]  but they're crazy, none of it's coming back, just accepted.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.680]  It's so fundamental to steal the next election,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.680]  it's so fundamental for their global ID,
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.680]  it's so fundamental for their cash flow society,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.680]  it's so fundamental to control our bodies,
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.680]  that they just don't know
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680]  what to do.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.680]  They are in a full panic mode.
[00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:44.930]  So, it's not about a victory lap for everybody to say, oh, we did a great job.
[00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.529]  It's about, no, the enemy's not invincible.
[00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:48.529]  They're not all powerful.
[00:39:48.529 --> 00:39:53.069]  And I'll use another military analogy, World War II, radar was just getting invented.
[00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:57.569]  The British knew when German planes were coming, but Germany didn't really have radar
[00:39:57.569 --> 00:40:00.569]  and our aircraft didn't have radar.
[00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:09.450]  So they're flying in over Germany or Italy to drop bombs, the Army Air Corps.
[00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:10.990]  You know they would fly towards the flak.
[00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.990]  That's how you know you're over the target.
[00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.490]  And that's an old saying, you're getting the flak when you're over the target.
[00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:21.990]  But more importantly, they had spotters and the bombardier.
[00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:26.890]  Their job when targeting and looking at maps they had and trying to guide in by eye,
[00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.390]  let's harp the plane of what factories to hit or bridges to hit or things they're supposed
[00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:37.970]  to hit, was to mark down where they got big explosions.
[00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.490]  Even if the bomb missed, it might have created a huge explosion because really
[00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.730]  the Germans had stuff in another warehouse or maybe underground.
[00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.970]  And oh, we got a big explosion here, kick that again.
[00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.490]  That's obviously valuable.
[00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:57.690]  And so that's what we're doing here is we're like, this really blew up big, folks.
[00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.210]  I mean, big, spectacular explosion.
[00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:07.490]  And we need to circle back around a lot and hit this target again and again and
[00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.090]  again and again and again and again and again.
[00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:15.569]  Because again, if they can't roll out their propaganda and have us just react to
[00:41:15.569 --> 00:41:19.930]  it, I know for most listeners, you're like, Jones, we knew that before you were born.
[00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:21.610]  Will you quit?
[00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.130]  This show is not for those of you that know more than I do.
[00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.830]  I know there's a lot, you understand that?
[00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.049]  This show is for the general public that's tuning in.
[00:41:30.049 --> 00:41:34.410]  I want them to get it through their brain.
[00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:39.410]  Because if this show was just about entertainment, man, I got so many entertaining clips.
[00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:44.210]  I got the leftist trying to block the road to Burning Man and the police running them
[00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.210]  over.
[00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.170]  I could watch it all day.
[00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.170]  I got probably 30 clips just as good.
[00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.690]  Would listeners rather me just give you entertainment?
[00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:59.130]  Because I would enjoy the show more, quite frankly, if I just sat back and showed police
[00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.730]  because they wouldn't pull down the barricade, they jumped in front of the vehicle.
[00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.410]  So the police just went ahead and ran through it.
[00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:10.410]  And the point is, there's 20 miles of people backed up with their cars overheating and
[00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:16.009]  people basically about to die in the desert because of these terrorists.
[00:42:16.009 --> 00:42:18.049]  And this is how the police should act.
[00:42:18.049 --> 00:42:27.490]  But see, it's tribal police, so they don't have to be politically correct.
[00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:33.210]  So you know, I could just come back.
[00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.210]  Maybe I just come back for the whole show and just play fun clips.
[00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.569]  But I don't think you want me to do that.
[00:42:39.569 --> 00:42:40.569]  Because you want to win, right?
[00:42:40.569 --> 00:42:41.569]  You want to beat these people.
[00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:45.529]  We got to wargame this, we got to talk about how we beat them, we got to stop the
[00:42:46.529 --> 00:42:47.529]  next lockdown.
[00:42:47.529 --> 00:42:48.529]  And we know how to do it.
[00:42:48.529 --> 00:42:49.529]  We just had a major victory.
[00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:53.410]  So I'm going to get to these clips and finish up this hour on this, then I'll hit
[00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.410]  all the other news.
[00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:58.810]  Take your calls and more info wars.com to Mars this day.

[00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.290]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had
[00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:09.290]  gone down some.
[00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.569]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:19.250]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier

[00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:14.890]  What's better?
[00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.529]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep eggs?
[00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:21.009]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[00:44:21.009 --> 00:44:22.009]  people.
[00:44:22.009 --> 00:44:26.250]  So one person might like this coffee, other person likes that coffee.

[00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:00.430]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:04.750]  Yeah, they have control of the syntax, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.750]  Some of their operations are going to take decades to stop, but one thing you can do

[00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.950]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.630]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.910]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.230]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:35.190]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on
[00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:41.109]  top of that exclusively at info war store.com on the Alexa pure water filtration system
[00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:44.910]  in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.870]  Get it today and it flows the info war.
[00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:47.870]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:51.750]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.470]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:57.109]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:05.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:34.100]  All right, I've spent a lot of time on this the first hour, and I think rightfully so.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:40.100]  They were planning, and they already are doing it, to roll out their new incremental COVID lockdowns.
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:50.100]  They even said, with different universities and public schools, just 14 days to flatten the curve.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.100]  You say, why would they use the same fake script again?
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.100]  This is the same fake script again because it worked for a while last time.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.100]  And they want mail-in ballots again next year.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.100]  People say, wow, they're going to push it all the way to next year?
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.100]  They pushed it over two years before, this is just less than a year.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.100]  The mail-in ballots are going to go out in September and October.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.100]  And they've got all these federal purchase orders after I covered this,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.100]  that literally came out a few days after we broke it, saying, oh, guess what?
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:42.100]  Middle of September, all these federal agencies need millions and millions of dollars apiece in PPE, in the mask, in the sanitizer, in all of it.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.100]  Yes, it's going on.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.100]  And again, we are having a debate about it up front saying, no thank you.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.100]  No thank you.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.100]  It'd be like if you didn't want to go to Pedo Run Disney World,
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:06.100]  and you live out in California and your wife gets you and the kids in the car and says, I have a surprise for you for your, say, 40th birthday.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.100]  You're like, okay, what are you going to a steakhouse or what are we doing?
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.100]  Are we going to the Redwoods?
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.100]  Your wife says, you'll see.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.100]  So you drive out of L.A. and you drive out toward, and all of a sudden you get closer to Disneyland.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.100]  You're on the highway and you go, we're not going to Disneyland, are we?
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.100]  Oh, no, no, we're not going to Disneyland.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:26.100]  But she knows the kids are going to go once you get in the parking lot.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:39.100]  And then once you get to the parking lot, dad's going to go, okay, I'll go and watch the bearded men dressed in princess outfits across my daughters.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:52.100]  Now that's a good analogy because my wife hates the system, but she still feels like, well, our six-year-old, you know, it's a rite of passage to go to Disney World, Disneyland.
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.100]  I'm like, no, it's not.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.100]  Over my dead body, we're never going.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.100]  And she's like, I guess you're right.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.100]  But there's still this thing.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:05.100]  So let's go back to the COVID shots or the lockdowns or the mask or any of it.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:13.100]  They want to get us in the car and get us there before we have a debate about where we're going.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:25.100]  Instead, I don't really snoop around, but if I, you know, got on the computer and saw the history and it said Disneyland and I saw tickets were bought, I'd be like, we're not going to Disneyland.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:33.100]  In fact, I got on about six months ago on our desktop in the bedroom and Disneyland was pulled up.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.100]  This is a true story.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.100]  And I walked out there and talked to my wife and I said, we're not going to Disney World.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.100]  She said, well, I just know we're going to Florida on a business trip.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.100]  And I figured, I know it's all liberal, but, you know, we still have some fun.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.100]  What, stand in line all day and fund something?
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.100]  No, we're not going.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.100]  But see, that's called getting ahead of it.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:59.100]  So we caught the wife with the Disneyland brochures and the Disneyland tickets.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.100]  And we're saying we're not going.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.100]  And she's saying, or maybe the husband did end up blaming women.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.100]  It's an allegory.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.100]  It's an analogy.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.100]  She's like, okay, we're not going to Disneyland, but she has tickets.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.100]  But it would sure be a fun place to go.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:26.100]  But, you know, but we are putting masks on and we do have a new shot and we are locking things down and we had told the corporations to get ready for new lockdowns this winter.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.100]  But nobody wants you to, there's no COVID changes, okay?
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:42.100]  Now Biden just, you know, signed a deal for 1.4 billion new shots and the government's buying up all the emergency gear and, you know, it's perfect timing for an election, but it's not really going on.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.100]  What is Disneyland, Disney World doing on the computer?
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.100]  So I don't really look at the history.
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.100]  I popped it open and it was just right there.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:01.100]  And of course I had like a heart attack because literally you could torture me taking me to Disney World.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:06.100]  When I was like 10 years old, my parents go, oh, let's go to Florida and let's go to Disney World.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.100]  I hated it then.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]  Two hours to ride a roller coaster?
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.100]  I'd go to Six Flags and wait 30 minutes and ride one.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.100]  That's still too long.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.100]  Two hours to ride Magic Mountain?
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.100]  No.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.100]  It sucks.
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.100]  You had a bunch of fat dudes in dresses running around.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.100]  You might as well put me in a firing squad, but at least that won't kill you.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:34.100]  What is a firing squad is these shots and this medical tearing.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:46.520]  So, because I mentioned it, let's play a clip of Biden three years ago saying you'll
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:53.020]  never have to take a shot again because one shot protects you, and then let's play his
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:58.940]  latest clip from Friday where he comes over to the press, here it is.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:04.180]  The various shots that people are getting now cover that.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.180]  You're okay.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:09.140]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:16.310]  Mr. President, can you say anything about the uptick of COVID cases and the new variant?
[00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:31.310]  Yes, I can. As a matter of fact, I signed off this morning in a proposal we have to present to the Congress a request for additional funding for a new vaccine that is not necessary, that works.
[00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:42.310]  And tentatively, not decided finally yet, tentatively, it is recommended that, we would like to be recommended that everybody get it, no matter what they got before.
[00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:52.310]  So I know he's babbling and it's hard to understand him, but he said, this time it works and everybody should get it. Oh, and it's going to be free again.
[00:53:52.310 --> 00:54:02.310]  Really, they made 80 million at Pfizer alone last time, and over half that was the U.S. morons taking it.
[00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:16.310]  So to do the math, only 1.4 billion? No, most of these are being mandated. And last time I checked, a Moderna shot is 100 bucks, and a Pfizer shot is like 80 bucks.
[00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:30.310]  Guys, look up how much one of these shots is now. So, if the shots cost 80, 90 billion dollars, then how are we going to get them for 1.4 billion?
[00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:37.310]  Even if you want to take the poison? And the answer is no, it's the bonanza off of the insurance companies.
[00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:47.310]  Look, it just goes on and on. I could talk for 10 hours about this. Republicans in nine Florida counties adopt resolution calling for ban on COVID vaccines. That's good news.
[00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:56.310]  I'm going to revisit this after I hit the other news, but I didn't get so prepared for this show. I got really prepared for this broadcast.
[00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:07.310]  So, we're going to get everything else when we come back and start the next hour, including how they're planning to have A.I. take over the airlines, the latest on Trump.
[00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:16.310]  They're trying to disqualify him. We knew this was coming in New Hampshire and in Florida. The Democrats are talking about election meddling. This is the next level.
[00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:27.310]  We're also going to get into now they're blaming climate change for the Mali fire, but even the government now admits it was the power lines and the fault of Black Rock.
[00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:42.310]  Also, they've arrested 79 people in Greece. The government says the major fires were caused by leftists who were out burning everything down, who were in the country with a cover story of being at an environmental conference.
[00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:53.310]  Remember that. Anywhere you have a smart conference, one of these U.N. sponsored deals, by night in high wind, they burn you down. By day, they drink alcohol and have sex.
[00:55:53.310 --> 00:56:06.310]  And people are already tracking this, so that's good news. So, these are armies of terrorists. They don't just block highways, folks. They don't just try to teach your son to have his penis cut off.
[00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:09.310]  They want to destroy everything, and they will if we let them.
[00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:16.310]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:21.310]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation of 360 Wind.
[00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:37.310]  Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere, jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, that battles cancer, you name it.
[00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:42.310]  I mean, it's just so amazing. God gave it to us, and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:51.310]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid. Most brands are 5% curcumin, and that still does a great thing for you.
[00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:58.310]  This is the strongest anybody makes, 95% curcuminoid. Look at this on the table.
[00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:08.310]  Overhead shot, please. Look at all these babies. You take a couple of these a day, it's a multi-month supply, and you are in like Flynn.
[00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:20.310]  No additives, no garbage, just turbocharged 95% curcuminoid with a couple of other key amino acids that are known to supercharge it and upload it to your body.
[00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:27.310]  I am so glad this is back. I have been out of this myself for months. We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:36.310]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula, back in stock, 25% off, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:44.310]  And by the way, that flash sale on X3, Environmental Fusion, it ends today. It really is selling out. We'll be right back. Please stay with us.
[00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:53.970]  Coffee has not been available at Infowarsstore.com for two years because the price went up too
[00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:59.049]  high and the quality was starting to go down. I turned out so many other producers that
[00:57:59.049 --> 00:58:02.610]  wanted to partner with us. But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I
[00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:07.170]  began to try their coffees, I was blown away. We finally have three great coffees that
[00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:11.110]  are the best they have to offer available to you right now. This is the best coffee
[00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:15.690]  I've ever tasted. It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever
[00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:21.170]  drank. Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available
[00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:27.130]  at Infowarsstore.com exclusively. Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast. Tastes great, it's

[00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:36.009]  Roast, Wake of America. Whoo! That's what my go to. Dark Roast, Tip of the Spear
[00:58:36.009 --> 00:58:40.770]  tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.
[00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:45.650]  They're all three available at Infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation and each order
[00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.730]  gets a pocket Constitution Citizen rule book.
[00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:55.650]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock. With the
[00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:59.410]  supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get
[00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:05.370]  the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock. But now
[00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:09.089]  we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab. We've got a limited
[00:59:09.089 --> 00:59:12.330]  shipment. Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future. But if you want to
[00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:18.529]  experience and have in your medicine cabin, have in your preparedness arsenal, high
[00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:22.089]  quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer, we have it right now

[00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:56.569]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:17.730]  By the way, folks, there's no doubt that COVID is going back around. It is a
[01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:21.770]  synthetic nanotech attacking people. I've been tested twice for it. Suppose you
[01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:25.770]  don't have it, but I've been around 49 years and I barely ever get sick.
[01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:30.170]  But every three, four years, I know what it feels like. And this is what
[01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:33.170]  it felt like when I had it two years ago. But I'm almost through it
[01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:37.490]  taking ivermectin and the great products at Infowarslife.com as well.
[01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:42.650]  But Infowarsstore.com. But man, I tell you, it is just it is just crazy
[01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.690]  time to be alive here. So I appreciate folks putting up with the
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:50.609]  fact that my voice is shot and I want to cough all the time. But I
[01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:53.569]  didn't just go out with the globalists said about COVID coming
[01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:57.250]  back. And their answer to it is to make it worse with the shots and
[01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:01.850]  blocking therapeutics. It's that I talked to the medical doctors, I
[01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:03.850]  talked to the clinic owners, I talked to them, we had Dr.
[01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:11.210]  Estella Emanuel on right before we broke all this news. And no,
[01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:18.090]  she is seeing it at her major clinics in Houston. So a lot goes
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:21.609]  into it. They give us the injections and mutates it. It
[01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:24.890]  creates all these other viruses, it lowers our immunity, that
[01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:28.009]  other viruses can attack us. And I want to be clear. Some
[01:01:28.009 --> 01:01:30.690]  people say COVID doesn't exist. It's all fake. It's never
[01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.330]  been isolated. I'm not attacking those folks. It's just
[01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:40.290]  not true. It's 100% real. It's a nanotech. And if you have the
[01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:42.850]  proper things up front, you can deal with it and mitigate
[01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:46.370]  it. And it's much better to get it naturally. And your body
[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:50.170]  does create some immunity to it. The shot obviously gives it
[01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.609]  to you makes your body produce it. And it's absolutely
[01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:57.609]  horrible. But it's real. I mean, let me tell you, I mean,
[01:01:57.609 --> 01:02:00.410]  I'm getting the flu or some I just ignore it. It's I mean,
[01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:06.730]  I might get really sick every 10 years. And I got COVID. After
[01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:11.529]  it almost killed my dad and Rob do. And we almost killed. I
[01:02:11.529 --> 01:02:17.930]  got it taken care of. And my wife's like, wow, you really
[01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:20.690]  are sick. What are you doing at 3am walking around the
[01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:24.490]  neighborhood? And I said, Well, I can't breathe. And I
[01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:26.810]  was starting to take me that's not I was feeling a lot
[01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:28.330]  better, but I still couldn't breathe in the middle of
[01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:31.290]  night. And I said, if you had this, you'd panic when I go to
[01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.090]  the hospital. I said, I've never felt like this. It feels
[01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:36.850]  like I'm literally, you know, I did a little bit of wrestling
[01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.049]  growing up. I've been in a few fights, the guy starts
[01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:41.490]  choking you, you feel that that that's what it felt like.
[01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:45.090]  I said, I get why people are panicking. This is really a
[01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.330]  psychological weapon, because it's not causing real damage
[01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.009]  to your tissue. It's causing inflammation, like the
[01:02:50.009 --> 01:02:53.049]  Spanish flu did. I'm not a doctor, I've just
[01:02:53.049 --> 01:02:55.930]  interviewed a bunch of them. So they explain. And
[01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:58.970]  she's like, wow, and then she got it right after I had it. And
[01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:01.850]  she was like, I want to go to the hospital. She's in great
[01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.250]  shape. You can run 10 miles out the front door can lift
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.650]  weights for two hours, like a gorilla. I mean, it's like
[01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.450]  female Arnold Schwarzenegger. And she was like, I can't
[01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:13.130]  breathe. It's acid. Don't worry. I got me that's tonight.
[01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.810]  I got ever make it's a lot better than she got better like
[01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.850]  in four or five days. But she was like, I want to the
[01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:21.009]  hospital right now. I can't breathe. I came on one day and
[01:03:21.009 --> 01:03:23.609]  I was like, I told you, you get it. This is what it's
[01:03:23.609 --> 01:03:26.490]  like you just got to chill out. Because if they put a
[01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:31.730]  tube down your throat, that makes inflammation even worse
[01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:34.730]  and you die. It's not that you're not getting oxygen.
[01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:38.850]  It's that your body is going into an anaphylactic shock.
[01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:44.970]  And so I know what it feels like. Doesn't matter. I took
[01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:47.690]  two antigen tests and they said I didn't have it. This
[01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:51.210]  is some spin off of this crap. And now they've got all
[01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:54.569]  these new super viruses. Oh, they're also horrible. And
[01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.450]  we got to get pregnant women this shot for RSV and all of
[01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.330]  it. Until five years ago, you never gave a pregnant
[01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.529]  woman any shot everybody knew it caused an autoimmune
[01:04:03.529 --> 01:04:09.210]  disorder, bare minimum in the baby, or the mother, or
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:12.330]  caused a spontaneous miscarriage. So they're just
[01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.210]  messing with us, folks. They're jacking with us. But
[01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:20.410]  listen, when I said get ready and beef up your body's
[01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:22.810]  natural defenses and drink pure water and get sunshine
[01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:27.330]  and take a lot of vitamins and minerals. And if you
[01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.290]  don't want to get sick, do stay away from crowds.
[01:04:30.529 --> 01:04:33.609]  Masks, I don't care if it's M 95. It's not doing
[01:04:33.609 --> 01:04:38.609]  jack diddly squad. You have to wear a spacesuit and
[01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:42.730]  then go into ultraviolet radiation for 30 minutes. And
[01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.290]  then get out and shower your body not to get a virus
[01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:47.529]  like this. It's so small. Okay. Now if you've got
[01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.890]  ultraviolet decontamination center, and you've got a
[01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:53.529]  full space suit, then by all means wear it. You're
[01:04:53.529 --> 01:04:56.970]  not going to get this. But wearing a mask is like
[01:04:58.009 --> 01:05:02.970]  saying a cyclone fence. Omega three fatty acids are
[01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.450]  needed for optimal strength. And they can only be
[01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:09.890]  obtained through diet. They can be found in grass
[01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:13.170]  fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying
[01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:16.450]  to ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are
[01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:20.650]  arguably the best source of omega threes. But the
[01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.930]  problem today is finding fish without a high mercury

[01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.410]  The worst health crisis we're facing in more
[01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:06.049]  than a century. Don't tell your supporters don't
[01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:09.690]  be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of
[01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:10.130]  COVID.
[01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:33.370]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID. I just want
[01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:36.090]  to say they gave me Regeneron. We have
[01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.490]  hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about
[01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:40.730]  ready. And if you're in the hospital and you're
[01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:43.130]  feeling really bad, we're going to work it so that
[01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:44.690]  you get them and you're going to get them free.
[01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:46.890]  And especially if you're a senior, we're going to
[01:06:46.890 --> 01:07:02.690]  get everyone should be afraid of COVID. Everyone
[01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:05.250]  should be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be
[01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:13.569]  afraid of COVID. Is there no one who can tell
[01:07:13.569 --> 01:07:14.649]  them don't do this?
[01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:25.770]  All right, I want to be 100% clear with
[01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:28.730]  listeners. This is my best thinking. I'm gonna
[01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:31.730]  open the phones up on this topic of COVID of
[01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.970]  the attempts to lock down again of them trying
[01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:36.690]  to come out and say, Oh, Jones is lying. There's
[01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:39.250]  no plans for new COVID restrictions, even though
[01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:40.810]  they announced them right after we broke the
[01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:43.850]  news. Until Big Tree has talked to his
[01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:46.050]  investigative reporters, they've confirmed the
[01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:49.569]  feds were and are planning this. And he's very
[01:07:49.569 --> 01:07:51.850]  credible. So of course, my sources are credible
[01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:55.090]  as well. That's our whole point is being
[01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:56.970]  credible. Why in the hell would I come out here
[01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.330]  with an announcement that wasn't going to come
[01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:03.170]  true? I said by me doing this, if we stop
[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:07.170]  it, I'll be attacked and demonized fine. You're
[01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:08.649]  smart enough to figure out we stopped it
[01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:11.649]  together. But I had no idea I thought we might
[01:08:11.649 --> 01:08:14.170]  stop it because of public outrage. And then
[01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:15.850]  they just wouldn't roll it out. No, they
[01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.610]  began to roll it out right after we made the
[01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:21.570]  announcement. Got huge backlash. And now go,
[01:08:21.570 --> 01:08:24.210]  okay, we were never planning any of this. But
[01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:26.130]  we do need you to wear a mask and take a
[01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:29.010]  shot. And we should shut down public events. And
[01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:30.330]  the colleges are going to make you take a
[01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:33.130]  shot. And so is your job, which is the COVID
[01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:38.850]  restrictions. So seeing them try to clean this
[01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:41.650]  up is incredible. So I want to open the phones
[01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.330]  up, intersperse all this other news on what
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.690]  do you think of the new tyranny they're
[01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:49.290]  rolling out? What do you make of how they're
[01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.769]  badly coordinated? And what do you really make
[01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:55.690]  of COVID? Because listen, if you think
[01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:59.130]  directed energy weapons fried Maui, you have a
[01:08:59.130 --> 01:09:01.850]  right to believe that because they exist. And
[01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.210]  this government so hijacked, and has run so
[01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:06.690]  many weather wars operations against us, that
[01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:08.889]  indeed they do have those. And it turns out
[01:09:08.889 --> 01:09:11.130]  the second largest base in the world of
[01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:14.130]  directed energy weapons the US has is Maui.
[01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:19.769]  That's where the C-130s and DC-10s with high
[01:09:19.769 --> 01:09:22.490]  powered chemical lasers that could fly around
[01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.330]  and burn down a town in a matter of minutes
[01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:25.730]  are based.
[01:09:28.809 --> 01:09:32.690]  But see, I don't need to blame that because I
[01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:34.769]  have them admitting BlackRock owned the power
[01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:37.210]  company for five years, didn't cut the trees,
[01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.410]  didn't cut the power when they were told to
[01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.730]  and cut the water through an Obama
[01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:43.690]  appointee, and didn't turn the emergency
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:47.130]  sirens on and ordered the police to block each
[01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:49.050]  ends of the town so they'd all burn to
[01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:52.210]  death. So there'd be nobody to stand up for
[01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:55.530]  their property, whole families annihilated. And
[01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:58.050]  the locals get it. But that's part of a
[01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.530]  debate. We know the official story is not
[01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.010]  true. I've not seen evidence of a space
[01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.410]  laser. The stuff I saw saying it was a
[01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.010]  space laser was
[01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:11.290]  SpaceX launches.
[01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.690]  They didn't show a time lapse of it looks
[01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:20.490]  like a laser. But I have the video of the
[01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.170]  power lines falling down in line with the
[01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.889]  town burning it down and BlackRock owned it
[01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:28.570]  and did it and has been trying to buy the
[01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:31.330]  town up. And somebody hacked the power
[01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:35.250]  poles in the weeks before with axes so
[01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:42.010]  they'd fall. So I don't believe they had
[01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:43.769]  the Air Force flying around with space
[01:10:43.769 --> 01:10:48.809]  lasers or direct energy weapons. Those
[01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:52.370]  But they will exist soon in a form it
[01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:53.690]  didn't exist. And that's drone
[01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:57.250]  controlled. Ai control where one person
[01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:00.010]  in the Pentagon, the chairman of the
[01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.889]  Joint Chiefs, can give an order to an
[01:11:02.889 --> 01:11:05.889]  army of aircraft outside of human
[01:11:05.889 --> 01:11:08.370]  control with no record they did it. And
[01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:09.769]  then the computers would erase their
[01:11:09.769 --> 01:11:11.769]  operational plan once they were done
[01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:16.490]  in an army, an Air Force, squadron upon
[01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:20.450]  squadron. 100 squadrons. They have 100
[01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:24.450]  squadrons of predator drones alone. I
[01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:25.610]  don't know if they have 20,000 of
[01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:29.170]  them. How many squadrons is that? They
[01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:32.250]  can mount with lasers that take off
[01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:36.330]  under one man's order, or they
[01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:40.170]  malfunction on their own. So I'm not
[01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.570]  saying Ai direct energy weapons are
[01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:44.850]  important. I'm saying when you have
[01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.130]  the video of the power lines falling,
[01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.050]  and the transformers blowing up, and
[01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:50.809]  the police blockading the town, and
[01:11:50.809 --> 01:11:53.290]  the water not being delivered, and
[01:11:53.290 --> 01:12:00.769]  being deliberately turned off. You
[01:12:00.769 --> 01:12:03.370]  gotta go with what's admitted. And
[01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:05.370]  that burns the global assist as bad
[01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:07.530]  as it was space lasers. Now, here's
[01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:09.850]  why direct energy weapons, and if
[01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:10.889]  you're actually burning a town down,
[01:12:10.889 --> 01:12:11.850]  it wouldn't be from space because
[01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.370]  that takes a more powerful laser to
[01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:14.610]  shoot into the atmosphere. You do
[01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:20.170]  it close up. The reason direct
[01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:24.450]  energy weapons are so good is you
[01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:26.769]  don't have to have BlackRock not
[01:12:26.769 --> 01:12:28.690]  trim the trees for five years, and
[01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:30.450]  cut the water off and cut the
[01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:34.130]  sirens off, which they did do,
[01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:36.170]  which caused the fire. You can
[01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:37.850]  just fly in in high winds and
[01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:39.410]  zap a few key points, and it
[01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:43.730]  does burn down. So I'm not saying
[01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:46.170]  it's not a real threat. I'm not
[01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:47.769]  saying it's not something we
[01:12:47.769 --> 01:12:49.330]  should be looking at very, very
[01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.730]  closely. It's a real thing. And
[01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:53.930]  I got something special for you
[01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:55.889]  today after we take some calls.
[01:12:57.769 --> 01:13:03.090]  See this? Weather and climate
[01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:08.570]  modification. This is from the
[01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:18.410]  US government in 1965. And when
[01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:23.610]  you read this, they say we can
[01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:26.170]  modify the environment to make
[01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:27.450]  people accept environmental
[01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:30.250]  rules. They describe exactly what
[01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:33.970]  they're doing. So yes, I don't
[01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.889]  poopoo anybody that wants to
[01:13:35.889 --> 01:13:37.010]  say this is direct energy
[01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:41.130]  weapons. But when we have them
[01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:43.570]  with the power lines falling
[01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:44.769]  down with the juice still left
[01:13:44.769 --> 01:13:47.650]  on and BlackRock owns them, and
[01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:48.650]  they wouldn't deliver the water
[01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:49.850]  and they turned off the sirens
[01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:51.650]  and they blocked the people in
[01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.490]  and they diverted the fire
[01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:56.010]  department north of the hills to
[01:13:56.010 --> 01:14:00.370]  non threatening fires. It's a
[01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:02.930]  choreographed operation, in my
[01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:05.250]  view, as the locals are now
[01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:09.530]  saying. And it's a microcosm of
[01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.809]  everything else we're facing. So
[01:14:11.809 --> 01:14:14.130]  I will not disregard the power
[01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:17.010]  lines down and the proof that
[01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:19.050]  shows they did just because
[01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:22.889]  there's the possibility it could
[01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:24.210]  have been something else. As
[01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.410]  soon as I see evidence of that,
[01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.769]  fine. But we know who on the
[01:14:28.769 --> 01:14:30.730]  power lines, BlackRock, we know
[01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:37.650]  who did it. So that's why I'm
[01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:41.250]  saying in this case, direct
[01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.210]  energy weapons are a distraction
[01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:45.250]  from we have them red handed.
[01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.650]  The toll free number to join
[01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:53.650]  us is 877-789-2539. 877-789
[01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:57.770]  Alex, 877-789-2539. We're
[01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.809]  talking about the new COVID
[01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:02.210]  protocols that have been rolled
[01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:05.210]  out and they're gaslighting
[01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.889]  saying it's not happening. Alex
[01:15:06.889 --> 01:15:09.210]  Jones is crazy. That's how they
[01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:09.969]  grabbed the victory from the
[01:15:09.969 --> 01:15:11.809]  jaws of defeat. And what you
[01:15:11.809 --> 01:15:12.809]  expect them to do next and
[01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:13.730]  what you think we should do
[01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:15.610]  next to counter them and what
[01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:17.410]  you think of O'Biden's new
[01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:18.809]  shot that quote is going to
[01:15:18.809 --> 01:15:22.490]  protect you from the quote new
[01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:23.570]  variant that they have
[01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:27.250]  magically ready. 877-789-2539.
[01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:30.530]  Your phone calls are straight
[01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:33.889]  ahead. Then AI taking over
[01:15:33.889 --> 01:15:36.010]  airline pilots, latest on the
[01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:39.130]  Trump attacks, the climate
[01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:40.690]  change power grab, Greece
[01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:42.690]  caught. Oh, this should have
[01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:44.570]  been my top story. Wow, the
[01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:45.969]  Greece, the government of
[01:15:45.969 --> 01:15:48.969]  Greece caught 79 leftists. They
[01:15:48.969 --> 01:15:50.010]  even say it's leftists,
[01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.650]  environmentalists setting the
[01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:52.850]  fires. They're doing it
[01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:54.210]  everywhere, folks. And they
[01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:55.210]  use the cover of
[01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.290]  environmental conferences to
[01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:57.050]  come to your town and burn
[01:15:57.050 --> 01:16:01.370]  yourself. Omega-3 fatty
[01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:03.770]  acids are needed for optimal
[01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:05.690]  strength. And they can only
[01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:08.130]  be obtained through diet. They
[01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.610]  can be found in grass fed
[01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:10.969]  beef, which is why the
[01:16:10.969 --> 01:16:13.050]  ruling class is trying to ban
[01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.770]  it. And they can be found in
[01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.930]  fish, which are arguably the
[01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.969]  best source of Omega-3s. But
[01:16:19.969 --> 01:16:21.570]  the problem today is finding

[01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.570]  order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:25.170]  Welcome back to this live
[01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:27.210]  Monday, August 28, 2023
[01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:29.090]  transmission. I'm your host
[01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.010]  Alex Jones. I'm your TV
[01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:32.050]  viewer. Here's what we're
[01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:33.330]  going to be covering next
[01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:33.969]  segment. I'm gonna go to
[01:20:33.969 --> 01:20:35.490]  your calls right now. I'm
[01:20:35.490 --> 01:20:36.290]  gonna hit this story when we
[01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:37.250]  come back and then go right
[01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.170]  back to your calls. Greece
[01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:41.930]  wildfires, 79 people arrested
[01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:45.889]  for arson, BBC. Here's
[01:20:45.889 --> 01:20:46.610]  another one. Greek
[01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:47.650]  authorities are a seven and
[01:20:47.650 --> 01:20:49.770]  arson is scum in connection
[01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:54.330]  with devastating wildfires and
[01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:56.730]  it goes on. You don't just
[01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:58.250]  think they go block roads
[01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:59.450]  and block cars and block
[01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:01.370]  factories. No, when the high
[01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:02.370]  winds are blowing, they get
[01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:04.130]  their order and they go out
[01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:05.170]  and they start burning stuff
[01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.050]  down. We're going to cover
[01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:08.410]  that next segment, but I'm
[01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:08.969]  gonna get to some of your
[01:21:08.969 --> 01:21:11.090]  calls as promised right now.
[01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:13.330]  We have John Kerry saying now
[01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:14.690]  humanity is inexorably
[01:21:14.690 --> 01:21:16.370]  threatened by humanity itself,
[01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:17.410]  which he's telling you the
[01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:18.290]  truth. We're threatened by
[01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.170]  him. They finance the big
[01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:22.370]  oil companies fund the green
[01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:24.370]  movement. I'll explain it all
[01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:26.530]  coming up. This is a total
[01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:29.650]  takeover. They've got us by
[01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:30.930]  the huevos folks, but we
[01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:35.570]  can defeat them. It's the
[01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:36.610]  same everywhere. You have a
[01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:37.969]  big environmental conference,
[01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:40.450]  a big sustainability
[01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:41.969]  conference, a smart grid
[01:21:41.969 --> 01:21:44.130]  conference. They use that
[01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:45.969]  to shoehorn as their cover
[01:21:45.969 --> 01:21:47.889]  as intelligence ops. This
[01:21:47.889 --> 01:21:49.570]  is coming out now into your
[01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:50.850]  town or city. Doesn't matter
[01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:53.730]  whether it's in Western
[01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:54.930]  Europe, Eastern Europe,
[01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:57.010]  Africa, Asia, Latin America,
[01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:59.730]  the US, and then they put
[01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:00.770]  their little mask on. They
[01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:02.530]  get their rent cars. They
[01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:04.770]  go out, they set their
[01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:07.330]  fires and they leave. They
[01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:09.170]  mean business. These are
[01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:12.770]  military operations. They've
[01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:14.930]  been caught all over the
[01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.130]  world. If there's high
[01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:19.809]  winds and you live in a
[01:22:19.809 --> 01:22:21.889]  population center, the left
[01:22:21.889 --> 01:22:22.690]  is coming to burn you and
[01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:24.850]  your family down. They
[01:22:24.850 --> 01:22:25.570]  don't want to just chop
[01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.250]  your son's penis off. They
[01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:27.969]  don't want to just create
[01:22:27.969 --> 01:22:29.170]  blue cities with fentanyl
[01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:30.050]  and needles and almost
[01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:31.490]  everywhere. They want to
[01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:33.490]  destroy you because they're
[01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.450]  the manager class. They
[01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.090]  believe when stuff
[01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.969]  collapses, they're going to
[01:22:35.969 --> 01:22:37.010]  get full control of all
[01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:38.290]  of it. They've been
[01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:39.170]  promised positions of
[01:22:39.170 --> 01:22:42.050]  power. Levi, thanks for
[01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:45.010]  holding from Maui. You
[01:22:45.010 --> 01:22:45.570]  want to talk about the
[01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:48.610]  fires in Hawaii? I'll do
[01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:49.889]  that. I'm glad to talk to
[01:22:49.889 --> 01:22:53.090]  you, but in fact, let me
[01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:54.930]  just put you on hold. I
[01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:58.050]  said on here that we're
[01:22:58.050 --> 01:23:00.290]  taking calls on how they're
[01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:01.090]  going to try to roll out
[01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:03.010]  the new COVID lockdowns
[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:03.969]  and the new restrictions
[01:23:03.969 --> 01:23:04.850]  and what do you think of
[01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.410]  the fact that we've
[01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:06.210]  gotten ahead of it this
[01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.969]  time? I said, we're only
[01:23:07.969 --> 01:23:09.090]  covering that topic, but
[01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:11.969]  I noticed people ignore
[01:23:11.969 --> 01:23:17.170]  me, which is fine, and
[01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:17.889]  people are calling in
[01:23:17.889 --> 01:23:19.490]  about Hawaii. Mountain
[01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:20.130]  Patriot wants to talk
[01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:21.250]  about Hawaiian fires.
[01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:24.930]  Patriot Rep wants to
[01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:26.210]  talk about Maui fires.
[01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.090]  Gavin wants to talk
[01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:30.930]  about the fires.
[01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:35.809]  And so does Levi. So
[01:23:35.809 --> 01:23:36.530]  we'll go to Levi and
[01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:40.930]  Maui. Maybe we
[01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:41.969]  shouldn't talk about
[01:23:41.969 --> 01:23:42.610]  how they're rolling out
[01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:44.690]  a new lockdown or how
[01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:45.330]  they're rolling out a
[01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:48.050]  new mask mandate, a
[01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:50.850]  new injection. I mean,
[01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:51.570]  I think Maui is
[01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:53.010]  important as a microcosm
[01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:53.650]  of what they'll do to
[01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:57.010]  all of us, but I just
[01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:58.770]  get, it's so weird.
[01:23:58.770 --> 01:24:01.650]  Like I said, I only
[01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:04.210]  want to take calls on
[01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:05.730]  the shots and what
[01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:06.610]  you think about that.
[01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.050]  I'm happy to take
[01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:08.850]  the Maui. In fact,
[01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:10.850]  we won't take calls on
[01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:11.809]  COVID and the shots
[01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:13.969]  in the new rollout.
[01:24:13.969 --> 01:24:14.690]  We'll only take
[01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:16.370]  calls on Maui. I
[01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:17.250]  think that's reasonable.
[01:24:21.809 --> 01:24:22.450]  Then everybody will
[01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:23.090]  call up the shots,
[01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.570]  though, as soon as
[01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:26.050]  I say that. I don't
[01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:28.530]  know anymore because
[01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:29.170]  we need to have a
[01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:30.130]  big debate. You know,
[01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:33.410]  you saw what
[01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.969]  happened. We got
[01:24:33.969 --> 01:24:34.850]  excited about their
[01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:36.290]  new rollout plan.
[01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:37.010]  We were able to get
[01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.730]  ahead of it and
[01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.170]  really put a dent in it.
[01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:42.210]  And Maui's important.
[01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:43.730]  We've covered that
[01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:46.770]  at Nauseam. Let's
[01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:47.410]  just do this. Let's
[01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:48.050]  just go to your phone
[01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:50.050]  calls. Hell, maybe
[01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:50.850]  I should just walk
[01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.490]  for a while. Maybe
[01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:54.370]  that's just the answer.
[01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:55.010]  Just give everybody
[01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.809]  what they want.
[01:24:55.809 --> 01:24:56.610]  Everybody wants it
[01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:58.610]  so bad. I mean,
[01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:59.410]  you want class swap
[01:24:59.410 --> 01:24:59.889]  to kill you and
[01:24:59.889 --> 01:25:00.770]  your family, don't you?
[01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:01.410]  You actually do.
[01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:04.770]  Maybe he is
[01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:05.330]  better than you.
[01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:05.889]  Maybe he does
[01:25:05.889 --> 01:25:06.610]  need to kill you.
[01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:07.170]  Maybe he does
[01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:07.809]  deserve everything.
[01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:09.170]  He's organized.
[01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.050]  He's serious.
[01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:10.610]  He's focused.
[01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:11.250]  He's got a plan.
[01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.850]  He means business.
[01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:16.050]  Levi and Maui,
[01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:16.290]  go ahead.
[01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:16.850]  You're on the air.
[01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:19.490]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:21.250]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:21.650]  I went.
[01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:22.290]  It popped up.
[01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:22.850]  It looked like
[01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:23.410]  you're talking
[01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:23.969]  about Maui.
[01:25:23.969 --> 01:25:25.250]  Still, I'm not
[01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.809]  even trying to
[01:25:25.809 --> 01:25:26.530]  mention you.
[01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:27.250]  It's that I have
[01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.130]  no control over
[01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.770]  anything here.
[01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:30.850]  You don't understand
[01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:31.809]  what it's like.
[01:25:31.809 --> 01:25:33.250]  I have no control
[01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.050]  other than quitting.
[01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:35.330]  What looks better
[01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.730]  every day,
[01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:36.850]  but listen,
[01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:38.130]  let's just not
[01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.170]  go there right now.
[01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:39.889]  Please don't say
[01:25:39.889 --> 01:25:40.530]  sorry you called
[01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:41.570]  about Maui.
[01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:42.130]  You shouldn't be
[01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:42.690]  sorry you called
[01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:43.969]  it about Maui.
[01:25:43.969 --> 01:25:44.610]  It's important
[01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:45.010]  you called it
[01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:45.730]  about Maui.
[01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:47.809]  Go ahead.
[01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:51.250]  Yeah, I just wanted
[01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:52.530]  to bring some light
[01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:53.650]  in regards to
[01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:54.290]  Lahaina.
[01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:55.010]  I went over there
[01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.730]  helping the humane
[01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:56.290]  society,
[01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:57.410]  but I wanted
[01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:59.090]  to bring up Eric West.
[01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.330]  He's been documenting
[01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:02.610]  it so well
[01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:03.650]  from the very beginning.
[01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:04.370]  He had the drone
[01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:05.410]  up the very next day.
[01:26:05.969 --> 01:26:06.610]  He's been meeting
[01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:07.809]  with the family members.
[01:26:08.370 --> 01:26:09.730]  His last two videos
[01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:12.850]  have profound anomalies
[01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:15.730]  of it's incredible.
[01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:16.850]  So I just suggest
[01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:17.650]  that people head over
[01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:18.370]  and check him out
[01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:19.730]  because I believe
[01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:20.450]  what he's doing
[01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:21.330]  is very profound.
[01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:22.610]  Also believe
[01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:24.210]  one of the profound
[01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:24.850]  anomalies.
[01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:27.809]  The profound anomalies
[01:26:27.809 --> 01:26:28.450]  are you know
[01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:29.650]  we have cars
[01:26:29.650 --> 01:26:30.690]  completely away
[01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:32.130]  from anything
[01:26:32.130 --> 01:26:33.090]  but shrub
[01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:33.809]  that's not even
[01:26:33.809 --> 01:26:34.690]  properly burned.
[01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:35.570]  They're still green
[01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:36.050]  around it.
[01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:37.170]  The highway
[01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:38.130]  on both sides
[01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:38.690]  untouched
[01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:40.130]  on the other side
[01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:40.770]  and a little bit
[01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:41.330]  down low
[01:26:41.969 --> 01:26:42.530]  and you have
[01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.570]  the pulverized car.
[01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:45.570]  So yeah
[01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.290]  I'm not saying anything.
[01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:48.930]  I'm just saying
[01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:49.570]  it's good to
[01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:50.130]  account for
[01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:50.530]  everything
[01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:51.410]  but I agree with you.
[01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:52.850]  They have
[01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:54.290]  completely been busted.
[01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:56.210]  They do have
[01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:57.570]  airship based
[01:26:57.570 --> 01:26:58.450]  not so much space
[01:26:58.450 --> 01:26:59.250]  based
[01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:00.050]  microwaves
[01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.370]  which are
[01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:00.930]  direct energy
[01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:01.330]  weapons
[01:27:01.889 --> 01:27:02.850]  that will cause
[01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:04.530]  cars to explode.
[01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.570]  So I wouldn't
[01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:06.130]  put it past
[01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:07.330]  the technocracy.
[01:27:07.330 --> 01:27:08.050]  They got a huge
[01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:09.090]  secret weather program
[01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:09.410]  that's all
[01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.969]  admitted that's
[01:27:09.969 --> 01:27:10.770]  going on.
[01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:11.170]  No one wants
[01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:11.889]  to talk about it.
[01:27:11.889 --> 01:27:12.290]  Who knows
[01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.690]  they might have
[01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:13.010]  hit them
[01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:14.290]  not with space lasers
[01:27:14.290 --> 01:27:15.250]  but with microwaves.
[01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:17.170]  I just think
[01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:18.370]  they've been
[01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:19.010]  shipping stuff
[01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.330]  out here
[01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:19.809]  from HARP
[01:27:19.809 --> 01:27:21.250]  since 1993
[01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:21.730]  since the
[01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:23.730]  Aloha on 93 project.
[01:27:23.809 --> 01:27:25.010]  I document it
[01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.650]  every year.
[01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:26.690]  They've run so much
[01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:27.490]  geo-engineering
[01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:29.250]  projects here
[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:30.370]  it'll blow your mind.
[01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:31.330]  I mean it's paradise
[01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:32.290]  but at the same time
[01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:34.050]  they are constantly
[01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:35.730]  manipulating the weather here.
[01:27:35.730 --> 01:27:37.010]  I try to wake my friends up
[01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.889]  in regards to it
[01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:38.690]  but yeah
[01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:39.330]  they just want to
[01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:40.770]  willfully be ignorant about it
[01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:41.250]  but yeah
[01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.690]  I believe that
[01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.130]  they pulled out
[01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:44.850]  all the cars.
[01:27:45.809 --> 01:27:46.690]  It's one of the areas
[01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:48.290]  Joe Rogan is still wrong.
[01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:49.010]  He used to believe
[01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.809]  in chem trails
[01:27:49.809 --> 01:27:50.450]  geo-engineering
[01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:51.090]  and then he
[01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:51.570]  did a show
[01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:52.370]  how they weren't real
[01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:53.090]  like 10 years ago
[01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:53.969]  and he says they're not real
[01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:54.450]  but
[01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:55.570]  it's declassified
[01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.130]  they're doing it.
[01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:57.490]  They don't call them
[01:27:57.490 --> 01:27:58.050]  chem trails
[01:27:58.050 --> 01:27:59.410]  they call it geo-engineering
[01:27:59.969 --> 01:28:00.930]  and it's going on
[01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:01.969]  it's happening everywhere
[01:28:02.690 --> 01:28:04.210]  and it's very very serious.
[01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:04.770]  Yeah
[01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:05.650]  I'm seeing the videos
[01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:06.370]  you're talking about
[01:28:07.969 --> 01:28:08.210]  but
[01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:11.170]  in part two
[01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:12.130]  on his YouTube channel
[01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:12.770]  it's just going
[01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:13.650]  completely viral
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:14.690]  but he's been awesome
[01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:15.490]  and he's been meeting
[01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.130]  with the people
[01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:17.969]  getting the money directly
[01:28:17.969 --> 01:28:18.770]  because
[01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:19.730]  a lot of my friends
[01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:20.130]  are the ones
[01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:21.570]  that ran the operations
[01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:22.450]  to the survivors
[01:28:22.450 --> 01:28:23.410]  of Lahaina
[01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:23.969]  and those guys
[01:28:23.969 --> 01:28:24.930]  were left for dead.
[01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:25.730]  The community
[01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:27.969]  has been the 100% support system
[01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:29.490]  and the first week
[01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:30.770]  they completely outperformed
[01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:31.889]  the government.
[01:28:31.889 --> 01:28:32.370]  Actually
[01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:32.770]  you know
[01:28:32.770 --> 01:28:33.809]  they're still jumping
[01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:34.370]  through hoops
[01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:35.330]  trying to get their money
[01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:36.210]  700 bucks
[01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.250]  from FEMA right now.
[01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:39.570]  It's all a sick joke
[01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:40.050]  meanwhile
[01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:42.050]  FEMA gets a thousand dollar a night
[01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.889]  at Bill Gates' hotel
[01:28:43.889 --> 01:28:44.690]  the four seasons
[01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:45.330]  there in Maui.
[01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:46.610]  It's just
[01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:47.170]  it's all about
[01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:47.809]  rubbing it in
[01:28:47.809 --> 01:28:48.770]  it's all about doing it
[01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:49.490]  because the public
[01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.450]  loves getting murdered
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:52.130]  the public loves getting killed
[01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:53.090]  by the government
[01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:53.650]  they love it
[01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:54.610]  it's our religion.
[01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:59.650]  A lot of listeners
[01:28:59.650 --> 01:29:00.290]  have complained
[01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:01.490]  in the last two years
[01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:02.450]  that our amazing
[01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:03.410]  high quality coffee
[01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:04.610]  has not been available
[01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:05.250]  and that's because
[01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:06.850]  the prices went up too high
[01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:07.730]  for the raw beans
[01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:08.290]  and the quality
[01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:09.410]  had gone down some.
[01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:10.290]  I turned down
[01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:11.090]  so many companies
[01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:12.450]  that wanted to work with us
[01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:13.410]  but now
[01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.010]  we have brought back
[01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:15.730]  the coffee
[01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:17.490]  and it's even better
[01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:19.250]  from a national supplier
[01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:20.690]  that's veteran owned
[01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:22.050]  and veteran operated
[01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:23.730]  it's powered by the company
[01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:25.250]  Minuteman Coffee
[01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:26.130]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:26.930]  this is
[01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:28.690]  the best tasting
[01:29:28.690 --> 01:29:29.410]  best smelling
[01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:31.650]  strongest coffee
[01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:33.730]  that I have ever drank
[01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:35.570]  it is game changing
[01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.210]  all you got to do
[01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:37.330]  is buy a bag of it
[01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:37.889]  and try it
[01:29:37.889 --> 01:29:38.850]  I know you're going to be hooked
[01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:39.410]  which will then
[01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:40.210]  funder operation

[01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:47.330]  the amazing
[01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.969]  medium roast

[01:30:01.889 --> 01:30:02.850]  for two years
[01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:04.290]  because the price went up too high
[01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:04.930]  and the quality
[01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:06.050]  was starting to go down
[01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.770]  I turned out

[01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:10.930]  but when the folks

[01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:04.290]  how do i write
[01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:05.330]  all the books that i do
[01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:07.250]  four books with dr judy mykibitz

[01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:15.010]  that's because i use brain force every day
[01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.330]  what i always need is i always need
[01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:19.010]  some sort of boost in the morning

[01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:22.930]  take good vitamins
[01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:25.650]  but the one thing that i have really found
[01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:27.250]  that makes a difference
[01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:28.450]  is brain force

[01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:32.610]  right before i go to my computer

[01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:40.610]  that brain force is something i use every day
[01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:42.210]  and it helps me with my writing

[01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:30.460]  from the infowars.com studios it's alex jones look if you're sitting on the most expensive
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:38.460]  land in america we're talking thousands of dollars a square inch and you run your black rock and you
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:43.259]  run the power company you just don't trim the trees leave the power on it burns down and your other
[01:33:43.259 --> 01:33:49.179]  investments get it it's that simple they did it it's all come out so i'm not trying to limit people
[01:33:49.179 --> 01:33:55.500]  to just the topic of the new covid rollouts maybe tomorrow we have a special guest on
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:01.580]  we'll just open the phones up on leftist arson the different ways they do it
[01:34:03.099 --> 01:34:07.420]  because you don't need a directed energy weapon to do it you don't even need an arsonist to do it
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:13.740]  if you don't trim the trees in dry weather around major towns and then leave the power
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:21.099]  on when the storm comes it will burn the town down period you know a five-year-old knows
[01:34:21.099 --> 01:34:25.740]  if you're in the bathtub don't plug in mom's hair dryer and throw it in the water you're
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:31.900]  gonna you're gonna electrocute this is default stuff folks like your car is on empty
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:40.299]  better get gas or you know don't take cyanide it'll kill you and people are freaking out
[01:34:40.299 --> 01:34:46.219]  watching this happen and they're realizing that it's premeditated the way you slice it
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:51.660]  and knowing the globalists they might have thrown in a c-130 that was drone operated they've got
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:56.780]  those now and done some extra zapping to burn it down i i don't know i just know we got them
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:06.540]  on everything else we got them and we can't prove lasers we can sure as hell prove they
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:10.700]  left those power lines on they didn't trim the trees black rock said for environmental reasons
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.339]  we don't upkeep our power lines anymore these of us a weapon against us and then they
[01:35:15.339 --> 01:35:22.700]  barricaded the people in the town that happened you can't prove direct energy weapons you can prove
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:26.460]  they got orders to barricade them in that town when the fire was at their back
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:31.500]  that's open and shut who gave order we got their ass and it goes right up the chain to
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:36.380]  larry think right to the top of the pyramid so i'm the one saying i don't want to take calls
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:40.860]  on maui it's not that it's that i'm trying to take calls and focus we'll do maui tomorrow
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:44.940]  i'm trying i already covered it a bunch today we'll cover it next hour too
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:53.660]  i'm trying to cover the fact they're trying new lockdowns everywhere they're trying more
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:57.980]  masking force injections that have already killed 20 million people worldwide and when
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:03.420]  they shut down the third world it causes mass starvation and death so i was opening the
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:10.380]  phones up to hear from listeners specifically where you work at colleges or at grocery stores
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:15.580]  or at hotels or in law enforcement what are you hearing because i got stacks of news here
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:20.380]  they're bringing back the mask and the shots and the lockdowns and all of it and we got the
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:24.540]  fed saying alex jones is wrong we're not planning any such thing but we do have a new
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:30.139]  shot for you though the middle of next month just like i told you before they did from our
[01:36:30.139 --> 01:36:35.660]  sources so how do we get ahead of it what do you think's next how big a win is it that
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:40.059]  they're all unstable right now because they wanted to roll it out and incrementally not
[01:36:40.059 --> 01:36:46.460]  have a debate up front that's why i wanted to focus on that topic they've been focusing
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:52.139]  a lot on hawaii and it's just as important in the aggregate and look at the lockdown they
[01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:57.019]  had in hawaii and what that did this is all the same people the same people that created the
[01:36:57.019 --> 01:37:03.980]  conditions and choreographed that inferno are the same ones choreographing world war three
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:08.860]  open borders the attacks on our children the pedophilia
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:12.860]  the coven lockdowns the poison shots the whole shooting match
[01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:18.380]  all right i'm gonna go in the order your calls are received
[01:37:22.299 --> 01:37:23.980]  and we got a caller in italy
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:33.179]  i pronounce everything wrong is that savario savaro

[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:03.420]  millgate's promise that would be the case what's your view on that yes i was going to call and
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:10.620]  just ask if you heard anything i've heard it it's targeted for old people and children this time
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:18.219]  to kill them mainly you know they're just actually making a target on just those people
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:23.340]  well we know the covet shot targets old people and young people uh and not middle-aged people
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:29.580]  but yeah i've seen millgate's and others say the next pandemic will target children
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:33.900]  and then he says the next pandemic will be far worse so to show biden
[01:40:35.259 --> 01:40:41.259]  yes i've got grandchildren that'd be about that age and i haven't seen many masks here in
[01:40:41.259 --> 01:40:46.940]  georgia yet and uh yeah i haven't been to a hospital i'm not gonna go to a hospital
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:52.059]  but i haven't seen them out in the public you know general public nobody's wearing them around here
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:59.420]  i'm not gonna wear one i never have well i tried to say it earlier but we slammed into a break
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:05.740]  but there's a great meme it's a photo of a woman on one side of a cyclone fence saying
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:11.900]  i wear my mask so i don't get covered and the man behind the fence says i put up the cyclone
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:19.580]  fence so i don't have mosquitoes and it's actually a mosquito per capita is bigger than the virus
[01:41:20.299 --> 01:41:26.780]  flying through the cyclone fence yeah and i've tried to explain that i had to as a doctor tried
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:30.860]  to make me put a mask on when i went to see him and i wouldn't do it and they tried to
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:37.420]  make me leave so i left and i told him i said air goes through this mask what's gonna it's not
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.700]  gonna stop a a uh adjournment i'm going through there how's it gonna stop the journey
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:48.219]  well that's the thing though if the mass supposedly protects them why does it matter
[01:41:48.219 --> 01:41:54.299]  no it's all an act of contrition of worship of submission the question is hey your mask
[01:41:54.299 --> 01:42:01.259]  protects you right why do i gotta wear one oh it doesn't protect them and i'm not wearing one
[01:42:03.179 --> 01:42:07.580]  they'll just have to shoot me well the good news is brother you called into this
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:11.179]  show and you care so keep spreading the word and god bless you and your family
[01:42:11.179 --> 01:42:19.420]  all right let's just skip this break so we get more time and again if i'm grumpy today
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:24.940]  to the crew and everybody else is knocking a lot of people i just get sick about every five years
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:32.219]  no big deal i mean i get the flu i'll be over today i know what covid feels like and
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:38.460]  i had it two and a half years ago and i got it right now i've already gone to two
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:43.420]  air engine tests at clinics i'm getting a blood test today when i leave here i feel like i've been
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:48.299]  run over by a truck and i probably shouldn't be here because i feel nasty as a rattlesnake right
[01:42:48.299 --> 01:42:52.219]  now so i'm being a jerk to people there's nothing to do with the crew or you or anybody
[01:42:52.219 --> 01:42:56.139]  in fact we should take mali calls i should have said both they hung up on a whole bunch
[01:42:56.139 --> 01:43:00.299]  of mali calls and i feel bad now because i care about that just as much it's the same damn
[01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:04.540]  people it's just i want to get focused on the cobit thing because that's going to hit that's
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:09.660]  going to starve hundreds of millions of people to death it's going to flood the borders yeah and
[01:43:10.299 --> 01:43:17.740]  you know one man's fired it's a recession you get fired it's depression i care about those
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:21.420]  people so don't don't think i don't want to talk about mali i had two guests today
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:26.860]  that had to go deal with the relief effort couldn't come on so we were going to cover mali
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:30.460]  today but i just started thinking about big picture what affects even more people
[01:43:31.259 --> 01:43:34.460]  and that's that's that's these shots and that's this poison that's what they're doing
[01:43:35.099 --> 01:43:37.019]  so we're going to skip this break and take calls here
[01:43:38.299 --> 01:43:41.259]  now let's talk to carlos and houston carlos you're on the air go ahead
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:48.780]  hey what's up alex it's always a pleasure to talk to you um me and you talked about
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:52.940]  i gotta say about eight months ago my mom was doing real bad with the uh
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:58.299]  kidneys because of the remdesivir she she went on to be with the lord
[01:43:58.299 --> 01:44:04.059]  oh sorry to hear that so so take your time we talked about one of your family members on
[01:44:04.059 --> 01:44:09.179]  remdesivir you know but kill them you're saying it did they know it does zero help and what 30
[01:44:09.179 --> 01:44:14.299]  some percent of the time kills you and that's fauci again like you did with azt so tell folks
[01:44:14.299 --> 01:44:22.700]  what happened well for for about 18 months you know she she was very strong we tried everything
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:27.740]  under the sun hell we even tried the ivermectin again you know a couple of doses here and there
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:31.900]  you had a family member that was sick with coven for 18 months
[01:44:33.099 --> 01:44:39.740]  it it wasn't covid um uh she initially had covid and she went to the hospital and they
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:46.860]  gave her remdesivir which didn't do her any good and it made in in the end and and
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:52.860]  on the very last day she was alive alex she had a full system organ failure now that's
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:45:00.700]  what remdesivir does yeah it is just that she left the doctors kind of like weirded out because
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:05.259]  like man how did she last this long all the people i know alex and i'm pretty sure you know
[01:45:05.259 --> 01:45:09.820]  everybody that's given remdesivir goes within two weeks my mom lasted a whole 18 months yeah
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:14.299]  your mother was tough as nails and and and that's exactly what she was and she didn't want
[01:45:14.299 --> 01:45:21.740]  to go in the end but alex these covid lockdowns are are and the maui fires everything coincides
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:25.259]  with each other they don't want you to talk about one thing they don't want you to talk about the
[01:45:25.259 --> 01:45:30.540]  other so you're cross between having to talk about both of them and we can't get the message
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:35.340]  of either out if that makes any sense no you're absolutely right the globalists hit us with so
[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:39.820]  many crises they even admit that in their manuals that while we're trying to cover one they hit
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:44.540]  us with the next they hit us with the next what you said is absolutely true and and and
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:48.860]  you don't even get a chance to really get up and get over the first one they hit you and
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:53.980]  you're dealing with the freaking next one and that's the purpose behind it they want us either
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:59.820]  to die with the next injection or they want you to die and starve of hunger because if they push
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:07.740]  these mandates and the supreme court actually actually doesn't support the contractors and the
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:12.860]  workers across the country we're all screwed no no matter which way you do it it's either
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:16.460]  you take the vaccine and you die or you don't take the vaccine and you die
[01:46:18.379 --> 01:46:22.940]  you just can't you just can't make this up alex and you know watching my mother
[01:46:25.259 --> 01:46:30.059]  take her last breath because of these bastards that's what they want for everybody alex
[01:46:31.099 --> 01:46:35.099]  that's exactly what they want they almost killed my dad they almost killed rob dude and
[01:46:35.099 --> 01:46:39.740]  i'm still i bless you brother being able to control yourself because i've been really honest
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:43.740]  about this i'm a non-violent guy because they want to use it against us but there's a few
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:48.460]  people if i saw them in person i don't know what i'd do uh you know people like fauci people
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:54.379]  like bill gates i mean they are laughing about it and they get so funny and they knew day one
[01:46:54.379 --> 01:47:02.860]  randezavir would fry anybody's kidneys and liver and they're giving it to children imagine
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:08.620]  the the i mean i'll be honest it takes a lot of will i respect fauci and gates i mean they
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:14.299]  they they are dangerous i mean they are evil but your mother has an eternal soul
[01:47:14.299 --> 01:47:18.219]  brother you'll see her soon carlos thank you oh my god
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.259]  yeah you might as well just drink gasoline if you're gonna take randezavir
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:31.500]  but you gotta love these people man they they pick the one thing that'll kill your ass
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:35.019]  and then they approve that and then oh you can't have avermectin
[01:47:35.019 --> 01:47:42.780]  hydroxychloroquine vitamin d vitamin c oh no no no you can't have your desedine steroid no no no
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.179]  you get randezavir
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.700]  it was even worse in the uk they gave him that um can't remember the name name's too
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:58.139]  hard to pronounce but it's like it's an assisted suicide drug which makes you if you
[01:47:58.139 --> 01:48:02.620]  give it to somebody they stop breathing so they say they give it to them and then they kill
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:09.179]  them and months before coven broke out they bought a record amount of like five times the record
[01:48:09.179 --> 01:48:14.620]  in the uk and then just murdered people and to them it's like power like i'm a bureaucrat i'm
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:20.940]  murdering people i'm murdering people it's like a video game to them imagine the office like
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:24.860]  we have empathy we care about people they see that as weak they're like look at this guy
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:31.099]  he cares about people an idiot oh but as soon as we go after them oh you go to a supermax
[01:48:31.099 --> 01:48:37.099]  prison double-edged dagger and say you don't care about us and just leave their guts on the ground
[01:48:37.099 --> 01:48:41.500]  you're gonna go to a supermax prison because that's a precious satanist that's a precious
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:46.780]  globalist that's a precious murderer that murdered all these people oh we gotta protect
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:51.980]  them we gotta bow down to them don't you spill their guts on the sidewalk no no if you
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:57.099]  touch one of the little preciouses because their lives value it's our mothers and our daughters
[01:48:57.099 --> 01:49:02.139]  and our sons and our fathers and our lives it's our lives that don't matter it's their
[01:49:02.139 --> 01:49:08.860]  worshipful golden calf lives we gotta bow down to and if we do anything the men in black come
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:15.740]  to get us the same men in black the globalist hit with the strongest poison shots and they're
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:21.099]  almost done with them next hour i'm gonna cover it they're going all the robots soon there
[01:49:21.099 --> 01:49:24.379]  won't be any airline pilots because they're not available they're all having heart attacks
[01:49:24.379 --> 01:49:31.019]  it's all funny to them and we just have to sit here and accept it and love it
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.019]  nick in texas you're on the air go ahead
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:42.780]  oh man hey alex how you doing i'm pretty pissed off right now
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:50.139]  yeah me too um i i've had a couple theories uh we're gaining the uh covid rollout and
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:55.820]  you know how you rolled it out last friday right five hours before they put it out on the news
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:59.740]  now they're kind of uh sitting there scrambling figuring out what they're going to do but
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.099]  you know well that's why i meant to take your calls and i'm glad you called i apologize
[01:50:03.099 --> 01:50:08.059]  because i'm really out of it today uh i meant to ask listeners what is their next move
[01:50:08.059 --> 01:50:12.700]  because i really respect you and i'll just say that to pat you on the head the listeners
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:18.059]  all the time take me to next level or i read comments or i read emails because i go to the
[01:50:18.059 --> 01:50:24.299]  random info wars email i just read them because it just always takes me next level the angles you
[01:50:24.299 --> 01:50:28.860]  think of i don't think of and that's what i meant to do what is their next move
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:36.139]  and i mean go ahead and tell us well i've been thinking um i don't think they're going to be
[01:50:36.139 --> 01:50:39.580]  able to lock us down again like they did previously you know we're all we're all aware
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:45.019]  and awake to their their propaganda but i think what could force people to get a little scared
[01:50:45.019 --> 01:50:49.099]  is if they start trying to infect the children i mean if you want to if you want to really
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:54.700]  get into the hearts and minds of the people strategically as a as a tyrant as these globalist
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:59.820]  scumbags are you want to hit their kids well that's right will bend some knees you know what
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:04.540]  i mean let's just pull it out it was bill gate said a year ago the next outbreak will hit
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:09.980]  children i mean how they're even going to tell us their next move i can pull i'm going to put the
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:20.059]  five solids in the right corner pocket right yeah so um i i could see rsv i could see uh
[01:51:20.059 --> 01:51:24.540]  i mean they had probably a million different variants of covid it could be another covid variant
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:29.019]  that actually is dangerous for the kids and these people are you know us as parents i got i
[01:51:29.019 --> 01:51:33.660]  got a son a six and a half year old son and i got a daughter coming in october and uh if you
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:38.299]  want to if you want to scare me you know you're gonna my kids are gonna be very threatened
[01:51:38.299 --> 01:51:42.219]  by this next thing that they could roll out and then after they roll it out they lock us down
[01:51:42.219 --> 01:51:46.139]  they get us to stay inside our houses then they could start crashing the economy and we
[01:51:46.139 --> 01:51:50.139]  won't know we won't be none the wiser because we're going to be in our houses that's right
[01:51:50.139 --> 01:51:54.940]  they want to bring in their new global est system their new central magnesium currency
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:00.059]  the time is now their bubbles gotten so big they can't control it and they want to have
[01:52:00.059 --> 01:52:07.580]  the new viral outbreak that targets children so that we will cower and all i can say is
[01:52:08.299 --> 01:52:12.299]  i don't know if bill gates has got big enough balls because it's going to come out he killed
[01:52:12.299 --> 01:52:17.099]  a bunch of kids they already have i i i tell you i wonder if they're going to go that far
[01:52:17.099 --> 01:52:22.059]  but they might they're already killing kids in the mali fires they have no problem killing
[01:52:22.059 --> 01:52:25.820]  us the other ways you're right brother thanks for the call

[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:08.140]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.

[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:53.780]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them, but the Lord laughs
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:57.100]  at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:59:01.580]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:06.420]  slay those whose ways are upright, but their swords will pierce their own hearts
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:10.940]  and their bows will be broken, better the little that have righteousness than the
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:15.380]  wealth of many wicked, for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:17.900]  upholds the righteous.
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:21.740]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care, and their inheritance will
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:22.740]  endure forever.
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:25.740]  In times of disaster, they will not wither.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:31.580]  In days of famine, they will not plummet, but the wicked will perish.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:36.180]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed,
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:37.180]  and they will go up in smoke.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:56.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:11.780]  Tonight, COVID-19 forcing a school district to shut down.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:18.420]  Rungi ISD, southeast of San Antonio, is reporting 20% of its teachers and staff have
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.700]  COVID, including the superintendent.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:26.260]  Tonight, as the school leader recovers, he spoke exclusively with KENS 5's Alyssa Niaves
[02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:31.860]  on closing schools after starting just two weeks ago.
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:37.820]  Rungi, Texas, a town of fewer than 1,000 people in Carnes County, quieter than usual
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:38.820]  this week.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.140]  On Saturday afternoon, I began to receive calls.
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:46.180]  Rungi ISD superintendent Hector Dominguez says he's been here before, a surge of
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:48.460]  COVID cases at the start of school.
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:51.700]  But last year, he says, the students got sick.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:53.660]  This year, it's with our employees.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:56.780]  Over the weekend, Dominguez says he took call after call.
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:01.620]  So we were up to over 20% of our staff that had tested positive.
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:03.660]  Ten of his employees had COVID.
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:08.540]  I tested myself with my physician, and I, too, tested positive for COVID.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:13.280]  We're a very, very small school district, and so we don't have the resources that
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:15.700]  a large district would have to cover classes.
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:20.700]  One hundred and ninety-five students in grades pre-K through 12 make up Rungi ISD.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:26.260]  Monday, all of Yellow Jacket Nation received this letter saying all schools will be closed
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:27.360]  this week.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.380]  That same day, all buildings were sanitized.
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:33.780]  It was a no-brainer that it was in the best interest of keeping everyone safe.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:38.780]  Rungi ISD operates on a four-day learning schedule, Tuesday through Friday.
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:43.300]  Dominguez says they'll soon meet to draft a new instructional calendar to make up
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.820]  the lost days from this week.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:51.060]  Everything will go back to normal in Rungi ISD beginning Saturday at the home high school
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:52.140]  volleyball game.
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:54.860]  Monday will be a staff development day.
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:57.100]  Students return on Tuesday.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:00.820]  Reporting in Rungi, Alicia Nieves, KENS5.
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:03.220]  Now to the COVID front here in San Antonio.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:09.140]  The city has seen a thirty percent increase in COVID-19 cases since last week.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:13.260]  One thousand nine hundred and sixty-five new cases have been reported.
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:17.020]  It's still well below last year's numbers and what the city saw during the peak
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.420]  of the pandemic.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:22.620]  Metro Health says the positivity rate at its facilities is twenty-nine percent, but
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:25.900]  so far says not many children have tested positive.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:30.020]  So officials say that could change as we get later on into the school year.
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:39.940]  The CDC announced it's tracking a newly discovered strain of COVID-19.
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:44.900]  Just four cases have been confirmed so far worldwide with one of those in Michigan.
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:49.740]  The World Health Organization has classified the strain as a quote variant under monitoring
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:52.620]  due to its large number of mutations.
[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:57.580]  Officials say its mutations could help the virus bypass immunity from prior infections
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:59.540]  or vaccinations.
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:00.540]  That's right.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:04.220]  There's still no reason to be alarmed, but health officials say pay attention.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.940]  Many people are traveling, they're getting together.
[02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:12.500]  All of that has fueled an uptick in COVID-19 cases and rates are increasing at the highest
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:15.940]  rate right now in the southwest.
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:21.820]  As many enter the last few weeks of a social summer season, it's clear one thing didn't
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:23.060]  take a break.
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.060]  COVID.
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:28.540]  And with fall fast approaching, many are wondering if and when they should get their
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:30.100]  booster shots.
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:35.460]  Everyone will likely meet the criteria to get the new booster.
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:36.460]  CBS News.
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:40.980]  And don't worry, right after they rolled all this out, Biden announced the new booster
[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:46.020]  is ready for you.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:48.260]  All completely scripted.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.360]  The same way they did three and a half years ago, hey, it's not that big a threat.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  Just be ready.
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:53.360]  Be aware.
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:54.360]  Oh, gosh.
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.360]  Oh, no.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:56.360]  There's no cases of kids.
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:57.360]  But we got to close the school.
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.280]  Oh, my gosh, somebody tested positive in our business, close it.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.480]  Which shuts down society, but the big box stores have a plan, they're going to stay
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:07.480]  open.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:08.680]  They'll further consolidate control.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:13.200]  Notice the school day at that school four days now.
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:17.520]  And after the next attack, three days, two days, what will the schools be for?
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.400]  The homeless people.
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.160]  The reeducation camps.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:22.860]  The government command bases.
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:27.720]  This is all admitted under State Department of Random 7277 and others.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:28.760]  They figured this all out.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:32.760]  Remember, the Taliban used the public schools once they took over as the torture
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:33.760]  bases.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:36.040]  That's all they are is reeducation camps.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:38.040]  They're getting ready to get rid of it all.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.040]  You'll stay in your house.
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:40.280]  You'll be pre-programmed there.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.440]  When they let you out of your house with a pass, you'll go.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.440]  This is their whole plan.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.120]  But we're here opposing it.
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:51.040]  We're here saying no to the ESGs, no to the new world order.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.920]  You got to admit the full horror, we're going to have a chance to beat it.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.440]  Your phone calls are coming up in 60 seconds.
[02:04:56.970 --> 02:05:03.290]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:05.030]  coffee has not been available.
[02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:08.650]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had
[02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:09.650]  gone down some.
[02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:12.930]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:05:12.930 --> 02:05:19.610]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier
[02:05:19.610 --> 02:05:22.470]  that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:25.690]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[02:05:25.730 --> 02:05:32.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have
[02:05:32.650 --> 02:05:33.650]  ever drank.
[02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:36.050]  It is game changing.
[02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:38.210]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[02:05:38.210 --> 02:05:41.650]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund or operation a 360 win.

[02:06:16.770 --> 02:06:26.610]  All right, we'll tell you your phone calls were totally vindicated.
[02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:31.490]  They rolled out the attempted launch, their new covered lockdowns and the public's not
[02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:32.490]  buying it.
[02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:36.290]  So they're saying, oh, we're not doing new covered restrictions, even though we are.
[02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:37.290]  How do we counter this?
[02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:38.730]  What do you think they're going to do next?
[02:06:38.730 --> 02:06:39.730]  How do we respond?
[02:06:39.730 --> 02:06:42.250]  Let's go to Mountain Patriot, Colorado, Mountain Patriot.
[02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:43.250]  Thanks for calling.
[02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:44.250]  Go ahead.
[02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:51.530]  Is it COVID coming back or is it America creeping in?
[02:06:51.530 --> 02:06:53.170]  That's the question I have.
[02:06:53.170 --> 02:06:57.050]  Now, there's all sorts of new viruses you're trying to hit us with.
[02:06:57.050 --> 02:06:58.770]  You want to elaborate on that?
[02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:06.770]  Well, you remember when they tried to they tried to vaccinate the chicken for coronavirus,
[02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:12.210]  it ended up that the chicken couldn't live without the vaccination after a while because
[02:07:12.210 --> 02:07:13.210]  what do they call them?
[02:07:13.210 --> 02:07:14.210]  Leaky vaccines.
[02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:15.210]  They don't work.
[02:07:15.210 --> 02:07:16.210]  Right.
[02:07:16.210 --> 02:07:19.930]  And before long, the chickens can't even live together unless they all get vaccinated
[02:07:19.930 --> 02:07:20.930]  continuously.
[02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:29.170]  And then once they give them enough shots, it turns them into a mutant.
[02:07:29.170 --> 02:07:31.050]  Yeah.
[02:07:31.050 --> 02:07:33.770]  And there's plenty of mutants running around right now.
[02:07:33.770 --> 02:07:36.530]  And you know, I covered that ad nauseum like three years ago.
[02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:40.570]  What's the name of the disorder when you give chickens like their third or fourth
[02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:45.730]  COVID shot because it's all started with bird flu and then it causes them to mutate.
[02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:50.210]  All their joints get a lot bigger and they grow tumors everywhere and then become immune
[02:07:50.210 --> 02:07:53.610]  to it and stay alive are these giant mutants.
[02:07:53.610 --> 02:07:54.610]  What was that called?
[02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:59.170]  I believe that's the Merrick's disease that you're talking about.
[02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:06.370]  There was an article about it in National Geographic on that on on on their website.
[02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:10.490]  How do you spell that, numerics?
[02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:11.490]  Merrick.
[02:08:11.490 --> 02:08:12.490]  M-A-R-E-K.
[02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:13.490]  And you mentioned it.
[02:08:13.490 --> 02:08:15.890]  So I looked it up and I've been thinking long and hard about it.
[02:08:15.890 --> 02:08:16.890]  Believe me.
[02:08:16.890 --> 02:08:17.890]  I forgot about Merrick's disease.
[02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:18.890]  Yeah.
[02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:19.890]  Print that for me.
[02:08:19.890 --> 02:08:20.890]  Yeah.
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:21.890]  They got similar studies.
[02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:22.890]  It does that to humans too.
[02:08:22.890 --> 02:08:25.690]  That's why you take them over and over again because it keeps insulting your immune
[02:08:25.690 --> 02:08:28.450]  system till it finally takes you over.
[02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:29.450]  Yeah.
[02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:32.890]  And then these morons that keep taking them and taking them, they just become, you
[02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:36.010]  know, super spreaders of all these variants.
[02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:41.450]  They're just like big walking petri dishes without a thought in their head.
[02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:42.450]  And they love it.
[02:08:42.450 --> 02:08:43.450]  They absolutely love it.
[02:08:43.450 --> 02:08:44.450]  Anything else?
[02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:45.450]  I tell you what, Alex.
[02:08:45.450 --> 02:08:49.930]  I'm just so frustrated and I feel terrible sometimes, but some of these people that
[02:08:49.930 --> 02:08:53.610]  I just wish they'd take some of them, I wish they'd take more vaccines.
[02:08:53.610 --> 02:08:57.290]  I just I'm so fed up with it all, man.
[02:08:57.290 --> 02:09:02.850]  My gal worked at the hospital outside the Navajo Nation in the ICU, and she went through
[02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:08.610]  absolute hell and, you know, probably has PTSD from everything that she saw and went
[02:09:08.610 --> 02:09:14.250]  through with all those, with all the breathing apparatus and having, you know, the doctors
[02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:15.970]  won't even go in the rooms.
[02:09:15.970 --> 02:09:21.890]  And she had to lead families up to the window outside the ICU to say goodbye to
[02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:22.890]  their loved ones.
[02:09:22.890 --> 02:09:23.890]  Yeah.
[02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:24.890]  The doctors are the worst.
[02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:28.770]  They're following the orders to suck the 53,000 out, but they won't even go see the
[02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:30.530]  person they're murdering.
[02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:31.730]  I'm so angry, man.
[02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:35.170]  I'm so angry.
[02:09:35.170 --> 02:09:40.410]  I don't I don't know what the answer is other than, you know, trying to wake people
[02:09:40.410 --> 02:09:46.530]  up nonviolently and, you know, it's just it's unreal.
[02:09:46.530 --> 02:09:50.090]  I don't I don't see any way out of this right now.
[02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:51.090]  But yeah.
[02:09:51.090 --> 02:09:54.450]  Remember, they would take infected people and put them in there with old people in
[02:09:54.450 --> 02:09:58.610]  nursing home, but family couldn't come see their loved one because they wanted to quietly
[02:09:58.610 --> 02:09:59.610]  murder him.
[02:09:59.610 --> 02:10:04.730]  And whether you were in Europe or Australia or the U.S., it was the same policy, all
[02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:06.690]  directed by the same people.
[02:10:06.690 --> 02:10:07.690]  That's the big giveaway.
[02:10:07.690 --> 02:10:08.690]  Thank you.
[02:10:08.690 --> 02:10:09.690]  Mountain Patriot.
[02:10:09.690 --> 02:10:12.330]  Roy in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:10:12.330 --> 02:10:13.330]  Go ahead.
[02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:14.330]  Hey, Alex.
[02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:15.330]  How's it going?
[02:10:15.330 --> 02:10:17.570]  Thanks for holding.
[02:10:17.570 --> 02:10:21.210]  So I want to call in about the COVID.
[02:10:21.210 --> 02:10:25.650]  I'm agreeing with you that the N95, it just doesn't work.
[02:10:25.650 --> 02:10:32.250]  We learned, you know, back in school before we went into the hospital that even an N95
[02:10:32.250 --> 02:10:35.170]  still allows five percent nanoparticles.
[02:10:35.170 --> 02:10:40.410]  And even if you had a perfect seal, you you couldn't stop the virus from getting
[02:10:40.410 --> 02:10:42.490]  through into your system.
[02:10:42.490 --> 02:10:46.810]  And so the whole mass thing is really unless you can live in a bubble and get air a different
[02:10:46.810 --> 02:10:50.370]  way, you can't really stop from getting a virus.
[02:10:51.170 --> 02:10:55.890]  So the virus, you know, it causes basically a constant chronic inflammation.
[02:10:55.890 --> 02:11:00.810]  I got it back in 2020 and I've had to deal with complications with it all the way up
[02:11:00.810 --> 02:11:03.290]  even till today.
[02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:08.290]  And so you get sort of a chronic inflammation and you get sort of an asthmatic effect
[02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:09.290]  from it.
[02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:10.290]  Yes.
[02:11:10.290 --> 02:11:16.490]  So when it gets really bad for me, I have no problem whatsoever taking even more than
[02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:18.370]  one shot of pomacord if I need to.
[02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:22.730]  There were times when it was so bad, I would take three shots of pomacord.
[02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:26.890]  If you got the liquid pomacord and you can use a nebulizer, it'll it'll work a whole
[02:11:26.890 --> 02:11:28.210]  lot better.
[02:11:28.210 --> 02:11:34.190]  But if you've got the powder form called Adver, that also helps.
[02:11:34.190 --> 02:11:37.810]  But you seem to need more of it if you use the powdered form.
[02:11:37.810 --> 02:11:43.850]  I would I would recommend people get a nebulized machine and get the liquid form of pomacord.
[02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:49.610]  And if you have to take two, three to get your inflammation down and keep you out of
[02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:50.610]  the emergency room.
[02:11:50.610 --> 02:11:54.890]  And Milo, you're a really important caller, Roy, because there were two camps here.
[02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:58.730]  People that said that it's the most deadly virus ever kills three point four percent
[02:11:58.730 --> 02:12:01.530]  or those that said, oh, it's not real.
[02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:02.530]  No, I'm tough.
[02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:03.530]  I'm not a hypochondriac.
[02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:06.530]  I hardly ever get sick.
[02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:07.530]  This was different.
[02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:12.570]  I was huffing steroids, taking all the stuff, and if I didn't know that it was inflammation
[02:12:12.570 --> 02:12:15.170]  and psychological, I'd have gone to the hospital, I'd have died.
[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:20.630]  So you work as a respiratory therapist and you're saying you've never seen anything
[02:12:20.630 --> 02:12:21.630]  like this?
[02:12:21.630 --> 02:12:24.490]  No, this is definitely different.
[02:12:24.490 --> 02:12:28.850]  We've had all kinds of different ways that people get pneumonia in hospitals before.
[02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:34.930]  And, you know, we we've had people before the whole covid thing came out, you know,
[02:12:34.930 --> 02:12:39.770]  there were different reasons why people ended up with pneumonia and ended up on ventilators.
[02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:45.810]  But then as soon as they released this virus, which I believe is an attack, too, I think
[02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:48.770]  it's been manipulated even myself.
[02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:53.250]  But when they released this, it was like that was the only thing that existed.
[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:56.850]  There wasn't any there was nothing else out there.
[02:12:56.850 --> 02:12:59.370]  And even the doctors, that's all they would say everybody had was covid.
[02:12:59.370 --> 02:13:00.850]  I'm like, well, how's that possible?
[02:13:00.850 --> 02:13:04.970]  I'm like, we had all kinds of different things that cause pneumonia before even bacterial
[02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:05.970]  others.
[02:13:05.970 --> 02:13:06.970]  No doubt.
[02:13:06.970 --> 02:13:07.970]  No doubt.
[02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:08.970]  They boosted the numbers of it.
[02:13:09.170 --> 02:13:10.170]  No doubt they did that.
[02:13:10.170 --> 02:13:14.770]  But but separately, you're saying you did see something different physiologically from
[02:13:14.770 --> 02:13:15.770]  covid.
[02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:16.770]  Yes.
[02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:19.770]  Yes, because it just wouldn't stop.
[02:13:19.770 --> 02:13:22.130]  The inflammation keeps coming back and coming back.
[02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:24.250]  It's almost like a virus that you can't.
[02:13:24.250 --> 02:13:28.410]  Well, I mean, I'm not I'm not a medical worker like you are, but I've interviewed
[02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:29.810]  literally hundreds of doctors.
[02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:37.530]  It is a prion isolated nanotech viral particle that keeps replicating just like the thing
[02:13:37.570 --> 02:13:39.370]  that causes mad cow disease.
[02:13:39.370 --> 02:13:40.450]  And so that's what it is.
[02:13:40.450 --> 02:13:42.250]  That's why it just keeps coming back.
[02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:43.250]  Yeah.
[02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:46.490]  Plus, it's an RNA virus, not a DNA virus.
[02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:51.010]  So an RNA virus like HIV can be prolonged.
[02:13:51.010 --> 02:13:55.490]  It can be manipulated in a way where it's very difficult for the body to fight it off.
[02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:59.850]  So they intentionally use something that they knew that you wouldn't be able to fight
[02:13:59.850 --> 02:14:00.850]  off easily.
[02:14:00.850 --> 02:14:05.910]  And if they gave it longevity by by splicing in something like HIV or just some crazy
[02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:09.790]  thing they could have spliced in there, then it's almost impossible to beat.
[02:14:09.790 --> 02:14:12.790]  I mean, you'll go through phases of feeling better than you'll feel worse and you'll
[02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:14.270]  feel better than you'll feel worse.
[02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:15.270]  Well, I mean, they did.
[02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:16.270]  They did.
[02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:18.710]  They did splice in the HIV delivery system.
[02:14:18.710 --> 02:14:19.710]  They did do that.
[02:14:19.710 --> 02:14:20.710]  Yeah.
[02:14:20.710 --> 02:14:25.310]  And that's what I wonder, you know, if some people are reacting to it in different
[02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:29.470]  ways than others, because it's always like dormant in the body and and goes through
[02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:33.350]  these phases where it mutates because RNA viruses, they just mutate mutates.
[02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:37.750]  They colonize this with a chimeric.
[02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:42.150]  Self replicating infection, there are ways to mitigate it, but it's it's reducing
[02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:43.830]  everybody's lifespan.
[02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:49.670]  It's infected everybody and again, what was Fauci specialty HIV?
[02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:51.990]  What is Bill Gates specialty HIV?
[02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:55.530]  So they hit us with this thing that's very hard to track and affects each person
[02:14:55.530 --> 02:14:57.030]  differently.
[02:14:57.030 --> 02:15:02.350]  And it's just it's we're literally living we're living in Hitler 2.0 right now.
[02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:06.190]  I'll tell you what, you really know that you're dealing with the problem is and
[02:15:06.190 --> 02:15:09.510]  I'll say this is something I've noticed I recognized in me and some people I've
[02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:10.510]  talked to.
[02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:14.230]  If you lie down flat on your back and it seems to get worse.
[02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:18.510]  It's because I've been dealing with for a while has done so much damage to
[02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:19.510]  your lungs.
[02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:20.510]  It's weakened your lungs.
[02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:21.510]  I don't have a name for that.
[02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.830]  I just myself call it weakened lung syndrome.
[02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:28.230]  There's no real name for it, but I've gotten to the point to where I've had
[02:15:28.230 --> 02:15:31.670]  inflammation so much to where I have to use like a CPAP when I lay flat on my
[02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:32.670]  back.
[02:15:32.670 --> 02:15:35.790]  It's the only way that I can breathe better.
[02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:40.110]  And you know and I and like you I take ivermectin and I take some of the other
[02:15:40.110 --> 02:15:41.110]  stuff too.
[02:15:41.110 --> 02:15:44.110]  Same thing happened to me after COVID I've never been the same.
[02:15:44.110 --> 02:15:48.430]  Can't sleep on my back now because I wake up gasping for air.
[02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:51.590]  Yeah if I don't put a I got to put a nasal CPAP on my nose.
[02:15:51.590 --> 02:15:55.830]  It's the only way that I can actually lay flat on my back and go to sleep now because
[02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:59.990]  of all the damage that's been done to my lungs from the inflammation.
[02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:06.590]  And so you know it's it's kind of crazy but you also need albuterol too because
[02:16:06.590 --> 02:16:10.590]  you there's also you know the I went in there to the doctor and he diagnosed me
[02:16:10.590 --> 02:16:16.510]  with RAD reactive airway disease and you know he just prescribed me albuterol
[02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:17.510]  for that.
[02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:19.630]  But there's more to it than just reactive airway disease.
[02:16:19.630 --> 02:16:23.190]  That's just saying that you've got a form of asthma and nobody in my family's
[02:16:23.190 --> 02:16:24.190]  ever had it.
[02:16:24.190 --> 02:16:25.190]  I've never had it.
[02:16:25.190 --> 02:16:26.190]  It's obvious.
[02:16:26.190 --> 02:16:28.190]  Nobody in my family's ever had asthma.
[02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:33.350]  And I was thinking last night when I woke up in the morning I was like man this COVID
[02:16:33.350 --> 02:16:34.350]  gave me asthma.
[02:16:34.350 --> 02:16:40.090]  Well I'll tell you what I feel better though when I go out in the sun and I get some
[02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:44.670]  natural sunlight on me you know if I if I go out there do that I also and I don't
[02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:48.150]  recommend this for everybody but I remember you had a doctor on there was talking about
[02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:52.670]  how the virus stays in the back of the nose and in that area.
[02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:58.230]  And if you can't get rid of it back there you know it also can cause more trouble.
[02:16:58.230 --> 02:17:00.230]  And so I tried.
[02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:04.350]  I wouldn't recommend this for it for anybody but I put a little bit of your immune support
[02:17:04.350 --> 02:17:08.750]  in my nebulizer after the inflammation is gone I would recommend using that while
[02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:09.750]  you got the inflammation.
[02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:14.550]  I put a little bit of that in my nebulizer and I and I nebulized that in through my
[02:17:14.550 --> 02:17:18.590]  nose and tried to kill some of the virus that keeps coming up.
[02:17:18.590 --> 02:17:22.790]  It seems to help a little bit you know but I don't I don't necessarily recommend that
[02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:23.790]  for everybody.
[02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:29.470]  Well I know we've had medical doctors on that recommend a lot of different disinfectants
[02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:30.990]  that are out there.
[02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:33.310]  We had Peter McCullough on a few weeks ago he talked about it we had some other
[02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:39.030]  people on and then they were talking about it's just mouthwashes too are really
[02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:40.030]  really important.
[02:17:40.030 --> 02:17:44.590]  But yeah this is a thing that colonizes the nasal cavity it's a crystal basically
[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:47.190]  a protein crystal and it keeps growing back.
[02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:51.430]  It's a synthetic virus made in the lab growing back growing back growing back
[02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:56.550]  and so it starts here and it goes into your mouth your tonsils your throat your
[02:17:56.550 --> 02:17:58.790]  lungs over and over again.
[02:17:58.790 --> 02:18:00.030]  Thank you Roy.
[02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:04.790]  And for some people it hits the liver and it's the testicles and it's the kidneys.
[02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:10.310]  I mean they stood this thing up they made it and they released it on us and they're
[02:18:10.310 --> 02:18:15.110]  just laughing their ass off because it's a bunch of psychotic demons.
[02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:20.590]  And it's just important to realize that that that's who runs our government.
[02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:23.110]  And they did it.
[02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:27.550]  And I've got all the videos they want us to just move on to the next story which I've
[02:18:27.550 --> 02:18:28.590]  kind of done.
[02:18:28.590 --> 02:18:32.110]  I can pull Fauci up tears before they release COVID saying we're going to release
[02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:37.350]  a virus out of China a bird flu to blow up the old system and take control of everybody
[02:18:37.350 --> 02:18:39.750]  and bring an mRNA.
[02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:44.710]  I mean it goes on and on and just like Senator Paul points out I've got all your hearings
[02:18:44.710 --> 02:18:50.510]  he says you have these big meetings called gain of function conference and then you say
[02:18:50.510 --> 02:18:56.430]  you don't know what gain of function is and you look at Fauci he's obviously a psychotic
[02:18:56.430 --> 02:19:04.470]  demon and he does just what he looks like he did.
[02:19:04.470 --> 02:19:08.430]  He's the big predator we're the little sheep there's too many of us and he's willing
[02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:13.990]  to come in and call everybody for the betterment of humanity that's his idea but if you try
[02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:22.110]  to make a move on him whoa that's who that's supermax prison Fauci's allowed to hurt you
[02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:27.350]  you're not allowed to even talk bad about him he's the anointed one you lay down you
[02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:34.230]  die okay good that's good that's right he's the boss good for you Kyle in Kansas
[02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:42.110]  you're on the air thanks for calling hey Alex uh quick plug your CBD best I've ever
[02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:48.550]  had I've been taking CBD for years tried a bunch of different kinds and by far hands
[02:19:48.550 --> 02:19:58.150]  down Info Wars best CBD is that the rebels in well I just got an order rebels in I haven't
[02:19:58.150 --> 02:20:04.150]  tried it yet but this is the thousand milligram I do the tincture and I've been I've gone
[02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:08.470]  through about three bottles of that and and so when you just came out with the rebels
[02:20:08.470 --> 02:20:14.470]  then I just put in an order just showed up it's it's even stronger the other ones grand
[02:20:14.470 --> 02:20:20.350]  as well but it but it's even stronger awesome I can't wait out well I want to talk
[02:20:20.350 --> 02:20:28.110]  about a little big picture here what I think what they're doing right now they're really
[02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:35.870]  got their hand on the dial on these future shock have a stock Institute type of attacks
[02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:40.830]  that are going on you just look at it you got the virus attack you got the food attack
[02:20:40.830 --> 02:20:47.070]  you got the energy attack the inflation attack the weather attack the different groups that
[02:20:47.070 --> 02:20:53.870]  trying to fight each other getting everybody at each other and all these are just attacks
[02:20:53.870 --> 02:21:02.590]  just like you you lay down artillery and to soften up your target and before you really go
[02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:08.670]  in and hopefully what the idea is you just walk right in afterwards everybody's demoralized
[02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:16.030]  days just beaten down and that's what we're going through is what I feel like I agree
[02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:22.870]  they're opening up the artillery ahead of the central bank digital currencies having
[02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:28.070]  first they'll soften us up and offer themselves as saviors and then as soon as they get the
[02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:33.470]  handcuffs on us digitally they're gonna kill up basically everybody that's it you gotta be
[02:21:33.470 --> 02:21:40.110]  where I tell people you be aware of the solutions look out for you know anytime they
[02:21:40.110 --> 02:21:45.430]  offer a solution you know what what's their end goal you know you tie it back to 9-11 like
[02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:51.790]  what did they get in the end well they got the Patriot Act they got 20 years of war so
[02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:56.110]  all you got to do is just say well step back what did they get with that's right I mean
[02:21:56.110 --> 02:22:00.990]  if you get evil people in charge and they have the administrative power they can do incredible
[02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:06.470]  things Maui's a microcosm of that don't give them water don't trim the trees leave the power
[02:22:06.470 --> 02:22:13.590]  on order the cops all people in the town you know what would happen and then you've got the
[02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:18.790]  cops who aren't even part of it doing your dirty work now so the public goes well forgive
[02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:23.030]  them they didn't know but now they're not calling for an investigation that goes all the
[02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:28.950]  way up so they know our nature they know we love to take it Larry Fink knows we love for
[02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:34.390]  him to kill us we love for him to rape us and rob us and he wants to do it he just sees us as
[02:22:34.390 --> 02:22:40.710]  trash to be taken out it's disgusting cockroaches eating his pie and it's very very sad I
[02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:47.950]  appreciate your call and maybe Larry thinks better than everybody maybe he is a god we're
[02:22:47.950 --> 02:22:55.590]  here just to die in his wake we sure act like it so but know this you can be a doctor you can
[02:22:55.590 --> 02:23:01.990]  be a schoolteacher you me an FBI agent Larry thinks gonna kill you too clashwab's gonna kill
[02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:07.150]  you too so you pretend you're part of the power structure you're gonna die too they're
[02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:14.530]  gonna slowly cut your resources off too so just know that enjoy yourself let's talk to
[02:23:14.530 --> 02:23:19.570]  Patriot rep in Ohio you're on the air go ahead hey Alex it's great talking to you
[02:23:19.570 --> 02:23:26.170]  man I gotta tell you I'm one of your biggest supporters I'm running for second district out
[02:23:26.170 --> 02:23:32.750]  here in Ohio beautiful oh and I've actually got a link straight on my website at Patriot
[02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:37.770]  rep calm to go straight to band top video I'm also gonna put up one also for you just
[02:23:37.770 --> 02:23:43.310]  rent the war store and I didn't try to want to get off topic earlier with you about the
[02:23:44.310 --> 02:23:49.790]  we're talking about the COVID vaccine roll outside and the reason I didn't say anything
[02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:53.110]  about the COVID vaccine because you know what I'm not buying it I'm not taking a shot
[02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:57.430]  and people are people are awake they're not going to take them we're not going to take them
[02:23:57.430 --> 02:24:01.350]  but you try to talk to people to explain to people they don't even want to hear it
[02:24:01.350 --> 02:24:07.110]  they do not want to listen they don't want to hear the other side you know so to my
[02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:11.710]  point was like there's no point even try to talk to these people anymore but my question
[02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:20.550]  what nobody has addressed is I know that on the Maui fires Alex if you they talk about all
[02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:27.110]  these kids that are missing my question is where are these kids parents where are these kids
[02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:32.270]  uncles well that's the whole family whole families burn up and are dead and they don't
[02:24:32.270 --> 02:24:36.550]  want people to know because then they could get the property since the whole family's dead
[02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:42.190]  yeah but where are the where the outspoken I mean I mean we're the grandmothers the uncles
[02:24:42.190 --> 02:24:47.830]  that live in other states where is the outcry from these people where are they where are they
[02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:54.910]  we've been trained to submit and so that's a good question that's why there's a 12 mile
[02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:59.870]  exclusion zone because if grandma wants to come find their daughter well grandma's not allowed
[02:24:59.870 --> 02:25:04.070]  in we just killed your daughter lady you're gonna come talk to your daughter we just killed
[02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:08.910]  your grandkids we killed your wife we killed your husband we killed your ass she just lay
[02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:12.630]  down and take it that's why they kept him out they can't come find out where their family
[02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:16.150]  went they can't go to their house and find them burn up and dead or find them burn up and
[02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:20.830]  dead the car he was gonna bulldoze all that out while they $7,000 night millgate's
[02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:26.510]  hotel people out there on the ground they get these people heard you know get these
[02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:30.270]  families heard like you know we can't we don't even know where our kids are we don't know
[02:25:30.270 --> 02:25:35.310]  where our granddaughters is we don't know where my daughter is but I mean I appreciate all the
[02:25:35.310 --> 02:25:41.150]  work you do and are you saying are you saying you you've got family in Maui no no no no I'm just
[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:46.310]  saying you know that they're you know everybody that you know that all the people that died in
[02:25:46.310 --> 02:25:51.310]  Maui you know God be with them but you know I'm just saying you have people that don't live
[02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:55.950]  in Maui that had people live in Maui you know where where are they at you don't hear
[02:25:55.950 --> 02:26:02.110]  them on any on any talk shows or anything saying hey man I couldn't get to my kids I can't see my
[02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:06.950]  kids they won't tell me nothing you don't hear about and listen I need to go to Maui and I
[02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:12.470]  appreciate your call I'm gonna have to reach out to an outside media company to actually fund
[02:26:12.470 --> 02:26:21.590]  me to go because there's a limited travel budget here and I thought I control them for as I don't
[02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:29.150]  so we do Patriot Award shows and we do Barton Springs events and we do Las Vegas events so
[02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:36.470]  there's no money for me to go cover this mass murder and I'm not mad but because there's a CRO
[02:26:36.470 --> 02:26:41.470]  who's not really connected to it and the crew kind of does what they want so that's fine I'm
[02:26:41.470 --> 02:26:47.390]  gonna go and I'm gonna get outside funding outside of info Wars and I'm gonna go to Maui
[02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:52.270]  and I'm gonna cover it for someone else I'm being basically forced out of him for worse
[02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:59.390]  and it's okay but that's why I got one foot out the door I've really tried to stabilize this
[02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:06.270]  place I've really tried to work with people but it's just that it's it's it's a whole
[02:27:06.270 --> 02:27:14.710]  nother world in that it's not even the management that's the issue it's just that
[02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:23.790]  sometimes things get long in the tooth they just get long in the tooth and people love
[02:27:23.790 --> 02:27:29.050]  award shows they love it I don't I will never be part of it in fact I'm not doing any stadium
[02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:35.230]  events any award shows I'd rather be executed than be part of that because it doesn't do
[02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:50.030]  anything it does nothing and but people don't agree with me around here and I don't know
[02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:58.430]  how I'm not in control of my own company I'll be honest I'm not in control it's like there could
[02:27:58.430 --> 02:28:03.670]  be a flying saucers attack in New York City next week there'll be no budget for that but
[02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:09.070]  there's an award show you better damn believe will be there that no one watches nobody cares
[02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:15.270]  about and I'm not even against that it's fine like I'll leave here and info Wars can be one
[02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:22.670]  endless award show just 24-7 like Hollywood we'll have Oscars and stuff you know we'll we'll
[02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:29.590]  do that for everybody but I'll be long gone long gone and so I probably shouldn't be on
[02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:35.270]  air today cuz I don't feel well I'll be gone absolutely off everybody but uh I'll be damned
[02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:40.550]  to hell before I'm ever part of some award show or some Vegas thing you know everybody
[02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:44.070]  struts around all day long I'm not even against all that kind of crap it's just that

[02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:06.670]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:11.190]  us when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the
[02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:18.230]  writers they really have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:23.790]  Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really
[02:32:23.790 --> 02:32:29.270]  just incredible so for myself the whole enforce crew I thank you for your past support I only
[02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:33.990]  encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us
[02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:39.150]  I know you spread the word I know you pray for us that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers
[02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:44.070]  and listeners never go to enforce store comm you never buy great products that enrich and empower
[02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:48.630]  your life all the same time give us on air I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:53.430]  actually go buy products in for store comm if just 1% more of you took action and went to
[02:32:53.430 --> 02:33:00.150]  enforce or comm our funding problems will be over please take action now leading a frontal
[02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:04.750]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:36.750]  while other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next visit Infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today
[02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:55.750]  so please listen to me clearly if you remember about 10 days ago I came out and said according to my sources inside the federal government they've been told that new COVID protocols are going to be rolled back out starting September 15th through December and into next year for the election
[02:33:55.750 --> 02:34:07.750]  they were told first masking for TSA employees and other airport employees and that Biden would then do a mandate middle of October now that's what they were told right after I reported that news
[02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:21.750]  and the reason my story went so viral was because suddenly the same afternoon they rolled out a huge PR campaign that hospitals are shutting back down and colleges are making you wear masks and some public schools are closing and
[02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:40.750]  the protocols need to come back whether you were in Australia, the UK, Canada, the US, it was the same PR so I announced this in the first hour of my morning show on Friday two Fridays ago and then by five o'clock that evening they had their full roll out pushing it
[02:34:40.750 --> 02:35:09.750]  since then Biden has come out and said he wants multiple millions of dollars for a new COVID vaccine that's coming out September 15 same date the TSA whistleblower told me they were going to have masks put back on so there was a huge backlash to this and now the White House the CDC and the TSA as well have all come out and said no we don't have any plans to go back to lockdowns
[02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:26.750]  and then they have the fact checkers that by the way are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation it's that funny saying oh Jones said lockdowns by the fall no I said they'd like to get back to full COVID protocols is what I was told by December but the key here is they'd like to
[02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:51.750]  in my original announcement that went viral in that little five minute clip I said we have a chance to stop this they lied to us about masks being effective they lied to us about the origin of the virus they lied to us about the so called vaccines working that aren't even vaccines that are gene therapies that erase your immune system they lied to us at every level about oh if you take the shot you're protected and you can't spread it
[02:35:52.750 --> 02:36:06.750]  ladies and gentlemen I got a call yesterday an individual was in town and they are a high level manager in the TSA and they said you gotta warn people
[02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:24.750]  from TSA and Border Patrol have raised the alarm to info wars that the by administration is setting the stage for full covered lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions like masking TSA employees in mid September then by the middle of October they are going to
[02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:46.750]  say that everyone flying has to wear a mask and in the meetings people begin to ask them well I mean why is this happening they said well because of the new variant in Canada and because of the WHO they may you know declare this but regardless we've been told this is going to happen
[02:36:47.750 --> 02:37:09.750]  gloomy scientists call for people to start wearing COVID masks again as they sound alarm over a new variant AB16 that has lots of new mutations print that for me and then they were told we expect by December a return to the full COVID protocol of 2020 2021
[02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:24.750]  that's two federal agents that told me this yesterday and then I went and looked at the news and there they were saying Canada is looking at new restrictions again because of the variant and so is the EU and one of the Russians just put out three days ago
[02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:30.750]  US is plotting another pandemic Russian head of the defense ministry warns
[02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:45.750]  now new lockdowns will start the third world new lockdowns will destroy small businesses new lockdowns will take the average person that's already $5,000 in the hole and their paycheck is just on time will put them into full bankruptcy
[02:37:46.750 --> 02:37:53.750]  and the children in the mask and the attempt to push a new shot with a new variant and we're right back in the same hellhole
[02:37:56.750 --> 02:38:04.750]  we were in just a few years ago and why is it perfect timing because going to the election year
[02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:10.750]  and the last crisis go over two and a half years they'll bare minimum run this through the next election
[02:38:10.750 --> 02:38:25.750]  it's only 14 15 months out with mail-in ballots again we have all the eyewitnesses and testimony that they'd get the mail-in ballots and in some cases they were 99% for Joe Biden who believes that
[02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:36.750]  I said to be clear did they say this was hypothetical no we asked them we said how do you know they said well we can see with the testing it's going up it's already really bad
[02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:45.750]  so you have 20 million people dead from the shots you have all sorts of illnesses it's all gonna be blamed on COVID the heart attacks the myocarditis the blood clots the strokes
[02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:53.750]  because it's all kicking in now some people die in just a few days or a few weeks most people die years later
[02:38:54.750 --> 02:39:00.750]  so we're gonna have major death this winter when the vitamin D goes down the viruses that are already in them kick up
[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:06.750]  you've been implanted with a cocktail as Dr. Judy Mikovits exposed a few days ago of hundreds of these viruses
[02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:12.750]  when your body gets overwhelmed just like herpes keeps coming back over and over again when you're stressed
[02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:19.750]  they've implanted you with herpes SV40 cancer virus limes disease that's in the shots
[02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:24.750]  so are we gonna sit here and take this are we gonna sit here and lay out of this
[02:39:24.750 --> 02:39:33.750]  and let them put the narrative out and use the fear mongering and then it's the concerts and then it's the grocery stores and then it's the fear and all the same thing
[02:39:34.750 --> 02:39:39.750]  we're gonna go through Groundhog Day again we'll work hard to expose it it'll get us ahead of it
[02:39:40.750 --> 02:39:44.750]  but I gotta see your suspicion we'll be sitting here very soon going Alex Jones is right again
[02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:49.750]  let's not fail this time folks please please
[02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:58.750]  you actually can get more infected and spread it easier and statistically die more often if you have according to hundreds of studies
[02:39:59.750 --> 02:40:03.750]  so we're not getting back on this roller coaster again at least on a large part of us
[02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:07.750]  and so they were trying to incrementally bring it back in before we noticed
[02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:14.750]  and ordered the hotels and the different hospitality industries to tell their employees to start wearing them
[02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:21.750]  I opened the phones up on my show hundreds of calls last week of people being told indeed our hotel chain says the masks are coming back
[02:40:22.750 --> 02:40:28.750]  and then boom it was suddenly in the news some public schools have closed in places like Texas and New York
[02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:33.750]  again hospitals are bringing back the mask they're talking about vaccine passports again
[02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:39.750]  in fact a bunch of colleges are making you have the shots including the quote new one to be in the school
[02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:45.750]  even though it doesn't come out until get this of course September 15th
[02:40:46.750 --> 02:40:53.750]  so CDC denies COVID restrictions coming after bombshell Alex Jones exposes Biden's lockdown plan
[02:40:54.750 --> 02:40:59.750]  here's the AP article conspiracy theorist spreads false information about the return of COVID mandates
[02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:01.750]  even though they are returning in front of our faces
[02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:05.750]  they have science check COVID-19 vaccination project
[02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:09.750]  no support for viral claim that COVID-19 lockdowns are returning this fall
[02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:11.750]  and you know who funds this group?
[02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:14.750]  Bill and Melinda Gates fund the watchdog group
[02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:17.750]  isn't that a massive conflict of interest
[02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:19.750]  here's another one we'll play called the Biden
[02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:25.750]  breaking Biden regime to use 1.4 billion of taxpayer cash to make roll more COVID vaccines
[02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:28.750]  but he says this time it's gonna work
[02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:39.750]  Mr. President, can you say anything about the uptick of COVID cases and the variant?
[02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:44.750]  Yes I can, as a matter of fact I signed off this morning in a proposal we have
[02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:51.750]  to present to the Congress a request for additional funding for a new vaccine
[02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:54.750]  as necessary, that works
[02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:58.750]  and tentatively not decided finally yet
[02:41:59.750 --> 02:42:01.750]  tentatively it is recommended that
[02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:05.750]  everybody get no matter what they got this morning
[02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:09.750]  you gotta love how Biden took time out from being booed
[02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:13.750]  when he was in Nevada to walk up to a lady and tell her
[02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:17.750]  don't you worry, we're going to get you this new shot
[02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:19.750]  it's gonna work and everybody needs it
[02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:21.750]  and that's what they're now saying
[02:42:22.750 --> 02:42:24.750]  oh Gottlieb and all these board members of Pfizer
[02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:26.750]  who are also FDA board members
[02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:29.750]  are on television telling us that
[02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:32.750]  yep it's a yearly shot, COVID's never going away
[02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:34.750]  and you really need this shot
[02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:37.750]  here's another headline, is masking coming back?
[02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:40.750]  as new COVID variants emerge, here's what experts say
[02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:45.750]  so the truth is, I told the truth about those whistleblowers
[02:42:46.750 --> 02:42:47.750]  and then right after I announced it
[02:42:48.750 --> 02:42:51.750]  they had their program timed to roll out the same day
[02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:54.750]  incredible timing, so that's what supercharged
[02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:59.750]  a lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:02.750]  that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available
[02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:04.750]  and that's because the prices went up too high
[02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:07.750]  for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some
[02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:10.750]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us
[02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:13.750]  but now we have brought back the coffee
[02:43:14.750 --> 02:43:17.750]  and it's even better from a national supplier

[02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:01.750]  leading a frontal assault
[02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:03.750]  on the lies of the new world order
[02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:05.750]  it's Alex Jones
[02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:31.660]  I told the truth about those whistleblowers and then right after I announced it they
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:35.900]  had their program time to roll out the same day.
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:41.660]  So that's what supercharged our report because people could see my report come out in the morning
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:47.980]  and five six hours later every major channel in the western world rolled out oh we gotta make you wear
[02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:52.300]  masks oh hospitals are gonna have long lines again oh there's new variants oh there's a new
[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:59.340]  shot oh we gotta close these schools oh oh oh oh so here we are again but the good news is
[02:47:59.340 --> 02:48:04.540]  we're not taking it lying down there's a huge backlash ongoing and folks see through these
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:10.540]  denials but the fact that the White House and the CDC and the TSA are coming out and saying that
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:15.340]  there's no truth to what I said even though you see the robot in front of you shows that
[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:22.220]  they need you to unconsciously incrementally go back under the controls but if you're conscious
[02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:26.140]  of it and form opposition up front they'll never get to where they want it to go
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:32.060]  so that's the psychological warfare operation once you're aware of what their goal is to take
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:36.780]  control of your body to get this UN treaty through to set up a vaccine passport worldwide
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:40.860]  that's going to be assigned to the carbon tax the social credit score which is also run by
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:47.100]  Bill Gates the UN once you realize that you start resisting that they can't get it through
[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:52.540]  so any program they launch they need minimal resistance and people not conscious of it
[02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:56.220]  another great example is the second amendment when people didn't know that the government
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:49:00.460]  really wanted their guns to enslave them they were getting gun control passed victim disarmament
[02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:06.300]  now the general public knows the truth we're gaining back second amendment rights not losing them
[02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:11.180]  despite all their lust disarm us it's the same thing once we realize they want to control our
[02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:16.380]  bodies want to make us their biomedical slaves it's came over someone to salute the viewers
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:21.180]  salute the listeners and just tell them hey this is a great example for they try to roll
[02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:23.980]  stuff out in the future because you know they're not going to stop they're still going to try
[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:28.460]  this roll out to continue to educate people and bring up the fact that they lied to us
[02:49:29.180 --> 02:49:34.060]  about every facet of covid and their fact checkers are bought and paid for by the very people
[02:49:34.060 --> 02:49:39.420]  that launched the coven attack on humanity and again the only reason we were successful
[02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:44.460]  heading this off at the pass so far is because you are informed you remembered what
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:48.940]  happened and you've decided to not take it this time so i'll see you all on the front lines of
[02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:54.620]  the fight at the forbidden site info wars.com forward slash show in band video and i ask you
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:58.380]  to please let everybody else know that the forbidden show they're not supposed to hear or
[02:49:58.380 --> 02:50:03.340]  see and all the news they're not supposed to see is at info wars.com and info wars.com forward
[02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:09.100]  slash show now here's an example of how we peacefully resist the next phase of this rollout
[02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:14.380]  this is a shout out to everybody that works a normal job you're a cashier you're a receptionist
[02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:19.500]  or whatever last time covid came around we kind of gave you guys a pass for trying to
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:23.580]  enforce the mask up because we knew it wasn't really coming from you so we didn't want to
[02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:30.780]  ruin your day unfortunately we can't do that this time because the government's going to push
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:37.500]  us around through you so we have to push back through you unfortunately we're not going to allow
[02:50:37.500 --> 02:50:43.100]  the need and desire to be cordial and polite to destroy the need for us to do smart things
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:48.220]  and avoid stupid things like putting something on your face that's not actually effective so
[02:50:48.220 --> 02:50:51.980]  i we i don't want to do this no offense at all but just so you know
[02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:59.500]  we're not going to let it slide this time sorry about that no offense only love for you but you're
[02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:03.820]  going to catch these ideological hands and what i mean by that is you're going to learn everything
[02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:08.780]  about masks and how stupid what you're asking us to do is and we're going to demand to talk
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:12.540]  to your higher ups and they're going to get educated too that's the way it's going to work
[02:51:12.540 --> 02:51:16.300]  this time it's going to be awkward it's going to be real awkward but you know what's more
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:25.740]  awkward doing dumb that doesn't work in mass that's more awkward so sorry not sorry not happening
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:30.860]  i hope i don't have to talk to you about it but i'm gonna i'm looking for that five percent
[02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:36.620]  that's willing to stand up we're rapidly approaching that momentum point america has not
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:42.860]  been sold out by americans america has been sold out by traders and we've sold out america

[02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:53.020]  us they're going to create a crisis because they know that they can't deal with a real
[02:51:53.020 --> 02:51:58.700]  political backlash and and the restructuring and the reforming and getting back to the bill
[02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:04.140]  of rights and the constitution and the only government with a history of testing biological
[02:52:04.140 --> 02:52:09.260]  weapons is america they've done an inside america in the 50s and 60s that's what's

[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:37.520]  There used to be these great songs like that, but that's before my time. Summertime,
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:44.600]  summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime. And now it's one bad rap. Look at
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:53.120]  me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Like this country's gone down so low, man.
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:59.080]  Dancing in the street. No, no, no dancing in the street. You only put homeless in the
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:07.680]  street now. This is America. Calm down Cilente. Swallow the crap like the rest of us. You
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:13.440]  know, if only you would speak more properly like Obama or the other clowns,
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:19.520]  more people would listen to you because more people like to swallow crap coming out of the
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:28.920]  mouth of crapheads. Look at this decline in this country. Look at it. It breaks my heart.
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:38.040]  It breaks my heart. One time there used to be music and style and ha. Yeah, no more.
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:54.440]  Look at me. Look at me. Just like a slob. Got my hand on backwards. Yeah. And the slime balls,
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:02:03.360]  the little arrogant boys, slime balls and arrogant, mostly boys who run the record
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:09.280]  companies. All they care about is making money and they'll sell any kind of stupidity they want.
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:24.600]  Yeah. Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra. Yeah. Now a joke.
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:33.600]  Anyway, going back to AI, AI, the death of music and the beginning of the real death of
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:39.880]  America began with the internet revolution. That's right. Hey, we could synthesize the
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:46.680]  music. We don't got to hire no people that play our instrument. We want to make more money
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:47.840]  and this could do it.
[03:02:48.100 --> 03:03:14.270]  That was the beginning. The beginning of the end. And it just got worse. So, this whole AI thing coming up. The markets are going up because a lot of these stocks are going up in AI. Are they real? Is AI another dot-com bust?
[03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:21.300]  I was the first one to call the dot-com bust.
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:23.500]  Here it is in your Trends Journal.
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:34.380]  Fall issue, 1999, it used to be a quarterly magazine, now it's a weekly, it was 8 pages
[03:03:34.380 --> 03:03:42.540]  back then, now it averages over 160 pages, no ads, no one tells us what to do.
[03:03:42.540 --> 03:03:51.500]  .com this, .com overload will soon short circuit high expectations for used profits
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:59.140]  in internet commerce, entertainment and a wide array of .com services.
[03:03:59.140 --> 03:04:04.540]  Following the holiday season, many of today's high-flying internet stocks, the hottest IPOs,
[03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:11.480]  newly emerging IPO wannabes, have begun their descent from their overvalued heights.
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:17.020]  We warned that the .com bust would happen by the second quarter of 2000.
[03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:20.140]  I am the first guy to do it.
[03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:25.060]  I also took out the domain name, the Panic of 08 in November 2007.
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:35.640]  Yeah, I got best-selling books, Trends 2000, no thing or two about this.
[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:37.900]  So where's the AI going?
[03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:42.020]  We're going to tell you where it's going when we come back, but first I want to say
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:51.000]  how grateful I am and love being on InfoWars, where you hear the truth being spoken.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:58.180]  So do what you can to support InfoWars because they're supporting you, got it?
[03:04:58.180 --> 03:05:03.000]  It's been three years since we had it, we got it back in stock, the amazing 30 parts
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:07.120]  per million, highest quality colloidal silver and all the great things and all the great
[03:05:07.120 --> 03:05:16.440]  uses, back in stock, limited supply, infowarstore.com, 30% off, and it's a very limited supply,
[03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:23.240]  but we have it back, infowarstore.com, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, the InfoWars Live
[03:05:23.240 --> 03:05:29.520]  Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has returned, Silver Bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive
[03:05:29.520 --> 03:05:34.840]  search for a powerful colloidal silver product that utilizes high quality processes to ensure
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:40.280]  for a truly unique product that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.
[03:05:40.280 --> 03:05:48.000]  It is amazing, it's got thousands of reviews, 5 star reviews, infowarstore.com, Silver
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:53.400]  Bullet returns to infowarstore.com, and while you're there get some super female
[03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:57.600]  vitality, some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:25.560]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show, and I really honor everybody, I go to InfoWars
[03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:29.360]  every day, I want to see what they're talking about, what articles they're hitting,
[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:34.760]  what major stories, and they're hitting a lot of on-trend things before anybody else.
[03:06:34.760 --> 03:06:38.640]  You know, again, people, you know, I get these things, you know, that I'm angry,
[03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:39.480]  you bet I'm angry.
[03:06:40.100 --> 03:07:00.980]  He who is not angry when there is just cause to anger is immoral. Why? Because anger looks
[03:07:00.980 --> 03:07:09.380]  to the good of justice. And if you live amid injustice without anger, you are immoral
[03:07:09.380 --> 03:07:19.060]  as well as unjust. That's by Saint Thomas Aquinas. But you know, they probably don't want to say this
[03:07:19.060 --> 03:07:28.820]  anymore because he who is not angry, you should say she, her or he, his who is not angry. Let's
[03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:40.900]  really be stupid. So going on, and why we need to support info wars. And of course, if you want
[03:07:41.460 --> 03:07:47.780]  the truth in trends, you want the Trends Journal, a grand total of less than $2 and change a week
[03:07:47.780 --> 03:07:54.660]  when you subscribe to Alex Jones. The American people don't believe anything until they see it
[03:07:54.660 --> 03:08:04.260]  on television. That was the warmonger Watergate cat, Richard Nixon. They swallow the crap coming
[03:08:04.260 --> 03:08:09.460]  out of the mouth of prostitutes, media whores who get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:12.500]  their government warmasters. You ready for this?
[03:08:12.700 --> 03:08:24.960]  We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the public believes
[03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:32.820]  is false. Sounds like George Goebbels, huh? No. Oh, George Goebbels, you mean that guy
[03:08:32.820 --> 03:08:38.720]  Sullivan who plays our national security adviser, looks like his great great grandson?
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:46.800]  No, not George Goebbels. I left the word out. I'm going to reread it. We'll know our disinformation
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:55.900]  program is complete when everything the American public believes is false. William J. Casey,
[03:08:55.900 --> 03:09:02.940]  CIA director, 1981 under Reagan. All right? All right?
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:11.920]  Disinformation. No, when you don't believe what they're saying, it's misinformation.
[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:14.400]  When you don't swallow Casey crap.
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:20.500]  You arrogant boy!
[03:09:20.500 --> 03:09:22.060]  May you rot in hell!
[03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:26.660]  Selling the people lives?
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:41.040]  Yeah! We're the government! You do what we tell you! I'm Arrogant Gavin Newsom! I'm daddy's
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:50.740]  boy Andy Cuomo! I'm Whitless Whitmere! I'm the line from Ohio! We'll tell you what to
[03:09:50.740 --> 03:09:58.700]  do! Oh, and Trump's Operation Warp Speed! Can't forget that one! Oh, and Biden and Harris
[03:09:58.700 --> 03:10:04.060]  saying that, oh, we won't support, we wrote this in the Trends Journal, going back before
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:09.260]  the elections in 2020. They said, no, no, we won't support that vaccination, it's come
[03:10:09.260 --> 03:10:16.740]  out too quick! Oh yeah? And then after they got elected, no jab, no job. Yeah.
[03:10:16.740 --> 03:10:21.300]  These are the clowns we've got running our show. So now, I said I was going to talk about
[03:10:21.700 --> 03:10:45.390]  what's going on in A.I. and it's big and it's real. Yeah, this is an article last week from the Toilet Paper Record in New York Times. Look how big this is. Stroke silenced her. A.I. is helping her talk. So is A.I. the next dot com bust?
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:46.400]  A.I.
[03:10:47.700 --> 03:10:55.000]  The demand for A.I. chips lists Nvidia's sales to record high.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:58.560]  The sales are to record high.
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:00.340]  This is real.
[03:11:00.340 --> 03:11:12.860]  A.I., chat, GPT, trends are born, they grow, they mature, reach old age, and die.
[03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:15.300]  This has just been born.
[03:11:15.300 --> 03:11:21.660]  I remember when the internet revolution began in 1994, really started taking off.
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:27.880]  It was just the beginning.
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:32.080]  When the dot-com bust came, they were making up crap.
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:34.800]  That made no sense.
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:38.519]  And that's when I forecast, no, these things are going to go down.
[03:11:38.519 --> 03:11:43.939]  But everybody believed it because they were speaking this new language of another line
[03:11:43.939 --> 03:11:45.039]  of BS.
[03:11:45.100 --> 03:11:45.920]  This is different. This AI, matter of fact, is one of our top trends for 2023. AI, we own you. And the people that are going to be losing the jobs, according to the data coming out, are not low-paid workers. They're middle-class and higher-end paid workers.
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:17.900]  So this thing is real.
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:22.000]  And it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[03:12:22.100 --> 03:12:38.900]  And, and, I tell the youngest people on my staff, learn everything you can about this
[03:12:38.900 --> 03:12:41.460]  AI.
[03:12:41.460 --> 03:12:43.500]  Everything you can.
[03:12:43.500 --> 03:12:49.340]  Understand chat, understand it to the highest, highest, highest level you can.
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:51.180]  This is an on-trend-preneur.
[03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:52.620]  Like it, hate it.
[03:12:52.620 --> 03:12:57.020]  When you forecast trends, it's not what you want, what you wish for, what you like.
[03:12:57.020 --> 03:12:58.980]  It's what is.
[03:12:58.980 --> 03:13:04.040]  Again, trends are born, they mature, reach old age and die.
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:06.920]  This has just been born.
[03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:14.720]  This is one of the biggest on-trend-preneur opportunities in the coming lifetime.
[03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:18.300]  That's of course if the world doesn't come to an end because of the crazy people we
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:24.020]  got running the show that may start a nuclear war because they're out of their minds and
[03:13:24.020 --> 03:13:27.180]  you don't ask crazy people why they're out of their minds.
[03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:39.420]  Name the country. You're Biden. Oh, that's a stray cat, man. Solid as can be, man. Yeah.
[03:13:39.420 --> 03:13:44.880]  Netanyahu over there in Israel did away with the judiciary reform. When all else fails,
[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:51.800]  they take you to war. Little Katzon Macron over there in France, the little peckerhead
[03:13:51.800 --> 03:13:59.840]  of nothing. When all else fails, they take you to war. But other than that, stay on the
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:07.220]  AI. Learn everything you can about it in every different way. This unfortunately is the future.
[03:14:07.220 --> 03:14:14.480]  I mentioned how they killed music. It's dead. Dead. I hear the same damn beat every time
[03:14:14.480 --> 03:14:22.039]  I go into a restaurant. Find place in anything. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Boy, I
[03:14:22.039 --> 03:14:32.779]  never heard that beat before. One time the cats got dressed up hot and play. Yeah. And
[03:14:32.779 --> 03:14:38.820]  now it's gone. One bad rap. So this AI is going to take over. So going into the
[03:14:38.820 --> 03:14:46.580]  investment strategies, the markets are not going to get to have a lousy August and we're
[03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:53.519]  forecasting a worse September. And the crash may definitely come, I shouldn't say definitely
[03:14:53.519 --> 03:15:01.220]  with May, looks very high likely to come in October because you got your treasuries
[03:15:01.220 --> 03:15:08.080]  and your money markets. Yeah. Why should I gamble in the equity markets when I'm getting
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:10.779]  over 5% interest on my money?
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:17.760]  I got no risk or hardly any risk.
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:25.160]  We got a great article that's coming out this week, a special trend alert by Gregory Manarino
[03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:30.280]  on what's going on in the banking system and all the money that's being drawn out.
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:35.360]  That's only the beginning of it, only the beginning of it, because there's going to
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:40.080]  be the office building bust that's going to break down the banks like nothing else
[03:15:40.080 --> 03:15:41.880]  we've seen in modern history.
[03:15:41.880 --> 03:15:48.920]  And again, we're going to take a break, get it straight, do everything you can to support
[03:15:48.920 --> 03:15:49.920]  Infowars.
[03:15:49.920 --> 03:15:51.920]  They got great products.
[03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:55.560]  They help Infowars and they help you.
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:16:01.760]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars Store and Infowars Life not in a probiotic
[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:02.760]  for more than three years?
[03:16:02.760 --> 03:16:04.160]  The answer is simple.
[03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:07.080]  We only bring you the highest quality, the lowest prices.
[03:16:07.080 --> 03:16:11.240]  We had a top maker, top certified probiotics for more than seven years.
[03:16:11.240 --> 03:16:16.520]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones,
[03:16:16.520 --> 03:16:17.520]  anymore.
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:22.080]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our
[03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:23.080]  show.
[03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:26.960]  We're able to private label it under Infowars MD as our probiotic formula.
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:32.760]  So you can get a super high quality probiotic for amazing gut health and more at InfowarsStore.com

[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:42.240]  I think you're going to have an amazing effect and it funds our entire operation.

[03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:01.880]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the
[03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:06.280]  insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:10.600]  You are crazy in my view, if you don't get high quality storeable food and water filtration
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:11.600]  and self-defense.
[03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:13.760]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:16.280]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:20.360]  And I'm preaching the choir on that, but a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they
[03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:23.280]  don't have enough storeable food or water filtration.
[03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:27.380]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the
[03:17:27.380 --> 03:17:31.280]  high quality water filtration department, the highest quality food, the best water
[03:17:31.280 --> 03:17:35.240]  filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.

[03:17:45.800 --> 03:17:48.040]  Our prices are already the lowest at 10% off.
[03:17:48.040 --> 03:17:50.000]  It's an insane deal for a limited time.

[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:00.620]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most
[03:18:00.660 --> 03:18:03.620]  concentrated high quality bone broth there is.
[03:18:03.620 --> 03:18:09.740]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[03:18:09.740 --> 03:18:15.140]  dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just
[03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:16.860]  gets crazier from there.
[03:18:16.860 --> 03:18:17.980]  It's about to sell out.
[03:18:17.980 --> 03:18:19.520]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:21.500]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:02.600]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[03:19:02.600 --> 03:19:06.280]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not
[03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:11.760]  get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:16.320]  But now we've got it, 30 parts per million from the top lab, we've got a limited

[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:33.400]  And now, your host, Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:43.400]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show. Again, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime.
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:51.119]  My favorite one was, school is out at last, and I'm so glad I passed. Yeah, I hated every
[03:20:51.119 --> 03:21:00.039]  day of school. Anyway, but again, summertime used to be fun. I mentioned this before. I'll
[03:21:00.039 --> 03:21:03.880]  mention it again. This is from Bloomberg, so you can't call it misinformation. And I
[03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:10.720]  find that sexist calling it misinformation. Why, that's terrible. Let's call it gender
[03:21:10.720 --> 03:21:11.480]  information.
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:22.080]  Gen Z is searching for sad music on Spotify technology essay more than any other generation,
[03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:31.000]  leading the streaming platform to dub the past few months as bummer summer.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  Bummer summer, you know why it's a bummer summer?
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:43.320]  Because it's brought to you by the bums, the lousy, low-life bums that have destroyed this
[03:21:43.320 --> 03:21:46.320]  country, sucked the joy out of life.
[03:21:46.320 --> 03:21:54.040]  Hey, all you politicians, all you little boys and girls that were class presidents
[03:21:54.040 --> 03:22:01.140]  and head of the student council in college and kept on going, once upon a time, but
[03:22:01.140 --> 03:22:06.100]  you're all too stupid and arrogant to know this.
[03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:13.980]  It was a thing called the Declaration of Independence, and it was about life, liberty, and the pursuit
[03:22:13.980 --> 03:22:14.980]  of happiness.
[03:22:14.980 --> 03:22:15.980]  Happiness?
[03:22:15.980 --> 03:22:16.980]  Why, how dare you?
[03:22:16.980 --> 03:22:17.980]  Lock down your business.
[03:22:17.980 --> 03:22:18.980]  Stay at home.
[03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:29.500]  Your mother's dying, your father's dying, your brother's dying, your friend's dying.
[03:22:29.500 --> 03:22:34.180]  You can't go into the hospital or nursing home to go see him.
[03:22:34.180 --> 03:22:37.820]  I'm in charge.
[03:22:37.820 --> 03:22:40.740]  I'm an American.
[03:22:40.740 --> 03:22:46.260]  A-M-E-R-I-K-A-N.
[03:22:46.260 --> 03:22:47.980]  Yeah.
[03:22:47.980 --> 03:22:49.460]  Look at this.
[03:22:49.460 --> 03:22:53.700]  I'm reading in this article, oh, Cilenti, use proper language.
[03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:56.660]  Suck the crap that we suck.
[03:22:56.660 --> 03:22:59.500]  Be one of the sad people.
[03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:05.020]  Yeah, it's right there.
[03:23:05.020 --> 03:23:07.140]  Right there.
[03:23:07.140 --> 03:23:16.700]  Sad is Gen Z's most searched term on Spotify, the audio service said in a blog post last
[03:23:16.700 --> 03:23:17.700]  Monday.
[03:23:17.700 --> 03:23:18.300]  Yep.
[03:23:18.500 --> 03:23:22.300]  Isn't that great?
[03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:29.320]  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:23:29.320 --> 03:23:35.760]  One time, America, man, even the blues had an upside to them, you know?
[03:23:35.760 --> 03:23:36.760]  Not anymore.
[03:23:36.760 --> 03:23:44.880]  Again, just one bad rap, eh, eh, don't know what to say, eh, eh, look at me, look at
[03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:50.320]  me, eh, eh, yeah, yeah.
[03:23:50.320 --> 03:24:01.160]  So going back to the economy, it's very serious what's going on, we're gonna be putting
[03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:08.960]  out an article by Gregory Manarino, rungs on banks are going on right now, but let's
[03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:12.000]  keep it quiet.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:16.380]  I mentioned to you before why people aren't, one of the reasons they're putting money
[03:24:16.380 --> 03:24:17.880]  in the bank.
[03:24:17.880 --> 03:24:23.960]  Why should I when I'm getting, again, almost 5% more put on treasuries or money market funds?
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:28.920]  So this is just from Bloomberg, just got it when I took the break.
[03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:35.880]  An auction of two-year treasury notes Monday, today, drew the highest yield since 2006.
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:42.240]  Oh, 2006, the market's crashed in 2008, that was the lead up, right, oh yeah.
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:47.520]  Reflecting the U.S. bond market sell-off that deepened last week in anticipation of another
[03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:49.400]  Federal Reserve rate increase.
[03:24:51.300 --> 03:24:52.300]  So there you got it. Two-year yields climbed nearly 14 basis points last week, including on Friday. So, people are going to be taking their money out of the stock markets. It's a safe bet to buy a money market funder a treasury, and you know you're getting income coming in. You're not gambling.
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:33.300]  So, when we're looking at this, we're looking at the big picture. And again, I'm not bragging.
[03:25:33.300 --> 03:25:36.860]  If you could find me a better magazine than the Trends Journal that gives you in-depth
[03:25:36.860 --> 03:25:45.900]  socioeconomic and geopolitical trend forecasts from high-tech to AI to technocracy by Joe
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:52.340]  Duran, the top, top, top, top technocracy cat who knows what's going on. Here's one of his
[03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:59.900]  books. Look how thick it is. Be human. You get this, by the way, on Amazon. Joe Duran
[03:25:59.900 --> 03:26:03.540]  does that with technocracy. We're giving you everything we can, and we're giving you
[03:26:03.540 --> 03:26:08.300]  the trends before they happen. And now they're talking about them. We warned about this.
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:17.760]  It's in fact in data. You ready? Oh, today. Eurozone recession seems likely as business
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:24.500]  activity slows. Son of a gun would have never known. Blow me away. Oh, you mean
[03:26:24.500 --> 03:26:30.660]  you kept raising interest rates out of artificially low for how many years? You
[03:26:30.660 --> 03:26:36.020]  didn't start raising interest rates until July of last year, and the economy can't
[03:26:36.020 --> 03:26:40.300]  take it? And you had this thing called quantitative easing, where you're buying
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:47.620]  government and corporate bonds? Oh, you call yourself a democracy, run by the
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:53.660]  central banksters? How about fascism, the merger of state and corporate
[03:26:53.660 --> 03:26:58.220]  powers? There's a paisano of mine that I'm not too fond of, Benito
[03:26:58.220 --> 03:27:04.180]  Mussolini called it. And that's all it is. This thing's going down big
[03:27:04.180 --> 03:27:12.740]  and hot. Germany facing zero growth. Who said that? Oh, Bundesbank. Oh, wow.
[03:27:12.740 --> 03:27:18.660]  Startup funding shrinks in Europe. Blow me away. Would have never known it.
[03:27:18.660 --> 03:27:26.860]  We've been warning about this. We are headed for the worst socioeconomic and
[03:27:26.860 --> 03:27:33.660]  geopolitical crisis in modern history. And hopefully, we'll live to see a change.
[03:27:34.420 --> 03:27:38.420]  And I say hopefully because hope is the most negative word in the metaphysical
[03:27:38.420 --> 03:27:43.900]  dictionary. It means wanting to do something without doing anything. And
[03:27:43.900 --> 03:27:49.620]  Infowars and all the great staff that work so hard, they're doing it. We're
[03:27:49.620 --> 03:27:54.500]  doing it at the Trends Journal. We're putting out information, trend
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:58.460]  forecast, you're not going to find anywhere else. We're doing it. What are
[03:27:58.460 --> 03:28:06.140]  you doing? What are you doing mentally, socially and spiritually? Who
[03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:07.380]  are you supporting?
[03:28:07.500 --> 03:28:15.300]  What are you doing to change the course of history, that if it doesn't go in a different
[03:28:15.300 --> 03:28:20.540]  direction to a 180 from where we are, Jack, you're dead?
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:29.400]  Yeah. You want these water filters that Infowars is selling, or you want to keep drinking
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:36.619]  of filthy water? And you can dump, hey, we got all these PCBs over here in the Hudson
[03:28:36.619 --> 03:28:42.199]  River where I am, thanks to General Electric. General Electric here. I'm a member of the
[03:28:42.199 --> 03:28:50.000]  military industrial complex, sir. Yeah. So we're going to take a break. Be right back.
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:58.880]  Your Infowars because they're supporting you. The wicked plot against the righteous and
[03:28:58.880 --> 03:29:04.960]  gnash their teeth at them. But the Lord laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming.
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:09.560]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:14.400]  those whose ways are upright. But their swords will pierce their own hearts and
[03:29:14.400 --> 03:29:19.199]  their bows will be broken. Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of
[03:29:19.199 --> 03:29:24.240]  any wicked. For the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[03:29:24.240 --> 03:29:30.119]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever.
[03:29:30.119 --> 03:29:37.199]  In times of disaster, they will not wither. In days of famine, they will have plenty. But
[03:29:37.199 --> 03:29:41.599]  the wicked will perish. Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field,
[03:29:41.599 --> 03:29:45.000]  they will be consumed and they will develop in smoke.
[03:29:49.199 --> 03:30:01.599]  It's been three years since we had it. We got it back in stock. The amazing 30 parts

[03:32:07.400 --> 03:32:10.599]  but when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,

[03:33:22.080 --> 03:33:28.160]  We're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.160 --> 03:33:36.680]  Great being on The Alex Jones Show and really, it's terrific because there's the one and
[03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:42.160]  only Alex Jones and a great team of people there that have given you what they feel
[03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:50.800]  is the truth of what's going on and providing the facts to support it.
[03:33:50.800 --> 03:33:56.400]  So they're giving you the facts to support it and what you need to do, if you want to,
[03:33:56.400 --> 03:34:01.960]  is to support Infowars and they're doing it as much as they can by giving you breaks on
[03:34:01.960 --> 03:34:08.200]  all these great products that not only help you, you help Infowars, it's that 360 win.

[03:34:11.880 --> 03:34:13.760]  these health products, natural healing.
[03:34:13.760 --> 03:34:16.320]  By the way, that was the first book I worked on.
[03:34:16.320 --> 03:34:19.920]  This was a Warner book, a big book back in the day, Natural Healing.
[03:34:19.920 --> 03:34:23.880]  I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences to work I've
[03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:32.520]  done and right now they have their bodies and it's a perfect answer to whole body support

[03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:39.880]  of years.
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:46.680]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today and this says it's paired with
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:52.680]  black pepper and bodies is a turmeric supplement and what it does is it takes advantage of
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:59.760]  the turmeric with over 95% of its active ingredients and again, turmeric contains some
[03:34:59.760 --> 03:35:08.680]  of the most powerful antioxidants and you need them in this very oxidant, dibioxidant
[03:35:08.680 --> 03:35:13.320]  world and so they paired it with other powerful ingredients including five different
[03:35:13.320 --> 03:35:18.840]  herbs and extracts and it gives you the ultimate boost for you and your family and you really
[03:35:18.840 --> 03:35:22.080]  need to do this in this very poisonous world.
[03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:28.320]  With these ingredients bodies, again, it's a 360 win and that helps you with joint
[03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:34.080]  support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, a whole great bunch
[03:35:34.080 --> 03:35:42.200]  of ingredients, turmeric, organic spearmint sage, extract from black pepper and anyway
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:46.640]  a whole bunch of stuff so don't wait because again, these things go out of stock really
[03:35:46.640 --> 03:35:56.680]  quick and you support your immune system and you also support info wars with bodies
[03:35:56.680 --> 03:35:59.680]  and it's back.
[03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:05.480]  So where I left off was talking about what in the world is going on with the economy
[03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:10.760]  and again, I'm not bragging but I'll put my trend forecasting track record up against
[03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:13.200]  anybody in the world.
[03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:17.960]  Show me your books, show me your magazines, show me your trend forecast so we can start
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:19.800]  to talk.
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:24.920]  Go back to 1987, that's how I made my name as a trend forecast when I forecast
[03:36:24.920 --> 03:36:27.400]  the 1987 stock market crash.
[03:36:27.900 --> 03:36:39.000]  The Asian currency crisis, the dot-com bust, the panic of 2008, again I took the domain
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:40.800]  name out in 2007.
[03:36:40.800 --> 03:36:41.800]  I got it wrong.
[03:36:41.800 --> 03:36:47.640]  I thought things would crash again in 2012, but they didn't teach me about a thing called
[03:36:47.640 --> 03:36:54.199]  quantitative easing with zero and negative interest rate policy in economics 101 in graduate
[03:36:54.199 --> 03:36:55.199]  school.
[03:36:55.199 --> 03:37:01.920]  So the banks, the gangsters will make anything up to forge when we pop up the system.
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:05.039]  So what I'm saying what's going to happen next is based on the facts and they could
[03:37:05.039 --> 03:37:09.960]  pull any kind of dirty game they want and again, one of my most concerned one is when
[03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:14.500]  all else fails, they take you to war, but I was reading some headlines to show you
[03:37:14.500 --> 03:37:19.160]  how bad it is and again, it's summertime and the people don't know what's going on.
[03:37:19.160 --> 03:37:22.720]  They're in a vacation state of mind and even when it's not summertime, they're in
[03:37:22.720 --> 03:37:24.840]  no detailed state of mind.
[03:37:24.840 --> 03:37:28.440]  They just buy the BS floating out of the TV.
[03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:33.520]  Again, Richard Nixon, the American people don't believe anything until they see it on
[03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:35.520]  television.
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:40.640]  German business confidence slides, all right?
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:46.820]  Eurozone business downturns increase, uncertainty continues, all right?
[03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:51.000]  And then we go to America.
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:54.039]  This was out last Wednesday.
[03:37:54.039 --> 03:37:59.400]  Landlords with $1.2 trillion of debt face rising default risks.
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:05.600]  I mentioned the article that's coming out from Gregory Manarino about the banks.
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:07.440]  This is just the beginning.
[03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:11.920]  The banking crisis that began last March has just begun.
[03:38:11.920 --> 03:38:19.539]  The Silicon Valley bank, Silicon Con Men bank, first republic, yeah, those, the three
[03:38:19.539 --> 03:38:24.760]  of them, just the beginning.
[03:38:24.760 --> 03:38:26.840]  Offices are the biggest near-term problem.
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:39.400]  They go on to state. Office values have tumbled 31% from their peak in the March of 2022 when
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:46.260]  the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates according to property analysis from Green
[03:38:46.260 --> 03:38:47.260]  Street.
[03:38:47.260 --> 03:38:54.880]  2022, how stupid can you be? Guess you never subscribe to the Trends Journal. We warned
[03:38:54.880 --> 03:39:00.860]  about the office building bust. When they began to lock down, the geeks were the first
[03:39:00.860 --> 03:39:09.820]  to do it. Again, the Silicon Valley Bank bust, all the IPOs and the SPACs and all the stuff
[03:39:09.820 --> 03:39:14.800]  they were pumping up because they were locking down everything. You got to work from home.
[03:39:14.800 --> 03:39:19.200]  You got to live at home. You can't go out. You got to go online. Our business is going
[03:39:19.200 --> 03:39:25.280]  to boom. We don't need all this office spaces because our business is booming while you
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:25.960]  are Zooming.
[03:39:26.100 --> 03:39:32.140]  And then people are commuting an hour and a half back and forth to work, and they're
[03:39:32.140 --> 03:39:36.300]  staying home week after week, month after month. They're saying, I'll be getting up at five
[03:39:36.300 --> 03:39:42.580]  o'clock in the morning to go to work. I'm not doing this anymore. I'll work from home.
[03:39:42.580 --> 03:39:48.420]  And I'm the employer, and I got 20 stories in a building. I say, yeah, work at home.
[03:39:48.420 --> 03:39:53.100]  I don't have 20 stories in beautiful buildings in Kingston, New York. Yeah, work at home.
[03:39:53.100 --> 03:39:57.660]  I don't need all this space. You're going to see, you know what? The prices, they were
[03:39:57.660 --> 03:40:09.140]  so stupid, they were still buying buildings in 2022. How dumb could you be? Hey, we're
[03:40:09.140 --> 03:40:16.460]  not dumb. We're gamblers and we're members of the gang. We don't look at the facts.
[03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:17.940]  All we want to do is make money.
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:40.460]  Ready? Wall Street Journal. Again, rewriting about week one in March of 2020, this would happen in your trends journal, trendsjournal.com. Office tenants recommit for less room. Yep.
[03:40:40.500 --> 03:40:51.780]  Tricking leases sizes are another blow to office owners during one of the industry's worst slumps
[03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:56.020]  since World War II. Oh, World War II, when all the guys are fighting overseas and everything's
[03:40:56.020 --> 03:41:02.280]  closed, you got no business yet. That slump is hurting cities, wiping out billions of
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:09.180]  dollars in property values and putting pressure on the banking system. Oh, that's buried
[03:41:09.180 --> 03:41:15.660]  in here. All right. But that's how they end it. Oh, putting pressure on the banking system.
[03:41:15.660 --> 03:41:20.780]  Oh, a little pressure? No, a crash like you've never seen before. And it's the medium and
[03:41:20.780 --> 03:41:25.660]  small size banks that have most of these loans. So the bigs will get bigger. Yeah,
[03:41:25.660 --> 03:41:30.900]  the Jamie Dimon, the J.P. Morgan Chase, five felonies. Hey, we don't go to jail only
[03:41:30.900 --> 03:41:38.220]  you go to jail. Five felonies, they convicted him. J.P. Morgan Chase. The number, are
[03:41:38.220 --> 03:41:43.660]  you ready for this? The number of companies requiring workers to be in the office full
[03:41:43.660 --> 03:41:54.120]  time. Thirty nine percent, thirty nine percent of the companies are requiring people
[03:41:54.120 --> 03:41:55.220]  to come back full time.
[03:41:55.400 --> 03:41:58.400]  This is according to scoop.
[03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:06.240]  In January, it was nearly 50% that we're requiring.
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:10.320]  It's gone down 10%, all right?
[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:15.600]  Now, what they don't talk about...
[03:42:15.900 --> 03:42:22.660]  ...is all the businesses that depended...
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:26.700]  ...on commuters.
[03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:33.700]  Hey, it's great to take the subway in New York. It's a night in Calcutta.
[03:42:33.700 --> 03:42:38.700]  Oh yeah, remember there was this, oh again, Duke Ellington. Yeah, I know, most people never heard of him.
[03:42:38.700 --> 03:42:47.700]  Take the A train. Da, da, da, da, da, da. Take the A train to Harlem. Yep.
[03:42:47.700 --> 03:42:53.700]  Now it's a hate train. Dead train. It'll be better. Stay tuned.

[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:31.080]  right place.
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:38.000]  You know, we talk about what we're giving you at such a low price, it's a lousy cup of coffee
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:42.400]  a week for a Trends Journal, like $2.86 a week.
[03:47:42.400 --> 03:47:44.840]  This is the cover of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:47:44.840 --> 03:47:45.840]  Ready?
[03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:56.600]  Look at this, $5, $5 a day, again, the Trends Journal, $2.86 a week, and if you
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:48:02.480]  get it from Infowars, even less.
[03:48:02.480 --> 03:48:05.640]  Eight trapped in cable car saved.
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:14.800]  Look at this, what do I care about eight people trapped in a cable car that is saved?
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:22.220]  I'm paying $5, I want information that I could use, this is supposed to be a newspaper
[03:48:22.220 --> 03:48:29.100]  about economic and financial data, and that's the whole back page of this front page.
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:33.200]  Nothing.
[03:48:33.900 --> 03:48:39.260]  So going on, I was talking about the office building bust.
[03:48:39.260 --> 03:48:41.699]  You ready for this?
[03:48:41.699 --> 03:48:43.260]  In Philadelphia.
[03:48:43.260 --> 03:48:44.420]  Yeah.
[03:48:44.500 --> 03:48:50.420]  Filthy Delphia, they got it wrong.
[03:48:50.420 --> 03:48:51.960]  They spelt it wrong.
[03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:56.740]  It's not Philadelphia, it's Filthy Delphia.
[03:48:56.740 --> 03:49:01.380]  Yeah in those areas where all the drugged out cats are all over the place, it wasn't
[03:49:01.380 --> 03:49:03.820]  like this before they began the COVID war.
[03:49:03.900 --> 03:49:08.820]  No, that wasn't going on before.
[03:49:08.820 --> 03:49:16.240]  There weren't gangs of guys and girls going into Nordstrom and other places robbing stuff.
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:18.020]  That didn't happen before the COVID war.
[03:49:18.100 --> 03:49:21.660]  Anyway, you ready?
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:28.980]  Castle, these castle systems, which I quote often,
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:42.680]  back to work barometer shows Philadelphia's office occupancy rate hovering around 40% and
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:45.960]  under 40% in some weeks during the summer.
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:50.000]  Yep.
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:56.520]  Isn't that great?
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:49:57.520]  New York City?
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:01.600]  45%
[03:50:02.100 --> 03:50:11.020]  Dallas and Austin, 50% to 65%.
[03:50:11.020 --> 03:50:14.580]  Fortune magazine.
[03:50:14.580 --> 03:50:23.180]  Real estate billionaires said that Fridays are dead forever for office and remote work
[03:50:23.180 --> 03:50:31.020]  guru, oh and remote work guru, Nick Bloom says he's right.
[03:50:31.020 --> 03:50:36.500]  Oh, if Nick Bloom says he's right and this guy's saying it, then I must believe it.
[03:50:36.500 --> 03:50:47.380]  We only said this in the Trends Journal back in March of 2020 when they began the lockdowns.
[03:50:47.400 --> 03:50:58.119]  Friday has become the day to something with it.
[03:50:58.200 --> 03:51:19.480]  So I'm saying the businesses that have been hurt by this, this is deep and that's only
[03:51:19.480 --> 03:51:20.480]  one thing.
[03:51:20.480 --> 03:51:27.720]  Here, this is a story from the week that Drudge, which is nothing anymore, put up.
[03:51:27.720 --> 03:51:31.240]  Don't put up our stuff or put up the week.
[03:51:31.240 --> 03:51:42.960]  A whole article, three pages of printout, from bottom to bust, the story of San Francisco.
[03:51:42.960 --> 03:51:51.080]  Not one word in here that the bust was caused by the geeks and the arrogant clown politicians
[03:51:51.080 --> 03:51:54.240]  that locked the joint down.
[03:51:54.240 --> 03:51:58.540]  The damage that's been done by the COVID war is incalculable.
[03:51:58.540 --> 03:52:02.820]  And everybody that I talk to calls it a pandemic.
[03:52:02.820 --> 03:52:05.100]  It was not a pandemic.
[03:52:05.100 --> 03:52:12.100]  The World Health Organization, or the World Horror Organization, I forget how they say
[03:52:12.100 --> 03:52:26.480]  it right, called it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, when 4,219 people died, allegedly of
[03:52:26.480 --> 03:52:31.180]  COVID in 114 countries.
[03:52:31.180 --> 03:52:31.940]  Are you kidding me?
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:39.760]  Probably 10 times that number died in car accidents in that time.
[03:52:39.900 --> 03:52:45.740]  They made it up.
[03:52:45.740 --> 03:52:46.940]  The dad is there.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:53:01.160]  99.95% of the people are still alive from COVID.
[03:53:01.200 --> 03:53:23.170]  And now they're selling us the new COVID scare, as we did in our Trench journal back on August 8th, that the media wars, the prostitutes, are selling more fear and hysteria.
[03:53:23.200 --> 03:53:33.960]  Here it is, COVID alert. It's August 8th. We're on the exact same page as info was. So go to
[03:53:33.960 --> 03:53:36.240]  the Cartoon News Network right now.
[03:53:36.300 --> 03:53:47.720]  Go to the homepage. COVID-19 has changed and so has our immunity. Here's how to think
[03:53:47.720 --> 03:53:55.480]  about virus risk now. Who's telling me how to think about it? That's the propaganda that
[03:53:55.480 --> 03:54:02.140]  they push out in the media. Here's how to think about the virus risk now. Here's how
[03:54:02.140 --> 03:54:08.980]  to think about it. I'm a little slimeball telling you how to think about it. You do not think
[03:54:08.980 --> 03:54:12.939]  for yourself. You are not allowed to think for yourself.
[03:54:13.300 --> 03:54:34.689]  Then, Epic Times came out with a number of articles. Secret letter to CDC, top epidemiologists suggest agency misrepresented scientific data. Yep.
[03:54:34.700 --> 03:54:42.920]  Epic Times documents recently obtained from the National Institute of Health suggested
[03:54:42.920 --> 03:54:50.020]  public health officials used inaccurate information and misrepresented medical research and misrepresented
[03:54:50.020 --> 03:54:58.220]  dead damn lying pieces of scum research to advance their policy objective that masks
[03:54:58.220 --> 03:55:01.940]  prevent severe COVID-19 and virus transmission.
[03:55:01.940 --> 03:55:10.180]  Despite opposing scientific evidence received from experts, we detailed it in the Trends
[03:55:10.180 --> 03:55:12.300]  Journal as it was happening.
[03:55:12.300 --> 03:55:15.540]  The mask thing was a big lie.
[03:55:15.540 --> 03:55:22.620]  Mask study published by NIH suggested N95 code masks may expose wearers to dangerous
[03:55:22.620 --> 03:55:26.500]  levels of toxic compounds linked to seizures and cancers.
[03:55:26.500 --> 03:55:27.500]  Who cares?
[03:55:27.500 --> 03:55:27.740]  Wear the mask.
[03:55:27.800 --> 03:55:42.269]  Are you ready? March 11th, here it is. 114 countries, 4291 debts. And who declares it
[03:55:42.300 --> 03:56:00.369]  a crisis, a pandemic. It may be time to break out masks again against COVID. Some experts say. This is August 23rd, the Cartoon News Network, CNN.
[03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:30.400]  Some experts say. Only the little slime balls that we put on. We hate you, Cilenti. And let me tell you why we really hate you. Because you love peace. And we're just pieces of crap. We're prostitutes. We're media whores. We love to sell war. We couldn't fight our way out of a paper bag. We're little low-life boys and girls. Yeah.

[03:56:30.400 --> 03:56:44.400]  Gloria Vanderbilt. And when I got hit during the Arab Spring in Egypt, I ran home. But we sell war. And we hate you because we're war whores.

[03:57:01.480 --> 03:57:07.320]  The notion of exceptionalism promoted by some nations and the policy of neo-colonialism derived
[03:57:07.320 --> 03:57:08.320]  from that claim.
[03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:15.200]  Oh, you mean Obama who used to sell the exceptional piece of lying crap, the Nobel
[03:57:15.200 --> 03:57:17.520]  peace of crap prize winner.

[03:59:02.460 --> 03:59:04.200]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:59:04.200 --> 03:59:08.680]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[03:59:08.680 --> 03:59:09.800]  people.
