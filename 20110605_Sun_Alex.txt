[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:40.000]  And I am bound and determined to calmly go over all the news and all of the video and audio clips that I have today.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  They run the gamut.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  News like this, DHS now testing new thought crime detection technology.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  SWAT team and riot police called on dancing protesters Saturday at the Jefferson Memorial,
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  shoving and roughing people up until they kicked them out of Thomas Jefferson's Memorial.
[01:04.000 --> 01:11.000]  We have obviously, blood was everywhere, 63 killed at Syria protests.
[01:11.000 --> 01:21.000]  And that's, the numbers went from 5, 20, 63, the numbers are growing and the media here in the U.S. is hailing it.
[01:21.000 --> 01:33.000]  In fact, the AP headline, Israeli troops battle protesters in Syria and then it lists the dead.
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  Regardless of whether you support Israel or not, or don't support Israel, it is double speak.
[01:41.000 --> 01:53.000]  It is double think to say they battle protesters. They mowed a bunch of peaceful protesters down who were kicked out decades ago when Israel took that area of Syria.
[01:53.000 --> 02:02.000]  They were protesting holding their keys in their hands saying they wanted their homes back.
[02:02.000 --> 02:12.000]  And how is this hypocritical? We're told that the new war in Libya, I'm sorry, that's not a war, a kinetic action that wouldn't be a ground war and would last days.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  See, lies, lies, lies, is to stop Qaddafi from killing peaceful people when there's no proof of that.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  Oh, you've heard it in the media, but they've always been forced to then later retract it.
[02:24.000 --> 02:39.000]  And no rape teams armed with Viagra. Similar, waving the bloody shirt, propaganda operation as saying Saddam's people were throwing babies out of incubators and stomping their brains out.
[02:39.000 --> 02:47.000]  I didn't really like Saddam Hussein, Handelbar Mustache and all. I don't like Muammar Qaddafi. I don't like dictators. I don't like big government.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  I don't like guys strutting around in military outfits. I don't like our corrupt government. See, it's not that Iran's good, the U.S. is good.
[02:55.000 --> 03:06.000]  It's Iran's bad and the U.S. is bad. It's not Israel good and China good. It's China bad, Israel bad.
[03:06.000 --> 03:19.000]  Look at history. Governments 99.9% of the time are corrupt criminal institutions, but they play this game where we're supposed to choose who we support, who we like.
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  Well, I don't choose any of the above. I don't have allegiance to any of these groups. I have an allegiance to the Bill of Rights Constitution and Declaration of Independence,
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  because it's the best document ever produced, and it produced the most wealth, and it produced the freest society the world's ever seen.
[03:36.000 --> 03:46.000]  Certainly wasn't perfect, but humans aren't perfect. There's no such thing as heaven on earth, Valhalla on earth. Humans are imperfect.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  There's no such thing as a utopia. Anybody promises you they got a utopia? In every case in history, they deliver a dystopia.
[03:55.000 --> 04:04.000]  They deliver a nightmare. We have incredible news, and I don't have the staff for this.
[04:04.000 --> 04:14.000]  But I do need to assign some of the people I've got to marking down predictions I make, because I make them constantly. They come true constantly.
[04:14.000 --> 04:24.000]  Many of them are pointed out by listeners simply so that new listeners, the reason it's important to point out when we predict things accurately is so folks understand we know what we're talking about.
[04:24.000 --> 04:34.000]  I've been saying for the last six months, every week on the week, at least, that right at the time they try to pass cybersecurity, that massive false flags will be launched on the internet.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  They're trying to pass it in the coming weeks. They're trying to pass a world government ruling on it as well.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  You notice all the hack attacks have started up right on time.
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  Meanwhile, the U.S. government admits, along with Microsoft and Google, they've recruited the hackers and they worked for them.
[04:50.000 --> 04:58.000]  We're going to break that down. The incredible news on the economy, the E. Coli, and the biggest news is right ahead. Stay with us.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[05:10.000 --> 05:22.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[05:28.000 --> 05:43.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[05:43.000 --> 05:58.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.
[06:14.000 --> 06:32.000]  It is Sunday, the fifth day of June 2011. We're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, 4-6 PM Central, 5-7 Eastern, 2-4 Pacific, 3-5 Mountain.
[06:32.000 --> 06:47.000]  The news websites are infowars.com and prismplanet.tv and we are streaming the radio show in a full 4-camera video streaming shoot at prismplanet.tv.
[06:47.000 --> 07:03.000]  I think it's important at the beginning of this transmission to point out that liberty is rising. People are becoming less and less gullible. Folks are beginning to wake up to the way this planet really is run and operated.
[07:03.000 --> 07:23.000]  A lot of exciting things are happening and evidence of how exciting this awakening is. My radio show is number one conservatively according to every Google analytic Alexa shoutcast tracking system.
[07:23.000 --> 07:34.000]  Number one radio show in the world on the internet. Over 500,000 podcast listeners today. Over a million people tuning in off and on a day to the streams.
[07:34.000 --> 07:45.000]  Over 3 million people a day now listening on AM and FM affiliates. On average we're getting three new affiliates a week. Many of them top stations in the biggest markets in the country.
[07:45.000 --> 08:06.000]  We're also of course on XM, Global, Shortwave, WWCR. The point is the fact that my radio show as hardcore as it is, as shocking as it is, the public and station managers and radio listeners and sponsors have gotten to a point in this country
[08:06.000 --> 08:17.000]  that things I was talking about 16 years ago that were seen as howling at the moon nuts are now more and more being seen as common sense.
[08:17.000 --> 08:29.000]  Because almost everything we predicted has now unfortunately come to past and now I'm breaking down what is going to happen in the near future and the long term future and folks know to listen.
[08:29.000 --> 08:44.000]  Now to be clear, I'm not the smartest guy in the world. I don't claim to have all the answers. I have studied history. I've studied anthropology, sociology, psychology, criminology and those that know history are not doomed to repeat it.
[08:44.000 --> 09:00.000]  So you're an expert in football or you're an expert in selling insurance or you're an expert in gardening. I'm an expert in geopolitical systems and systems analysis and studying civilization because I love knowledge.
[09:00.000 --> 09:16.000]  I love history. I find it absolutely engrossing and I am constantly, constantly whether I'm jogging or whether I'm driving or whether I'm even dreaming thinking about this information.
[09:16.000 --> 09:27.000]  And so that's how I've been able to so effectively break down what's happening. Now I have just an incredible amount of news and I'm going to be calm here and try to cover it all.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  And because I am bound and determined to cover all of this news and information, we're not going to take calls to take.
[09:34.000 --> 09:53.000]  But you're not just going to have Alex Jones for the full broadcast. Max Kaiser, BBC host, RT host, Press TV host, former top stockbroker, inventor of one of the major stock market systems, virtual trading systems that is used by most stock markets in the world.
[09:53.000 --> 10:03.000]  He'll be joining us from his palatial manner in Paris to break down the evidence that he has and has been breaking over the last few days.
[10:03.000 --> 10:13.000]  The big part of the invasion of Libya isn't just about the trillions in oil, but about the tens of billions that Gaddafi invested with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and others,
[10:13.000 --> 10:25.000]  and that large portions of the bailout money, and that was confirmed a month ago when the lawsuit went through with Bloomberg against the Federal Reserve, the private Fed, and they got the documents that a lot of it did go to Libya.
[10:25.000 --> 10:40.000]  So there's a larger scam going on there. He's also going to be leading a big demonstration in Greece and we have headlines dealing with the austerity measures that the public has squeezed for the sheriff of Nottingham to deliver it to the banking cartel.
[10:40.000 --> 11:00.000]  He's getting ready to leave Paris and go to Greece, the front lines of the fight against the globalist, so he'll be joining us in the last two segments of the second hour today, so in about an hour and 20 minutes from now, the always interesting Max Kaiser will be joining us today.
[11:00.000 --> 11:11.000]  Now, more and more of this happens. I got in here today and I look at the news and if I just read these headlines and give you a brief comment, it really doesn't serve anybody.
[11:11.000 --> 11:24.000]  People need to really have full spectrum understanding or at least a shadow of that. We're going to break here in a few minutes. Let me just go over some of the headlines.
[11:24.000 --> 11:34.000]  I'm going to come back and I still, I sat here for an hour before the live broadcast, looking at all these stacks of news that I've gone over and not being able to decide which one to start with.
[11:34.000 --> 11:48.000]  Here's probably the most important thing. And when I saw this last night, linked up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, I got chills up my spine and I just got them again, the Spidey Sense.
[11:48.000 --> 12:00.000]  The Spidey Sense in the past, we've all got it, the Sixth Sense, humans intuition, women's intuition, we all have it.
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  You know I've predicted this. I've seen this from the globalist operations and I've predicted it.
[12:07.000 --> 12:20.000]  Just as I predicted, there'd be massive sustained hack attacks the month that they try to pass the total Pentagon takeover of the Internet. At the same time, the UN tries to pass the UN global takeover of the web.
[12:20.000 --> 12:30.000]  And that's in the headlines today that there would be massive hack attacks launched worldwide. And those indeed have been launched and it's even in the news that it's linked to U.S. intelligence.
[12:30.000 --> 12:43.000]  But I want to be clear, U.S. doesn't exist anymore. It isn't, you know, you choose to be with the Russians or the Chinese or the Israelis or the Iranians or the Brits or the Mexicans or the Venezuelans or the South Africans.
[12:43.000 --> 12:53.000]  You have this global constellation of mega corporations, bigger than most governments, buying off governments and politicians, loaning them the fiat currency.
[12:53.000 --> 13:02.000]  And so when we talk about the U.S., we're talking about the offshore banks that have seized our republic. Let's remember that.
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.000]  And there's some very positive news in the fight against the private-making cartel. Bank of America gets padlocked if her homeowner forecloses on it.
[13:11.000 --> 13:23.000]  This is out of CBS News, out of another ABC News piece on it. And no, that's not a joke. You heard me right. They're not invincible. They're not God.
[13:23.000 --> 13:34.000]  When they commit these crimes, they can be brought to justice. We have the court system. If we elect the right type of judges and if we have the political will, they can't stop us.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  But I digress. That's not the biggest news today. I've got the good, the bad, and the ugly all here.
[13:40.000 --> 13:49.000]  The big news that every time I look at this article, I get chills because I can see in my mind's eye what they're going to do.
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  And it's not some X-Men psychic. Who's the head guy in the X-Men? Mr. X. I've only seen one of the movies.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  Professor X, you were telling me about the new movies that you liked it, but it's all about Join the CIA, the World Government, save you.
[14:04.000 --> 14:16.000]  Professor X. It's not some Professor X-Ian type thing. I had the BBC here doing a big hit piece, their hit piece specialist, Friday.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  And he said, why do you think 9-11's an inside job? And I said, well, I don't think. I know the official story's impossible.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  And I know our government and other governments have staged terror attacks in the past.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  And I could tell when I went over the evidence with him, it'll never see the light of day.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  But I brought up to him the fact that I said that 9-11 was going to take place two months before it happened.
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.000]  And he said, no, I know about that. I've seen it. And Countless Austinites saw me on local TV, say, call the White House, tell them don't stage the terror attack.
[14:50.000 --> 14:59.000]  And I even predicted, I said they'll say their asset, CIA asset, if someone had been lauding, did it. And they'll probably blow up the World Trade Center.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  It's in my film, The Masters of Terror. Now what, 9 years old?
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  But I did that on radio for two months straight leading up to 9-11 saying, call the White House, they're going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  They're going to blame it on their asset or someone been lauding. And I wasn't able to do that because I'm Professor X.
[15:20.000 --> 15:33.000]  I was able to do it because the establishment targets their propaganda, the social engineers, the psych warfare chiefs, target their propaganda at the lowest common denominator.
[15:33.000 --> 15:41.000]  So it's written in a cartoon fashion. And so you could see the prescripting of what they were getting ready to do.
[15:41.000 --> 15:51.000]  I'm not saying it didn't take some skill, but I've been telling you now, for about a year, they're going to stage big shootings at shopping malls and use that to ban the Second Amendment.
[15:51.000 --> 16:00.000]  Well, guess what? They are getting ready to launch it. We're going to break this down, we come back, new El Cata video, American Muslims should buy guns, start shooting people.
[16:00.000 --> 16:08.000]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.
[16:08.000 --> 16:19.000]  Saving means to make money. The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[16:19.000 --> 16:27.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[16:27.000 --> 16:35.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and a terrorizing clothing called lint.
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[16:40.000 --> 16:48.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[16:48.000 --> 17:08.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[17:08.000 --> 17:19.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[17:19.000 --> 17:28.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[17:28.000 --> 17:35.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[17:35.000 --> 17:44.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.000]  One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now. Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[18:06.000 --> 18:13.000]  As gas prices and drop failures push high food cost, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[19:30.000 --> 19:38.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America.
[19:52.000 --> 20:10.000]  The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[20:10.000 --> 20:26.000]  What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men, you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[20:26.000 --> 20:36.000]  Well, he is. I don't like any more than you.
[20:36.000 --> 20:43.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[20:43.000 --> 20:54.000]  Okay, before I get into this first piece of news, I meant to bring it here today, but I forgot to. While I was at Target, I bought a Life Books.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  Brought to Justice was the cover, and it was an image of Usama bin Laden.
[21:00.000 --> 21:08.000]  I also bought a little pinwheel with American flags on it, because I'm a big patriot. It was made in China, of course.
[21:08.000 --> 21:15.000]  See, if you're a patriot, you're not supposed to know your Bill of Rights or Constitution, love your country, fear your government, like George Washington said.
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  You're supposed to just stick a red, white, and blue pinwheel in your front yard and let what the flag symbolizes be destroyed.
[21:22.000 --> 21:35.000]  I got home and flipped through it. And of course, it did talk about the Oklahoma City situation. You know, there's domestic attacks, but then it had the first World Trade Center attack in it.
[21:35.000 --> 21:46.000]  And the World Trade Center attack in 1993, and just how terrible it was and how Al Qaeda hit us then.
[21:46.000 --> 21:57.000]  You see, there's a problem with that. It's in the New York Times and CBS News that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, protected them, and let the bombing go forward,
[21:57.000 --> 22:07.000]  and then tried to frame Ahmad Salam, the Egyptian security agent, from their CIA that was hired to do it, but then he knew they were setting him up, so he recorded the FBI.
[22:07.000 --> 22:13.000]  He said, you told me to build a fake bomb. Then you said build a real bomb. Then you said build a fake detonator. Then you said build a real detonator.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  You're going to let the bombing go forward? They're like, yes, we're going to do that.
[22:18.000 --> 22:28.000]  So see, there you have a bunch of low-grade moron patsies. Both the guys were close to retarded. They were both on New York City welfare.
[22:28.000 --> 22:39.000]  One had a 75 IQ, the other an 80 IQ, and they went out and found these morons and cooked the bomb, trained them, tried to make the entire tower collapse,
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  but they didn't park it up against the main pillar like they were supposed to, and so the rest is history.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  It didn't kill that many people, thank God. Most of them did die from smoke inhalation.
[22:50.000 --> 23:02.000]  But see, that's the problem. I open a magazine up promoting the fear of terror and telling me to give all my rights up or Al Qaeda will get me,
[23:02.000 --> 23:10.000]  and the first thing I read I know is a complete lie, and so is the whole magazine, the entire thing.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And this is not my opinion. This is a fact.
[23:16.000 --> 23:26.000]  Now, what else is a fact? It's a fact that and we're all a-locking the number one Al Qaeda operative running U.S. operations,
[23:26.000 --> 23:33.000]  born in the U.S., trained by the CIA, just like with some of Bin Laden, it's all on record, magically running Major Hassan at Fort Hood,
[23:33.000 --> 23:42.000]  magically running the underwear bomber, the Christmas Day bomber, the shoe bomber that thought you lit, that you light plastic explosives,
[23:42.000 --> 23:50.000]  the Times Square bomber, and I interviewed the witnesses months before it was mainstream news who were on the plane.
[23:50.000 --> 23:57.000]  They saw Mutalib and Amsterdam be gotten on the plane, looked drugged and disheveled, U.S. security, sharp dressed,
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  helping him get on without his ID, without his passport. I mean, that takes power.
[24:04.000 --> 24:14.000]  They put some drugged up idiot on a plane with a firecracker in his pants, right as the billions of dollars of scanners were set to go in the next month.
[24:14.000 --> 24:25.000]  See, it's all scripted, and it's 100% that in every case, these guys are recruited, protected, and run by this double-agent,
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  Amur Aulaki, Fox News headline, Aulaki dying at Pentagon, two weeks after 9-11.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  While he was on the news as most wanted, he's secretly hanging out at the Pentagon with the Secretary of the Army.
[24:37.000 --> 24:45.000]  Now, see, there's my problem. I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven stacks.
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  I'm not even getting into the first article here, because I can't even read you this article and make you just think,
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  oh, that Alex Jones guy is saying something without giving you background.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  The problem is, I've got thousands of pieces of evidence just on this next story.
[24:57.000 --> 25:03.000]  Now, who is Adam Gadon? Because of the top four Al-Qaeda guys, three of them are from the U.S.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  Aulaki Gadon was at the top five four from the U.S.
[25:10.000 --> 25:21.000]  Now, here's ABC News. Now, how many times have I told you that they're going to get your guns by shooting up a bunch of police stations and shopping malls,
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  and they're going to roll the TSA out in America on the streets, and that they're going to be groping you and your family,
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.000]  and literally putting us under martial law under another name after these mass shootings?
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  Now, how do I know that? Well, I happen to have gotten the secret documents from law enforcement across the country,
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  where they've been training for at least five years that this is imminent and coming,
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  and claiming that militia and Ron Paul supporters work with Al-Qaeda.
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  That's like saying the Easter Bunny works with Toucan Sam. None of it's true.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  So, they've already got this under-the-radar brainwashing going on of government,
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  so I already know what they're going to roll out. I've interviewed the emergency managers from Indiana and others
[26:05.000 --> 26:14.000]  who have been trained in every police department hardening itself against attack from the American people.
[26:14.000 --> 26:24.000]  I have the whole backstory. I told you over a year and a half ago that the BATFE, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Farms and Explosives,
[26:24.000 --> 26:33.000]  was helping ship arms to Mexico. I told you seven years ago with Sally Castillo, former top DE agent in Latin America,
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  that there was going to be a huge war over drugs in Mexico and that Los Zetas was being funded by the Pentagon.
[26:39.000 --> 26:46.000]  That came out last week. The point is, I knew this was coming. Now, what's been on CBS News?
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  White House orders ATF to ship tens of thousands of guns into Mexico.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  And I told you they're going to have increased shootings with guns from the U.S.
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  They're going to send the guns in to track them, and they're going to use that to go out for a second amendment.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  And sure enough, years after I tell you, they come out. The Justice Department has a press conference.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  Even when they got caught a few months ago doing this, they still are pushing to restrict the Second Amendment
[27:14.000 --> 27:22.000]  and repass the assault weapons ban and all the rest of it in the name of protecting America from its own guns
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  that are going into Mexico and coming back in.
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  That's a false flag terror attack, and that's confirmed, and that's been all over the news.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  Now, what else have I told you is coming?
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  I told you the TSA would start showing up at bus stations, train stations, and highway checkpoints
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  and would have mobile trucks that they would force you into. How did I know that?
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.000]  Three years ago, Homeland Security did the purchase orders to buy a score of these big mobile trucks
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  with not just naked body scanners, but brain scanners.
[27:57.000 --> 28:06.000]  Oh, what's Fox News? DHS now testing new thought crime detection technology with giant mobile trucks
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  that TSA are going to have on the streets. Remember, how are they going to roll all this sound?
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  Right as they collapse the economy. They're going to tell you it's for Al Qaeda, but it's for you and your family.
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.000]  Just like they now admit, nine out of ten of Patriot Act prosecutions are non-terror related.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  Well, we don't have a Bill of Rights Constitution anymore, but only for Al Qaeda. Oops, it's for you too.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  Oh, we're only spying on foreigners. No, we're spying on all of you without warrants.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  Now, here's the big news when we come back, because I've told you all this is coming.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  Now, and I've also warned you that behind the scenes they were laying the groundwork
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  were staged shootings at malls, you name it, that will then be blamed on Al C.I.A. to Al Qaeda
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  and then move to take the Second Amendment down.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  Well, now they're hyping it, which means they're thinking about doing it.
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[29:19.000 --> 29:26.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products.
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.000]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[29:40.000 --> 29:46.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[29:46.000 --> 29:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  It seems like nobody does care.
[30:44.000 --> 30:49.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.000]  Get your copy of A Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[30:54.000 --> 31:00.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:00.000 --> 31:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:09.000 --> 31:14.000]  Two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[31:35.000 --> 31:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[31:51.000 --> 31:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[32:30.000 --> 32:36.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.000]  I can't stress this enough.
[32:39.000 --> 32:42.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.000]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.000]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  That's End of America 3.com.
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:08.000 --> 33:10.000]  Network.
[33:10.000 --> 33:28.000]  All right, my friends, we are back live on this Sunday Transmission.
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[33:29.000 --> 33:37.000]  Max Keiser coming up in about an hour on the incredible revelations that Muammar Gaddafi and his billions have just disappeared
[33:37.000 --> 33:44.000]  into the private banking cartels, clutches similar to the American people's, 27 trillion disappearing.
[33:44.000 --> 33:50.000]  Also coming up, Bank of America gets padlocked after homeowner forecloses on it.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  One time, I had to begin filing suit on Bank of America.
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  They had taken my escrow.
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  They had bought my mortgage.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  My mortgage had been sold several times.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  This happened eight, nine years ago, and they were sending me threats.
[34:05.000 --> 34:13.000]  I went to the credit bureau and they said that I hadn't paid my escrow and they were going to start moving to take my house.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  And I had to go get a lawyer.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  The lawyer said, well, let's sue them.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  And we started that process and they said, oh, we found your escrow money.
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  Well, it turns out they took a house that they never had a deed for that was 100% paid for in cash.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  And you see this in the news now every day.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  I'm going to explain why this is happening.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  Well, you know why.
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.000]  All the major mortgages almost all have been sold into derivatives over and over again and have been sold to the Chinese and others.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  And it's all complete fraud.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  And who are the main culprits?
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo on record.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  They had congressional hearings three years ago, a year ago, a month ago.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  Rolling Stone had the headline, Senate panel confirms crime.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  Now, where are indictments?
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  Well, where are indictments?
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  These bankers own our country, own our military, own it all.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  They own the Fortune 500 because they've engaged in so much fraud.
[35:09.000 --> 35:18.000]  They've created 1.5 quadrillion fake monetary units.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  Yes, that's many times all the real wealth in the world.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  You guessed it.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  Okay, side issue.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  How are they planning to not go to prison?
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  How are they planning instead to come out on top of this Ponzi scheme with a private global government?
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  And I have that in the stack today.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  IMF World Bank called for global carbon taxes paid to them.
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.000]  Now, I remember a decade ago that was in their public policy reports, but not on the news.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  And I'd get up here and say, they're planning on coming out with a global carbon tax.
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.000]  And Al Gore and others will get before Congress just a few years ago and say, there's no plan for a tax.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  Oh, really?
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  We have an Obama administration official on video saying it is a tax and it's done by stealth.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  But sorry, again, we're conspiracy theorists because we know what we're talking about.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  Now, how are they planning on getting this through?
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.000]  Well, they're going to have their private corporate black ops people, provocateur Muslim extremist lunatics to attack us.
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  And if that won't work, sometimes the globalists, these private corporate scumbags, actually carry out the whole thing themselves.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  And they've been caught many times to get us into Vietnam, Gulf of Tonkin staged.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  To overthrow Iran at 53, staged terror attacks blamed on the government.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  Operation Ajax, Operation Gladio, partially declassified.
[36:37.000 --> 36:44.000]  Over 200 bombings carried out in Europe from 1962 until 1981 until the Italian government said, that's it.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  They blew up the Bologna train station, killed hundreds of people, including kids.
[36:48.000 --> 36:56.000]  And it's come out all over the Italian news confirmed they did it with the U.S. government to blame it on the communists because they didn't want them getting political power.
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  And I don't like communists either, but you don't blow up train stations to blame it on them.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  I know it works really good.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  But see, now they got the military doing this for a long time.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  And WikiLeaks and the Pentagon confirmed a few years ago it was accurate.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  They didn't deny it, released an army manual for captains and above in black ops.
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.000]  And it says, if you're out manned and outgunned in a situation in a third world country,
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  you stage a terror attack and you blame it on your political enemy and that will get the people behind you.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  I mean, it's in the army manual.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  Don't believe me, just search.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  Leaked army manual teaches troops how to stage false flags.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  Here's your M16, here's your canteen.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  Now we're going to teach you how to kill people and blame it on your enemies.
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  How's that sound?
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  It's a force multiplier.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  We're going to win.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  It's how we get it done.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  Grow up, people.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  Grow up.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  Grow up.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  How are they going to get your guns?
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  You've got to decide.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  Do you love the fetish of being scared of the guys with the turbines on their heads?
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  More than you love your Second Amendment and your private property rights.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.000]  And there it is.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  U.S. counterinsurgency manual leaked calls for false flag operation suspension of human rights.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  Julian Assange 2008, you can read the manual.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  And how to do it.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  And again, the Pentagon said they want to prosecute who released that.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  They didn't say, oh, that's not true.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  We don't do that.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  They said, we're going to put somebody in prison for life for releasing that.
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  See, ladies and gentlemen, one reason I know a lot of this stuff is because in some of my extended family,
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  upwards of half the people have been recruited for U.S. intelligence agencies or have worked for them.
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  And almost all of them were in the army.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  Now, there's millions of these people.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  It's not just my family, but they do love to recruit in Texas.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  And the stories, the things I haven't even been told that my dad told me they told them.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  I mean, you had a family reunion.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  It's like a spook reunion or something.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  Narcotics trafficking, killing people in America.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  My family gets mad when I talk about it.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  The point is this stuff goes on.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  Okay.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  This stuff goes on.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  It's time to grow up.
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  It's time to grow up because here's the deal.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  These false flags, you can be a good old boy and say,
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  so what if we blow something up and blame it on the commies or blow something up and blame it on the A-Rabs and get your oil?
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  They're going to blow stuff up and get your guns, Billy Bob.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  These bankers don't care about you.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  11 years ago, secret deal with the VA and major insurance companies.
[39:31.000 --> 39:37.000]  Bloomberg, AP, stealing the death benefits of World War II vets up until today.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  They don't care about you.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Grow up.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  Now, what gave me chills today?
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  Why have I spent 40 minutes on this so far?
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  Leading up to this point, giving you some background.
[39:50.000 --> 39:59.000]  New Al Qaeda video, American Muslims should buy guns, start shooting people.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  Now, I know I got millions of listeners.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  I don't have the crew to do it because we don't sit here and mark down my predictions.
[40:05.000 --> 40:13.000]  But I know in the last month I've said they're going to stage shootings at public places to get our guns.
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.000]  Just like I told you years ago, they were shipping guns into Mexico because I had the sources before it even came out on ABC and CBS News.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  Our government shipping guns to Mexico to have them come back over here with the serial numbers to go after the Second Amendment.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  Now, listen to me.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  They've been getting the cops ready for this.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  They've been getting all the communities ready.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  They've been openly getting the TSA ready.
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.000]  Now you hear about TSA under federal rulings at school proms, remember two weeks ago?
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  How many times did I tell you that?
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  Again, it's not that I have a crystal ball hanging around my rear view mirror in my car I look in every day.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  Okay?
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  I study these people because I want to be free.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  And I realize the globalists aren't going to give us quarter.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  These are very evil people that have hijacked America.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  How are they going to get Americans to give up their guns?
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  How are they going to do it?
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  I'm telling you how they're going to do it.
[41:07.000 --> 41:15.000]  They're going to go in and have hired corporate mercenaries, kill a couple hundred people at a couple shopping malls.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  They're going to blow up some police stations.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  They've been getting the whole narrative ready behind the scenes.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  They're going to come in and they're going to shut down private sale of guns first.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  That means you've given your grandson a gun, you selling it at the gun show, private seller.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  And folks, when you read, and we have the Adam Gadon video as well, but I'm going to read over it.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  You can watch the video at ABC News, New Al Qaeda video.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  American Muslims should buy guns, start shooting people.
[41:41.000 --> 41:48.000]  Now, not only do I read what he said, and it's cartoonish and written to scare the dumbest Americans.
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  Obviously propaganda, but I know who Adam Gadon is.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  He didn't just and we're all a lucky hanging out secretly at the Pentagon.
[41:54.000 --> 42:04.000]  Adam Gadon's grandfather was the head of the Anti-Defamation League, which is admittedly an Israeli Mossad operation.
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.000]  Caught and convicted in California, breaking in and police files and spying on citizens, okay?
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  The group that advises our police.
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.000]  Adam Gadon hates Muslims so much, he was arrested outside a mosque over a decade ago, beating up Muslims.
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  Okay, this guy hates Muslims so much, he goes out and street fights them, okay?
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  He goes out and rolls them, okay?
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  Now, he figured out how to really get the Muslims.
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  You become them, you bit the big turban on your head, got the big beard and come out in English.
[42:35.000 --> 42:43.000]  Now, when I come back, I'm going to read what he said. I'm going to read to you what he said, okay?
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.000]  Now, this is directly from the government, and this makes me want to throw up.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  So, folks, you've got to decide what you're going to do here.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  You've got to decide what side you're on.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  Is your love a hate Muslim so good you're going to turn your guns in?
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food cost, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[44:04.000 --> 44:09.000]  tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[44:17.000 --> 44:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[44:24.000 --> 44:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[44:30.000 --> 44:45.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[45:00.000 --> 45:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[45:12.000 --> 45:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[45:21.000 --> 45:29.000]  They soak right in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[45:34.000 --> 46:00.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  You should consider buying a solar power generator.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[46:15.000 --> 46:21.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[46:21.000 --> 46:32.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  To get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[46:51.000 --> 47:01.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[47:01.000 --> 47:09.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:09.000 --> 47:18.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.000]  By the way, I could go on for another two or three hours if I wanted to.
[47:25.000 --> 47:35.000]  On Adam Gadan, his real name Adam Perlman, the number one of the top guys, top four in Al Qaeda,
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  out of the top five, all from the U.S., real name Adam Perlman.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  And remember Wired Magazine three years ago?
[47:43.000 --> 47:52.000]  One of their big conferences had the top video analyst point out that the Intel Center, run by the two adjuncts of Rumsfeld,
[47:52.000 --> 48:04.000]  a quote, private intelligence group that gets government money, that they uploaded the Al Qaeda logo on Adam Gadan in the same logo as the Intel Center.
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  You understand that? It was produced at the same time.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  And I could go on for hours. Would you like me to?
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  Oh, if you're a new listener and you're saying, I am, we're all a locky.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  Didn't secretly at the Pentagon? Oh, really?
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  Fox News AP.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  If you've got the nerve to go look it up.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  And they just throw it out there like it's no big deal.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  Having dinner with the Secretary of the Army.
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.000]  See, this is full spectrum dominance where they don't just attack the nations.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  They, they, they create the opposition as the pretext to go into the nation.
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  This is the big global model of cops planting drugs on your farm to take it.
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.000]  How many times have cops been caught all over the country, planting marijuana plants on somebody's ranch they want for themselves?
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  How many times? How many times? A lot.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  And see, now they've gotten away with it for so long all over the country.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  The police just pull people over and take cash out of their wallets.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  No judge, no jury, no drugs found.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  You see, this is called corruption. Does it mean all the cops are corrupt?
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  No, but it's starting to get there.
[49:11.000 --> 49:19.000]  The people running the departments almost universally are globalist frontmen, intelligence agents or out and out criminals.
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  Now, let me just read to you this article and I've got a blitzkrieg of other key news.
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  ABC News, better give your guns up and ABC News has, you know, reports here.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  Maybe they should start restricting and ban semi-automatic handguns and rifles.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  That's what assault weapon means.
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  New Al Qaeda video, American Muslims should buy guns, start shooting people.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  And they've had a few of these random shootings and every time it's a Patsy or it's a staged event.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  In a new video message, oh, by the way, what is Operation Northwoods?
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  Declassified in 2000 say that the Pentagon had plans to stage shootings and bombings all over the country
[49:58.000 --> 50:05.000]  as a pretext of blame and Operation Northwoods on the Ruskies to start World War III.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  Oh, and don't worry, the Ruskies had their own program as well in Eastern Europe.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  They would stage things in blame and on their enemies.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  See, these governments do it. The Germans did it.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  You know how Hitler started World War II?
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.000]  He didn't just tell the Germans one day, hey, let's attack Poland with their horse-drawn carriage army.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  Oh, yeah, Poland really would do that, attack Germany, the biggest military in the world at the time.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  Most high-tech, they attack their own military basic, Gliwitz. Declassified.
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  Oh, I'm sorry, it doesn't exist. I should just trust the government.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  Listen to this. How are they going to kill America?
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  How are the offshore banks that have already looted his seven ways to Sunday?
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  How are they going to get control of our society?
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  They're going to stage shootings all over this country at soft targets, as they call them,
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  and roll out TSA that's already beta-tested to take over every corner of America.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  That's the domestic national security force, just as big and just as strong as our military.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  Remember Obama's saying that?
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  Let me continue here.
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  New Al-Qaeda video. American Muslims should buy guns, start shooting people.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  Let's say that's real and really going to happen.
[51:06.000 --> 51:11.000]  There's some mentally ill patsies. See this all over the news, as the news puts Gadan up there.
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.000]  And maybe there are some crazies out there that listen to this CIA operative and actually go out and do it.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  This may actually cause real people to do it, with them advertising it.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  You know, we had real terrorism in this country in the 60s and 70s, and they never gave it attention.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  Because real terrorism, you ignore it. Only the terrorist would give the terrorism attention.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  See how this works, but let me continue here.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  In a new video message released on the Internet Friday,
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.000]  American board Al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadan, no background they give you,
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  calls on Muslims living in America to carry out deadly one-man terror acts,
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  using fully automatic weapons purchased at gun shows.
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  And he goes on to say that.
[51:54.000 --> 51:59.000]  Obama's been trying to shut the gun shows down, shut down private sales so you can't give your grandson a rifle,
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.000]  put you in prison if you ever sell your buddy a gun so they can track them all, have them all registered,
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  make you go register guns you already bought that weren't on record.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  And it's, oh, oh, oh, and we know the ADL and the Israel lobby is always financing in the U.S. anti-gun movements.
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  One reason I get so angry is stay out of my business.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  You want to have tribal warfare and kill each other over there in the Middle East? Do it!
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  Don't come after my guns!
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  But Israel can't help it.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  I guess they want me to live like a Palestinian.
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  It continues, what are you waiting for? Ask Gadan in English.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  Again, he goes, go to the gun shows, get the guns.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  I mean, this is written directly out of the White House.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  What are you waiting for? Ask Gadan in English.
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.000]  And then adds that Jihadists shouldn't worry about getting caught since so many have been released.
[52:47.000 --> 52:54.000]  Over these past few years, quote, I've seen the release of many, many Mujahideen who I never even dream would regain their freedom.
[52:54.000 --> 53:00.000]  Folks, do you believe one of the top guys in Al Qaeda, they debate who the new guy is.
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  They're introducing all the characters and beta testing it, market testing it with the public, who scares you the most.
[53:06.000 --> 53:12.000]  Four of the five, all from the U.S. intelligence on record, hanging out at the Pentagon, on and on and on,
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  running all the patsies who the government gets on the planes.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  Publicly, State Department had to admit it.
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  Underwear bomber, gotten on the plane without a passport by the State Department under CIA orders.
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  Detroit free press, a month and a half after I had eyewitnesses who saw it happen.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  We broke that ear.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  Okay, I'm sorry. You understand they're getting ready for this.
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  The fact that they're rolling this out means they're getting ready to do it.
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  To come after your guns.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  Now, can you imagine, oh, oh, oh, oh, people don't believe that bin Laden was killed suddenly Al Qaeda tapes.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  Oh, yes, he was killed. The government's telling you the truth.
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  Oh, yes, you better pass carbon taxes or the earth will die or we'll bomb you.
[53:52.000 --> 54:01.000]  Whatever the government once said Al Qaeda comes out and says it, uploading it in U.S. government front group videos in the same video layer.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  As the Al Qaeda logo, I mean caught red handed.
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.000]  That's how dumb they think we are going back to over here.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  New Al Qaeda video, American Muslims should buy guns, start shooting people.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  Now you read the whole thing.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  What he said, you can watch the video online.
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  We've got it up on screen for folks watching at prisonplanet.tv.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  I'm so upset right now I said try to be calm today because because I mean, I mean, we're watching this unfold.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  We're watching this happen right now.
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  I got so upset.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  My shirt buttons all popped out.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  Going into incredible Holt mode here.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  New Al Qaeda video.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  Now, now notice the government right now is saying we don't want to shut down Guantanamo.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  We don't want to give anybody trials because Al Qaeda will get us.
[54:42.000 --> 54:50.000]  Then they release people who they send to Libya under CIA training, people from Gitmo to attack Qaddafi.
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.000]  And so they're trying to push a system where even U.S. citizens in this new defense authorization act can be held without trial.
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  And Guadan comes out and laughs and says, well, you're releasing all our people.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  Good job.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  Obviously for the American market.
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.000]  So government can say, let's get rid of habeas corpus and due process to see Al Qaeda is making jokes at us.
[55:11.000 --> 55:22.000]  This is all written tailor made to help the globalist take our liberties here in America as they're imploding our economy by designed with this depression they've engineered.
[55:22.000 --> 55:33.000]  The two part two hour video appeared on jihad websites Friday with images of jihadi leaders as well as snapshots of alleged underwear bomber Umar Farouk.
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  And the accused Fort Hood shooter major Nadal Hassan both run by Amaral Alaki and protected.
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  Who's admitted CIA both Hassan and Mutalib are charged with carrying out attacks inside the U.S.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  And magically now they release the photos of them with them.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Isn't that convenient?
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.000]  Meanwhile, the government doesn't want to discuss a week before they roll out the naked body scanners.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  They were already purchasing ready.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  And the former head of Homeland Security making the money off of it.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  The government helps get the underwear bomber on the plane.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  He was so drugged out he couldn't even just just walking around foaming at the mouth.
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  That's what witnesses said couldn't even didn't even have papers.
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  A disheveled drugged out person with the U.S. government getting him on the plane on record.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  It's just like in every other case.
[56:18.000 --> 56:26.000]  Turns out the Congress found out for two years Amaral Alaki was in contact via email and phone calls with major Hassan at Fort Hood.
[56:26.000 --> 56:33.000]  And at other bases he was at previous to that and they protected him and didn't let army intelligence stop Hassan.
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  Hassan was probably a real lunatic nutcase Muslim extremist.
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  Protected and run by his government handler.
[56:43.000 --> 56:49.000]  Now continuing here with this information.
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.000]  Call do not rely on others take the task upon yourself.
[56:54.000 --> 57:01.000]  He called for them to go to gun shows buy guns and attack and now the media saying shut down gun shows Al Qaeda Al Qaeda Al Qaeda Al Qaeda Al Qaeda.
[57:01.000 --> 57:09.000]  By the way Homeland Security is now looking at purchasing electronic shock bracelets for all air travelers.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  Four years ago they released the video promoting it now they're looking at that you're like that will never happen.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  Oh really the TSA will never stick its hands down your pants and grab you and your daughter and your son's genitals.
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  They'll never sexually assault putting their hands in the pants of Miss America in Dallas.
[57:25.000 --> 57:31.000]  They never do that Obama never passed Socialist Healthcare and exempt all his friends that would never happen.
[57:31.000 --> 57:38.000]  The borders would stay wide open after 9 11 but it did none of this would ever happen the foreign banks would still 27 trillion wouldn't happen.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  World government wouldn't be announced it has been.
[57:41.000 --> 57:51.000]  They lied to you about Libya no ground war they lie they lie they lie John Edwards Weiner all of them liars liars.
[57:51.000 --> 57:58.000]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings opportunity and recognize risk.
[57:58.000 --> 58:09.000]  Saving means to make money the cow been pure soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[58:09.000 --> 58:17.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes perfumes deodorants or antibacterials.
[58:17.000 --> 58:25.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes itching soars and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[58:58.000 --> 59:03.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[59:03.000 --> 59:09.000]  They've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[59:18.000 --> 59:25.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:31.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  Right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[59:43.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Well I said to myself today that I was not going to get angry.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  That I was going to stay focused and I didn't because I know it's coming.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  They've been preparing.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Post 9-11 to take over every street corner, every cafe, every grocery store.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  The 9,000 telescreens in public parks, Walmart, malls are going in saying spy on your neighbors.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  This is going to be the program, the reign of terror in America.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  They will go in and shoot up malls just like the dry run they did in Mumbai and got caught.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Even came out in the Chicago Tribune and other papers that the leader of the Mumbai attacks was reportedly CIA officer.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  And we knew that at the time.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  The head of Indian intelligence came out and said that we're big enemies with the Pakistanis had no reason to lie.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  And they have a bunch of troops attack and shoot up people at malls and then they grab some drugged up Patsy and present them to the news cameras.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  And it was admittedly that they were on PCP, LSD and a bunch of other drugs.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  The guys they killed and the one guy they found alive didn't even know who he was when they just fully wiped his brain.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  You just take an electroshop drugged out person that thinks they're Mickey Mouse and that's your guy.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  This is how they do it. They go in, shoot a bunch of people, kill a couple of the Patsy's, have one that's had their memory wiped with electricity and run across the frontal lobe.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  A passive lobotomy, hop them up on drugs. It's the end of it.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  It's how they do it.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  And they dry run it and they did the dry run in Mumbai a few years ago.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  And it's a full, giant Manhattan project level secret program that is partially unsecret because of all the documents we've gotten and what's been leaked.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  That they've got every cop in a detective and above intelligence unit level, shaking an abject fear of imminent attacks on their police stations, substations and malls.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  And that's why they're just scared to death, shaking in their boots and Adam Gadan, the ADL grandson is just up there like we're a bunch of idiots.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  Staged managed with his anti-gun, anti-assault weapon, anti-gun show.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  And by the way, they keep releasing all our people. Thank you, Obama, for releasing the terrorist.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  And it's all only about a millimeter thick. The propaganda is flimsy.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Yeah, they've been taking young people in training them and then sending them to Libya and other areas and to be double agents. That's all admitted.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  See, all of this is actually admitted in plain view. It's just they're counting on you not having the background, not having the information or not having the courage to stand up and talk about it.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  The truth is America is a good country. The truth is the globalists don't have control over everything.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  And we're on AM and FM. We're reaching more people. Other folks are understanding this. Other people are figuring out what's happening.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  And the game is almost up. We're getting closer and closer and closer and closer to being able to expose the globalist.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Very, very, very, very exciting things are happening, but history is being made.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  This is a hot tyranny we face. This is a horrible population reduction, eugenics, anti-family, re-engineering of society.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  This is full spectrum dominance over humanity. Now, when we come back, I have got a lot of really important news coming up.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  We've got news in Fukushima, more explosions, more fires, more radiation only gets higher and higher. Our media has almost no news on it.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  We have some incredible economic news. We have just absolutely amazing news on the front with the banksters and the fight against those guys in the tyranny that they are engaged in.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  So that is coming up as well. Also, another false flag, I predicted it.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  It's not hard to predict that when they try to pass the Cybersecurity Act to totally take over the web and start phasing out freedom on the web in their own words,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  that they would launch massive hack attacks against their own facilities.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  And that's what ABC News is reporting. China calls U.S. culprit in global internet war.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  And then in other articles, they admit they've recruited hackers to attack people that don't buy into their global warming fraud.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  That's exactly what Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are all for two years ago.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  We're going to be breaking all that down. And more. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, prisonplotter.com.

[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  I'm the keynote speaker in New York City this coming Saturday before the main corporate CEOs of talk radio,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  former keynote speakers have been Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity will be there and others.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  And I'm just going to go, they want me there to explain how I become so popular, how I reach millions and millions of people every day
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  and why we're growing so fast and I'm just going to break it down for them.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  But the mere fact that I'm being summoned there and I'm more than happy to go talk to them shows the fact that people are really starting to wake up in this country.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  All of you good old boys, all you people out there that think you're wealthy and think you're powerful, you're going to be robbed by this system as well.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  This is a ruthless global crime syndicate that sees independent wealth as a threat.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  And a lot of you that have bought into the establishment view of things, you're starting to wake up and that's good.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Because if we don't wake up, horrors are going to be revisited on this world that are going to make World War II look like a cakewalk,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  look like a Boy Scout event.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  Okay, Max Keiser coming up in T-minus 23 minutes.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  So I need to get into this news right now before I get into some good news on the economy.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Here's the bad news.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  And again, we told you all this was coming 11 years ago.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  I had economists on actually 12 years ago.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  George Humphrey and others breaking down that the private banks were going from fractional reserve banking for every dollar or euro you deposit,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  they could loan out 10 to, for every dollar, they could loan out infinity.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  And with that, they get real assets.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  Now, does that sound like a free or fair market or equitable or level playing field?
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  No, obviously not.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  Now, these same guys have created 1.5 quadrillion, you heard me right, 1,500 trillion conservatively in fake funny money.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  And they go buy off the politicians in the U.S., Greece, Portugal, Spain, all of them on record.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  And same thing, Iceland turned out over 90% of the debt was not owed by the people of Iceland.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  And it turns out that their banking ministers had sold them out.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  And Iceland said, no, we're not paying it back.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Now, Ireland and others, they went under globalist control.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  And in almost every one of those countries, Ireland, Greece, it's former Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  They're the two big kingpin leaders of the six global mega banks for domestically.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  And they're the guys that have their former executives as the president's prime ministers and banking heads,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  just like it was former Goldman Sachs had here as the treasury with the banker takeover in 2008.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  So this is a mafia.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  Now, this mafia, all over the United States and in Europe, take homes that are 100% paid for that they don't even have deeds for.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  We told you about this many years ago.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Now, they call it mortgage gate.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  Again, we're not conspiracy theorist.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  We're informed.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  The system, when you question them or point out something that's not widely known, wants to keep people from thinking.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  So they say, oh, that's a conspiracy theory, honey.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  Move on.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  No, questioning is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  When you know the federal and state law and they were taking houses more than 10 years ago,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  one of our IT guys had his home taken.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  They didn't have the deed.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  I went and saw the court case.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  I was there when they took his house.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  They didn't have the deed.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  They shouldn't have got the house.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  They got it.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  It wasn't even theirs.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  But they're the big banks.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  Why, why, they wear suits.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  They couldn't be crooks.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  Why, the Federal Reserve funds my local Rotary Club and the Elks Club.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  Why, they're good guys.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I get invited down to the regional bank.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  I feel important.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  They give me business deals.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Yeah, because they're a mafia.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  China has divested 97% of its holdings in U.S. Treasury bills.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  CNS News.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  Oh, that now the Federal Reserve is monetizing 75% of the national debt.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  That's created for a dollar to be created, a dollar of debt to the private banking cartel.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  Their consortium, the Federal Reserve, is created.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  That's good business if you can get it.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Let me read this one.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Summer job bummer.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Teen unemployment.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  24% CBS News.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  Try average unemployment.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  24.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  Not 9.1.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Delinquent homeowners to get mortgage aid from government.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Obama said this two years ago.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  It's a total lie.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  U.S. house price fall.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  Beats.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Great depression slide.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  London independent.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Worse than Great Depression numbers.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  They break it down.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  But I heard we've been in a big recovery while the economy's booming.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Because they say so.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Don't question that or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  It doesn't matter if every private brokerage firm and group says unemployment's been above 22% for three years.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  The government says it's 9.1.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  So don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  It doesn't matter if everybody knows it's above 20.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  It doesn't matter if it's above 33 in California, above 50% in Detroit.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  They say it's 11% in Detroit.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  Bleak teen jobs outlook.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  25% unemployment.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Christian science monitor.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Okay.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  So what's the good news I've got here for you?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Bank of America gets padlocked after a homeowner forecloses on it.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  And it turns out they paid for their house and cash, had it for years.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  But see, here's the thing.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  Bank of America sold derivatives to the Chinese and they sold them that house.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  Because many years ago somebody else had it.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  They didn't care. See, if you're going to engage in all this fraud, why not just put houses in there?
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  You don't even know.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Don't even own.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  How many times have you heard home taken and the people sit there and whine and cry and go to the courts?
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  The courts say we don't care if it's fully paid for.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  They don't have the deed.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  We're taking it.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  But see, politically the judges started getting thrown out.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  The little crooks started getting thrown out.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  So now they're not doing that as much anymore.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  We have the political will.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  We realize these little ball-headed freaks and suits, just because they're 70 years old, doesn't mean they're not criminals.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Women thought Ted Bundy was nice because he was wearing a suit.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  He tortured them to death.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Wake up to that.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  So here it is, the invincibility of the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  The invincibility of Bank of America, one of the private shareholders of it, thinking they could take a house.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  And even when the court ruled, give them their house back.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  You don't owe it.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  You don't own it.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  You never had a deed.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  It's paid for.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Bank of America said, we're too big to fail.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  It's ours.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  And the court said, your bank goes to these people now.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  Until that bank got on the phone with their boss and they said, give them the money.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  We'll move on to other slaves that don't know what's happening.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  And Bank of America tried this with me almost a decade ago.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Bank of America sent me a letter and said, we're going to start procedure to take your house.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Your escrow isn't here because they bought my mortgage.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  And I had to go out and get a stinking lawyer.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  And as soon as they knew I knew what I was doing, they dropped it.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  But some old lady, all these old people getting their houses taken, they don't know what to do.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Oh, but Bank of America wouldn't do that to us.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Just like Prudential wouldn't sign a deal with other big insurance companies to take all the death benefits of the troops secretly with the VA 11 years ago.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Now admitted.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Grow up.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Grow up.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Grow up.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  This banking cartel doesn't produce anything.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  They don't loan anything real.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  They make it up out of nothing.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Now, in case you think I'm joking, let's start playing this clip as we go to break.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Here it is, CBS News with the bank taking houses that they never even had a deed and never even thought they owned.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  They thought because they had little pointy headed lawyers and that because they were the big banker that everybody would just to give them the house.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  And the people tried to keep their house.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  They just call a SWAT team over.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  But we're going to teach the SWAT team what crux you are.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Your little filthy games over scum.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Play the tape.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Movers a truck and an armed deputy all while a nervous homeowner stands by and waits.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  This is normally what you'd see when a person's being foreclosed on and their property seized by a bank.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  But today is the other way around.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  They've ignored our calls, ignored our letters.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Legally, this is the next step to get my clients compensated.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  A Collier County judge said Bank of America had to pay Maureen Iyerges and her husband's legal fees after the bank tried to foreclose on their Golden Gate Estates property.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  But they paid cash.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  The courts agreed they never had a mortgage to begin with.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  After more than five months, the bank still hadn't paid up.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  So the homeowner's attorney did just what the bank would do to get their money, seize their assets.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  I instructed the deputy to go in and take desks, computers, copiers, filing cabinets, including cash in the drawers.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Outside the bank, several deputies stood by with movers ready to start hauling out the bank's office supplies and furniture.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Inside, the homeowner's attorney was locked out of the bank manager's office by deputies while the bank manager tried to figure out what to do.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  He was visibly shaken, you know, having two sheriff's deputies sitting across your desk and a lawyer standing up behind them, you know, demanding whatever assets are in the bank.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  It can be intimidating, but so is having your home foreclosed on when it wasn't right.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  After about an hour, the bank finally cut a check.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  So the cops and the courts did their job.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Now, how arrogant do these banks think they are?
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  How invincible? The news is they're not invincible.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  When we come back, we're going to explain their master plan for world government. It's public.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  You can educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest small owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America.

[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.

[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  You can get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com. That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  No one's gonna take me alive.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  I was a jock. I was the whole nine yards. I wasn't what you call a bookworm, but I was a bookworm.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  I started reading history books, and because I read hundreds of history books, from the time I could read, they had all those time-life World War I, World War II, time-life, western historical color, illustrated leather-bound books.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  That was the one thing my dad would buy. When I was a kid, I'd be watching TV and I'd say, I want those books. I want those books.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  I mean, just our whole house was full of books, and a lot of times I'd say, I want that toy or I want that bike, and they didn't really spoil me.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  But when it came to books, I knew I could get them, so they would just give me unlimited.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  And so I knew so much history that by the time I was in high school, they were telling me how bad America was and how bad the Second Amendment was,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  and by the time I went to college for a couple years and thought, I'm paying to be brainwashed, no thank you,
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  I had an understanding of what was happening. And then it got even more horrifying because I'd studied the history of banking and money-changing and the goldsmiths and all the manipulation in ancient Europe and all the wars that were started over it.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  And then I learned that some of the very families involved in that were running things today, and this is in mainline history.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  They just know the general public isn't into history. It freaked me out.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  And then I saw them get rid of Glass-Steagall in 99, and I was already on air, of course, for four or five years then, and I was just wanting to warn people,
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  because I knew that they were going from 10 times banking manipulation for every dollar to unlimited.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  And then I was reading IMF World Bank documents, watching Seaspan, watching Davos Switzerland meetings on Seaspan,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  where they were openly announcing, we're going to have a global carbon tax, we're going to tax all human activity, then only our friends will be able to operate,
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  only our companies will control the regulators. And I was just warning people, warning people, warning people, warning people.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  Ken Lay in 95 with Al Gore came up with the idea of the carbon trading because they couldn't get the direct tax.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  In fact, get that next clip ready, please, of the Obama's Commerce nominee, cap and trade good for hiding carbon taxes.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  We actually have the video of him saying it, and he says, people don't like taxes. They don't like new taxes on energy, so this is a way to hide it.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  I mean, you can't make this up. And I've had, like, David Rothschild on, heir to the Rothschild fortune three years ago.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  It's an end game. And I said, you want a carbon tax? And he laughed and said, there's no such thing as a carbon tax,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  even though he'd been on TV before that, promoting it. And you'd think, how arrogant, but it's about lying to the audience.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  It's about insulting you. He's only targeting those that don't know and hoping their ignorance. See, that's what they're counting on.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  They're counting on you staying out of the game. They're counting on you not being involved. They're counting on you not knowing what's going on.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  So imagine the carbon cycle, sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and oxygen. Those are the four things that cause life on this planet.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  If they can tax carbon dioxide, folks, it's over. Well, they're already doing it.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  And again, only General Electric's allowed to build new plants now. Everybody else isn't, or is being shut down.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  Because now they say carbon dioxide is evil, just like Obama's friends, thousands of major companies, including McDonald's.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  They don't have to get insurance. Your hamburger shop does.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  A water burger here in Texas, it doesn't get a waiver. McDonald's does. The water burger is going to go up in price.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  The McDonald's is going to go down. That's why McDonald's, half the new hires last month, were McDonald's.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  See, a managed economy, only the Walmart's, who have the inside deal with the Chinese Communist.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Only the McDonald's, who have the inside deal. Only the General Electric's, who have the inside deal can operate.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  It's called crony fascistic capitalism, not free market, the opposite.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  What did the founder of the Rockefeller family say, John D. Rockefeller?
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  Competition is a sin. Now listen, China calls U.S. culprit in global internet war.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Well, of course it is. And here's a CNN article.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Hackers gather around the globe to fight climate change.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  And it's run by NASA, the federal government, Google and Microsoft and Yahoo to attack people that don't agree with the global carbon taxes.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Now you notice all these hack attacks are getting launched.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Right as they try to pass cybersecurity, which admittedly gives Obama the internet kill switch.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Right as the U.N. tries to pass global regulations to shut down free speech,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  that White House regulations are cast sunsteens openly called for the hackers attack.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  Obama ships guns to Mexico to get your guns. I predicted it. Now they've announced it.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  You see how they stage everything, folks?
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Tarkozy seeks global net rules at U.N. meeting, Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  Okay, now getting back to their global tax.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  How are they going to fund this? And again, I saw this 10, 12 years ago.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  It was official that the IMF and World Bank, they're the global private Federal Reserve holding shell corporation.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  They said, we're going to tax everything you do and we're going to run everybody out of business.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  Host industrial world is what they call it.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  Here it is. Reuters.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  World Bank to suggest CO2 levy on jet and shipping fuel.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  At the wellhead, total global tax, paid to them. Reuters.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  And you go read the IMF World Bank announcements. They say a global governance run by the Bank of the World that all nations serve.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  It's been announced over and over again. You try to tell a yuppie that in the street they laugh because they're into being stylish.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  And they've been told for decades, kooks talk about world government.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  Ahead of it being announced, now that it's announced, they're like a deer in the headlights,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  hesitating while the very member banks of the IMF and World Bank, Bank of America,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Wells, all of them have been caught doing it. Taking homes they have no deed to that are paid off that they never had any part of.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  This is the same group. Okay, grow up.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Here is a clip.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  Here is a clip of Obama's commerce nominee, cap and trade, good for hiding carbon taxes.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  Hiding. Oh, guess what WikiLeaks just released.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  What we already had from Judicial Watch four years ago in in-game, my film,
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  that they already set up the North American Union in secret.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  And the number one agenda was to keep it secret from you. We were merged in 2007 with the European Union.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  Unbelievable. Let's go ahead and, America's been gone a long time.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  Only by admitting it can America come back. Here they are saying, the Obama administration,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  John Bryson, President's nominee to head up Commerce Department, saying we got to hide our tax as cap and trade. Here it is.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  For Project Catalyst, that work said, focusing on the next decade, which is what I said I would focus on,
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  energy efficiency steps, if fully exploited. Very hard to do, okay.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  But if fully exploited, and I believe the model I've suggested can contribute into big ways to actually getting the job done,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  but if fully exploited, the energy efficiency opportunity would provide about one third.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  Okay, folks, stop it right there. It's an eight minute video. I forgot to cue it up before the show to the part where he says it,
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  but you can actually just go read the quotes and watch the full video at CNF News.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  We have it linked on InfoWars. Obama's Commerce nominee, cap and trade good for hiding carbon taxes.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Greenhouse gas legislation, either way, tax or with cap and trade, which is more competitive way of getting it done.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  The advantage politically of sort of hiding the fact that you have a tax, but that's what you're trying to do.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  And he goes on to say, taxes on energy are unpopular, but that's how we sneak it through.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  That's how we sneak it through. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  They turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  One of my IT folks just brought me the Shoutcast report.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  For about four years we've been the number one radio show on the internet according to Shoutcast and Google Analytics.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  But this is just in from the month of May.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  We had 24,753,204 substantive tune-ins.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  So 24,700,000 people tuned in just over the free audio streams.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Getting close to 600,000 a day listening to the free podcast.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  That's kind of an old design podcast.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  We need to revamp the way you get delivery of it on the listen page at infowars.com.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  And we're very, very excited about that.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  It shows how successful the message of liberty is.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  Look at Ron Paul three years ago, not getting much traction now, number two in most of the polls in Republican candidates.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Look at Max Kaiser with his shows on BBC, RT, Press TV.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Getting ready to go to Greece and speak to over 100,000 people.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  Headline Greece austerity protests grows.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  The people learn about the Goldman Sachs swindle, same group.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  We have Bank of America gets padlocked after homeowner forecloses on it.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  By the way, if you want to see those Shoutcast numbers just go to the top of Shoutcast and click their statistics.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  Number one, not just in talk radio, period music, we're only live three hours a day folks and beat everything combined.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  Side issue, sorry. That's why I'm the keynote speaker at Talkers.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  Again, normally I don't talk about this stuff, but it's a it's a signet, a logo, a sign of liberty rising.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  Very exciting.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  But to go over all the financial news here with us is Max Kaiser, who's also the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange virtual trading system.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  He's a virtual specialist technology inventor used on many of the stock exchanges worldwide, maxkaiser.com.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Max, before you go any further though, your rant that we linked up to Saturday on infoawards.com when you were on international RT,
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  where you have a show but you were a guest, breaking down.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  And I'd seen this in the news, but billions and billions, they say seven to 10 billion of Gaddafi's money invested with the big banks.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  He even got some of the bailout money we now learn has disappeared.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  And of course, they said no ground invasion. They said the bombs were love bombs and kinetic.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  Now we know ground troops are there.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  So break down where the banksters are right now and what they're up to.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  Well, it all goes back to, yeah, by the way, thanks for having me on the show.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  It all goes back to 2004, if you remember, Tony Blair was over in Libya and making nice nights with Gaddafi
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  and welcoming him back to the world community.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  And he was going to dismantle his weapons of terror.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  And at that time, Tony Blair was still the prime minister of Britain,
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  but he already had his eye on his post prime ministerial job,
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  which was to join the board of directors of JP Morgan, which he now is part of JP Morgan.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  He started that job on the second week after leaving number 10 Downing Street.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  But back in 2004, when he's in Libya, he's already basically setting the table for these banksters to come in
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  like Goldman Sachs and Society General, who, incidentally, those two banks got huge bailout money during the 2008 bailout period.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  So Tony Blair set the table, he set up the deals, and then we left his job as prime minister of Britain.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  He went into the revolving door.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  He was forced to make introductions, and of course, Libya has this huge sovereign wealth fund that they accumulated
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  being in the oil business, and Goldman Sachs swoops in there, and they say,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  yeah, we'll manage part of this business, a billion dollar or more of the business,
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  and they managed to blow through 98% of that account by just spinning the sovereign wealth fund,
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  as any of these banksters do, when they get a hold of large chunks of money.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  They engaged in weapons of mass financial destruction, and they blew a billion dollars of that money.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Also, here in France, Society General, they got a hold of a billion dollars.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  They lost 75%, 80% of that money, churning and burning, doing trades and engaged,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  and at the same time getting bailout money from all the...
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  So they made a deal?
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Billions, but give them billions, and then they turn around and lose that money,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  and they go into Libya and take that money, and they're all feeding themselves these huge bonuses,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  and so it's all Tony Blair's involved, the bankers are involved,
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  the politics have merged with the banks, and they are this global establishment, this cartel,
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  that uses their influence to strong on their way into these economies,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  and I would imagine once they blow up Qaddafi, once they kill him,
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  then, of course, they don't have to worry about a lawsuit.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Finally, member Saddam Hussein started trading his oil in euros.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  They killed him.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  They don't like the leader of Iran, because he's talking about trading oil in euros,
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  so, of course, he's been targeted for some kind of action by military forces,
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  so if you step out of line, they will come in there and they will assassinate you,
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  or they'll just come in there and start managing your money.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Like they do for pension accounts all over America and Great Britain,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  losing billions and billions of dollars engaged in all their fraudulent trading,
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  and it's all subsidized by the taxpayer.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  At any time they make a mistake, they strong arm the Congress, as was done in 2008,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  to give them billions and billions more of bailout money,
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  so it's a mafia cartel, it's global, and Qaddafi is the latest victim.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  Now, Max expanding on that, we have the Senate committee saying clearly Goldman Sachs lied again,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  crimes have been committed, more subpoenas are going around.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  The problem is, almost the entire Treasury and federal government at the management level
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  are former Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan or Bank of America or Wells Fargo, alumni, city bank,
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  all of the usual suspects, the private Federal Reserve shareholders,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  and they've also put their people in over Greece, over Ireland, over Iceland, over Portugal,
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  and everywhere they have their people in, they loot and steal everything,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  and we did learn in Iceland, of course, you were there a few years before this happened,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  at a bar with them, they were bragging to you,
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  that over 90% of the debt was not owed by the people, it was owed by the bankers,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  and so this is coup d'etat by bankers, world government by bankers,
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  but more and more people are standing up to them.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  You're about to go to Greece, tell us about the resistance to these people mounting worldwide.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  Well, you see in Greece, there's a protest today, the biggest so far,
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  I just got news from somebody who was at the protest,
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  who said the numbers are closer to 250,000 in Parliament Square,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  and they are identifying clearly the enemy as the bankers,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  and the government has been involved in really an unbelievably atrocious act
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  of what many in Greece are now calling treason.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  When he came to power, going back in 2009,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  he immediately sold a billion in credit default swaps to his friends
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  in credit Swiss banks and other cronies in Greece.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Within five months, when the IMF came in and said,
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  well, we're going to have to start rearranging the furniture here,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  that particular trade was worth $27 billion,
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  and so he knowingly put 20 billion or so profits into the pockets of his cronies,
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  and that's 20 billion, if they were on the books of Greece today,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  would pay down most of their debt problems.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  So that is an act of treason by the folks in Greece
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  who have identified Papadreos, the Prime Minister, as a treasonous rat
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  that they need to get out of their fighting against the Troika.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  And it just came out today, Alex, that the advisors who are advising the Greek government now
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  on the assets that need to be sold to pay the debt,
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  and the debt, of course, was not originated in Greece.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  The debt was hoisted on to the Greek people from outside,
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  from the global banking cartel.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  Now to settle the debt that the people themselves had nothing to do in incurring,
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  Deutsche Bank will get their state gambling monopoly,
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  Credit Swiss will get the state lotteries,
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  the Rothschilds and Barclays will get the road concessions,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  PricewaterhouseCooper will get the railway,
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  FrancisBNT and the Greece's National Bank are getting the airport concessions,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  and Lazard are going to get the Greek trust and loan funds.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  So here you have a hueso of the global banksters,
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  they're carving up the economy in Greece using the debt that was never there to begin with,
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  that they just forced onto the people using inside cronyism with the Prime Minister involved,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  clearly, to carve up the country and take those assets,
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  and the country is in effect losing its sovereignty.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  And this is what we're seeing across Europe,
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  and we're going to see it in the UK, in the US, and North Africa, and in the mid-east.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  This is the model, this is how people are losing their sovereignty.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  And it's happening in Greece, it is the roadmap, it's the model.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  That's right, Max, stay there.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  Max, we've got to go to break, we're going to come back.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  And this is on record, I saw a few months ago, the head of the Irish central bank,
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  said, we don't know this money, but we want the foreign mechs to own and run us. Incredible.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.

[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple. Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  On the GCN radio network.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  I was busy during the break trying to find the BBC and Irish Times headline where a few months ago the head of Ireland's central bank, a former Goldman Sachs guy, said,
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  We want Ireland to be run by foreign banks. Yes, we don't owe this money, but it's good to owe it. So this is too big to fail. Banks that did all this betting and then they get governments to sign on, then the governments come in and reduce the country's credit rating and say,
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  Now you've got to pay us, the people you just bailed out, even more money. Yes, you bail the banks out, then you pay them interest in taxes and carbon taxes.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  I did find this one Irish Times. Ireland's future depends on breaking free from bailout.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Remember Ireland was the shining, wealthy example suddenly of Europe and then overnight they sign on to the Euro, they're imploded, they're in debt to the bankers.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Max, you're an expert in this. I mean, how do you describe a fraud this overwhelming to people?
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  The bankers, this inner cotery of six global banks, they engage in mass fraud and then they have all the government officials as their former alumni openly being paid off by them and they sign you over.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  I mean, I saw in Greece where you're about to go, where hundreds of islands worth billions of piece that Greece has are being given in some cases to American hedge fund owners as payment to them for fraud they created.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  I mean, this is like I rob a bank and I get a gold medal for it. I mean, this is insane, Max.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Well, it's like what we used to do on Wall Street, the leverage buyout or hostile raid. You use the collateral of the company or in this case the country as the collateral for the loan that you use to take over the company or the country,
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  then you sell off the component parts and you keep what's left as the profit. So this is, you know, Greece is only a $300 billion country. So it's not even as big as Walmart, one U.S. company.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  And that's why they want to implode countries because then they get to buy them up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  Right. And you mentioned it before, you know, the question is how does this all happen and why so, you know, how's it gotten so out of hand. And you mentioned it earlier when you talked about repeal of Glass-Steagall in 97.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  That was a huge step in the wrong direction. But then in 2000, at the very last few moments of Clinton's administration, you had the introduction of the Commodity Features Modernization Act.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  And this allowed banks and fund managers to go from that, let's say, 10 to 1 ratio that you were talking about earlier to 30, 40, 50, 60 to 1 ratio.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  And so they were able to borrow, in the case of Greece, for example, it's a $300 billion economy, but the bets that are being made against Greece equate to 3 to 4 trillion in derivatives and credit default swaps.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  And there's no end to the negative bets that can be created because you just create them at the flick of a switch from nothing. They're just produced electronically.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  So no matter what the Greek people do to say that they're going to pay off whatever debt that they never incurred to begin with, Wall Street will just create 10 times more of that in a negative bet and saying,
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  oh, well, it doesn't really matter because, in fact, you owe us 10 times more. And then Moody's and S&P and Fitch, the so-called neutral credit rating agencies, who are also in on this basically cartel, this mafia,
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  they are constantly downgrading the bonds of Greece. And of course, this is making it impossible for them to get out from under this mafia control.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  So yes, that is correct. They want to be able to buy islands. They want the airport. They want the lottery. They want the transportation. They want the infrastructure.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  They don't want to pay more than a penny on the dollar for it. And it's a hostile raid coordinated by the government. George Papadreus, the prime minister, is involved in this.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  He's committing an act of tyranny, as described by the people there in Greece, as well as these funds.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  And you know, Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, was in Greece just two years ago with John Paulson, who's one of the biggest hedge fund managers in the world.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  They had a meeting across from the Acropolis discussing, at that time, and this has been recorded, how they would carve up the destruction of the country.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  And John Paulson started making these incredible bets against Greece, just like he made those incredible bets against American housing, making those subprime bets that made him over a billion dollars in profits in one year.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  Betting against American housing. That's right, because they're using inside information that was passed to him from Goldman Sachs.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  That's why Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO, is facing possible perjury charges in front of Congress and the Department of Justice because he's lied about his relationship with the fund managers in passing inside information.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  And on that note, let me just make a quick observation here. It's come out recently that Senators and Congressmen in Washington, this is really incredible, Alex, they are exempt from any insider trading law.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  You can look this up on Google. If you're a Washington Senator or a Congressman or a staff member, you can trade on inside information completely outside of any law that's supposed to prohibit that.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  You are exempt from any of those laws. So the people who manage money in those circles, they're constantly making 10, 20% more than the market because they're saying they're such astute money managers, but there's a direct pipeline.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  No, that's why people get into Congress. That's why billionaires will pay $100 million to get into Congress because they can make another billion out of it.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  But let's stop there and explain something to people. The Democrats are saying give us more government, go into more debt because they're bought and paid for by the big mega banks.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  The Republicans are saying slash everything with austerity, but not so we can get out of debt. No amount of slashing, and I've seen the numbers, would get anywhere near getting us out of debt.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  It's designed so folks need to understand that these Republicans saying austerity, privatization, austerity and privatization means being gang raped by the offshore banks who control both parties and the leadership.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  There's the headline insider trading rules that don't apply to Congress. We've got the Wall Street Journal and others and Forbes.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  That's Forbes on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers in case you're a new listener or watching on PrisonPlanet.TV and think Max is making this stuff up on screen.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  This is the criminal takeover. It's why they're so arrogant. It's why they're setting up the police state here domestically because they don't want you to take your government back and prosecute them.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  So understand you could cut everything. You could get rid of all entitlements. You're talking about less than a couple trillion a year. Max, they have created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives. They've had their criminal agents in government worldwide.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  They put their people in everywhere, sign on to the debt. They tell you it's your debt and now you have to give them all your infrastructure, raise your taxes, cut your social security, take your private pension funds, take the veterans pension funds.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  It's all happening debt bondage. In closing, Max Kaiser, what do you make of the good news, though, with the robo-signing suits and all the rest of it?
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  And Bank of America, CBS News, having one of their branch banks seized, the deputies threatened to take the money out of the cash register, out of the bank till, to pay the family that had their home that they never had a mortgage with Bank of America.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  They never had a mortgage. They paid cash and Bank of America knew this, but still all over the country and the world, banks are taking houses that they don't even own.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  I mean, this shows that the facade of these crooks and suits is imploding.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  Well, there's another big side to that story. The side that you described, and I've been listening to this show when you've been talking about it, the fact that the banks have illegally been foreclosing on folks, and that's after they illegally induced them to take on mortgages outside of the law to begin with.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  But there's another big side to this story, is that once they made these illegal mortgage loans, they packaged them and sold them to foreign investors or foreign banks as a securitized loan.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  And now the banks at these foreign banks are saying, wait a minute, you sold us a 20, 30, 50 billion dollar package of securitized loans, but we know, reading the papers in the U.S., that those loan documents don't exist.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  So these securities that you sold us are invalid, and now they're trying to push those back to the U.S. government.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  And the U.S. government, as you also reported, are buying 98% of their own treasury bills, and they're buying some astronomical sum of their own treasury paper.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  Wait, I thought it was 75.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  I want to buy U.S. paper.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  I thought it was 75, Max.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  You're saying 98%?
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Well, the number that you quoted earlier on the T-bill market was over 90% on the T-bill market, which is the very liquid paper that they're not buying anymore.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  But the issue here is they're selling mortgages in these packages when they don't ever even own the house.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  This isn't just they're selling bad loans.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  I mean, why shouldn't they though?
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  If they're going to engage in all these crimes, Max, why not go all the way?
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Well, this is why you talked about austerity measures.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  In the United States, the poison on offer is not austerity.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  The poison on offer is inflation, and that's why in the U.S. the problem is the food and energy prices are skyrocketing because the pay for all the malfeasance the government is creating more and more and more money.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  The things that Ron Paul talks about all the time.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  So the average American is having their food and energy prices go up and down.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Absolutely, Max.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  Well, at the same time, the house prices are falling in value.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  You're right.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  We're out of time, Max.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  MaxKaiser.com.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  See you back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  We'll have Max back later in the week if he can on the inflation bomb.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  That's how they're robbing you.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  They're crooks.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  Max, wake up.
