[00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.572]  Thanks to Inventech, no one's gonna cash in but me.
[00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:08.675]  They're going to help me get my invention off the drawing board and into the marketplace.
[00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.376]  I really need Inventech.
[00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:11.417]  What's that number again?
[00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:11.957]  1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:12.377]  One more time?
[00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:12.778]  Call 1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:13.058]  That's 1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:39.573]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.874]  Big Brother.
[00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.654]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:44.414]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:45.975]  You want answers?
[00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:46.875]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:51.736]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:55.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.242 --> 00:01:07.412]  The big Texas Independence Day rally is tomorrow, March 2nd.
[00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:11.636]  It is March 1st.
[00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:23.054]  Already the beginning of the third month of 2007.
[00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:40.880]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and I want to open the phones up for the entire three hours and take your calls on the BBC Building 7 implosion, controlled demolition, cover-up on the latest Oklahoma City revelations that came out a week ago.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.783]  On what's happening to the global stock market and the stock markets here in the United States with the different indexes, indices.
[00:01:50.783 --> 00:02:02.506]  We want to discuss how the carriers are lined up and major publications are reporting that the White House is intending to order an attack on Iran simultaneously with Israel.
[00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:09.848]  With Israel getting clearance from Arab states, Gulf states to fly over their nations to attack Iran.
[00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:25.659]  Ahmed Adinejad, depending on the pronunciation you favor, is going to engage in an extremely rare trip to Saudi Arabia, their arch enemies with the Sunni versus the Shia.
[00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:34.101]  We have just got so much news going on as we literally edge up against the edge of the precipice.
[00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:56.816]  I remember the old-timers always saying there'd be World War III starting in the Middle East, and the Russians and the Chinese might be involved, and there'd be a domestic police state and foreign troops, and North American unions and cameras everywhere, and even when I was just waking up, an anti-federal reserve, an anti-police state, 12, 15 years ago, I guess I woke up about 15 years ago, got on air over 12 years ago,
[00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:04.454]  I still didn't buy into all that, and boy did they know what they were talking about, because now we've entered that time!
[00:03:04.454 --> 00:03:07.517]  We've got a government that blows up skyscrapers right in front of us.
[00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:11.522]  We've got a government that puts live cancer viruses in our vaccines.
[00:03:11.522 --> 00:03:15.826]  We've got a, and I'm not talking about the new one they're pushing that's a live cancer virus to cure cancer.
[00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:19.610]  I mean, they put cancer viruses in many of the other vaccines.
[00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.752]  We live in just an insane astralum.
[00:03:23.044 --> 00:03:31.530]  We are in a total Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Brave New World, Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs land.
[00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.151]  Every day is so exciting.
[00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:35.072]  Every day is a new twist.
[00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:38.174]  And I want to hear what you think is going to happen in the next year, the next two years.
[00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.575]  Will they go into Iran?
[00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.597]  What do you think will happen when they go into Iran?
[00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:51.803]  What do you think about the BBC and now CNN cover-up of the footage of them saying, yeah, Building 7, Salomon Brothers, has fallen.
[00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:53.324]  There's been big new developments there.
[00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:54.325]  We'll go through for you.
[00:03:55.723 --> 00:04:01.626]  The toll-free number to join us on this first day of March, beware the Ides of March, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:05.569]  When we get back, I'll go straight into the World Economic Outlook right now.
[00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.270]  Global stock markets resume plunge.
[00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.330]  This out of AFP.
[00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.351]  AP, stocks try to recover.
[00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:10.331]  Nice spin there.
[00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:28.249]  Africa, where the next U.S.
[00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:29.430]  oil wars may be.
[00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.971]  Interesting article I have there.
[00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:32.252]  Greenspan says, U.S.
[00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:33.994]  recession possible, not probable.
[00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:36.616]  We're already in a recession.
[00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:41.320]  And much more, coming up today, here on the broadcast.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.422]  And then we'll get into the latest information.
[00:04:43.422 --> 00:04:45.144]  Media blacklist.
[00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.366]  BBC fiasco.
[00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:49.227]  Google dig sensor.
[00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:49.948]  9-11 truth.
[00:04:52.117 --> 00:05:00.601]  News 24 timestamp video disappears from Google Video, despite the fact it's under 30 seconds in length and clearly contains fair use.
[00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:06.303]  Digg lets small minority of morons decide its content.
[00:05:06.303 --> 00:05:11.405]  I called Paul this morning and I said, Paul, did you forget Digg, two months ago, banned us for a time?
[00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:12.265]  Until protest.
[00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:16.527]  Our stories were banned by the Digg bigwigs.
[00:05:16.527 --> 00:05:18.448]  When you get one of the biggest websites out there in the top 50,
[00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:28.614]  And, uh, it's because we go on their main page and we become the number one story and we wake the people up and... That place is Spook Central, folks.
[00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:31.338]  In fact, that's now been discovered and documented.
[00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:32.078]  We have them...
[00:05:38.434 --> 00:05:41.939]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.261]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:51.911]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.043]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:11.787]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:15.728]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:18.009]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.850]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:35.474 --> 00:06:39.076]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:39.797]  are located?
[00:06:39.797 --> 00:06:43.419]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.191]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:38.672]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:41.874]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:45.176]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:52.480]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:26.287]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:26.287 --> 00:08:27.867]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:51.588 --> 00:09:05.999]  Texas Independence Day rally tomorrow, kicking off right here in Austin, Texas, starting where Congress meets the river, about 600 yard march down to the Capitol.
[00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.361]  Try to get down there about one o'clock.
[00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:09.602]  The march starts at two.
[00:09:09.602 --> 00:09:17.007]  There will be three hours of speeches, including myself, Jimmy Vaughn, Hank Gilbert, and many, many others.
[00:09:17.007 --> 00:09:18.989]  Ron Paul's Chief of Staff is going to be there.
[00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:31.582]  And this is the kind of Texas Independence Day rally we need, not one where people literally go out and get drunk and wave Texas flags, having no idea what the Lone Star State even means.
[00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:37.804]  Well, coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to play a Johnny Cash song.
[00:09:37.804 --> 00:09:39.885]  And of course, that is, remember, the Alamo.
[00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:49.531]  That is coming up, and we'll break down more details of why you need to come to the rally no matter where you live in surrounding states.
[00:09:49.531 --> 00:10:08.102]  I want to see you there tomorrow because we're fighting the Trans-Texas Corridor, the NAFTA Superhighway, which will be the taxing, one of the main taxing mechanisms for the North American Union, the National Animal Identification System, and much, much more.
[00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:10.804]  Right now, let me get into the top stories.
[00:10:12.032 --> 00:10:28.042]  A few days ago, Alan Greenspan, what, on Monday, came out and said, as part of an international conference in Hong Kong, and said that we're probably going to enter a recession.
[00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:32.905]  He said we're probably going to enter a recession, if not later this year, early 2008.
[00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:36.427]  Now, if you really look at all the economic indicators and the real numbers,
[00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:40.331]  This country's been in a recession for decades.
[00:10:40.331 --> 00:10:56.243]  In the past, the United States enjoyed 8 to 10 percent growth rates, right up until the 1970s, and they've been at around 3 percent a year ever since, not even catching up with real inflation, not the cooked 3 percent on average that we've seen.
[00:10:56.243 --> 00:11:00.506]  There's been 20 percent inflation in the last five years.
[00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:06.631]  The dollar's been devalued against the pound by half, near half against the euro,
[00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:11.859]  And that plunge is only accelerating.
[00:11:11.859 --> 00:11:20.070]  And Greenspan knew exactly what he was doing when he said that in the conference via satellite connection from New York.
[00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:38.686]  But then they always hedge their bets to then not get blamed when they want to manipulate, when they want to drive down markets in speculation, profit-taking by the globalists who are the insiders who then get to always basically cheat the system to always get ahead of others because they have the inside information.
[00:11:38.686 --> 00:11:45.892]  Then he comes out and says, oh no, I'm saying that recession's possible, not probable.
[00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:54.772]  This out of Bloomberg Financial, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said a recession in the U.S.
[00:11:54.772 --> 00:12:07.022]  is possible, though not probable this year, as excess inventory is being reduced quickly, according to people attending a CLSA Japan forum in Tokyo today.
[00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:10.164]  So he's saying probably not this year, but next year.
[00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:12.146]  He's really saying the same thing again, just differently.
[00:12:12.806 --> 00:12:16.548]  By the end of this year, there is a possibility, but not the probability, of a U.S.
[00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:25.972]  moving into recession, Greenspan said, according to notes taken by Bernard Key, a former economics professor at Tama University in Tokyo, who attended the event.
[00:12:25.972 --> 00:12:31.154]  So, on Monday, it was Greenspan popping in via the big screen, via SAT.
[00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:33.480]  I think so.
[00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:52.273]  And the original statement is a hedge bet by Greenspan.
[00:12:52.273 --> 00:12:58.836]  Meanwhile, the new Fed Chairman, now in for a year, Eber Bernanke, has made the M3 money supply secret.
[00:12:58.836 --> 00:13:02.238]  And they'd already doubled the money supply from 2000 to 2006.
[00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:11.903]  And now Bernanke, before he made the M3 money supply secret, announced that they would double it in the next two years.
[00:13:11.903 --> 00:13:14.985]  So, folks, this is 1929-type stuff we're witnessing.
[00:13:18.471 --> 00:13:24.235]  It took over 20 years for the Federal Reserve to double the money supply up until 2000.
[00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:29.138]  Then they doubled it from 2000 to 2006, the beginning of 2006.
[00:13:29.138 --> 00:13:35.923]  Bernanke came in in February, and heaven help us, no one even knows what they're doing now, but it's clear that
[00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.352]  They're just printing at an insane rate.
[00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:43.454]  And not just printing, because you've only got about 1.5%.
[00:13:43.454 --> 00:13:44.794]  Everybody keeps using the old 3%.
[00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:46.596]  That's an old number.
[00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:49.717]  1.5% or lower.
[00:13:49.717 --> 00:13:53.420]  That's as of the doubling by 2006.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.341]  1.5% actual paper currency, or cotton.
[00:13:56.341 --> 00:13:59.903]  I always say paper, it's really cotton.
[00:13:59.903 --> 00:14:03.886]  1.5% actual greenbacks in global circulation.
[00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:24.290]  Versus the digital records of Federal Reserve issuance of credit and notes, money, the currency, consisting of 98 plus percent.
[00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.415]  If there is any attempt, any attempt, for people to get their cash out of the banks,
[00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:35.061]  You will see total runs and an implosion of the economy.
[00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:37.142]  I don't like to report this.
[00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:47.850]  I'm so busy, the little bit of money I've got in the bank is just sitting there because I don't have the time to go figure out what to do with my children's little college funds.
[00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.371]  It's just horrible.
[00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:52.994]  And it's all been done by design, and when they do it, when they drop the hammer on us,
[00:14:54.401 --> 00:15:02.106]  They will stand up on television and pose as our saviors and the general public will do exactly what they say and thank them for the crash.
[00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:05.427]  The very central banks that have set up this climate.
[00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:10.310]  Let me just go back before I get into the global economic news and go back to 1929.
[00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:18.315]  Let me just go back and briefly describe this.
[00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:28.229]  You had the Federal Reserve take over the banking system and the regulatory system of the entire banking system.
[00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:39.555]  Again, when you think about the banking system, most of the banking system is not part of a Federal Reserve shareholding bank.
[00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:44.797]  They're just under the Federal Reserve FDIC regulatory umbrella.
[00:15:47.550 --> 00:16:13.722]  And there had been little runs on banks, small problems, but it wasn't centralized, so the economy grew at around, until 1913, at around 10%, then it slowed to about 6% again into the 70s, so things did slow once they got control, and they promised, the Central Bank promised that if you'll just give us a Federal Reserve, no more booms, no more busts, just steady growth, no more runs, no more problems.
[00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:14.362]  They took over in 1913,
[00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:20.263]  And in 1929, there was the biggest depression this country had ever seen.
[00:16:20.263 --> 00:16:23.991]  In fact, the first depression this nation had ever had.
[00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:26.636]  And what they did was, they cranked up the presses.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:49.369]  And printed masses of money and they took the fractional reserve banking from around 4 to 1 to 10 to 1 and then to 15 to 1 and that means that if a bank has $1 of your deposit, now this is the non-Federal Reserve Banks, but the Federal Reserve Banks do it as well, if they have $1 of your deposit, they loan out 10 times
[00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:53.137]  That's the general rules.
[00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.297]  They keep it about ten times.
[00:16:54.297 --> 00:16:55.938]  Sometimes it goes higher, sometimes lower.
[00:16:55.938 --> 00:16:58.879]  The Federal Reserve sets all this policy.
[00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:06.862]  That bank can then, just on a ballot sheet, just on a record sheet, loan out ten times for any deposits it has.
[00:17:06.862 --> 00:17:13.145]  They can also use assets the bank holds and then leverage those ten times.
[00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:14.566]  Well, it was simple.
[00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.567]  They cranked up the printing presses, opened up the lending,
[00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:23.997]  And then the newspapers advertised how the stock market was a win-win.
[00:17:23.997 --> 00:17:26.038]  You could not lose.
[00:17:26.038 --> 00:17:31.079]  The stock market was making 25-30% profits a year and growing.
[00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:33.500]  There was a basic hysteria going.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.120]  And then they crashed the stock market.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.281]  And the newspapers all reported it was a huge crash and hyped it.
[00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:42.022]  The big Hearstone and other key newspapers.
[00:17:42.022 --> 00:17:43.662]  They wanted to bankrupt all their competition.
[00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:58.914]  And then, for the next ten years, there was a massive monetary restriction on lending and the physical money supply.
[00:17:58.914 --> 00:18:08.637]  People ran to the banks to get their cash, because they were solvent, even if they weren't heavily into the markets, and they couldn't physically pay them back.
[00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:12.999]  Then the banks called in the farm and ranch and home and factory and business.
[00:18:13.769 --> 00:18:18.170]  And Merchant Loans.
[00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.871]  That's right.
[00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:20.411]  That's coming up.
[00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:23.732]  Thanks for reminding me, John.
[00:18:23.732 --> 00:18:25.912]  We'll play that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:25.912 --> 00:18:30.093]  I told John to come in with that then, and I'm busy ranting about the market.
[00:18:30.093 --> 00:18:35.275]  We'll play it later.
[00:18:35.275 --> 00:18:35.935]  Going back here.
[00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.692]  And so they restricted the physical money supply.
[00:18:39.692 --> 00:18:41.353]  There were runs on banks.
[00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.075]  You couldn't get your money out of banks.
[00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:48.459]  And I remember in the 80s and 90s, hearing the yuppies go, these dumb old people, they don't trust banks.
[00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:49.040]  Ha ha!
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.201]  Grandma doesn't trust a bank.
[00:18:51.201 --> 00:18:55.044]  Grandma's got gold buried in the backyard.
[00:18:55.044 --> 00:19:01.930]  Well, that's because Grandma was a young lady and watched her daddy and mommy lose everything they had.
[00:19:03.237 --> 00:19:04.137]  Oh, but that wasn't enough.
[00:19:04.137 --> 00:19:10.179]  They knew the old-timers didn't trust the banks to begin with, so they had gold.
[00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:15.361]  So after four years of depression, Roosevelt comes in, declares martial law with the War Powers Act.
[00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:16.081]  You ought to go read it.
[00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:19.722]  It was issued nationwide, hung up on all the courthouses.
[00:19:19.722 --> 00:19:21.263]  And the state police were set up.
[00:19:21.263 --> 00:19:22.863]  They've always been federal.
[00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:24.544]  Federally chartered police were set up.
[00:19:25.974 --> 00:19:33.040]  And the federal government declared martial law, and a private corporation, the Bank of England, took the country under total receivership.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.262]  This is in the mainstream history books if you just know where to look.
[00:19:35.262 --> 00:19:37.444]  It's just hidden in plain view.
[00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:48.954]  And the country went into its first wave of receivership, but there was still tons of private property and liberty and the spirit of freedom, so it took them decades to get us to what we are now, land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:53.838]  Land of the obese, stupid, dumbed-down, foaming-at-the-mouth sports fans.
[00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.591]  From the land of people known worldwide.
[00:19:57.591 --> 00:20:01.094]  If you wanted to fight, come pick one and you'd certainly get your clock clean.
[00:20:01.094 --> 00:20:07.938]  And people who were into liberty and freedom and a dynamo of the planet.
[00:20:07.938 --> 00:20:12.421]  And so, they orchestrated the whole thing and said, by law, you must turn in all your gold.
[00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:14.922]  And they sent police to people's houses.
[00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.844]  They had tattletales and they had rewards.
[00:20:17.844 --> 00:20:19.425]  Is somebody paying in gold?
[00:20:19.425 --> 00:20:20.246]  Have you seen gold?
[00:20:21.187 --> 00:20:22.410]  They sent in the regulators.
[00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.793]  What's the BATF today?
[00:20:23.793 --> 00:20:27.220]  They went into farms and ranches, gunned people down with Tommy guns.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.502]  Got the gold!
[00:20:28.502 --> 00:20:30.667]  We'll be back and tell you more about it.
[00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:31.909]  Don't worry, they'll do it again.
[00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.572]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:41.637]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:41.637 --> 00:20:46.224]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:46.224 --> 00:20:47.366]  So what do you do?
[00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:51.933]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:52.413 --> 00:20:55.034]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:55.034 --> 00:21:09.759]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:21:26.344 --> 00:21:27.685]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:27.685 --> 00:21:28.145]  One and the same.
[00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.912]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:50.993]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:50.993 --> 00:21:51.553]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:51.553 --> 00:21:53.334]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:53.334 --> 00:21:53.814]  Here is reality.
[00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:55.855]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:14.903]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:14.903 --> 00:22:19.084]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:19.084 --> 00:22:23.166]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:38.849]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:38.849 --> 00:22:41.770]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:48.414]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:22:48.414 --> 00:22:54.437]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[00:22:54.437 --> 00:22:56.638]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:22:56.638 --> 00:22:57.399]  There may be more.
[00:22:58.602 --> 00:23:06.085]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:14.768]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:35.608 --> 00:23:42.333]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:46.617]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:23:46.617 --> 00:23:49.139]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:23:49.139 --> 00:23:51.081]  All natural Non-X clears out the sore
[00:23:51.101 --> 00:23:51.401]  I think so.
[00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:13.139]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:28.243]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:24:28.243 --> 00:24:33.605]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:41.286]  I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[00:24:41.286 --> 00:24:46.868]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:54.792]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[00:24:54.792 --> 00:25:00.514]  And when you're out there, well out there, yeah I was out of touch.
[00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:02.315]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[00:25:08.427 --> 00:25:12.970]  Does that make us crazy?
[00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:13.470]  Welcome back.
[00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.792]  Your calls will be in the next segment.
[00:25:15.792 --> 00:25:20.276]  Ed and John and Rita and Logan and Jimmy and others.
[00:25:20.276 --> 00:25:25.920]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.720]  Just finishing up.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.005]  So in 1933, they made all privately held gold as an investment or a currency illegal.
[00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:35.107]  Even gold chains they tried to confiscate.
[00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:41.122]  Most of the population, dutifully trusting their government, went and turned them in for paper notes.
[00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:47.065]  Now remember, they wouldn't give your money out of the bank, and they said, that's alright, bring your gold in and we'll give it to you.
[00:25:47.065 --> 00:26:00.272]  Then one year after the gold was confiscated, they doubled the price of gold, and the gold was publicly transferred to Europe, and it was still illegal for many years to buy gold as an investment.
[00:26:00.272 --> 00:26:05.355]  The Firestone family, some of them got arrested for setting up dummy corporations in Europe trying to buy gold.
[00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:08.307]  So don't think it can't happen here, okay?
[00:26:08.307 --> 00:26:10.068]  Don't think they won't do it.
[00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:14.170]  They've done it before, and they engineered the crash of 1929.
[00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:22.074]  Now, I don't think that's what's happening right now, but we've gotten way more extended than we were in 1929.
[00:26:22.074 --> 00:26:29.757]  In fact, last year we crossed the Rubicon to the highest private debt ratio in U.S.
[00:26:29.757 --> 00:26:30.278]  history.
[00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:30.678]  Higher
[00:26:31.903 --> 00:26:35.126]  And we are, overall, a debtor nation.
[00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:39.070]  We have a negative balance of accounts privately.
[00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:44.755]  We passed that number last year to have a higher debt ratio of private citizens.
[00:26:44.755 --> 00:26:53.723]  We are in debt more than in late 1933, which is the marker for the depth of the Great Depression.
[00:26:53.723 --> 00:26:55.725]  The depth of the Great Depression.
[00:26:57.325 --> 00:27:07.331]  And they tell you, measure your wealth by how much debt you're in and how many mortgages you have and just keep living on credit.
[00:27:07.331 --> 00:27:20.598]  And when they decide to then start restricting the money supply, it will be physically impossible, physically impossible for you to pay off debts.
[00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:24.280]  Because they will tell you that the banks have gone under,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.944]  It'll take three, four, five years, unless you're a big corporation, to have the FDIC reimburse you.
[00:27:30.944 --> 00:27:44.232]  So during that period, they're going to take your house, your car, your business, but don't worry, they've got all the big FEMA camps they've built, where they'll have soup and beds, but because of crime at the facilities, they'll have to split your families up.
[00:27:44.232 --> 00:27:46.273]  This has all been announced.
[00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:51.316]  And your children, of course, will have to, in some cases, go to other facilities, just like you saw with Katrina.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.403]  And they'll be nice men in black masks ready to gun you down to keep order and save the nation.
[00:27:57.403 --> 00:28:01.166]  And of course, they'll lose their pensions too, but they won't care.
[00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:02.867]  It's just the power they enjoy.
[00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:06.729]  And they'll still be getting their basic paycheck.
[00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:09.451]  And they'll be more taken care of than the general public.
[00:28:11.292 --> 00:28:19.299]  And while you're busy worrying about this, they'll go ahead and fully announce the North American Union, claiming that by merging the nation's economies, that will save us.
[00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:34.313]  And then they'll bring us out of the Depression in five to ten years, and then give the credit to the North American Union, and then start the money Ponzi scheme all over again, and the general public will thank the central banks that did it for saving us.
[00:28:35.033 --> 00:28:36.995]  That's always the great part about this.
[00:28:36.995 --> 00:28:45.741]  They bankrupt economies, destroy third-world nations, start wars, finance terrorists, and then we get to see them up on TV posing as our saviors.
[00:28:45.741 --> 00:29:01.953]  And I was walking the dog late last night, and I was just walking down the street and back to the house, and I just, it was about, I don't know, it was about 1230 at night, and a lot of the houses still had their
[00:29:02.927 --> 00:29:03.627]  Television's on.
[00:29:03.627 --> 00:29:04.828]  I can see in their front windows.
[00:29:04.828 --> 00:29:07.850]  Most of my neighbors, just the glowing blue.
[00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:15.654]  Glowing blue, the television's set, and it's their friend, and it'll take good care of them, and tells them everything they need to know.
[00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:17.115]  Why listen to people like me?
[00:29:17.115 --> 00:29:18.716]  I mean, you know, we're just cooks, folks.
[00:29:18.716 --> 00:29:19.457]  We don't know anything.
[00:29:19.457 --> 00:29:20.837]  We just, you know, make it all up.
[00:29:20.837 --> 00:29:21.938]  The government loves you.
[00:29:21.938 --> 00:29:23.199]  The Federal Reserve's governmental.
[00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:24.359]  It's not private.
[00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:27.061]  Everything's fine.
[00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:28.742]  When we get back, we will go to your calls.
[00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:34.266]  I'm going to start the segment with Johnny Cash, and remember the Alamo.
[00:29:34.266 --> 00:29:38.968]  Donovan and many others did great renditions of it, but I think Cash's is the best.
[00:29:38.968 --> 00:29:55.975]  And while there's still time, I do want to tell you that David Gergen, I can't skip the show today to do this, because I'll be taking off part of the show tomorrow to go down to the rally, but David Gergen, the Karl Rove of at least four administrations, the Bilderberg CFR trilateral Bohemian Grove member, who I confronted in 2004, will be
[00:29:59.722 --> 00:30:03.865]  At the LBJ Library building.
[00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:07.968]  And he's going to be there giving a speech.
[00:30:07.968 --> 00:30:09.829]  It's open to the public.
[00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:14.192]  And that starts in 40 minutes.
[00:30:14.192 --> 00:30:19.516]  So I suggest anybody listening right now locally make their way down to that.
[00:30:19.516 --> 00:30:25.760]  It'll be at the Center for Ethical Leadership inside the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.161]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:28.662]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:36.862]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.862 --> 00:30:38.363]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[00:30:38.363 --> 00:30:40.504]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[00:30:40.504 --> 00:30:45.005]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:46.926]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:30:46.926 --> 00:30:49.227]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[00:30:49.227 --> 00:30:54.648]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar, that really works.
[00:30:54.648 --> 00:30:56.009]  Have you tried sucroblast?
[00:30:56.761 --> 00:31:02.423]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's Sucroblast.
[00:31:02.423 --> 00:31:07.324]  Sucroblast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.

[00:31:11.845 --> 00:31:14.626]  Call 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[00:31:14.626 --> 00:31:17.407]  That's 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[00:31:17.407 --> 00:31:21.588]  Or visit them on the web at MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:23.309]  That's MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[00:31:25.094 --> 00:31:26.518]  So Jane, what do you think?
[00:31:26.518 --> 00:31:30.729]  I'm going to call Sucroblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[00:31:30.729 --> 00:31:32.734]  Excellent Jane, you'll be glad you did.
[00:31:35.544 --> 00:31:36.805]  Shelley, you look exhausted!
[00:31:36.805 --> 00:31:37.365]  Oh, wait!
[00:31:37.365 --> 00:31:38.446]  Why did you turn that down?
[00:31:38.446 --> 00:31:41.508]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:46.131]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:31:46.131 --> 00:31:48.792]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:31:48.792 --> 00:31:49.993]  I could use something like that.
[00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:52.515]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:31:52.515 --> 00:31:55.437]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:31:55.437 --> 00:31:57.318]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:31:57.318 --> 00:31:59.919]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:00.920]  I guess you're right.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.761]  Why don't we try it?
[00:32:01.761 --> 00:32:03.702]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:32:04.102 --> 00:32:08.484]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:32:08.484 --> 00:32:10.545]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:32:10.545 --> 00:32:15.047]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:32:15.047 --> 00:32:18.529]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:24.551]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:26.092]  The BedFan is the answer.
[00:32:26.092 --> 00:32:29.674]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[00:32:29.674 --> 00:32:32.295]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[00:32:32.495 --> 00:32:35.658]  That's bedfan.com.
[00:32:35.658 --> 00:32:36.479]  Hey Emily!
[00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:37.720]  Wow, you look great!
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.761]  I feel great.
[00:32:38.761 --> 00:32:41.083]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:41.604]  Really?
[00:32:41.604 --> 00:32:42.165]  What is it?
[00:32:42.165 --> 00:32:42.745]  How does it work?
[00:32:42.745 --> 00:32:49.311]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:51.774]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:32:51.774 --> 00:32:56.899]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:32:57.199 --> 00:32:57.659]  That's it?
[00:32:57.659 --> 00:32:59.701]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:32:59.701 --> 00:33:00.602]  It is easy.
[00:33:00.602 --> 00:33:07.527]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:09.068]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:33:09.068 --> 00:33:10.169]  That's amazing!
[00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:15.773]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:33:15.773 --> 00:33:16.273]  Wow!
[00:33:16.273 --> 00:33:17.334]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:33:17.774 --> 00:33:20.875]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:24.836]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.357]  For only $26.90, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[00:33:28.357 --> 00:33:28.737]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:33:28.737 --> 00:33:28.937]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:33:28.937 --> 00:33:31.198]  And a hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die.
[00:33:43.507 --> 00:33:50.969]  By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh.
[00:33:50.969 --> 00:33:58.731]  Any man that would fight to the death cross over, but him that would live better fly.
[00:33:58.731 --> 00:34:03.372]  And over the line, what a hundred and seventy-nine.
[00:34:03.372 --> 00:34:10.394]  Hey, Santa Ana, we're killing your soldiers below.
[00:34:11.497 --> 00:34:20.460]  That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:31.564]  The boy lay dying but his powder was ready and dry.
[00:34:31.564 --> 00:34:35.865]  The lad on his back boy killed him a few in reply.
[00:34:38.747 --> 00:34:46.313]  And young David Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fierce in his eyes.
[00:34:46.313 --> 00:34:51.396]  For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die.
[00:34:51.396 --> 00:34:59.402]  Hey, Santa Ana, we're killing your soldiers below.
[00:34:59.402 --> 00:35:05.407]  Let men, wherever they go, will remember the Alamo.
[00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:19.304]  And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud.
[00:35:19.304 --> 00:35:26.708]  With the words of farewell from a garrison, valiant and proud.
[00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:34.532]  Grieve not, little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free.
[00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:38.515]  We'll never surrender, and ever with liberty be.
[00:35:42.356 --> 00:35:47.559]  Hey, Santa Ana, we're killing your soldiers below.
[00:35:47.559 --> 00:36:01.826]  That men, wherever they go, will remember the Alamo.
[00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:06.148]  Sometimes you win by losing.
[00:36:06.148 --> 00:36:08.770]  There's more than one way to skin a cat, they say.
[00:36:11.238 --> 00:36:22.647]  And sometimes the tree of liberty needs to be watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants and the mainstream media, the globalists that want to destroy this country's sovereignty.
[00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:30.654]  They've done everything they can to demonize the sacrifice made at the Alamo, but they failed miserably.
[00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:36.703]  And tomorrow, I want to see everybody out there for a real Texas Independence.
[00:36:36.703 --> 00:36:43.508]  I don't think there's been a Texas Independence rally where they're actually talking about resistance against a foreign invader, resistance against a tyranny.
[00:36:43.508 --> 00:36:48.752]  Never has Texas, since its founding, faced such a dire threat.
[00:36:48.752 --> 00:36:51.955]  Our entire infrastructure, water, power,
[00:36:53.428 --> 00:37:06.112]  Roads is being handed over to foreign interest, and that's because the global corporations hold dollars, which are now near worthless, and the politicians have been fully paid off, and they're being told, allow the infrastructure to be transferred.
[00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:11.574]  We're going into receivership, but we're fighting it, and we're having victories.
[00:37:11.574 --> 00:37:19.436]  And when the enemy has victories, frankly, it only wakes more people up and ensures our greater victory, just like the Battle of San Jacinto.
[00:37:21.744 --> 00:37:27.025]  Angoliad, and of course where it all kicked off, in Gonzales.
[00:37:27.025 --> 00:37:27.846]  Come and take it!
[00:37:27.846 --> 00:37:29.326]  Come and take our guns!
[00:37:29.326 --> 00:37:38.589]  That's what the corrupt Mexican officials were coming to do, and they failed miserably.
[00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:44.370]  And so now the New World Order wants to bring down not just Texas, but the entire country, but Texas is the front line.
[00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.451]  Join us in Austin, Texas on Friday, March 2nd, tomorrow.
[00:37:48.803 --> 00:37:51.024]  2007 at 1.30 p.m.
[00:37:51.024 --> 00:37:57.985]  March to the Capitol to protest the Trans-Texas Corridor and the National Animal Identification System.
[00:37:57.985 --> 00:38:03.206]  Speakers and musical performances by Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:38:03.206 --> 00:38:07.786]  Meet at the corner of Cesar Chavez and First Street at Red River in Austin, Texas.
[00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:09.507]  No later than 1.30 p.m.
[00:38:09.507 --> 00:38:10.987]  to march to the Capitol.
[00:38:10.987 --> 00:38:16.068]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, anyone who loves liberty and doesn't want the foreign Spanish
[00:38:17.452 --> 00:38:21.875]  German, Dutch, Australian companies getting our water, our coal plants.
[00:38:21.875 --> 00:38:25.038]  It's sick.
[00:38:25.038 --> 00:38:26.999]  We're totally being taken over.
[00:38:26.999 --> 00:38:28.080]  We're under attack.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.801]  They're going after the ranches, the farms.
[00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:32.483]  This animal ID will shut down most farms and ranches.
[00:38:32.483 --> 00:38:33.704]  That's official.
[00:38:33.704 --> 00:38:35.165]  We're not kidding when we say that.
[00:38:35.165 --> 00:38:37.647]  That's a conservative estimate.
[00:38:37.647 --> 00:38:38.728]  It will devastate them.
[00:38:40.783 --> 00:38:50.348]  If you weren't planning to take off work tomorrow, I'm asking you to take off work and I'm asking you to call five people right now and tell them to take off work and to be down there.
[00:38:50.348 --> 00:38:51.369]  And don't lie to your boss.
[00:38:51.369 --> 00:38:56.091]  Say it's Texas Independence, it's the toll roads, it's the Napta Highway, we need to go to the protest.
[00:38:56.091 --> 00:38:59.373]  Take Cargill and some of the big meat packers.
[00:39:00.226 --> 00:39:06.228]  Last year for that staged illegal alien rally with 30 million people on the streets, which it turned out Rob Allen and co.
[00:39:06.228 --> 00:39:09.109]  and the Bush administration with Fox had paid for.
[00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:11.049]  That was Dallas Morning News, by the way.
[00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:17.431]  Remember all the big factories and companies telling the illegals they could take off the day with pay?
[00:39:17.431 --> 00:39:24.493]  Well, to stand up for Texas, I bet your boss isn't going to give you pay.
[00:39:24.493 --> 00:39:28.094]  My crew's getting paid to go down there, but they'd be down there anyways.
[00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.911]  My crew here said, do we just take off and clock out?
[00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:39.133]  And I said, no, you just go down there, all of you.
[00:39:39.133 --> 00:39:43.395]  I think one of them's staying here, because there's some computer tutorial they've got to do on some new bookkeeping system.
[00:39:43.395 --> 00:39:45.155]  But we're all going to be down there.
[00:39:45.155 --> 00:39:48.197]  I want to see everybody there.
[00:39:48.197 --> 00:39:52.018]  And I want you to bring people down there.
[00:39:52.018 --> 00:39:58.221]  And I'd shoot for one o'clock the latest getting down there, because then we're going to march at two, and it's going to take a while to get that in order.
[00:39:58.221 --> 00:40:00.562]  Trucks and tractors and floats and
[00:40:01.668 --> 00:40:15.042]  My friend Matt pulled up in his truck yesterday at the office and he's got a big hanging gallows built in the back of the truck to hang an effigy of somebody on.
[00:40:15.042 --> 00:40:16.923]  Info Wars painted down the side.
[00:40:16.923 --> 00:40:20.907]  That's going to be something else.
[00:40:20.907 --> 00:40:22.689]  I want to see you there, folks.
[00:40:22.689 --> 00:40:24.071]  Alright, I said we'd go to your calls.
[00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:25.372]  We're going to do that right now.
[00:40:26.764 --> 00:40:39.293]  We'll get more into the huge controversy of WTC7 with the news, CNN, BBC, reporting it had collapsed before it did, and why that's so important, and how the ongoing cover-up has woken up more people than the story itself.
[00:40:39.293 --> 00:40:42.716]  We're working on getting Jesse Trinidad with New Oklahoma City Revelations in the third hour.
[00:40:42.716 --> 00:40:50.361]  We've got Ron Paul's district political director, Penny Langford, popping in for about 15 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:40:50.361 --> 00:40:52.283]  She'll be there at the rally tomorrow.
[00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.545]  Ed in L.A.
[00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:55.005]  You're on the air.
[00:40:56.164 --> 00:41:06.412]  Hey Alex, I've been a subscriber for about the last four years and I wanted to tell you that I was in the Czech Republic earlier this year.
[00:41:06.412 --> 00:41:11.836]  I just came back and you were like the biggest thing over there.
[00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:15.518]  Bigger than the rock groups, bigger than Elvis.
[00:41:15.518 --> 00:41:20.122]  Right now, whenever I walk down the streets of Prague, which I visit quite often,
[00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:34.929]  I see big InfoWars.com stickers or graffiti on the walls or bridges and it's unavoidable and basically you're just going to catch an Eiffel if you're walking around there.
[00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:35.810]  Well that's amazing.
[00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:49.237]  You know my wife has a good friend who her father when she was a little girl in the park controlled by the Soviets one day he was a well-known artist they just came to his house and said no more
[00:41:50.288 --> 00:41:53.669]  No more of your art displays or you'll be arrested.
[00:41:53.669 --> 00:41:55.670]  It's Western art.
[00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:03.193]  And so he told his wife and children, oh, we're going to go to a vacation in, I believe they said Serbia.
[00:42:03.193 --> 00:42:04.133]  But that wasn't it.
[00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:09.835]  They went there and they got into a refugee camp in Bosnia, were there for two years.
[00:42:09.835 --> 00:42:11.816]  And my son is friends with her daughter.
[00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:22.367]  And so people over in Czechoslovakia, in the two areas, and over there where they've lived through tyranny, they know it, they recognize it, they see it.
[00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:32.775]  And I know that all over Europe, in Eastern Europe and Asia, people really pay attention to what we're saying because they're informed and they're concerned.
[00:42:32.775 --> 00:42:35.858]  And I have heard from friends that have been over in Prague and places that there's
[00:42:36.478 --> 00:42:41.260]  InfoWars stickers and stuff everywhere, and that's why we're about to redo the site and make it even better.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.321]  We're just a small outfit, but we are reaching tens of millions, and I'm so blessed.
[00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:55.825]  I mean, every night when I go to sleep, I'm humbled, because it's quiet, and I'm tired, and I'm getting in bed, and you know, you have that quiet moment before you go to sleep, and it's almost like a chill of responsibility.
[00:42:55.825 --> 00:43:03.808]  I don't want to say it's fear, but it's more, it's not even a weight, it's more just like an atmosphere of, it's very solemn, very stoic,
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.301]  Well, you know, I saw that a lot of the upward bound youth over there, especially upper middle class,
[00:43:29.867 --> 00:43:35.910]  Talk about you by name, like practically every single day around the circles that I hang out with.
[00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.411]  And people just say, oh yeah, it's Alex Jones guy.
[00:43:38.411 --> 00:43:40.712]  He's a really smart guy.
[00:43:40.712 --> 00:43:43.694]  He's got it all figured out and all that kind of stuff.
[00:43:43.694 --> 00:43:44.774]  And let me tell you one thing.
[00:43:44.774 --> 00:43:57.561]  The day before I came back, I was seen in the news as a pretty well-known news reporter in the Czech Republic who was talking about you and the Building 17 right there on TV.
[00:43:58.137 --> 00:44:03.379]  But she was kind of like trying to debunk it and show that you're like some kind of a crazy person or something.
[00:44:03.379 --> 00:44:13.604]  But, you know, most young people over there, the way they see it is, you know, they don't trust anything from the official news apparatus and all that.
[00:44:13.604 --> 00:44:16.045]  Well, that's because they've been through it, and I appreciate your call.
[00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:17.225]  That's exciting.
[00:44:17.225 --> 00:44:20.827]  I don't want to say I've got it all figured out.
[00:44:20.827 --> 00:44:23.048]  The globalists write policy reports.
[00:44:23.048 --> 00:44:25.209]  I mean, they're telling us what they're going to do.
[00:44:26.929 --> 00:44:40.001]  We get the minutes of the SPP secret meeting, the North American Summit last year, in Canada, and the first thing they talk about is how to keep it secret, the North American Union, how to enslave us, how to tax us.
[00:44:40.001 --> 00:44:48.208]  I mean, look, all I'm doing is covering the facts.
[00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:48.688]  In Building 7,
[00:44:52.822 --> 00:44:53.923]  They love to poo-poo us.
[00:44:53.923 --> 00:44:54.983]  They love to make fun of us.
[00:44:54.983 --> 00:44:59.126]  And now we've got this BBC and CNN and another BBC.
[00:44:59.126 --> 00:45:02.928]  By the way, it did turn out that the BBC did have some archives up online.
[00:45:02.928 --> 00:45:04.229]  They did indeed pull those.
[00:45:04.229 --> 00:45:05.750]  They're admitting they pulled them.
[00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:11.833]  They're claiming that everything malfunctioned and they don't have any of the videotapes of 9-11.
[00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:19.678]  And their response is blown up and made the story a hundred, and I'm serious when I say that, more than a hundred times bigger.
[00:45:22.049 --> 00:45:32.253]  And now, Digg.com, it is not just the people that the quote, you know, Digg Brigades, these... How Digg works is, they have these select members.
[00:45:32.253 --> 00:45:35.954]  The longer you've been a member, the more, quote, power you have to deep six a story.
[00:45:35.954 --> 00:45:41.276]  You can have 2,000, 3,000, 5,000, doesn't matter, 10,000 votes for your story.
[00:45:41.276 --> 00:45:48.498]  Just five or six of these selected little enforcers that they knight go and vote against you and your story's gone.
[00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:55.046]  But then Dig lies and claims, again this is in the top 50 websites, Drudge is like 500 and something to give you an idea.
[00:45:55.046 --> 00:46:00.288]  I know I've talked a lot about this, but it's important.
[00:46:00.288 --> 00:46:09.232]  Dig claims we're a digital democracy and it's what you want to read, what you think is most important, you vote the news up to the main page.
[00:46:09.232 --> 00:46:12.733]  I didn't frankly know what Dig was six months ago.
[00:46:12.733 --> 00:46:16.495]  I'd seen links to it, I knew it was the basics.
[00:46:18.084 --> 00:46:25.087]  About three months ago, I saw headlines on other websites, Prison Planet banned from Digg.
[00:46:25.087 --> 00:46:37.714]  And I went and saw their press release and they said, yes, this website is a fake news site, Prison Planet, it's not real, and it's a spam site, and it's banned.
[00:46:37.714 --> 00:46:44.817]  Well then people emailed and contacted them and we put a story up in Digg that allowed our stories to be reposted, but
[00:46:45.464 --> 00:46:56.451]  What happens is they get a thousand votes, they go to the main page, and then normally something with a hundred votes goes to the main page, and then we're trying to get screenshots of it.
[00:46:56.451 --> 00:47:00.773]  It will go up for one minute and they take it down.
[00:47:00.773 --> 00:47:02.875]  So the BBC is calling Google.
[00:47:02.875 --> 00:47:08.318]  They took down the other clip of the other BBC channel live saying Building 7 had fallen 20 plus minutes before it did.
[00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:10.851]  They've taken down the CNN.
[00:47:10.851 --> 00:47:12.511]  We've been having to repost it.
[00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:15.752]  I mean, they're literally folks in real time jerking all this.
[00:47:15.752 --> 00:47:20.494]  They basically made Archive.org take down the archives of everything that happened.
[00:47:20.494 --> 00:47:22.355]  So first they say, we've lost the tapes.
[00:47:22.355 --> 00:47:24.956]  Then they go to Archive.org and say, take it down!
[00:47:24.956 --> 00:47:28.997]  I mean, how obvious does that get?
[00:47:28.997 --> 00:47:32.958]  We've lost the tapes!
[00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:36.820]  We've got a story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.280]  Headline,
[00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:50.805]  Media, blacklist, BBC fiasco, Google digs, censor 9-11 truth, and it's all being censored.
[00:47:50.805 --> 00:47:58.229]  And you go into that, we found on the BBC's own policy site that they record every news event on two different machines and computer.
[00:47:58.229 --> 00:48:02.251]  As I told you, I've talked to Archivist and another one I don't know has contacted us.
[00:48:02.251 --> 00:48:03.472]  I need to vet and get him on.
[00:48:07.944 --> 00:48:13.629]  But the point is that, I mean, do you believe BBC on their number one news channel didn't tape that day?
[00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:16.511]  And then it turned out they had it posted on their site, so they took it down.
[00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:19.934]  Then they go to archive and it gets taken down.
[00:48:19.934 --> 00:48:21.656]  And then they're taking it down everywhere else.
[00:48:21.656 --> 00:48:24.098]  Oh, they're not worried about this, are they?
[00:48:24.098 --> 00:48:25.559]  Oh, it's no big deal!
[00:48:29.568 --> 00:48:31.349]  Because they know this can bring them down.
[00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:33.030]  And listen, don't worry, guys.
[00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.071]  Show everybody that you're a bunch of globalists.
[00:48:35.071 --> 00:48:36.712]  Show them that you're a bunch of censors.
[00:48:36.712 --> 00:48:37.853]  Show them you're scared.
[00:48:37.853 --> 00:48:38.834]  Thank you.
[00:48:38.834 --> 00:48:41.255]  You made the story 100 times bigger.
[00:48:41.255 --> 00:48:43.336]  You're not very sophisticated.
[00:48:43.336 --> 00:48:51.181]  You're living in the world of 10, 20 years ago, where you had media superiority, where no one could challenge you, where no one could call you out.
[00:48:51.181 --> 00:48:52.482]  So just keep acting like that!
[00:48:54.634 --> 00:49:06.683]  Because we've got millions of people watching everything you do, researching you, tracking you, tracking everything you do, scanning the information, finding more every second.
[00:49:06.683 --> 00:49:13.108]  We know you're the terrorist, we know you're behind 9-11 government, we know you're corrupt, and we're not going to stop.
[00:49:13.108 --> 00:49:14.208]  Period.
[00:49:14.208 --> 00:49:17.571]  Period!
[00:49:17.571 --> 00:49:19.572]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in Philly.
[00:49:19.572 --> 00:49:20.173]  Thanks for holding.
[00:49:21.198 --> 00:49:22.318]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[00:49:22.318 --> 00:49:22.679]  Good, sir.
[00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:23.979]  Good, John.
[00:49:23.979 --> 00:49:25.019]  Okay, well, sorry.
[00:49:25.019 --> 00:49:26.120]  Oh, no problem.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.280]  Great work.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.962]  The reason why I'm calling today is to talk about the New World Order and One Religion.
[00:49:32.962 --> 00:49:37.564]  But before I do that, last time I spoke to you about a month ago, we talked about Bank of America.
[00:49:37.564 --> 00:49:39.484]  I worked for them for a while.
[00:49:39.484 --> 00:49:45.186]  And the program, you actually have a program where Mexicans can send money back to Mexico.
[00:49:45.186 --> 00:49:47.387]  The name of the program is actually SafeSend.
[00:49:47.387 --> 00:49:49.468]  You caught me by surprise when I forgot the name of it.
[00:49:50.443 --> 00:49:52.364]  It's actually on their website.
[00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:59.086]  And, you know, Mexican illegals can send money back to Mexico, but that's... But citizens can!
[00:49:59.086 --> 00:50:06.147]  Let's be clear, citizens have to show all this ID, but the illegals don't, and that is a corporate government policy.
[00:50:06.147 --> 00:50:08.628]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:50:08.628 --> 00:50:16.430]  But the reason why I'm calling today is you had mentioned that one of the objectives of the New World Order is to establish one religion.
[00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.491]  And I'm actually looking, I bookmarked a
[00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:31.299]  An article from February 19th from the Times London online about the Anglican Church looking to unite with the Roman Catholic Church under the leadership of the Pope.
[00:50:31.299 --> 00:50:32.060]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.121]  Pretty scary.
[00:50:33.121 --> 00:50:39.087]  And I'm an Episcopalian and our church has been going through a lot of turmoil over the last few years.
[00:50:39.087 --> 00:50:42.431]  There's an organization called the American Anglican Council.
[00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:50.004]  That is, again, some of the things that the mainline church is doing, like gay marriages and things like that.
[00:50:50.004 --> 00:51:00.258]  But I didn't realize that you saw that article, but it's shocking how the things that you mentioned about one religion, you know, I just saw that article and I immediately thought of you.
[00:51:02.742 --> 00:51:03.742]  I wasn't ignoring you.
[00:51:03.742 --> 00:51:07.023]  My producer comes in and starts talking to me while I'm live on air.
[00:51:07.023 --> 00:51:09.984]  I didn't hear the last ten seconds of what you said.
[00:51:09.984 --> 00:51:10.424]  Say it again.
[00:51:10.424 --> 00:51:14.085]  No, I'm just saying that I heard you mention One Religion.
[00:51:14.085 --> 00:51:21.287]  I don't know if it was on George Norrie's program or on your program about the New World Order establishing One Religion.
[00:51:21.287 --> 00:51:23.168]  When I saw that article, I immediately thought of you.
[00:51:25.507 --> 00:51:32.811]  Well, no, I mean, the Catholic Church has said all religions are the same and called for one world government and a new world order.
[00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:34.072]  So I'll comment on that on the other side.
[00:51:34.072 --> 00:51:38.855]  Thanks for the call.
[00:51:38.855 --> 00:51:42.357]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:42.357 --> 00:51:44.678]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:44.678 --> 00:51:52.323]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.027 --> 00:52:00.470]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:12.195]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:16.157]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:16.157 --> 00:52:18.418]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:18.418 --> 00:52:22.260]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:55:24.596 --> 00:55:28.098]  Welcome back.
[00:55:28.098 --> 00:55:29.239]  Glad you joined us today.
[00:55:29.239 --> 00:55:33.762]  Just finishing up John and Philly's question.
[00:55:33.762 --> 00:55:36.444]  Yeah, just type into Google, Pope calls for a new world order.
[00:55:36.444 --> 00:55:37.905]  You'll get Pope John Paul doing it.
[00:55:37.905 --> 00:55:39.346]  You'll get the Pope before him doing it.
[00:55:39.346 --> 00:55:39.747]  You'll get
[00:55:41.085 --> 00:55:55.509]  Ratzinger, or Benedict doing it, and they had like 130-something religions meet last year and said it was a one-world religion, and the UN's calling for a one-world religion, and it's scary stuff.
[00:55:55.509 --> 00:55:58.550]  It's all about centralization.
[00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:03.611]  And people can debate whether the Catholic Church was the New World Order or is the New World Order.
[00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:04.832]  A lot of Catholics are great people.
[00:56:04.832 --> 00:56:08.993]  I'm just saying, there's no doubt that the Catholic Church today is total New World Order.
[00:56:09.762 --> 00:56:11.664]  I mean, you cannot debate that.
[00:56:11.664 --> 00:56:15.047]  They're calling for a new world order.
[00:56:15.047 --> 00:56:17.028]  But so are the major Protestant groups.
[00:56:17.028 --> 00:56:18.369]  They're just bought and paid for.
[00:56:18.369 --> 00:56:21.612]  And it's just horrible.
[00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:25.335]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rita in Illinois.
[00:56:25.335 --> 00:56:26.756]  Thanks for holding, Rita.
[00:56:26.756 --> 00:56:28.298]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:56:28.298 --> 00:56:29.158]  How are you today?
[00:56:29.158 --> 00:56:30.019]  Pretty good.
[00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:30.940]  Good.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:31.961]  I hope so.
[00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:35.824]  And I wanted to call you the day after you had that Guy Smith on there.
[00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:41.575]  Yes, the propagandist over at the BBC, Winston Smith, should be his real name.
[00:56:41.575 --> 00:56:42.855]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:56:42.855 --> 00:56:57.001]  And you know what, I worked for a life insurance company, I took the training, and I read a book by Delgado, and I also, well, the big thing is, man, you had him a couple of times, and the thing is, silence.
[00:56:57.001 --> 00:57:04.584]  When somebody's hiding something from you, it's an old trick, but when somebody's hiding something from you, and he says, well, I hear you, but I don't believe you,
[00:57:05.014 --> 00:57:05.715]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.964]  The other thing was the book from Conversational Magic.
[00:57:30.964 --> 00:57:31.485]  No, I know.
[00:57:31.485 --> 00:57:39.532]  I've been interrogated by police and border people and they'll ask a question and then you say something back and then they just pause and look at you.
[00:57:39.532 --> 00:57:43.616]  Or they ask a question and then scream at you and tell you you're not supposed to talk.
[00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:46.239]  But, you know, I don't think about tactics.
[00:57:46.239 --> 00:57:47.720]  I just kind of go at it.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.443]  But I should think about tactics when I'm... You're on top now.
[00:57:51.385 --> 00:57:52.926]  You're on the top now.
[00:57:52.926 --> 00:57:56.168]  And the thing is, you guys should have laughed at him when Paul brought that up.
[00:57:56.168 --> 00:57:58.630]  No, a dropout doesn't do it on me.
[00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:02.793]  You guys should have all laughed because he was doing that.
[00:58:02.793 --> 00:58:05.475]  I know, but see, they all go off those tactics in those books.
[00:58:05.475 --> 00:58:07.256]  I just go at it from the gut.
[00:58:07.256 --> 00:58:09.918]  Well, yeah, but you still, you gotta hit them every way you can.
[00:58:09.918 --> 00:58:10.658]  No, I agree.
[00:58:10.658 --> 00:58:12.039]  I just don't think about tactics.
[00:58:12.039 --> 00:58:12.379]  I should.
[00:58:12.379 --> 00:58:14.040]  I have one more thing.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.102]  There is this, I thought it was a new song.
[00:58:16.102 --> 00:58:19.144]  Did you hear that David Ickey music video with you on it?
[00:58:20.943 --> 00:58:22.864]  No, I haven't heard it.
[00:58:22.864 --> 00:58:26.405]  Oh, it's called David Icky and it's called Problem, Reaction, Solution.
[00:58:26.405 --> 00:58:28.185]  It's a catchy little song.
[00:58:28.185 --> 00:58:33.747]  If I can try this, I got a little piece of it.
[00:58:33.747 --> 00:58:34.167]  You're in it.
[00:58:42.765 --> 00:58:44.787]  Listen, do me a favor.
[00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:45.147]  What?
[00:58:45.147 --> 00:58:47.830]  Just email it to me and we'll get it posted.
[00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:48.931]  How do you do that?
[00:58:48.931 --> 00:58:52.474]  Because you've got that form now.
[00:58:52.474 --> 00:58:53.895]  You can enter links.
[00:58:53.895 --> 00:58:56.317]  You can enter the link to where it's located.
[00:58:56.317 --> 00:58:57.158]  It's just on YouTube.
[00:58:57.158 --> 00:59:00.040]  It's David Icky Problem Reaction Solution.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.841]  Easy to remember.
[00:59:00.841 --> 00:59:02.623]  Okay, we'll try to find it.
[00:59:02.623 --> 00:59:03.643]  I appreciate it.
[00:59:03.643 --> 00:59:08.308]  Yeah, we had to put that form thing up there because the email was crashing.
[00:59:08.308 --> 00:59:08.848]  I'm not kidding.
[00:59:08.848 --> 00:59:09.769]  The other day we cleaned out email.
[00:59:10.447 --> 00:59:11.367]  There was like 150,000 in there.

[01:00:35.807 --> 01:00:36.407]  Big Brother.
[01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:38.872]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:38.872 --> 01:00:40.633]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:40.633 --> 01:00:42.214]  You want answers?
[01:00:42.214 --> 01:00:43.775]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:43.775 --> 01:00:47.957]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:47.957 --> 01:00:52.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.781]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:09.422]  Welcome.
[01:01:09.422 --> 01:01:11.183]  It is high noon.
[01:01:11.183 --> 01:01:15.787]  Coming to you from the great state of Texas, transmitting against tyranny worldwide.
[01:01:15.787 --> 01:01:18.889]  Continued open phones throughout the full three hours today.
[01:01:18.889 --> 01:01:20.931]  We'll have about 30 minutes.
[01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:25.894]  The lawyer has broken the huge government involvement news concerning Oklahoma City.
[01:01:25.894 --> 01:01:30.338]  We'll be joining us with new revelations coming up in the next hour.
[01:01:30.338 --> 01:01:32.920]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.721]  Let's talk to Tom in Florida.
[01:01:34.721 --> 01:01:35.542]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:38.322]  Oh, thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[01:01:38.322 --> 01:01:46.267]  You have my sincerest regards concerning what you're doing there, and I think you're an American hero.
[01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:55.032]  This might be out in left field, but I keep hearing this animal ID thing, and I keep hearing something about the mention of registration.
[01:01:55.032 --> 01:02:02.377]  And I'm sure you're familiar, and hopefully the listeners are familiar with, you know, the automobile registration, which occurs in every state.
[01:02:03.092 --> 01:02:05.594]  Which is effectively where you turn your vehicle over.
[01:02:05.594 --> 01:02:06.534]  You turn the legal over.
[01:02:06.534 --> 01:02:09.296]  And then you get a receipt of the deed.
[01:02:09.296 --> 01:02:12.057]  A receipt of the title.
[01:02:12.057 --> 01:02:17.140]  You turn legal title over to the state and you receive equitable title.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.341]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:02:19.341 --> 01:02:21.823]  And cops listening will laugh at this because they don't know.
[01:02:21.823 --> 01:02:25.545]  But any lawyer worth their salt or any constitutional scholar knows this.
[01:02:25.545 --> 01:02:29.407]  It's admiralty law, which the modern name is administrative law.
[01:02:30.632 --> 01:02:37.905]  It's a contract that then becomes a privilege because you become a war of the state with the license.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:53.911]  Supreme Court rulings, state rulings, you have a right to travel, but in 1918 was the first case they said automobiles were new and were not the general and agreed upon conveyance.
[01:02:53.911 --> 01:03:06.882]  So they couldn't tax horses and things like that, but they could tax cars because the argument was they were messing up the roads, these rich people have cars, let's make them pay a fee, and then that's how it began.
[01:03:08.266 --> 01:03:08.946]  Right.
[01:03:08.946 --> 01:03:15.829]  And basically, with the sedgestation of the animals, it could possibly be the exact same thing.
[01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:24.932]  Well, sir, if you don't announce within two days that a cow died, or if you don't announce that a chicken died, you have to report all this.
[01:03:24.932 --> 01:03:26.632]  This is like April 15th, 365 days a year.
[01:03:29.725 --> 01:03:37.812]  There's auditors that come out to your property, and if you don't announce that, it's a $1,000 a day fine for each infraction.
[01:03:37.812 --> 01:03:48.501]  But, so somebody with 200 chickens or somebody with 30 cows, that's the average, about 35 cows, people, by the way, that have that just use that to pay the property tax, they don't even make money off the cows, okay?
[01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:57.289]  In fact, most people that got 300 acres and 40, 50 cows, they end up going out of business because you can't even pay the bills for the property with that, and then they go work
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:01.966]  Jobs at the power plant or at the prison or as a postman or whatever.
[01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:07.212]  We're cowboying on three or four other ranches to try to keep your own family property.
[01:04:07.212 --> 01:04:08.532]  Believe me, folks, I've lived through it.
[01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:10.113]  I don't want to go off into it.
[01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:13.073]  So it's land, land rich, money poor.
[01:04:13.073 --> 01:04:17.854]  And so you've got to have a $10 tag per chicken, a chicken that's worth $4.
[01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.855]  Now, Big Agra wrote the law.
[01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.795]  They don't have to have tags on any of them.
[01:04:21.795 --> 01:04:23.876]  They have premises IDs.
[01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:26.316]  But I'm sorry, I'm interrupting you, but I just want folks to know.
[01:04:26.316 --> 01:04:26.976]  Go ahead.
[01:04:26.976 --> 01:04:29.277]  Well, it appears then that they own your cow.
[01:04:29.884 --> 01:04:31.125]  They have legalized that?
[01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.026]  No, it's the end.
[01:04:32.026 --> 01:04:33.467]  Look, it's the end of farming and ranching.
[01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:34.608]  You think it was gone already?
[01:04:34.608 --> 01:04:35.349]  No.
[01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:36.410]  It's over.
[01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:37.211]  And there's no law.
[01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:41.234]  They're just saying it's a law and the people are complying like cowardly pieces of trash.
[01:04:41.234 --> 01:04:43.997]  Can I mention, there is a fellow who you may be aware of.
[01:04:43.997 --> 01:04:45.278]  His name is Alfred Adas.
[01:04:46.201 --> 01:04:51.163]  He's been reading law for about 23 years and he would be an absolutely wonderful guest.
[01:04:51.163 --> 01:04:52.943]  I believe I had him on about four or five years ago.
[01:04:52.943 --> 01:04:54.684]  I need to get him on again.
[01:04:54.684 --> 01:04:55.724]  He's out of Dallas.
[01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:57.165]  Yeah, and he's wonderful.
[01:04:57.165 --> 01:05:11.029]  He has a wonderful way of explaining how we have all been transferred voluntarily out of public law into private law and how all our municipalities are literally just northern corporations all linked together in a form of like strategy.
[01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:13.370]  Now, that's all true.
[01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.391]  The problem is
[01:05:16.255 --> 01:05:18.800]  People think you can do filings and things to disprove this.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.087]  They just send men with machine guns to kill you.
[01:05:22.087 --> 01:05:24.071]  They don't even follow their own laws.
[01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:25.253]  30 years ago they did.
[01:05:25.253 --> 01:05:26.335]  Now it's just lawlessness.
[01:05:34.674 --> 01:05:35.355]  It's here.
[01:05:35.355 --> 01:05:40.499]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:40.499 --> 01:05:48.146]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:48.826 --> 01:05:56.288]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:56.288 --> 01:06:08.031]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:11.991]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:14.232]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:18.093]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:03.702 --> 01:07:07.443]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:07:32.242 --> 01:07:34.983]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[01:09:01.747 --> 01:09:10.396]  And we are honored to have her on with us, District Political Director for Congressman Ron Paul, right here in the great state of Texas.
[01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:12.378]  Down there by Rockport is their offices.
[01:09:12.378 --> 01:09:15.301]  Makes me want to go fishing just hearing the name Rockport.
[01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:21.027]  And she's going to be one of the keynote speakers tomorrow at the big Texas Independence Day rally.
[01:09:21.027 --> 01:09:22.829]  This isn't a rally, just a wave plastic
[01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:24.409]  Texas flags.
[01:09:24.409 --> 01:09:34.972]  This is a true rally for Texas to survive and not be swallowed into the North American Union, the Security and Prosperity Partnership, the Animal ID, and the whole shootin' match.
[01:09:34.972 --> 01:09:37.253]  And Penny, thank you for spending time with us today.
[01:09:37.253 --> 01:09:38.513]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:09:38.513 --> 01:09:40.214]  Alex, I'm glad to be here.
[01:09:40.214 --> 01:09:46.316]  You have a lot going on with Ron Paul getting ready for his big presidential run, don't you?
[01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:50.397]  We're pretty busy, and you know, an exploratory is when you
[01:09:51.127 --> 01:10:00.189]  Put your feelers out and see if you have a name, ID, and basically a chance to actually, you know, run for president.
[01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:06.390]  And we have been overwhelmed with, you know, contributions and names of people who want to help.
[01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:08.690]  And Lou Dobbs, two nights in a row?
[01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:10.250]  Right, right.
[01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:18.532]  You know, we don't get much coverage from ABC and CBS and things like that, but with the activity on the Internet, you know, the thinking people,
[01:10:22.727 --> 01:10:28.469]  They are being forced into recognizing Ron Paul, so it's really great.
[01:10:28.469 --> 01:10:30.830]  In fact, there's been a controversy.
[01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:41.974]  Four big websites were doing presidential polls, and Ron Paul was winning all of them by like 80%, 65%, and so they've been pulling him off all the polls.
[01:10:41.974 --> 01:10:42.334]  Right.
[01:10:42.334 --> 01:10:46.476]  You know, matter of fact, a reporter called us from C-SPAN, and they said,
[01:10:46.994 --> 01:10:48.756]  You know, how come he's so popular?
[01:10:48.756 --> 01:10:59.125]  And we basically just tell him, uh, because these are people who can read, you know, and also, uh, you know, he's the only one who voted against internet regulation.
[01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:01.367]  He is for freedom and people know that.
[01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:04.546]  And so, you know, they're like, oh, really?
[01:11:21.674 --> 01:11:29.740]  He is the type of person who would be out there in the arena by himself, you know, 10, 15 years ago when he was in Congress the first time in the 70s.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:35.605]  He has done so much and held back so much that I just cannot think of a better president.
[01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:38.387]  I mean, he would have fit in, you know, back in the 1780s.
[01:11:38.387 --> 01:11:40.869]  This guy is an absolute diamond.
[01:11:40.869 --> 01:11:42.170]  Well, and I'll tell you why.
[01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:45.672]  The difference is very simple.
[01:11:45.672 --> 01:11:50.656]  You have politicians who are haughty and proud and want to be somebody, and then you have
[01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:58.630]  A Ron Paul, who is a very humble man, who wants to be a voice of the people and just discuss issues.
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:03.093]  He doesn't want power, and he doesn't want pomp.
[01:12:03.093 --> 01:12:07.056]  You know, you can see by the things that he does that most people never know about.
[01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:20.125]  You know, he's never taken a junket, he always votes against his own pay raises, he has rejected his congressional pension, and he has never, you know, been swayed by a lobbyist, a corporate lobbyist.
[01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:21.666]  So you can see those things.
[01:12:21.666 --> 01:12:25.688]  But there's also a great, quiet, dignified power about Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:12:25.688 --> 01:12:32.011]  The haughty guys in the $6,000 suits, dressed up like a bunch of strumpets, are just jokes.
[01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:33.591]  The Texas Legislature is even worse.
[01:12:33.591 --> 01:12:37.453]  They look like a bunch of ninnying cheerleaders.
[01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:40.574]  I mean, Ron Paul just really has that quiet strength.
[01:12:40.574 --> 01:12:42.615]  And let's talk about the Congressman.
[01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:47.397]  Getting to know him personally all these years yourself, what type of person is the Congressman?
[01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:56.033]  Well, I was telling you about our offices a while ago, and this is an explanation of just his character.
[01:12:56.033 --> 01:13:10.696]  You know, if you go into an office of one of these other congressmen, you would see expensive pictures on the wall and expensive furniture because you're paying for it, you know.
[01:13:10.696 --> 01:13:12.317]  Congressman Paul has a very
[01:13:14.113 --> 01:13:19.816]  Small office, private office when he comes home, and it looks like a library because he's an academic.
[01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:21.817]  He's not a politician.
[01:13:21.817 --> 01:13:25.780]  A lot of people will say, you know, he just doesn't have the charisma.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.340]  He's not out for charisma.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:32.383]  He is out on a mission, and that's to keep the liberties of the people of this country.
[01:13:32.383 --> 01:13:39.787]  You know, looks is not... Matter of fact, this is another good thing, a great thing.
[01:13:39.787 --> 01:13:42.829]  Back in the 70s when he ran for Congress first,
[01:13:44.309 --> 01:13:54.232]  Some reporter took a picture of Newt Gingrich's Cadillac and Ron Paul's little green Ford Focus parked in the same parking lot.
[01:13:54.232 --> 01:14:04.374]  Because, you know, the American people are paying for the transportation, and he figured that he was going to be as tight as possible with the American people's dollars, right?
[01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:11.756]  Well, that made the front page on several major newspapers, and it was very embarrassing to a lot of the people up there in Washington.
[01:14:11.756 --> 01:14:13.557]  But that's his point, you know?
[01:14:13.976 --> 01:14:17.258]  This is supposed to be an office of service.
[01:14:17.258 --> 01:14:19.160]  A service to the people.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:28.566]  And when government gets out of control and starts feeling like, I can spend all your money that I want to, it becomes tyranny.
[01:14:28.566 --> 01:14:38.613]  Well, I've read the letters by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and others in government when they were paying for their own wine and beef for parties.
[01:14:38.613 --> 01:14:39.253]  Right.
[01:14:39.253 --> 01:14:42.155]  Because they knew that it was the people's money.
[01:14:43.007 --> 01:14:47.869]  Well, and tomorrow, you know, we're going to be drawing a line in the sand on government tyranny again.
[01:14:47.869 --> 01:14:49.729]  You know, that's what we do here.
[01:14:49.729 --> 01:15:05.294]  So, we're going to be talking about the animal ID and, you know, just some other things that are a complete tyrannical broach of the people's right to private property.
[01:15:05.294 --> 01:15:11.916]  Whether it's the trans-corridor or, you know, gun rights or tagging your animals.
[01:15:12.463 --> 01:15:35.048]  Of which, you know, I've got another great story about how in Katy, which my family has got a background in rice farming, Katy, Texas, the EPA comes in and says, you know what, we've got a new Animal Protection Endangered Species Act, and we're going to start shutting you all down if we find any of these endangered species.
[01:15:35.048 --> 01:15:41.349]  Well, people are very creative, and when we started reading the list of the endangered species,
[01:15:42.552 --> 01:15:47.314]  Many of those animals on that list became extinct species.
[01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:55.017]  So you see that government does not always work in the way that it's supposed to when you restrict people's freedom.
[01:15:55.017 --> 01:16:06.182]  Well, what, three years ago they caught them in Colorado bringing in animals that didn't even live in the area and then releasing them out of cages and claiming, oh look, we've got an endangered animal in this area.
[01:16:06.182 --> 01:16:07.422]  I mean, it's a total fraud.
[01:16:07.422 --> 01:16:09.603]  Yeah, it is.
[01:16:09.603 --> 01:16:10.804]  And it pits man against animal.
[01:16:12.054 --> 01:16:15.155]  And man is always the smarter, you know.
[01:16:15.155 --> 01:16:18.056]  And that's what happened on the Katy Prairie.
[01:16:18.056 --> 01:16:21.618]  You know, they came in and they said, oh, these beavers are endangered.
[01:16:21.618 --> 01:16:29.921]  Well, you know, we had created that beautiful place for those beavers to roam.
[01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:37.244]  Well, soon there were several beaver pelts on a lot of office floors in the farm economy in Katy.
[01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:40.605]  Because, you know, we were not going to let them take our property.
[01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:53.288]  And, you know, you cannot come into the agricultural world and say, I know how to run your business better.
[01:16:53.288 --> 01:16:56.030]  Because we've been doing it for years, and you know what else?
[01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:58.311]  The Texas Ag people are armed.
[01:16:58.311 --> 01:17:02.232]  So I think that we're going to give them a run for the money on this animal tagging thing.
[01:17:02.232 --> 01:17:07.695]  Well, I've been to some of these Trans-Texas Corridor meetings and Animal ID meetings, and it's prominent people getting up saying,
[01:17:08.487 --> 01:17:10.788]  Saying, I'm armed and I'm ready to start shooting.
[01:17:10.788 --> 01:17:19.931]  I mean, I don't think the government and these foreign corporations and the Spanish company grabbing all the roads and the payoffs realize, Penny, just how angry they've gotten people.
[01:17:19.931 --> 01:17:20.832]  I think they do.
[01:17:20.832 --> 01:17:23.693]  I think they do know how angry we are.
[01:17:23.693 --> 01:17:29.975]  I think they just underestimate the enforcement power we have.
[01:17:29.975 --> 01:17:31.676]  I think that that's the problem.
[01:17:31.676 --> 01:17:35.397]  Because, you know, they slide these things under the door.
[01:17:35.397 --> 01:17:36.518]  Like the trans-corridor.
[01:17:37.222 --> 01:17:38.363]  Nobody even knew about it.
[01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:40.744]  They told the legislature they couldn't even see the agreement.
[01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:45.146]  Now the legislature is, I mean, it's incredible.
[01:17:45.146 --> 01:17:50.749]  It is a farce, and so when the people find out about it, they think that it's already too late.
[01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:53.711]  You know, the contracts are signed, there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:17:53.711 --> 01:18:00.915]  Well, that might sound all good, but when you come taking people's property, they're going to be standing at the gate with a rifle.
[01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:02.794]  That's where the rubber meets the road.
[01:18:02.794 --> 01:18:04.955]  That is exactly where it meets the road.
[01:18:04.955 --> 01:18:09.997]  Penny, in the two minutes we've got left, what are some of the issues you're going to be giving your speech on tomorrow?
[01:18:09.997 --> 01:18:29.943]  Well, basically it's going to be about, and I had told Judith McGrary, who is from FARFA, who is one of the hosts of this rally, I told her that I would really like for people to hear about the corporate end of it and how they deal with
[01:18:30.478 --> 01:18:45.490]  The members of Congress, whether it would be in the Texas legislature or the federal legislature, and how these huge international corporate lobbyists just absolutely hammer the members of Congress.
[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:53.236]  And if they don't have the strong character needed to stand up to them, they cave in.
[01:18:53.236 --> 01:18:54.096]  Well, here's an example.
[01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:59.901]  The AP reported over $150 million spent last year trying to end net neutrality.
[01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:00.221]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:00.703 --> 01:19:01.243]  Yeah.
[01:19:01.243 --> 01:19:07.348]  There's, you know, billions of dollars spent up there in Washington, D.C.
[01:19:07.348 --> 01:19:08.629]  hammering the legislature.
[01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:19.136]  And, you know, if you look and you can see that there are many members who, after they retire, what do they become?
[01:19:19.136 --> 01:19:20.617]  CEOs.
[01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:21.818]  Board members.
[01:19:21.818 --> 01:19:22.098]  Yes.
[01:19:22.098 --> 01:19:22.919]  Well, here's an example.
[01:19:22.919 --> 01:19:23.840]  Take LCRA.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.240]  They've got
[01:19:25.322 --> 01:19:34.268]  A bunch of people in the legislatures, daughters, sons, cousins, working, and I know people that work at LCRA, that people just collect paychecks.
[01:19:34.268 --> 01:19:36.669]  There's all sorts of little ways they do this.
[01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:37.970]  Right, right.
[01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:43.514]  And they think that nobody sees it and the people won't know about it, and for the most part, they're right.
[01:19:43.514 --> 01:19:48.977]  They get away with it because, you know, it's not in the media, and people don't dig for that information.
[01:19:48.977 --> 01:19:52.239]  Penny, are you going to be part of the parade as well?
[01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:54.621]  No, I've actually got a couple of meetings before.
[01:19:55.525 --> 01:19:57.707]  Um, I'll be running through my district.
[01:19:57.707 --> 01:20:12.021]  Matter of fact, uh, you'll be interested to know that we have just, um, we'll be awarding a gun tomorrow in Wharton County, but, um, I will be there from about 2 to 4 30 and I'll be happy to be a part of it.
[01:20:12.021 --> 01:20:18.748]  And, and I hope that everybody will, you know, come out and really, you know, protect the right.
[01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:22.800]  And the property rights of these people who will be abused.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.642]  Absolutely.
[01:20:23.642 --> 01:20:25.165]  This is real Texas independence.
[01:20:25.165 --> 01:20:27.209]  Tell the Congressman I said hi, and God bless you.
[01:20:27.209 --> 01:20:28.372]  We'll see you tomorrow, Penny.
[01:20:28.372 --> 01:20:29.595]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:20:29.595 --> 01:20:29.955]  Take care.

[01:21:12.637 --> 01:21:14.337]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:43.634]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:21:43.634 --> 01:21:46.416]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:48.878]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:21:48.878 --> 01:21:54.403]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:21:54.403 --> 01:22:02.669]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[01:22:31.588 --> 01:22:34.609]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:34.609 --> 01:22:38.510]  Did you know that our founding fathers gave us a Republican form of government?
[01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:43.411]  Why is all you ever hear from our leaders is that we're a democracy?

[01:23:01.796 --> 01:23:04.917]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:23:04.917 --> 01:23:10.059]  Have you ever been told the truth about why Russian Communism seemingly has fallen?
[01:23:10.059 --> 01:23:13.880]  Why did our government let Mikhail Gorbachev come here?

[01:23:31.405 --> 01:23:36.672]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:23:36.672 --> 01:23:38.735]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:23:38.735 --> 01:23:41.979]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:45.423]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:23:45.423 --> 01:23:47.266]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:23:47.526 --> 01:23:51.508]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:23:51.508 --> 01:23:54.789]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:23:54.789 --> 01:23:59.290]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:03.532]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:08.615]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:24:08.615 --> 01:24:13.198]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:24:13.198 --> 01:24:19.382]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:24:19.382 --> 01:24:22.024]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:22.864]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:24:22.864 --> 01:24:23.224]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.205]  And ask for Packet B.
[01:24:34.155 --> 01:24:42.678]  Alright, I said open phones.
[01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:56.642]  Let's move quickly through them, then I'll get into the latest Iran developments, as well as the big BBC ongoing cover-up concerning the collapse of Building 7, which just gets bigger and bigger because of their ongoing attempt to spike it and covered it up.
[01:24:56.642 --> 01:24:58.463]  I want to thank them for doing that.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:24:59.841]  I'm in Canada.
[01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:04.609]  First off, I want to say you good old boys keep fighting the good fight.
[01:25:12.845 --> 01:25:16.488]  Next off, uh, you gotta understand, it's like a Monopoly board.
[01:25:16.488 --> 01:25:21.451]  You put too many players, too many superpowers at the Monopoly board, the game gets out of balance.
[01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:29.617]  Now, I didn't really... I saw 9-11, I was sittin' at home just like everybody else, all wrapped up in the shock and awe of it, and I didn't really figure it out.
[01:25:29.617 --> 01:25:35.741]  But, over the past year, I started watching these soldiers posting stuff on YouTube, posting stuff on Google.
[01:25:35.741 --> 01:25:38.503]  You can see how they've been brainwashed into kill, kill, kill.
[01:25:39.526 --> 01:25:49.730]  Um, Iran, it's the same kind of scenario where if you take it and you put it into a game board kind of atmosphere, if it's like a risk or access and allies game, it's all about Iran.
[01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:52.051]  It was never about catching all these other things.
[01:25:52.051 --> 01:25:53.932]  It was about trying to strike Iran.
[01:25:53.932 --> 01:25:54.972]  And the Pentagon said that.
[01:25:54.972 --> 01:26:07.317]  It's get into Iraq, use it as a military launch base to go into Iran, get the fringe benefit of tens of billions every month in no-bid contract profits, and cut off the oil flow, which then jacks up oil prices for record profits.
[01:26:07.857 --> 01:26:10.279]  Well, you know, funny, like, look out throughout centuries.
[01:26:10.279 --> 01:26:13.862]  Mankind's rulers have always tried to rule with an iron fist.
[01:26:13.862 --> 01:26:21.129]  It's funny how the word tyrant came from Greece, where the tyrant... And now you tell the general public there's tyrants.
[01:26:21.129 --> 01:26:22.630]  They go, there's no such thing.
[01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:23.571]  It's never existed.
[01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:24.632]  Government is only good.
[01:26:25.319 --> 01:26:26.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.563]  Now, USA and Canada, you know, how free are we really?
[01:26:29.563 --> 01:26:32.965]  You know, once the banks and the money, and it's not your money.
[01:26:32.965 --> 01:26:34.687]  You know, paper, that's all it is.
[01:26:34.687 --> 01:26:39.871]  That's right, they've got control of the real assets, now they're trying to get physical control over us, and that's the real fight.
[01:26:40.592 --> 01:26:42.573]  Well, it's all about the brainwashing, Alex.
[01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:46.236]  And there's good brainwashing, because you're getting the real word out there.
[01:26:46.236 --> 01:26:53.361]  And then people start to... the sheeple, I should say... Well, brainwashing lies to you, teaches you not to think, tells you to go to sleep.
[01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:54.862]  So I wouldn't call what we do brainwashing.
[01:26:54.862 --> 01:27:00.145]  We're trying to ignite bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:27:00.145 --> 01:27:04.348]  We're trying to ignite people to simply become conscious and look around them for themselves.
[01:27:05.015 --> 01:27:06.876]  Yeah, well, that happened to me.
[01:27:06.876 --> 01:27:11.318]  I heard one of your programs, and then I thought, you know, well, he's really, he's got the voice.
[01:27:11.318 --> 01:27:12.599]  He's really passionate about this.
[01:27:12.599 --> 01:27:18.222]  Then I watched the Loose Change, and I was like, oh my God, I didn't even know about Building 7.
[01:27:18.222 --> 01:27:32.450]  Now, it's kind of funny that, you know, I watched your little Building 7 clip there, and it just really goes to show, like, I've been showing that to my friends, the ones that said to me, oh, Ron, why do you want to put so many knots in your stomach worrying about what the world government today is doing, you know?
[01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:43.279]  The fact that the teleprompter is what's ruling the news media, the fact that we got Anna Nicole Smith hogging up more time than other things on CNN, and all these other things.
[01:27:43.279 --> 01:27:44.700]  Look at global warming, okay?
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:51.466]  When you gotta think about it, it's all a money grab, because the fact is, I remember watching programs five years ago, maybe seven years ago,
[01:27:51.946 --> 01:27:54.148]  The Earth is changing its rotation.
[01:27:54.148 --> 01:27:56.350]  It's getting a little bit closer to the Sun.
[01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:57.751]  Same way the dinosaurs died.
[01:27:57.751 --> 01:28:03.556]  The Earth, I would assume, I might not be right, but I would assume that the Earth probably got a little bit further away from the Sun.
[01:28:03.556 --> 01:28:05.057]  Therefore, the Ice Age.
[01:28:05.057 --> 01:28:09.020]  You know, it's... There's so much money going... Sure, sure.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.722]  Let me let you go, because we've got to move on here.
[01:28:10.722 --> 01:28:14.285]  But really, the Earth is at the same distance from the Sun.
[01:28:16.022 --> 01:28:18.945]  You may be talking about its axis, its tilt towards the sun.
[01:28:18.945 --> 01:28:21.728]  That does change over time.
[01:28:21.728 --> 01:28:25.632]  They believe over millennia, but there hasn't been a proper gauge of that.
[01:28:25.632 --> 01:28:32.840]  But for the last several hundred years, they have been getting accurate readings on radiance of the sun, and it's at record radiance.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.785]  And if it keeps growing in this current cycle, it will double any previous recording for brightness.
[01:28:37.785 --> 01:28:38.406]  And if that happens,
[01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:44.895]  Things aren't going to be going too well, and a global tax isn't going to help us.
[01:28:44.895 --> 01:28:46.896]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[01:28:46.896 --> 01:28:48.456]  You're on the air, John.
[01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:48.957]  Hello, Alex.
[01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:49.577]  How are you doing?
[01:28:49.577 --> 01:28:50.357]  Good, sir.
[01:28:50.357 --> 01:28:52.398]  Hey, a couple things.
[01:28:52.398 --> 01:28:57.640]  One thing that's very important, I heard you bring up that Dig was censoring 9-11 Truth.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.260]  Yes, they admit they are.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.701]  Netscape is much worse.
[01:29:01.826 --> 01:29:03.207]  I've caught them at it.
[01:29:03.207 --> 01:29:07.529]  I even got an email from one of the people that work at Netscape where they even admitted it.
[01:29:07.529 --> 01:29:10.271]  I mailed some of this information to you.
[01:29:10.271 --> 01:29:10.931]  Send it again.
[01:29:10.931 --> 01:29:13.292]  Send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:13.292 --> 01:29:13.952]  Okay.
[01:29:13.952 --> 01:29:21.256]  Because even like when Terrence Dunstorm went to the first front page of Netscape, they've actually deleted all the comments on that.
[01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:22.857]  There are like 400 and something comments.
[01:29:23.883 --> 01:29:25.765]  And it's really getting ugly.
[01:29:25.765 --> 01:29:29.207]  Oh yeah, Google knocks us off, Netscape.
[01:29:29.207 --> 01:29:30.108]  I saw that when it happened.
[01:29:30.108 --> 01:29:32.810]  We actually linked to it.
[01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:34.431]  We linked to it when it went to the front page.
[01:29:34.431 --> 01:29:35.592]  Yeah, I mean, this is what they do.
[01:29:35.592 --> 01:29:41.537]  And Digs the same way, but then they lie and say they're this democracy and anything goes.
[01:29:41.537 --> 01:29:42.578]  Total bull.
[01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:50.064]  You know what's funny is when I was talking to this person that worked for Netscape and I called him out on the censorship, he's like, well,
[01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:55.133]  You have to understand, censorship only applies to democracy, and Netscape isn't a democracy.
[01:29:55.133 --> 01:29:59.136]  Of course, that's a lot of doublespeak, because they pretend to be into democracy and everything.
[01:29:59.136 --> 01:30:06.462]  Um, another thing that was... Stay there, I want to hear the rest of this when we get back, and I'll go ahead and cover the censored story.
[01:30:06.462 --> 01:30:09.424]  It's big, and it's because we're beating their hind-ends.
[01:30:09.424 --> 01:30:16.870]  We're winning, and I tell them, just keep censoring losers, just keep... people are learning about it, they're finding out what you're trying to keep them from getting, so just, thank you.
[01:30:21.869 --> 01:30:25.790]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:33.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.471 --> 01:30:39.333]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:44.454]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:30:44.454 --> 01:30:47.574]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:30:47.574 --> 01:30:50.915]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:56.534]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:30:56.534 --> 01:31:00.317]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:00.317 --> 01:31:03.139]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:05.739]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:05.739 --> 01:31:08.181]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:08.181 --> 01:31:08.561]  U.S.
[01:31:08.561 --> 01:31:10.323]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:31:10.323 --> 01:31:10.623]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:10.623 --> 01:31:11.524]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:11.524 --> 01:31:12.185]  Ask for George.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:36.246]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:31:36.246 --> 01:31:40.071]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:31:40.071 --> 01:31:44.457]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:45.618]  I was so amazed.
[01:31:45.618 --> 01:31:46.820]  I put it in the baby's room and
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.641]  And it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:31:48.641 --> 01:31:50.922]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:56.585]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:31:56.585 --> 01:32:02.768]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:04.508]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:32:04.508 --> 01:32:08.110]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:12.272]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:32:12.272 --> 01:32:13.733]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:32:14.073 --> 01:32:19.281]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[01:32:19.281 --> 01:32:23.067]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com or call 312-224-2710.
[01:32:23.067 --> 01:32:23.107]  312-224-2710.
[01:32:31.744 --> 01:32:35.588]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:32:35.588 --> 01:32:36.749]  Look no further!
[01:32:36.749 --> 01:32:39.752]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:32:39.752 --> 01:32:48.420]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:49.701]  You can order everything you need on
[01:32:49.701 --> 01:32:50.521]  We're good to go.
[01:33:18.966 --> 01:33:19.446]  We're good to go.
[01:33:53.431 --> 01:33:58.616]  We do live in extremely interesting times.
[01:33:58.616 --> 01:34:02.379]  You know, Len was extremely evil.
[01:34:02.379 --> 01:34:07.883]  I want to make that clear when I quote him, but he was right about several things.
[01:34:07.883 --> 01:34:17.071]  And basically, to paraphrase him, he said, there are times in human history where more happens in weeks than happens in a hundred years.
[01:34:17.071 --> 01:34:19.293]  And we are living in that time right now.
[01:34:19.293 --> 01:34:21.995]  Technology is doubling faster than every two years.
[01:34:24.565 --> 01:34:32.888]  Tyranny is expanding, liberty is expanding, they're on a collision course.
[01:34:32.888 --> 01:34:48.592]  And here we are, we've proven that our government is completely criminal at the top, Democratic and Republican, owned by foreign military industrial complex banking cartels, that stage 9-11 and have staged other events and are preparing to launch World War III.
[01:34:48.592 --> 01:34:50.113]  And we're here trying to fight it.
[01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:55.110]  And the government has pre-packaged propaganda for the liberals, and their little false reality.
[01:34:55.110 --> 01:35:01.396]  They've got a pre-packaged false reality for the neocon followers, and we're just here covering the facts.
[01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:03.298]  I'm gonna go back to your calls.
[01:35:03.298 --> 01:35:10.545]  In fact, let's just do that right now, and then I'll... Well, after I talk to this one caller, I'll get into the censored story, and then into more calls.
[01:35:10.545 --> 01:35:12.547]  Let's go back to John.
[01:35:14.847 --> 01:35:16.688]  John, finish up your other point.
[01:35:16.688 --> 01:35:23.149]  Yeah, on the one thing that you guys can do to help us, I know you have the Dig API for syndicated voting.
[01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:25.370]  Netscape also has that same product.
[01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:29.471]  I'll email this to Aaron also, and that'll help us to beat them there.
[01:35:29.471 --> 01:35:37.653]  The other thing was PBS, about a couple of weeks, maybe a month ago now, came out with this big propaganda story pushing chips to be put in people's brains.
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:47.082]  If you go to Google Video and do a search on World Wide Mind PBS... No, I know, it's going to end depression and if we just all have our chips it'll be okay.
[01:35:47.082 --> 01:35:53.784]  But yeah, and it's so interesting that they had, like, I heard you mentioning Alex Huxley, the guy that did Brave New World.
[01:35:53.784 --> 01:35:54.844]  Almost Huxley, yeah.
[01:35:54.844 --> 01:36:04.507]  Right, they brought up a hologram of him and he was like the old codger that just against technology and they bring up this trendy
[01:36:04.986 --> 01:36:13.493]  Young woman that's just talking about, oh, you're just afraid of people knowing your opinions, and this is so wonderful because we know everything, because we're all wired in this worldwide line.
[01:36:13.493 --> 01:36:15.675]  Let me comment on that, and I appreciate all your great points.
[01:36:15.675 --> 01:36:16.656]  Send us that video clip.
[01:36:16.656 --> 01:36:21.420]  I haven't seen that particular one, but I've seen CNBC pieces and others that are basically identical.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.141]  We know the MO.
[01:36:22.141 --> 01:36:24.323]  They go off a script.
[01:36:24.323 --> 01:36:26.765]  But I knew what their plan would be to promote this.
[01:36:26.765 --> 01:36:28.286]  I get emails going, how did you know?
[01:36:28.286 --> 01:36:30.268]  Are you an insider?
[01:36:30.268 --> 01:36:31.509]  How did you know this would happen?
[01:36:34.145 --> 01:36:50.914]  In January of 2000, the Pentagon released, that is, the Federation of American Scientists released, the Pentagon confirmed, but said that it was classified and it shouldn't have been released, the plan to implant every person on Earth with a chip in their brain.
[01:36:50.914 --> 01:36:58.918]  And I'd go on there and I'd say, you know, this is seven, eight years ago, I'd say, folks, this is hard to believe, but it's really, this is their plan.
[01:36:58.918 --> 01:37:02.920]  In fact, it's in my book, Descent into Tyranny, and they said
[01:37:03.994 --> 01:37:06.054]  We will use trendiness.
[01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:12.236]  We will use the youth to push this and sell it as the new stylish thing to do.
[01:37:12.236 --> 01:37:18.457]  We'll also make people take it for security reasons, for certain jobs, and we'll make prisoners take it.
[01:37:18.457 --> 01:37:26.379]  And by 2025, it will be the military's job to make sure everyone has been implanted with their brain chips.
[01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:32.896]  Now, folks, they're not playing games, okay?
[01:37:32.896 --> 01:37:35.138]  And no one had heard them promote chips at that time.
[01:37:35.138 --> 01:37:36.079]  They're like, are you crazy?
[01:37:36.079 --> 01:37:38.161]  I'm like, hey, it's just the Army's own documents.
[01:37:38.161 --> 01:37:42.005]  And then now, it's all over TV, all over radio.
[01:37:42.005 --> 01:37:43.086]  And what then?
[01:37:43.086 --> 01:37:46.330]  In 2003, Time magazine for kids, two different issues I've seen.
[01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:53.380]  There was one that said, your parents are scared and backwards and afraid of the future, but you're not.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:59.707]  You know how great a chip under the skin will be, how you'll be able to interface with your friends and have safety.
[01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:08.796]  I mean, you send your children to school, or Time Magazine has Time for Kids, and it talks bad about you.
[01:38:11.053 --> 01:38:12.154]  And so that's how it is.
[01:38:12.154 --> 01:38:14.355]  You're the body mod group, man.
[01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:17.757]  You're into the trans, post-human.
[01:38:17.757 --> 01:38:19.659]  You're down with it.
[01:38:19.659 --> 01:38:25.042]  And the cartoons and the movies and, you know, you're just so rad.
[01:38:25.042 --> 01:38:27.704]  Oh my gosh.
[01:38:27.704 --> 01:38:33.447]  That's the whole attitude and, you know, those backwards people just don't get how cool it is.
[01:38:33.447 --> 01:38:35.209]  It's Pentagon propaganda.
[01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.210]  Do you like being propagandized?
[01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:39.872]  Do you like... The government found out in the 60s.
[01:38:41.517 --> 01:38:53.039]  That they could fund the drug culture and they could fund the counterculture and say it was counterculture and then you would go do it.
[01:38:53.039 --> 01:38:58.420]  Now I'm not knocking people that got tattoos and dreadlocks and whatever floats your boat.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.940]  And if that's how you show you're different, fine.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:05.661]  But if you're not different on the inside, then you're not really different.
[01:39:05.661 --> 01:39:09.422]  But see, they tell you, go put horns on your head, have them implanted, go
[01:39:11.033 --> 01:39:16.675]  You know, have 14 nose rings and you're different.
[01:39:16.675 --> 01:39:18.515]  And then Alex, why don't you get hip, man?
[01:39:18.515 --> 01:39:26.258]  Why don't you grow your hair out long and wear trendy clothes and, you know, t-shirts and blue jeans?
[01:39:26.258 --> 01:39:28.678]  Number one, I comb my hair straight back in the morning.
[01:39:28.678 --> 01:39:34.880]  It takes about 15 seconds when I get out of the shower and I brush my teeth and floss and that's about it.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:40.062]  You know, it's kind of like I'm a fireman and the fire alarm goes off and I squeeze my sleep in and I
[01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:43.683]  Get to work.
[01:39:43.683 --> 01:39:44.723]  Number one, that's why.
[01:39:44.723 --> 01:39:48.166]  But people do pay attention so much to that.
[01:39:48.166 --> 01:39:50.087]  Maybe I should dress trendy or something.
[01:39:50.087 --> 01:39:53.409]  It's just not in me.
[01:39:53.409 --> 01:39:57.252]  Being authentic, getting real, is what's cool.
[01:39:57.252 --> 01:39:59.453]  And when you don't want to be cool, is when you are cool.
[01:39:59.453 --> 01:40:03.196]  When you don't care about being cool, is when you are cool.
[01:40:03.196 --> 01:40:04.216]  Okay?
[01:40:04.216 --> 01:40:04.957]  It's that simple.
[01:40:05.555 --> 01:40:12.620]  And so let's get past the images of being cool, and what the media tells us is cool, and let's try to survive here.
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.381]  Okay?
[01:40:14.381 --> 01:40:16.863]  Because people think I'm so cool.
[01:40:16.863 --> 01:40:19.124]  I'm not trying to be cool.
[01:40:19.124 --> 01:40:21.246]  I'm trying to survive here.
[01:40:21.246 --> 01:40:27.010]  Sometimes I get chills at night, and really get concerned, and physically feel the danger.
[01:40:27.010 --> 01:40:29.952]  I mean, I'm in a race against time.
[01:40:29.952 --> 01:40:34.015]  And I, um... That's what it comes down to.
[01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:40.132]  In the final equation.
[01:40:40.132 --> 01:40:42.973]  And I'm not just knocking the trendies.
[01:40:42.973 --> 01:40:44.514]  You know, the young trendies.
[01:40:44.514 --> 01:40:49.797]  The worst people are, and I'm not saying... This is all delicate here.
[01:40:49.797 --> 01:40:53.519]  I'm not saying having a Cadillac is bad.
[01:40:53.519 --> 01:40:54.639]  I like how some of them look.
[01:40:54.639 --> 01:40:55.780]  Nice cars.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:57.841]  I'm not saying having good transportation is bad.
[01:40:57.841 --> 01:40:59.502]  I'm not saying liking your car is bad.
[01:40:59.502 --> 01:41:05.765]  I'm not saying having a golf membership is bad because golf's fun and they're beautiful courses and it's a great outdoor sport.
[01:41:06.767 --> 01:41:10.208]  I'm not saying having a country club membership is bad.
[01:41:10.208 --> 01:41:27.892]  But if that's your God, all you do is feel powerful because of it, and you feel like you're part of the elite, and you get out there with your buddies, and you're not worried about the country, and you just make jokes about them ARABs, and you can't wait till we hit Iran, and it's what's gotta be done.
[01:41:27.892 --> 01:41:34.114]  I mean, again, you're part of your own little... I'll tell you the group that's the worst, and I'm not saying people on motorcycles are bad.
[01:41:34.114 --> 01:41:35.574]  Most of my friends have got motorcycles.
[01:41:36.562 --> 01:41:46.329]  But it's the yuppie lawyer, 50 years old, it's always the same type person.
[01:41:46.329 --> 01:42:00.940]  And I'll be walking down Congress with my wife and children, or I'll be out at the lake about to go fishing, you know, and I get a chance maybe once a year, and I'll be in the parking lot at the boat docks where I'm going to fish with some friends, and it's always a big $80,000 Harley tricked out,
[01:42:02.893 --> 01:42:06.054]  And a big guy on it who's got some yacht.
[01:42:06.054 --> 01:42:09.075]  I've seen him park and go get in their yachts.
[01:42:09.075 --> 01:42:14.676]  And they'll drive by and go, hey Mr. Black Helicopter, why don't you leave the country, huh?
[01:42:14.676 --> 01:42:17.597]  And my family will go, hey come on back.
[01:42:17.597 --> 01:42:20.898]  Come on, let's have a discussion about this, huh?
[01:42:20.898 --> 01:42:21.958]  You don't want me to.
[01:42:24.182 --> 01:42:38.931]  Now, that fool, because he's got five million dollars in assets, and a million dollar house, and a four hundred thousand dollar boat, and an eighty thousand dollar Harley, and a mistress, and a wife, and five kids, thinks he's the elite.
[01:42:38.931 --> 01:42:45.795]  Hey, buddy, the elite is worth over one family's worth over three hundred trill.
[01:42:45.795 --> 01:42:46.896]  Okay?
[01:42:46.896 --> 01:42:48.517]  You're nothing.
[01:42:48.517 --> 01:42:50.238]  Your money's been devalued by half.
[01:42:50.945 --> 01:42:56.370]  The stock market's been devalued by half, but because of the money inflation, you don't even know that.
[01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:59.412]  You're a joke.
[01:42:59.412 --> 01:43:00.293]  You're a joke.
[01:43:00.293 --> 01:43:02.155]  You're a joke to this country.
[01:43:02.155 --> 01:43:12.303]  And you've got your little biker outfit, and you've got your yacht, and it's all real funny, and your life's good, and so you don't want to worry about Texas.
[01:43:12.303 --> 01:43:15.386]  You probably are part of some contract for some toll road.
[01:43:17.719 --> 01:43:22.202]  You know, a lot of these people are on the payroll of this whole thing, and it's just, it's cute.
[01:43:22.202 --> 01:43:24.644]  It's cute, isn't it?
[01:43:24.644 --> 01:43:29.587]  And it's these same phony conservatives that will go, so what if we're turning into Mexico and they're getting rid of the borders?
[01:43:29.587 --> 01:43:31.149]  Eh, just change.
[01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:34.631]  And I've had high-powered lobbyists walk up to me.
[01:43:34.631 --> 01:43:43.257]  One time I had one of the biggest politicians in Texas walk up to me, and he said, this will be off-record, won't it?
[01:43:43.257 --> 01:43:45.699]  So I said it was off-record, so I'll never tell you his name.
[01:43:47.017 --> 01:43:48.918]  He even gave me his card and he said, what are you?
[01:43:48.918 --> 01:43:51.841]  Of course you're right about it all, Alex.
[01:43:51.841 --> 01:43:58.105]  He just projected confidence and friendliness and sparkly eyes, old man.
[01:43:58.105 --> 01:43:59.206]  Alex, why?
[01:43:59.206 --> 01:44:00.667]  You're not going to help these people.
[01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:02.188]  You know how dumb they are.
[01:44:02.188 --> 01:44:03.169]  You're trying to help them.
[01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:06.751]  They don't want your help.
[01:44:06.751 --> 01:44:14.157]  The best you can do is join the system and then try to mediate in it and work with both sides and help yourself out.
[01:44:14.157 --> 01:44:15.838]  Why don't you give me a call sometime?
[01:44:17.788 --> 01:44:21.777]  And I've gotten calls from similar people back when I first started, folks.
[01:44:21.777 --> 01:44:25.705]  They're looking for anybody that sticks their head up, just like the Rockefellers tried to recruit Aaron Russo.
[01:44:27.006 --> 01:44:29.888]  And that's when you know how real this stuff is.
[01:44:29.888 --> 01:44:33.529]  When they're sticking cards in your hands and saying, yeah, it's real.
[01:44:33.529 --> 01:44:35.410]  And you know, they know how to hit you, too.
[01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:37.812]  They know that this is a thankless job.
[01:44:37.812 --> 01:44:40.813]  They know that the public generally is dumbed down.
[01:44:40.813 --> 01:44:45.296]  And they know how, with that elitist attitude, to go, well, you're sardonic, too, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:45.296 --> 01:44:47.377]  You know, hey, you know more than they do.
[01:44:47.377 --> 01:44:49.818]  Why don't you just use that against them?
[01:44:49.818 --> 01:44:51.719]  They don't want your help, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:52.933 --> 01:44:54.374]  See, that's the devil's lie.
[01:44:54.374 --> 01:44:56.736]  Oh, you're not going to help the world the way it's always been.
[01:44:56.736 --> 01:44:58.617]  Just protect yourself and your family.
[01:44:58.617 --> 01:45:01.418]  That's what Nick Rockefeller told Aaron Russo.
[01:45:01.418 --> 01:45:02.779]  You know you can't help them, Aaron.
[01:45:02.779 --> 01:45:03.780]  They don't want help.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:04.901]  Just protect your family.
[01:45:04.901 --> 01:45:05.701]  Join us.
[01:45:05.701 --> 01:45:10.664]  We'll take care of you.
[01:45:10.664 --> 01:45:12.766]  And that's when you know how real it is.
[01:45:12.766 --> 01:45:19.490]  When you're sitting there and people have got a contract with over a million dollars they're offering you to go basically join the New World Order and be a neocon.
[01:45:20.879 --> 01:45:28.645]  And, man, you go to the average person, the average talk show host, and you go to them and you offer them that much money, all they're thinking about is a big house and cars and status.
[01:45:28.645 --> 01:45:30.607]  Who cares about all that?
[01:45:30.607 --> 01:45:45.439]  Now, if you can make money honestly and doing the right thing, sure, live in a comfortable house, drive a decent car so it doesn't break down, but I'm not there polishing my car and strutting around and trying to, you know, like a peacock and
[01:45:47.814 --> 01:45:49.195]  That stuff is low-level.
[01:45:49.195 --> 01:45:51.336]  That's not what life's really all about.
[01:45:51.336 --> 01:45:58.061]  Life is about honor and building things and doing the right thing and standing up and being strong.
[01:45:58.061 --> 01:45:59.962]  And defending the weak.
[01:45:59.962 --> 01:46:05.345]  If you don't have an instinct to stand up for women and children, you're not a man.
[01:46:05.345 --> 01:46:07.287]  That's what men are supposed to do.
[01:46:07.287 --> 01:46:09.948]  It's not anything special.
[01:46:09.948 --> 01:46:10.889]  I'm nothing special.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.962]  And you've just got to believe in yourselves and believe that if you ask God to empower you, you will be a leader.
[01:46:18.962 --> 01:46:22.262]  And that's what we need, because ideas are bulletproof.
[01:46:22.262 --> 01:46:33.766]  And if you just simply step up to the plate and get in the arena, you're going to get stronger, you're going to get better, you're going to get more confident, and it's going to lead to great things for this society.
[01:46:33.766 --> 01:46:38.007]  And true service and true commitment to service.
[01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:51.725]  And they know a lot of you want to serve, so they have fake groups that are these charities that are really funding the destruction of our country, who put out nice propaganda, and then you go and you join them.
[01:46:51.725 --> 01:46:53.746]  Or, oh, help girls not get cancer.
[01:46:53.746 --> 01:46:54.446]  Come help.
[01:46:54.446 --> 01:46:58.488]  We grassroots lobbying arms to push the human papillomavirus.
[01:46:59.964 --> 01:47:01.545]  Or, oh, come join the Red Cross.
[01:47:01.545 --> 01:47:02.205]  We help people.
[01:47:02.205 --> 01:47:07.408]  Really, they give money to anti-gun groups and steal the lion's share of the money and are an intelligence operation.
[01:47:07.408 --> 01:47:13.672]  And by the way, that's been certified for over a hundred years, the International Red Cross is a global intelligence operation.
[01:47:13.672 --> 01:47:24.858]  It was the Red Cross that brought Lenin his 25 million in gold when the white Russians were beating them in 1917.
[01:47:24.858 --> 01:47:28.180]  Not bashing you that went and volunteered for them and handed out soup.
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:29.161]  They do a little something.
[01:47:30.071 --> 01:47:31.172]  But that's just for looks.
[01:47:31.172 --> 01:47:35.036]  That's just for appearances.
[01:47:35.036 --> 01:47:40.821]  That's the only reason that's happening.
[01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:44.224]  Alright, shifting gears, I want to go back to your calls here in a moment.
[01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:50.049]  Censored Media Blacklist BBC Fiasco Google Dig Sensor 9-11 Truth
[01:47:52.882 --> 01:47:59.604]  News 24 time-stamped video disappears from Google Video despite the fact it's under 30 seconds in length and clearly constitutes fair use.
[01:47:59.604 --> 01:48:06.166]  The new video from a separate live BBC feed where they announced Building 7 fell 20-something minutes before it did.
[01:48:06.166 --> 01:48:09.287]  Digg lets a small minority of morons decide its content.
[01:48:09.287 --> 01:48:18.910]  Now, Digg's already banned us before, and I told Paul, and then he remembered that, and it's even worse than that, and our stuff's up one minute before they take it down.
[01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:20.090]  So it's Digg itself.
[01:48:22.159 --> 01:48:31.343]  The crowned kings of censorship, Google, have pulled the news 24 time stamp video that shows BBC reporting the collapse of Building 7 26 minutes before it happened.
[01:48:31.343 --> 01:48:40.528]  Meanwhile, the establishment media continues to ignore Building 7 farce as a whole, including the inconceivable notion that BBC would have mysteriously lost all their 9-11 footage.
[01:48:42.276 --> 01:48:50.621]  Despite the fact that the clip is under 30 seconds in length and clearly constitutes fair use, Google yanked the video last night after it was prominently featured in our article yesterday.
[01:48:50.621 --> 01:49:03.189]  We have replaced the video with a YouTube composite of both the Jane Standley footage and the new BBC 24 clip, but for how long this stays active remains to be seen.
[01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:07.052]  So what you do is you grab it and save it and post it on your own little systems.
[01:49:08.795 --> 01:49:16.840]  Google and the BBC have a cozy relationship and are currently in an advanced stage of talks to content share on Google Video.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:24.846]  This could explain why the original Stan Lee footage was yanked from Google within hours of it becoming popular on the internet Monday afternoon.
[01:49:24.846 --> 01:49:31.370]  It seems the BBC are extremely incompetent when it comes to looking after their own archived tapes, but remarkably proficient
[01:49:32.302 --> 01:49:38.009]  About getting any embarrassing material scrubbed off the internet with the eager aid of the don't-be-evil Google.
[01:49:38.009 --> 01:49:40.913]  By the way, a bunch of other BBC clips have been left up.
[01:49:40.913 --> 01:49:42.114]  Those will be up for ten years.
[01:49:42.114 --> 01:49:44.958]  It's just the stuff that embarrasses them.
[01:49:44.958 --> 01:49:50.224]  Because there needs to be, grand juries need to be calling people in and saying, who gave you that information?
[01:49:50.224 --> 01:49:51.125]  Aaron Brown of CNN?
[01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:56.891]  All the people at BBC, I mean, they didn't just have her on their saying and it collapsed.
[01:49:56.891 --> 01:49:59.632]  The news readers in London were announcing it.
[01:49:59.632 --> 01:50:04.713]  Then they cut to her with a lower third already ready.
[01:50:04.713 --> 01:50:07.653]  A graphic was created.
[01:50:07.653 --> 01:50:11.474]  The neocon operatives and their followers, because it's a snowball.
[01:50:11.474 --> 01:50:20.776]  Not all of them are agents, but the agents put out the first disinfo and the parrots, the idiocracy crowd, then parrots it and snowballs it.
[01:50:21.722 --> 01:50:26.386]  They're just saying the video's all fake, even though BBC admits it's real.
[01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:33.013]  And they're also saying that the timestamp's fake, and they're saying the time zones are wrong.
[01:50:33.013 --> 01:50:35.515]  It's just incredible.
[01:50:35.515 --> 01:50:43.322]  It seems the BBC are extremely incompetent when it comes to looking after their own archive tapes, but remarkably proficient about getting any embarrassing material scrubbed off the internet.
[01:50:45.453 --> 01:50:50.496]  With the eager aid of the don't-be-evil Google, they compose a forbidding tag team of censorship.
[01:50:50.496 --> 01:51:08.585]  Recall that Google bizarrely wiped a leading mainstream news website from their search engine altogether after China complained last year simply because Space War had carried articles mildly critical of Google's beloved communist Chinese paymasters, for whom Yahoo have also shopped numerous dissidents
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:13.041]  Who have ended up in China's re-education labor camps.
[01:51:13.041 --> 01:51:13.781]  Some have been killed.
[01:51:13.781 --> 01:51:15.101]  Yeah, they rat you out.
[01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:20.103]  There was also Google video that were caught on numerous occasions resetting views.
[01:51:20.103 --> 01:51:28.064]  Features for Alex Jones' Terror Storm and other 9-11 truth films to prevent them from entering the higher echelons of the charts and going viral.
[01:51:28.064 --> 01:51:28.625]  We'll come back.
[01:51:28.625 --> 01:51:29.565]  Get to more of your calls.
[01:51:29.565 --> 01:51:29.945]  Stay with me.
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:40.984]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:40.984 --> 01:51:48.629]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:49.324 --> 01:51:56.766]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:56.766 --> 01:52:08.509]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:08.509 --> 01:52:12.469]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:12.469 --> 01:52:14.730]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:18.571]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:47.002 --> 01:52:48.923]  I can't drink this cabin water.

[01:52:51.023 --> 01:52:52.764]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.

[01:54:47.652 --> 01:54:48.832]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:48.832 --> 01:54:51.193]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:51.193 --> 01:54:53.314]  Going straight into hour number three here in just a few minutes.
[01:54:53.314 --> 01:54:55.875]  Continue with your calls and a special guest.
[01:54:55.875 --> 01:55:02.056]  Part two of the expose on the Oklahoma City bombing as that unravels as well.
[01:55:02.056 --> 01:55:10.619]  Now, first, the BBC started trying to jerk all the videos of their reporters reporting that Building 7 had collapsed and then even giving the reason it had collapsed.
[01:55:12.245 --> 01:55:14.586]  And then they tried to expunge the entire record.
[01:55:14.586 --> 01:55:15.687]  Then they tried to deny it.
[01:55:15.687 --> 01:55:19.209]  Then they said, okay, it's true, but we lost all the tapes.
[01:55:19.209 --> 01:55:21.510]  And then now it's being censored all over the place.
[01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:25.713]  And that convinced a bunch of people that weren't convinced before.
[01:55:25.713 --> 01:55:28.394]  Because they're watching it in real time.
[01:55:28.394 --> 01:55:30.896]  And they're seeing it happen.
[01:55:30.896 --> 01:55:31.556]  And that's the thing.
[01:55:31.556 --> 01:55:36.959]  If we can just get people to get involved and start investigating on their own, to witness this stuff for themselves,
[01:55:37.856 --> 01:55:39.277]  They'll be able to see what's happening.
[01:55:39.277 --> 01:55:45.539]  I mean, it is hard to believe there's massive censorship and control and operations and disinfo, and the government blew up Building 7.
[01:55:45.539 --> 01:55:46.340]  But they did!
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.101]  It's not just this BBC clip.
[01:55:48.101 --> 01:55:51.762]  It's Larry Silverstein, the owner, saying it, slipping up.
[01:55:51.762 --> 01:55:55.444]  It's all these firemen, police, and emergency workers saying that they were told to get back.
[01:55:55.444 --> 01:55:58.345]  The government was going to blow it up.
[01:55:58.345 --> 01:56:04.408]  So, billions of people have heard Building 7 discussed, and now they see this, and then they see the cover-up.
[01:56:05.928 --> 01:56:09.369]  The story would have been big, but nothing near its size.
[01:56:09.369 --> 01:56:11.390]  Literally, it's a hundred times bigger now.
[01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:14.011]  The biggest thing I've ever seen in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:56:14.011 --> 01:56:15.531]  Dwarfing the C-SPAN stuff.
[01:56:15.531 --> 01:56:18.492]  Dwarfing the Charlie Sheen developments.
[01:56:18.492 --> 01:56:22.974]  It's the biggest thing ever, and it's because they tried to cover up.
[01:56:22.974 --> 01:56:24.674]  And they're going to continue.
[01:56:24.674 --> 01:56:31.717]  And when they start arresting and killing patriots and trying to shut down the web, which no doubt they're going to do, they're arrogant, that's going to help even more.
[01:56:31.717 --> 01:56:32.937]  Just like the Alamo helped.
[01:56:34.327 --> 01:56:37.969]  Uh, be a great, uh, you know, fire starter, a great, uh, trigger point.
[01:56:37.969 --> 01:56:39.830]  Look, we're going to win this.
[01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:43.712]  If we just don't stop and we go 110%, it's like getting in a fight.
[01:56:43.712 --> 01:56:49.174]  The guy that thinks about how to win the fight and thinks about different moves to make and... He's gonna lose, folks.
[01:56:49.174 --> 01:56:59.419]  It's the person that charges in 110% with, you know, just the guerrilla attack, uh, pattern, is, is gonna win nine times out of ten.
[01:57:00.442 --> 01:57:04.484]  And we just gotta throw ourselves, our weight against the New World Order, all of us.
[01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:06.005]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:57:06.005 --> 01:57:06.365]  Get aggressive.
[01:57:06.365 --> 01:57:06.865]  Put on your war face.
[01:57:06.865 --> 01:57:08.346]  Give us a war cry.
[01:57:08.346 --> 01:57:09.906]  And just tell the New World Order we're coming.
[01:57:09.906 --> 01:57:27.474]  Just AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:30.372]  Envision it in your mind's eye.
[01:57:30.372 --> 01:57:33.514]  Take action!

[01:59:21.877 --> 01:59:27.020]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:34.485]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:59:34.485 --> 01:59:45.331]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:59:45.331 --> 01:59:49.874]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:50.154 --> 01:59:56.298]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food colorational minerals.
[01:59:56.298 --> 02:00:06.164]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:00:55.554 --> 02:01:05.684]  Alright, let's jam in a few calls before Jesse Trinidou is scheduled to join us with more information about the Oklahoma City Inside Job cover-up.
[02:01:05.684 --> 02:01:09.007]  Let's go to Jenna in Ontario, Canada, then Skip and others.
[02:01:09.007 --> 02:01:10.449]  Jenna, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:01:11.038 --> 02:01:11.779]  Hi Alex.
[02:01:11.779 --> 02:01:12.299]  Hi.
[02:01:12.299 --> 02:01:21.305]  I am actually calling to urge everyone to contact Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Peter McKay.
[02:01:21.305 --> 02:01:31.432]  You can get his phone number for his offices at petermckay.ca and my suggestion is to call his office and one, let him know that we're on to them.
[02:01:31.432 --> 02:01:38.617]  He's actually the one pursuing the North American Union publicly at this point and two, good luck getting away with it.
[02:01:39.908 --> 02:01:43.692]  Well, I mean, and then on top of it, they'll announce it and then they'll just deny it.
[02:01:43.692 --> 02:01:49.177]  They say we're for world government, we're for North American Union, but if you don't like it, it doesn't exist, you're crazy.
[02:01:49.177 --> 02:01:50.198]  Exactly.
[02:01:50.198 --> 02:01:50.638]  Exactly.
[02:01:50.638 --> 02:01:52.160]  And this guy's come right out and said it.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:53.721]  Like, he's basically in charge of it.
[02:01:53.721 --> 02:02:00.848]  So, I just suggest everyone, like, contacting him as soon as possible because they think they're getting away with it.
[02:02:00.848 --> 02:02:04.972]  And the more time that goes by, the angrier the Canadians that I know are becoming.
[02:02:06.047 --> 02:02:08.531]  Something's got to give here.
[02:02:08.531 --> 02:02:16.023]  The only reason that any progress is being made on our side at all is because people are becoming active and actually doing something about this stuff.
[02:02:16.023 --> 02:02:18.407]  So don't sit back and do nothing.
[02:02:18.407 --> 02:02:19.589]  You can definitely
[02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:36.160]  What did Canadians think about the meeting last Friday there in Ottawa, where they were just openly announcing, and it was in the newspaper, saying, well, the legislature doesn't need to be involved, we'll just have the leaders start merging the countries, it's for your own good.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:49.069]  Yeah, they're furious, and they're also, most people, we basically don't watch the news anymore, and when we do, we immediately either turn to your show for some kind of accurate interpretation of what actually is happening, for instance,
[02:02:49.668 --> 02:03:06.321]  Um, a lot of people are getting excited about, uh, Canada said, like, there's reports that we're going to stop dealing in American dollars, and Canada rejected the anti-terror law, and everyone's getting really excited, and, oh, we're winning, but we're also skeptical because, you know, does that even mean anything?
[02:03:06.321 --> 02:03:08.783]  Like, we've been lied to about everything, so we're very...
[02:03:09.813 --> 02:03:12.114]  We're not believing what we're told in the first place.
[02:03:12.114 --> 02:03:12.875]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:03:12.875 --> 02:03:16.937]  They have public debates about security, and then Canada says, no, we don't want to go that far.
[02:03:16.937 --> 02:03:19.919]  Meanwhile, behind the scenes, they're merging everything.
[02:03:19.919 --> 02:03:20.339]  Exactly.
[02:03:20.339 --> 02:03:26.003]  Basically, it's like Newt Gingrich comes out and says something mean about Hillary, but really they're for the same agenda.
[02:03:26.003 --> 02:03:27.304]  It's a dog and pony show.
[02:03:27.304 --> 02:03:27.744]  That's right.
[02:03:28.624 --> 02:03:32.765]  But people are waking up, so they're at least having to put on the show.
[02:03:32.765 --> 02:03:34.265]  Exactly, and that's my point.
[02:03:34.265 --> 02:03:36.385]  Like, get a hold of these people so they at least know.
[02:03:36.385 --> 02:03:39.086]  I think they're taking us for fools or something.
[02:03:39.086 --> 02:03:43.467]  Like, to think that they can just get away with this, like, above the radar.
[02:03:43.467 --> 02:03:44.847]  You shouldn't underestimate people.
[02:03:44.847 --> 02:03:47.267]  Jenna, how long ago did you wake up to the New World Order?
[02:03:47.267 --> 02:03:48.107]  Uh, 9-11.
[02:03:48.107 --> 02:03:50.488]  That day, I was like, what the hell was that?
[02:03:50.488 --> 02:03:56.549]  And it was just, I'd had a most uncomfortable feeling ever since, and then I got a hold of your show, and I'm like, oh my.
[02:03:57.347 --> 02:03:59.088]  That's the answer.
[02:03:59.088 --> 02:04:02.110]  And people beg me for information since then.
[02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:05.572]  They come to me all the time, just like, please give me some resources.
[02:04:05.572 --> 02:04:16.318]  They know they're being lied to, but until you're given accurate information of what exactly is happening, you're just left feeling confused and useless, really.
[02:04:16.318 --> 02:04:17.659]  Well, exactly.
[02:04:17.659 --> 02:04:21.141]  People say, well, the globalists are so big and powerful, we can't fight them.
[02:04:21.141 --> 02:04:21.962]  They're invincible.
[02:04:22.708 --> 02:04:27.212]  Well, it's even more discouraging to say that and then do nothing.
[02:04:27.212 --> 02:04:29.875]  No, at least we're fighting back.
[02:04:29.875 --> 02:04:32.077]  They're not invincible, they're stupid.
[02:04:32.077 --> 02:04:33.077]  Well, it's like the Borg.
[02:04:33.077 --> 02:04:36.641]  They keep saying, resistance is futile, you will assimilate.
[02:04:36.641 --> 02:04:37.621]  And no, we're not going to.
[02:04:37.621 --> 02:04:39.123]  To hell with that, exactly.
[02:04:39.123 --> 02:04:42.606]  And I love my country, and I know Canadians.
[02:04:42.606 --> 02:04:45.529]  The more we wake up, the less we're willing to tolerate this.
[02:04:46.932 --> 02:04:48.032]  Just keep it up.
[02:04:48.032 --> 02:04:49.193]  Well, good job.
[02:04:49.193 --> 02:04:51.454]  Jenna, good to hear from you there in Canada.
[02:04:51.454 --> 02:05:06.819]  Now, we're going to get to Skip and Todd and Doug and you're in the Netherlands and everybody else, but we've got Jesse Trinidou, the lawyer, coming on who got the affidavit from one of the other convicted bombers, the OKC, Terry Nichols.
[02:05:06.819 --> 02:05:09.340]  There's actually two affidavits here.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:10.861]  And this is powerful information.
[02:05:10.861 --> 02:05:16.023]  We're scheduled, as they say, across the pond to be having him on, but he was
[02:05:17.285 --> 02:05:27.531]  In some court proceedings, so we'll see if he's with us after we go to break, and we'll continue with calls and a ton of news on Iran, the censorship BBC scandal, and a lot more.
[02:05:27.531 --> 02:05:38.598]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.598 --> 02:05:46.183]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.932 --> 02:05:54.375]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.375 --> 02:06:06.120]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:10.082]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:10.082 --> 02:06:12.343]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:12.343 --> 02:06:16.185]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.395 --> 02:06:32.736]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:06:32.736 --> 02:06:37.919]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:06:37.919 --> 02:06:42.561]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:51.684]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:06:51.684 --> 02:06:55.306]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:06:55.586 --> 02:07:00.909]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:07:00.909 --> 02:07:07.593]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:07:08.129 --> 02:07:09.430]  What about you?
[02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:14.855]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:07:31.212 --> 02:07:35.576]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:07:35.576 --> 02:07:37.597]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:07:37.597 --> 02:07:44.182]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:07:44.182 --> 02:07:50.548]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:07:50.548 --> 02:07:52.329]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:53.090]  I think so.
[02:08:15.166 --> 02:08:18.267]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:18.267 --> 02:08:19.627]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:19.627 --> 02:08:19.927]  BBC!
[02:08:19.927 --> 02:08:20.067]  BBC!
[02:08:20.067 --> 02:08:20.508]  It's just BBC!
[02:08:44.139 --> 02:08:52.566]  We've got the big censored cover-up story concerning the video of Building 7 falling.
[02:08:52.566 --> 02:08:55.869]  BBC announced 20 plus minutes before it fell that it was going to fall.
[02:08:55.869 --> 02:09:01.553]  Now they've announced the tapes have all disappeared.
[02:09:01.553 --> 02:09:06.157]  They've been all over the web telling websites to expunge any video clips of it.
[02:09:06.157 --> 02:09:07.759]  They admit that they did indeed report it.
[02:09:07.759 --> 02:09:10.141]  Now we have CNN's Aaron Brown on tape doing it.
[02:09:10.141 --> 02:09:12.322]  And another live BBC feed on BBC 24.
[02:09:14.398 --> 02:09:40.198]  On the heels of all of that, what, two weeks ago, there was the four-part series, and the part that I'm in is part two, 9-11 Conspiracies, and Jesse Trenadue has heard from those involved in the production, it's a different director than Guy Smith, that in this part four of the series, to air this Sunday, they interview former FBI hostage rescue and anti-terror team founder, senior officer Danny Colson,
[02:09:41.135 --> 02:09:53.801]  He supposedly interviewed saying that he believes that Andre Stropmeyer was a government agent and was involved in the bombing and that the BBC spent a month in Oklahoma City and that this report is going to be a good one.
[02:09:53.801 --> 02:10:10.169]  We'll see what happens Sunday night, but to give us his inside take from talking to folks on that and talk about the latest developments, for those that don't know, the only other person fully convicted for the Oklahoma City bombing is Terry Nichols.
[02:10:11.139 --> 02:10:27.089]  And Terry Nichols is in a supermax prison in Colorado in 2004 in a sealed affidavit, but we do have the filing, just not the sealed subsections of it or the evidence.
[02:10:28.110 --> 02:10:29.371]  The exhibits.
[02:10:29.371 --> 02:10:42.836]  He said that in 2004 he wrote a letter to John Ashcroft, then Attorney General, saying, I want to spill the beans about a government involvement in this and McVeigh being a Special Forces Black Ops officer and how this whole thing was rigged.
[02:10:42.836 --> 02:10:45.737]  And then there was a gag order on Nichols talking to the media.
[02:10:45.737 --> 02:10:50.038]  We've since confirmed that 60 Minutes tried to get in to see him and was barred.
[02:10:50.038 --> 02:10:52.659]  That's CBS News reporting on that.
[02:10:52.659 --> 02:10:53.439]  We have the story.
[02:10:53.439 --> 02:10:54.560]  They did a story about that.
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:11:06.386]  So that confirms it, but because he is a lawyer, because he's suing the government, Jesse Trinidou was able to get in and interview for a day and a half Terry Nichols.
[02:11:06.386 --> 02:11:21.615]  Now again, the exhibits have been sealed, but not before the Salt Lake City Tribune and of course the Desert News were able to see it, and they named Larry Potts, Deputy FBI Director, as being behind and masterminding the bombing.
[02:11:22.336 --> 02:11:28.180]  But the counselor we have on can now not get into anything else that wasn't in the paper, because it's now been sealed.
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.624]  They can try to throw the whole thing out, but we do have a lot of other developments that he can discuss.
[02:11:32.624 --> 02:11:34.805]  Mr. Trinidou, thank you for coming on today.
[02:11:34.805 --> 02:11:35.506]  Thank you for having me.
[02:11:36.281 --> 02:11:39.623]  And thanks for sitting there while I reintroduce things.
[02:11:39.623 --> 02:11:43.864]  For those that don't know your story, just do a thumbnail sketch about your brother, what happened.
[02:11:43.864 --> 02:11:45.765]  Bring us up to speed with the filing.
[02:11:45.765 --> 02:11:52.048]  You're trying to get a videotaped deposition for your lawsuit dealing with your brother, wrongful death in federal custody.
[02:11:52.048 --> 02:11:55.890]  Walk us through it, and then we'll get into this new BBC report and what you've heard.
[02:11:55.890 --> 02:11:59.932]  Because that's some bombshell revelations, if that is indeed the case.
[02:11:59.932 --> 02:12:04.814]  Well, my brother was murdered while in federal custody in Oklahoma City shortly after the bombing.
[02:12:05.382 --> 02:12:14.372]  Turns out now that he was murdered because the FBI thought he was Richard Lee Guthrie, who I now suspect was John Doe, too, in a bombing.
[02:12:14.372 --> 02:12:19.338]  And I didn't set out to solve the bombing or get involved with the bombing of the Murrow Building in any fashion.
[02:12:19.338 --> 02:12:25.185]  It's just trying to find out what happened to my brother and who killed him, and it's all taking me back to the bombing.
[02:12:26.724 --> 02:12:33.948]  Now, your brother had his throat slit, his head bashed in three places, burn marks, electrical burns all over his body, black and blue.
[02:12:33.948 --> 02:12:38.050]  They tried to cremate, but you're a lawyer, you were able to block that, get the body.
[02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:42.492]  And then when they actually got Richard Lee Guthrie, they tortured him to death the same way.
[02:12:42.492 --> 02:12:43.713]  Can you talk about that?
[02:12:43.713 --> 02:12:52.497]  All I know is Richard Lee Guthrie, the day before he was supposed to give an interview and tell everything he knew about the Oklahoma City bombing, was supposedly committed suicide.
[02:12:53.562 --> 02:12:55.683]  And that's who they thought your brother was?
[02:12:55.683 --> 02:12:56.703]  Yes.
[02:12:56.703 --> 02:12:58.303]  He looked like my brother.
[02:12:58.303 --> 02:12:59.464]  Same build.
[02:12:59.464 --> 02:13:01.464]  Driving the same kind of vehicle.
[02:13:01.464 --> 02:13:04.185]  And both had a dragon tattoo on their left forearm.
[02:13:04.185 --> 02:13:12.607]  And that was the description of... They both matched the description of John Doe II that the FBI was circulating when my brother was arrested.
[02:13:12.607 --> 02:13:18.769]  I know it's hard for you to talk about, but for those, we have some of the autopsy photos, pre-op, post-autopsy photos up on the site.
[02:13:18.769 --> 02:13:20.449]  Can you describe what they did to your brother?
[02:13:21.261 --> 02:13:23.723]  Oh, he was beaten head to toe, front to back.
[02:13:23.723 --> 02:13:25.824]  His head was smashed in three places.
[02:13:25.824 --> 02:13:27.305]  His throat was cut.
[02:13:27.305 --> 02:13:29.387]  Even the soles of his feet had been beaten.
[02:13:29.387 --> 02:13:31.268]  And he had stun gun marks all over his body.
[02:13:31.268 --> 02:13:32.929]  Burn marks all over his body.
[02:13:32.929 --> 02:13:36.892]  He was visually strangled with a pair of plastic handcuffs.
[02:13:36.892 --> 02:13:38.473]  And that slashed his throat?
[02:13:38.473 --> 02:13:39.534]  Yes.
[02:13:39.534 --> 02:13:41.015]  No, no, his throat was cut.
[02:13:41.015 --> 02:13:46.338]  I think his throat was slashed cutting the handcuffs off.
[02:13:46.338 --> 02:13:50.201]  Now, describe how you got in contact with Terry Nichols.
[02:13:52.805 --> 02:13:59.607]  Well, in the beginning I had no inkling that my brother's murder was related to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:13:59.607 --> 02:14:05.308]  I received an anonymous phone call in, must have been early January of 1996 or late December of 1995.
[02:14:05.308 --> 02:14:09.149]  The caller said my brother had been murdered by the FBI.
[02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:19.311]  He died in an interrogation that got out of hand, that he fit the profile of a group who were robbing banks to fund the tax upon the federal government.
[02:14:19.924 --> 02:14:21.305]  And he wasn't a member of that group.
[02:14:21.305 --> 02:14:25.609]  It was a case of mistaken identity, but things just went bad.
[02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:30.253]  And I didn't... I just blew it off as just a nut calling me.
[02:14:30.253 --> 02:14:42.203]  And then about six months later, I read a story in the Los Angeles Times about a man named Richard Lee Guthrie, who was found hanging in his cell the day before he was going to supposedly talk about the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:14:42.203 --> 02:14:44.965]  And he was a member of a group called the Midwest Bank Robbery Gang.
[02:14:45.583 --> 02:14:50.788]  That was robbing banks to get money to fund bombing attacks on the federal government.
[02:14:50.788 --> 02:14:54.112]  And they didn't have a photograph of Guffey with the story, though.
[02:14:54.112 --> 02:15:08.526]  And then where it all came together was shortly before his execution, I received a message from Tim McVeigh, who told me that when he saw my brother's photograph and read about what happened to him, that he knew the FBI killed my brother because they thought he was Richard Lee Guffey.
[02:15:09.469 --> 02:15:12.351]  Now, if we can, and again, we're very appreciative of your time.
[02:15:12.351 --> 02:15:13.992]  We know you're very busy, sir.
[02:15:13.992 --> 02:15:24.100]  Walk through, without getting into the sealed exhibits, what you filed, why you filed it, and the things that are in the record about what Terry Nichols told you.
[02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:28.163]  And then I want to get into the new BBC developments you've learned of.
[02:15:28.163 --> 02:15:34.427]  Well, I was eventually contacted by Terry Nichols, who said he had a story he wanted told, and he couldn't get it out.
[02:15:34.427 --> 02:15:38.250]  And I was able to get in to see him and spend a day and a half with him.
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:40.902]  He wants to tell the story about the bombing.
[02:15:40.902 --> 02:15:44.324]  He wants to tell the story about the others involved.
[02:15:44.324 --> 02:15:52.531]  He gave me a sworn statement to which were attached a number of documents, including FBI documents.
[02:15:52.531 --> 02:16:04.600]  I filed that statement in support of a motion I had brought in federal court for an order allowing me to take a Terry Nichols sworn deposition and to videotape that deposition.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:07.943]  Upon the filing of the declaration, the documents were ordered sealed.
[02:16:10.453 --> 02:16:17.416]  Now, you talked about this being record fast to get something sealed.
[02:16:17.416 --> 02:16:19.397]  Well, it happened very quickly.
[02:16:19.397 --> 02:16:25.040]  I filed it, and then before it enters the docket, there's an order sealing it.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:35.725]  But not before two newspapers were able to see it and list the fact that Terry Nichols reported that McVeigh had told him that Larry Potts was commanding the bombing operation.
[02:16:35.725 --> 02:16:37.505]  I don't know if they were able to see it in time or not.
[02:16:37.505 --> 02:16:38.546]  I assume they probably did.
[02:16:39.309 --> 02:16:45.254]  Well, they reported they saw it and reported that.
[02:16:45.254 --> 02:16:46.275]  That's correct.
[02:16:46.275 --> 02:16:49.597]  But obviously, you can't even confirm that now because it's been sealed.
[02:16:49.597 --> 02:16:59.005]  No, the danger for me is if I get into it, I will get orders, motions from the FBI for contempt and to have the case thrown out.
[02:16:59.005 --> 02:17:02.327]  And as far as I know, this is the only case in existence that's going after this guy.
[02:17:02.327 --> 02:17:05.190]  Yeah, we don't want to go anywhere near that, Den, and you haven't.
[02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:06.631]  Let's now get into the BBC.
[02:17:08.042 --> 02:17:14.405]  You say that you've talked to those in and around the report, and you're hearing there's going to be some amazing revelations in it.
[02:17:14.405 --> 02:17:15.285]  Can you go through that?
[02:17:15.285 --> 02:17:18.226]  Well, I can tell you, but it's probably best to start at the beginning.
[02:17:18.226 --> 02:17:34.753]  It was in June of this year, June of 2006, the federal judge here in Salt Lake City ordered the FBI to turn over documents to me linking it to a failed sting operation at Elohim City that led to the bombing of the Merrill Building.
[02:17:34.753 --> 02:17:35.974]  The FBI came back and
[02:17:37.022 --> 02:17:43.764]  I told the judge that they had promised four informants anonymity and not to turn over anything.
[02:17:43.764 --> 02:17:47.625]  They never denied the accusations about being involved in the bombing.
[02:17:47.625 --> 02:17:56.967]  The judge said that while he could not, as a matter of law, disclose the names, he ordered them to black the names out and to turn over the documents to me.
[02:17:56.967 --> 02:18:05.269]  When that happened, I was contacted by the United States television media out of New York, the major networks and network headquarters.
[02:18:05.962 --> 02:18:07.803]  They asked for those copies of those documents.
[02:18:07.803 --> 02:18:09.524]  I said, yes, you can have them.
[02:18:09.524 --> 02:18:12.465]  And I'm asked more or less, are you going to tell this story?
[02:18:12.465 --> 02:18:21.049]  And what I got back from CBS and NBC and MSNBC and CNN was the story was so ugly that they wanted to be second.
[02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:23.210]  They didn't want to go first with this story.
[02:18:23.210 --> 02:18:27.712]  And then I received a call from a BBC producer who asked me about the documents.
[02:18:27.712 --> 02:18:28.933]  And could he come over and look at them?
[02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:29.673]  And I said, sure.
[02:18:29.673 --> 02:18:35.196]  So he and a reporter came in June of 2006, spent three days in Salt Lake City.
[02:18:35.985 --> 02:18:45.430]  Going over the court records and the documents, they came back in September with a film crew and spent a month filming in Oklahoma City, Texas, and I don't know where else.
[02:18:45.430 --> 02:18:51.253]  And later, to be clear, it was learned that separate documents had been released that hadn't been blacked out, so you could compare the two.
[02:18:51.253 --> 02:18:55.315]  These have been confirmed to be authentic, and it points the finger directly at the government.
[02:18:55.315 --> 02:18:55.815]  It does.
[02:18:55.815 --> 02:19:02.138]  They had informants in with McVeigh at Elkhorn City and had advanced knowledge of the bombing, but didn't stop it.
[02:19:02.757 --> 02:19:12.380]  So the BBC film crew comes back and spends a month here putting together an hour-long, it's my understanding, story about the FBI and ATF's involvement in the bombing.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:18.683]  And it airs primetime this Sunday, March 4th, 2007 in Europe.
[02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:22.684]  Now, one of the other producers who made the 9-11 segment for this four-part series,
[02:19:23.579 --> 02:19:24.620]  I have not seen the piece.
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:28.863]  All I know is they came on their last day in the United States, which was October 1st, I think, and spent the day with me.
[02:19:54.011 --> 02:19:59.614]  And shot some footage, but they had spent the entire month, it's my understanding, filming other people.
[02:19:59.614 --> 02:20:06.497]  And did they tell you they were convinced of inside job or prior knowledge and involvement when they left you, or what they said?
[02:20:06.497 --> 02:20:15.462]  All I know is that apparently they have people who are going on film to talk about the FBI's involvement.
[02:20:15.462 --> 02:20:17.323]  Let's talk about that on the other side.
[02:20:17.323 --> 02:20:19.684]  This is a huge revelation.
[02:20:19.684 --> 02:20:23.606]  Wait until you hear the details of it in the final segment with our guest,
[02:20:24.531 --> 02:20:30.672]  Jesse Trinidad!
[02:20:30.672 --> 02:20:32.012]  Good morning, honey!
[02:20:32.012 --> 02:20:32.733]  Wow!
[02:20:32.733 --> 02:20:38.294]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:20:38.294 --> 02:20:41.054]  Yeah... Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:20:41.054 --> 02:20:44.935]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:20:44.935 --> 02:20:46.875]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:20:46.875 --> 02:20:48.956]  And what am I gonna do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:20:48.956 --> 02:20:50.716]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:20:50.916 --> 02:20:52.218]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:20:52.218 --> 02:20:54.721]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:20:54.721 --> 02:20:55.482]  What?

[02:21:06.254 --> 02:21:11.100]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[02:21:18.863 --> 02:21:20.564]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:21:36.477 --> 02:21:41.501]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:21:41.501 --> 02:21:44.283]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:21:44.283 --> 02:21:46.745]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:21:46.745 --> 02:21:52.270]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:21:52.270 --> 02:22:00.536]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:22:00.536 --> 02:22:03.599]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:22:05.726 --> 02:22:10.150]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:11.691]  Call for your copy today.

[02:22:14.954 --> 02:22:21.500]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:21.960]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:22.161]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:32.855]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:22:32.855 --> 02:22:38.625]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:22:39.642 --> 02:22:47.884]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:22:47.884 --> 02:22:52.585]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:22:52.585 --> 02:22:59.626]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[02:22:59.626 --> 02:23:07.708]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:23:08.608 --> 02:23:10.089]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:23:29.739 --> 02:23:32.721]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:23:32.721 --> 02:23:35.023]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:23:35.023 --> 02:23:37.986]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:23:37.986 --> 02:23:42.469]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:43.070]  Here's why.
[02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:49.675]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:23:49.975 --> 02:23:56.625]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[02:23:56.625 --> 02:24:00.570]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:24:00.570 --> 02:24:04.797]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:24:05.257 --> 02:24:12.884]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.

[02:24:13.725 --> 02:24:14.545]  Get relief.
[02:24:14.545 --> 02:24:15.586]  Get some sleep.

[02:24:16.627 --> 02:24:17.648]  That's www.outand90.com.

[02:24:18.369 --> 02:24:18.589]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:24:31.046 --> 02:24:31.547]  Yeah.
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:44.402]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:24:44.402 --> 02:24:49.843]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:24:49.843 --> 02:24:52.544]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:24:52.544 --> 02:24:55.245]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:24:55.245 --> 02:25:00.287]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:25:03.252 --> 02:25:17.681]  Welcome back, as each one of you is our guest.
[02:25:17.681 --> 02:25:20.963]  He'll be with us a little bit in the next segment.
[02:25:20.963 --> 02:25:22.904]  Okay, incredible revelations.
[02:25:22.904 --> 02:25:24.285]  We're going to report out on this tonight.
[02:25:24.285 --> 02:25:25.126]  This is what you were told.
[02:25:25.126 --> 02:25:28.148]  We'll see if this happens.
[02:25:28.148 --> 02:25:31.069]  Because this is some of the same intel I've been getting, but we'll see what develops.
[02:25:31.069 --> 02:25:31.930]  But this is what you were told.
[02:25:33.266 --> 02:25:48.454]  You're now saying that there's a report that Danny Colson, the big founder of the FBI anti-terror wing, the top, I'd say six or seven in the FBI at the time, in the top echelon, is now saying that there was a government operative involved.
[02:25:48.454 --> 02:25:53.056]  He's naming Andrei Strassmayer, who we know is German intelligence that's now been admitted.
[02:25:53.056 --> 02:25:54.837]  Please, tell us about this.
[02:25:54.837 --> 02:25:56.037]  Well, I don't know.
[02:25:56.037 --> 02:25:57.678]  To be so all I know is what I've been told.
[02:25:58.767 --> 02:26:17.554]  He apparently was interviewed and spoke candidly and at length about the Oklahoma City bombing and the investigation, and the three things I have been told was that, or were, is that he was ordered out of the Justice Department not to pursue the Elohim City involvement in the bombing.
[02:26:19.176 --> 02:26:19.976]  Not to go there.
[02:26:19.976 --> 02:26:30.161]  And you told me during a break, though, that the BBC was telling you that he sits down on camera and fingers Andre Strassmeier.
[02:26:30.161 --> 02:26:31.122]  Can you repeat that?
[02:26:31.122 --> 02:26:40.366]  It's my understanding that he says that it's his belief that Strassmeier was an agent working for a foreign government.
[02:26:40.366 --> 02:26:41.687]  Man, this runs so deep.
[02:26:41.687 --> 02:26:45.229]  You've then got Iraqis running around in the middle of it, we know brought in by the U.S.
[02:26:45.229 --> 02:26:45.629]  government.
[02:26:45.629 --> 02:26:46.009]  You've got
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:52.881]  You've got white supremacists, you've got McVeigh going around trying to create a history at gun shows and with militias to then blame them.
[02:26:52.881 --> 02:26:55.262]  This is a classic black op.
[02:26:55.262 --> 02:26:59.062]  What other individuals did you hear sit down and bring forward these revelations?
[02:26:59.062 --> 02:27:01.543]  I have not heard who else they have on camera.
[02:27:01.543 --> 02:27:03.583]  Did you hear what they supposedly say?
[02:27:03.583 --> 02:27:04.504]  No.
[02:27:04.504 --> 02:27:16.586]  It's very close to the vest, but apparently it's being promoted very heavily in Europe on television and in the print media about the show and its significance.
[02:27:18.752 --> 02:27:21.293]  Just amazing.
[02:27:21.293 --> 02:27:25.455]  I know there's a lot of other facets and points we could go over.
[02:27:25.455 --> 02:27:28.876]  Right now, let me just ask you the question.
[02:27:28.876 --> 02:27:36.920]  What is the process now on your filing with your lawsuit to try to get the videotaped deposition with Terry Nichols?
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:40.761]  And how could the government even try to block that?
[02:27:40.761 --> 02:27:43.923]  Oh, I expect a vicious fight over that.
[02:27:43.923 --> 02:27:44.403]  They have
[02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:49.500]  Probably another two weeks in which to respond to that motion.
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:54.346]  I expect a full-out war in court over it.
[02:27:54.346 --> 02:28:03.036]  If it's granted, I fully expect them to appeal and not submit to the judge's order.
[02:28:03.036 --> 02:28:05.099]  I will be very surprised if they roll over on this one.
[02:28:07.626 --> 02:28:10.987]  Because they don't want that video getting out to the American people.
[02:28:10.987 --> 02:28:21.950]  I mean, the media predominantly has ignored this breaking news the last week and a half of the affidavit of Terry Nichols and the other affidavit, but I don't know how they ignored the videotape.
[02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:25.671]  No, it would be very difficult.
[02:28:25.671 --> 02:28:31.993]  Of course, my plan is, if I'm successful in getting that deposition, is to release the tape immediately.
[02:28:33.846 --> 02:28:36.246]  Well, I pray you release it to us.
[02:28:36.246 --> 02:28:37.507]  I certainly would.
[02:28:37.507 --> 02:28:39.887]  I'll jump on an airplane to go pick it up.
[02:28:39.887 --> 02:28:41.667]  Boy, that's a dangerous job.
[02:28:41.667 --> 02:28:46.048]  But I tell you, they killed your brother and you're not going to stop.
[02:28:46.048 --> 02:28:49.929]  This is like a fairy tale or something.
[02:28:49.929 --> 02:28:59.310]  This is a classic thing where they kill some innocent person and the brother starts out to find out why and finds out there's a much bigger world out there.
[02:28:59.310 --> 02:29:01.831]  It's an ugly, ugly story.
[02:29:01.831 --> 02:29:02.291]  They killed
[02:29:03.382 --> 02:29:05.144]  The whole bunch of people.
[02:29:05.144 --> 02:29:07.185]  It's a tragedy.
[02:29:07.185 --> 02:29:09.287]  People say, how can you say they killed them?
[02:29:09.287 --> 02:29:16.433]  My belief is that if your informants help build a bomb, you kill the people.
[02:29:17.535 --> 02:29:37.419]  Have you researched the World Trade Center, where the New York Times and CBS News both confirm, and it's admitted on record, they haven't debated it, that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, and funded the whole thing, and then told the guy that built it it was a sting, and then he thought they were setting him up, so he recorded them telling him, the FBI, go ahead and let it be bombed, the first World Trade Center, did you know that?
[02:29:37.419 --> 02:29:41.060]  I did not, but it's not, it wouldn't surprise me.
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:46.061]  Jesse, why do you think elements of the government like to kill people, and then blame it, want to get more funding, or why?
[02:29:47.746 --> 02:29:49.327]  I don't know why.
[02:29:49.327 --> 02:29:51.708]  All I know is with the sting operation in L.A.
[02:29:51.708 --> 02:30:02.593]  City, I think it was to restore their image and prestige after Waco and Ruby Ridge.
[02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:05.515]  They had suffered terribly as a result of Waco and Ruby Ridge.
[02:30:05.515 --> 02:30:08.776]  Let's talk about that when we get back in the final segment, then we'll go to your calls.
[02:30:08.776 --> 02:30:11.998]  Final segment with our guests and we'll get your calls, I promise.
[02:30:11.998 --> 02:30:16.100]  Yeah, but just stopping a bombing isn't as good as letting one go forward.
[02:30:17.177 --> 02:30:20.344]  No, that's even better.
[02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:21.747]  We're on the march.
[02:30:21.747 --> 02:30:24.272]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.272 --> 02:30:26.977]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:30.996 --> 02:30:35.761]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:30:35.761 --> 02:30:41.247]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:30:41.247 --> 02:30:44.711]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[02:30:44.711 --> 02:30:51.819]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:30:52.179 --> 02:30:59.601]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:30:59.601 --> 02:31:02.102]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[02:31:02.102 --> 02:31:08.664]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[02:31:08.664 --> 02:31:12.405]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[02:31:12.805 --> 02:31:15.407]  Call Day of Jubilee, open 9 a.m.
[02:31:15.407 --> 02:31:16.307]  to 5 p.m.

[02:31:20.330 --> 02:31:24.933]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:31:24.933 --> 02:31:26.193]  And ask for Robert.
[02:31:26.193 --> 02:31:30.076]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:31:30.076 --> 02:31:36.640]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:38.521]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big
[02:31:41.749 --> 02:31:42.069]  I think so.

[02:32:30.849 --> 02:32:33.531]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[02:32:33.531 --> 02:32:43.019]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[02:32:43.019 --> 02:32:50.105]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[02:32:50.811 --> 02:32:56.796]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[02:33:08.387 --> 02:33:10.949]  Laser technology at its best.

[02:33:14.172 --> 02:33:14.992]  I think so.
[02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:47.855]  By bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Murrow Building, you get to have the feds circle the wagons against the American people.
[02:33:47.855 --> 02:33:50.837]  This new attitude of there's lurking criminals everywhere.
[02:33:50.837 --> 02:33:53.799]  We've got to have secret police and spy networks.
[02:33:54.562 --> 02:34:19.820]  policing the nation and then it's really the secret police spy networks that are perfect for carrying out future terror and provocateur operations and getting more than double the funding for the anti-terror arms of the FBI and of course the BATF and their actions and that's what happened and saved Bill Clinton's presidency and now here we are today Jesse Trinidad in closing we're going to go to the calls
[02:34:21.003 --> 02:34:29.005]  How long until, ballpark, until we find out what the feds are going to do on your filing for a videotaped deposition and you think they'll appeal?
[02:34:29.005 --> 02:34:32.066]  How do you see this playing out?
[02:34:32.066 --> 02:34:37.767]  They'll have, I said, at least two additional weeks to respond.
[02:34:37.767 --> 02:34:43.909]  I'll have a short time thereafter in which to do a final reply in support of my motion.
[02:34:43.909 --> 02:34:48.270]  The judge will set a hearing date according to his calendar
[02:34:49.002 --> 02:34:55.548]  And then he'll decide the matter, and if he decides in my favor, I fully expect an appeal from the FBI.
[02:34:55.548 --> 02:34:56.929]  Is this a good judge?
[02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:59.451]  He's an excellent judge.
[02:34:59.451 --> 02:35:04.115]  So you've been getting favorable constitutional responses from him?
[02:35:04.115 --> 02:35:07.838]  He upholds the law and the Constitution, and he ordered the FBI to turn over those documents.
[02:35:10.507 --> 02:35:12.168]  And, uh, I don't have the court in front of me.
[02:35:12.168 --> 02:35:13.648]  Which court is this particularly?
[02:35:13.648 --> 02:35:16.389]  This is the United States District Court for the District of Utah.
[02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:17.649]  And Central Division?
[02:35:17.649 --> 02:35:17.989]  Yes.
[02:35:17.989 --> 02:35:18.369]  That's right.
[02:35:18.369 --> 02:35:20.830]  I just saw the document here in front of me.
[02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:24.711]  And, uh, do you ever think we'll see exhibits A through G unsealed?
[02:35:24.711 --> 02:35:27.432]  I want to try to have them unsealed.
[02:35:27.432 --> 02:35:34.434]  That's my next move in conjunction with trying to get the depositionists to file a motion asking that the names be blacked out.
[02:35:34.434 --> 02:35:38.495]  Well, not names blacked out, but any personal information blacked out and that the
[02:35:40.364 --> 02:35:47.141]  Did you ever see the news reports about Danny Colson checking in the night before the bombing in Oklahoma City?
[02:35:47.141 --> 02:35:47.562]  I did not.
[02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:51.052]  I actually have that report here in my stack.
[02:35:51.052 --> 02:35:52.353]  I'm trying to dig it out.
[02:35:52.353 --> 02:35:52.773]  Here it was.
[02:35:52.773 --> 02:35:53.594]  Let me just read this to you.
[02:35:53.594 --> 02:35:54.635]  World Net Daily picked it up.
[02:35:54.635 --> 02:35:57.677]  It was also in some mainstream papers in Oklahoma.
[02:35:57.677 --> 02:36:00.019]  Was FBI early arrival in Oklahoma City?
[02:36:00.019 --> 02:36:04.242]  Hotel receipt showed top terror man showed up nine hours before blast.
[02:36:04.242 --> 02:36:11.408]  Danny Colson had claimed that he had driven from Dallas, didn't get a flight, but people said he was there like an hour after, which is impossible.
[02:36:11.408 --> 02:36:13.529]  It's about a two-and-a-half, three-hour drive.
[02:36:13.529 --> 02:36:15.951]  If you speed, it's two hours.
[02:36:15.951 --> 02:36:18.173]  And then this receipt came up.
[02:36:19.602 --> 02:36:28.168]  I wonder, Danny, supposedly suddenly now in this report fingering some other intelligence operative.
[02:36:28.168 --> 02:36:31.471]  Just very interesting, Mr. Trinidad.
[02:36:31.471 --> 02:36:38.556]  Well, like I said, all I know is that's what I've been told consists of part of the story.
[02:36:38.556 --> 02:36:42.079]  Whether that story will ever be shown in the United States, I doubt.
[02:36:42.079 --> 02:36:46.222]  And just to be clear, because this is very newsworthy, just picking your brain here,
[02:36:47.817 --> 02:36:57.448]  Was there anything else the BBC said or any other indicators you got that make you come to the conclusion that this is a favorable report that's coming out Sunday?
[02:36:57.448 --> 02:37:07.460]  Apparently, I was told that Mr. Coulson goes on camera and says that he believes the grand jury should be reconvened to investigate the Elohim City connection to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:20.856]  If it comes out that the government was orchestrating the attack in 95, which clearly it was, all the evidence shows that the preponderance of it, the entire body of it, nothing points the other direction.
[02:37:20.856 --> 02:37:25.839]  You rarely see things so clear in a case, but it's very clear, especially once we have a real investigation.
[02:37:25.839 --> 02:37:27.860]  Boy, that'd be really scary.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:29.961]  Can the government afford to let this go forward?
[02:37:29.961 --> 02:37:33.063]  I mean, it seems like a collision course here.
[02:37:33.063 --> 02:37:37.866]  It would mean, it would destroy Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[02:37:39.348 --> 02:37:48.712]  It would result in the loss of careers of some high-level people within the various law enforcement agencies of the federal government.
[02:37:48.712 --> 02:37:53.894]  And it would probably result in a good number of them being prosecuted and sent to jail.
[02:37:53.894 --> 02:37:57.636]  You know, a lot of people get Arkansas-cited that mess with the Clintons.
[02:37:57.636 --> 02:37:59.917]  They're the most dangerous group I've seen to mess with.
[02:38:01.650 --> 02:38:07.235]  Well, for the order to come to not go to Elohim City, it would have to come out of the Clinton-Reno Justice Department.
[02:38:07.235 --> 02:38:10.157]  Oh, we know butch Reno ran the whole thing.
[02:38:10.157 --> 02:38:14.681]  We know they order when police grab some of the Arabs that they be released.
[02:38:14.681 --> 02:38:20.606]  From all your research, how do you think these Iraqis tie in?
[02:38:20.606 --> 02:38:22.928]  I see nothing to indicate there is a connection.
[02:38:22.928 --> 02:38:24.970]  Everything I've seen is Elohim City.
[02:38:24.970 --> 02:38:28.393]  The only foreign connection I've seen is the reference to Andreas Strassmayer.
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.543]  Well, I see a connection, but only at a patchy level, to have Arabs floating around.
[02:38:35.543 --> 02:38:38.905]  We know they were under CIA and Defense Department payroll.
[02:38:38.905 --> 02:38:40.125]  That's been confirmed.
[02:38:40.125 --> 02:38:46.128]  Just to have them there is some type of fallback or a muddying of the waters.
[02:38:46.128 --> 02:38:50.451]  All I know is that the FBI documents speak in terms of Strassmire and Ellingham City.
[02:38:51.914 --> 02:38:58.198]  Which again, the whole thing was being commanded by Strassmayer there at the Elohim City compound.
[02:38:58.198 --> 02:39:07.423]  From the research you've done, what percentage of the people at the Nazi compound were Feds or operatives or informants?
[02:39:07.423 --> 02:39:11.365]  The FBI has admitted they had at least four.
[02:39:11.365 --> 02:39:12.866]  And I'm sure there were more.
[02:39:12.866 --> 02:39:13.566]  And there were only what?
[02:39:14.153 --> 02:39:15.173]  Twenty people out there?
[02:39:15.173 --> 02:39:15.833]  Disgusting.
[02:39:33.118 --> 02:39:38.420]  Alright, well, Jesse Trinidou, I hope to get you back up next week, or sooner, as things develop.
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:48.163]  We know you have a very busy practice, and we appreciate all the work you're doing on this case, but we know you're doing it for your brother, and now you're doing it for the United States and the American people.
[02:39:48.163 --> 02:39:59.648]  And when it comes out, and it's come out, but when we nail it down for everybody, that OKC's an inside job, I think it's going to derail the entire war on terror.
[02:39:59.648 --> 02:40:00.668]  What do you think about that statement?
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:06.483]  Well, to the extent that... I don't know what the ramifications will be.
[02:40:06.483 --> 02:40:16.049]  I think it'll be a sobering thing for the American people to see what the law enforcement, federal law enforcement agencies have done.
[02:40:16.049 --> 02:40:18.670]  But duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:19.591]  What's the old saying?
[02:40:19.591 --> 02:40:21.572]  I mean, may the heavens fall.
[02:40:21.572 --> 02:40:28.916]  I mean, no matter how bad something's gonna be, you know, let the truth come out, let duty be done.
[02:40:28.916 --> 02:40:31.418]  And certainly on something like this, you need the truth told.
[02:40:32.364 --> 02:40:36.647]  Yeah, I mean, it's going to be bad cutting this cancer out, but we're not going to survive if we don't.
[02:40:36.647 --> 02:40:39.289]  Well, listen, I appreciate you coming on the air.
[02:40:39.289 --> 02:40:40.209]  God bless you.
[02:40:40.209 --> 02:40:41.090]  Thank you, sir.
[02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.550]  Take care.
[02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:43.131]  Jesse Trinidou.
[02:40:43.131 --> 02:40:44.653]  All right, I promise to get to your calls.
[02:40:44.653 --> 02:40:45.953]  Thank you for holding patiently.
[02:40:45.953 --> 02:40:51.577]  It's just, you have this, you have the BBC on the 9-11, it's just all of it.
[02:40:51.577 --> 02:40:54.599]  It's just... Can you feel it?
[02:40:54.599 --> 02:40:55.920]  Everything's accelerating.
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:57.081]  Everything is accelerating.
[02:40:57.081 --> 02:40:58.262]  I'm exhausted, personally.
[02:40:59.855 --> 02:41:00.876]  I'm just exhausted.
[02:41:00.876 --> 02:41:07.339]  I was working until about one last night and I just... I just can't even keep track of it all.
[02:41:07.339 --> 02:41:09.020]  I can't even counter all their lies.
[02:41:09.020 --> 02:41:13.042]  It's just... It's mind-blowing.
[02:41:13.042 --> 02:41:15.083]  You're in the Netherlands!
[02:41:15.083 --> 02:41:16.764]  Welcome, sir!
[02:41:16.764 --> 02:41:18.265]  Thank you very much.
[02:41:18.265 --> 02:41:20.206]  It is accelerating, isn't it?
[02:41:20.206 --> 02:41:21.706]  Everything is accelerating.
[02:41:21.706 --> 02:41:24.728]  I'm just calling about a little update from the Netherlands.
[02:41:24.728 --> 02:41:28.330]  Just today, a mainstream Dutch newspaper carried an article with the title
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:30.862]  Banks finance bombs.
[02:41:30.862 --> 02:41:37.607]  Now I've translated just the essence of the article, and maybe it's alright if I just say a few things about that?
[02:41:37.607 --> 02:41:38.668]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:41:38.668 --> 02:41:39.328]  Alright.
[02:41:39.328 --> 02:41:57.323]  An independent, and now I'm quoting the newspaper, well I translated it, an independent Belgian committee investigating money transfers from European banks to defense corporations and weapon manufacturers has concluded that quite a few European banks, under EU control of course, have directly financed weapon manufacturers.
[02:41:58.106 --> 02:42:09.656]  Well, the article mentions that the investigation in question led to the conclusion that a few Dutch banks, and in particular one called ABN Amro, have actually financed the production of cluster bombs.
[02:42:09.656 --> 02:42:19.524]  Now, the interesting thing, and this is my own adding, is that the foremost shareholder is none other than Beatrix van Oranje Nassau, which is Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.
[02:42:19.524 --> 02:42:26.930]  So, she's the foremost shareholder of this bank, this particular bank, which is financing cluster bombs.
[02:42:28.352 --> 02:42:31.136]  So this is the first part.
[02:42:31.136 --> 02:42:41.728]  This royalty-funded bank in its turn is a shareholder in the British INCIS group, I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly, who manufactured these devastating bombs for the British Ministry of Defense.
[02:42:41.728 --> 02:42:45.733]  Well, doesn't it all just perfectly fit in with the New World Order agenda for global governance?
[02:42:47.174 --> 02:43:03.349]  Yeah, the royalty and the big bankers literally print the money, they loan the money, they own the weapons contractors, they own the oil companies, they own the big eugenics operations, they own big pharma, and they all write books about how they want to kill most of us.
[02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:05.912]  Right, very parasitical, yeah.
[02:43:05.912 --> 02:43:07.894]  Yeah, these are sick people.
[02:43:07.894 --> 02:43:09.115]  These are very, very sick people.
[02:43:10.848 --> 02:43:11.128]  Sure.
[02:43:11.128 --> 02:43:14.489]  Well, that was about, you know, everything I had to say.
[02:43:14.489 --> 02:43:17.910]  Maybe I can translate the entire article and send it to you or something.
[02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:18.810]  That'd be great, sir.
[02:43:18.810 --> 02:43:25.572]  I really appreciate your work and thanks for holding to relay that information to us.
[02:43:25.572 --> 02:43:28.092]  There goes your in the Netherlands holding for a while.
[02:43:28.092 --> 02:43:29.033]  We appreciate it.
[02:43:29.033 --> 02:43:30.133]  Todd in Texas.
[02:43:30.133 --> 02:43:30.693]  Go ahead, Todd.
[02:43:32.833 --> 02:43:33.393]  Hey there, Alex.
[02:43:33.393 --> 02:43:34.834]  We'll be seeing you tomorrow, man.
[02:43:34.834 --> 02:43:38.556]  Yeah, the big Texas Independence Day rally against the New World Order.
[02:43:38.556 --> 02:43:40.757]  Yeah, me and Troy are coming up there in a shopping cart, man.
[02:43:40.757 --> 02:43:42.117]  We'll be there.
[02:43:42.117 --> 02:43:46.619]  By the time we get to the Hill Country, I'm going to make him push, but I'll be up there, man, for real.
[02:43:46.619 --> 02:44:02.226]  Just real quick, I heard something when I was checking out Dr. Begich's show, and he was talking about the active denial system can be counteracted by a thin copper wire mesh that would then have a lead to the ground.
[02:44:02.725 --> 02:44:04.506]  Well, it's like the shielding around a microwave.
[02:44:04.506 --> 02:44:12.329]  For those that don't know, the head of the Air Force said, this weapon is illegal to use on foreign enemy troops, but we can set the precedent using it against the American people.
[02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:53.688]  And of course, we told you seven years ago that it was developed for the American people, and they can focus the beam and actually harm you, or they have wide beam that can burn the skin of crowds, and just like the sound guns have been used on citizens, if they have their way, the police, as we riot wanting our money out of the banks, or riot not wanting to lose our houses as they consolidate, they'll just have the cops ride out their black uniforms on top of their armored vehicles and open fire with microwave guns on the American people.
[02:44:54.446 --> 02:45:00.391]  And I don't know if we can run around wearing wire mesh outfits to stop it.
[02:45:00.391 --> 02:45:02.853]  I've got mine.
[02:45:02.853 --> 02:45:07.898]  Well, I tell you, they start shooting at us with microwave guns.
[02:45:07.898 --> 02:45:10.820]  You know, it's time to take the gloves off.
[02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:11.501]  That's right.
[02:45:11.501 --> 02:45:13.142]  One last real quick thing.
[02:45:13.142 --> 02:45:18.367]  I told you last time I was doing a research paper on globalism versus cosmopolitanism, and I found this
[02:45:18.997 --> 02:45:23.540]  For some reason I decided to look up Epcot Center and I found this description of something that happens there every night.
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:33.687]  It's a pyrotechnic and laser show called Illuminations and it says, the description is, the show tells the story of Earth and is divided into three movements titled Chaos, Order, and Meaning.
[02:45:33.687 --> 02:45:39.451]  The music has an African tribal sound to it to emphasize the idea of humanity as a single unified tribe on this planet.
[02:45:39.451 --> 02:45:42.953]  The lagoon is surrounded by 20 large torches signifying the past 20 centuries.
[02:45:44.065 --> 02:45:51.511]  And the show culminates in the globe opening like a lotus blossom to reveal a 21st torch representing the new century.
[02:45:51.511 --> 02:45:54.673]  Sounds like total Illuminati propaganda.
[02:45:54.673 --> 02:45:55.114]  Yep.
[02:45:55.114 --> 02:45:56.195]  What play is this?
[02:45:56.195 --> 02:45:57.436]  What play is this?
[02:45:57.436 --> 02:46:02.540]  This is, I don't know if they still do it, but it's a, it's a, uh, the way they would close down Epcot Center.
[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:04.681]  Um, it's called Illumina-Nations.
[02:46:04.681 --> 02:46:07.183]  The Nations is capitalized, Illuminations.
[02:46:07.183 --> 02:46:10.306]  But it's kind of, it's a small world on steroids, I guess you'd say.
[02:46:11.002 --> 02:46:12.743]  How loving!
[02:46:12.743 --> 02:46:29.368]  A one-world tax, a one-world army, a one-child policy in accidental releases of bioweapons blamed on terrorists to reduce the population, just like Ted Turner and Bill Gates and Prince Philip and all of them want.
[02:46:29.368 --> 02:46:31.269]  Thank you for the call.
[02:46:31.269 --> 02:46:32.109]  Who's up next here?
[02:46:34.355 --> 02:46:37.257]  Frank in Brooklyn, you're on the air.
[02:46:37.257 --> 02:46:38.098]  Welcome.
[02:46:38.098 --> 02:46:39.439]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:46:39.439 --> 02:46:40.399]  How are you doing?
[02:46:40.399 --> 02:46:41.020]  Good.
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:45.123]  Very interesting guest this afternoon.
[02:46:45.123 --> 02:46:54.009]  I have one comment regarding the execution of what's his name?
[02:46:54.009 --> 02:46:54.649]  Tim McVeigh.
[02:46:54.649 --> 02:46:56.250]  Tim McVeigh.
[02:46:56.250 --> 02:47:01.654]  I remember reading Gore Vidal's article in Vanity Fair, you know, since he was a witness that
[02:47:04.253 --> 02:47:19.262]  Uh, sort of wrote about the execution as it happened and then after, but besides that, uh, what's the possibility that if this was a black op that he's, you know, somewhere else in the world with a new identity?
[02:47:21.070 --> 02:47:21.971]  I don't know.
[02:47:21.971 --> 02:47:31.663]  What I tend to think, from the evidence we have, is that he knew he was setting up Patsy's, he was setting up Nichols, and we went through that last week, and that they then set him up.
[02:47:31.663 --> 02:47:37.931]  That's their classic MO, like they set up Lee Harvey Oswald, and there is absolutely no
[02:47:38.783 --> 02:47:40.625]  Debating an Oswald with CIA.
[02:47:40.625 --> 02:47:41.345]  That's on record.
[02:47:41.345 --> 02:47:43.647]  We now have a CIA case number.
[02:47:43.647 --> 02:47:47.290]  Right, but he actually was executed, and that was televised.
[02:47:47.290 --> 02:47:48.031]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:48.031 --> 02:47:48.832]  He was killed.
[02:47:48.832 --> 02:47:50.233]  Yeah, they set him up.
[02:47:50.233 --> 02:47:53.936]  He was killed by Jack Ruby, and then, boy, you can see the cops.
[02:47:53.936 --> 02:47:56.038]  They walk him out, and they hold him up.
[02:47:56.038 --> 02:47:57.639]  Man, the cops have got a grimace.
[02:47:57.639 --> 02:47:59.481]  You know, the cops are getting ready for it.
[02:47:59.481 --> 02:48:03.004]  Dallas police, extremely corrupt back then, and even more so today.
[02:48:03.004 --> 02:48:03.504]  Of course.
[02:48:03.504 --> 02:48:06.547]  Now, the other comment I wanted to make was a story that broke
[02:48:07.142 --> 02:48:18.532]  Regarding the order CJCSI number 3610.01A, which was signed by Vice Admiral S.A.
[02:48:18.532 --> 02:48:34.365]  Fry, Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and it was done, I guess, on June 1st, 2001, which gave, which actually, instead of having NORAD protect the errors, it allowed the Defense Secretary Rumsfeld to do that.
[02:48:34.853 --> 02:48:45.276]  And it's rather interesting that with the trillions of dollars we have in our military in this country, that on 9-11, you know, NORAD did nothing.
[02:48:45.276 --> 02:48:51.257]  And now with the information coming out that actually it was in Rumsfeld's domain.
[02:48:51.257 --> 02:48:53.198]  Well, not just that order.
[02:48:53.198 --> 02:49:01.560]  The order was issued by the Vice President that no officers, flag or below, be able to be in the default to shoot down hijacked jets.
[02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:07.623]  Which had always been the default since 1957 when it was officially codified by the founding of NORAD.
[02:49:07.623 --> 02:49:21.112]  But previous to that, speaking of Gore Vidal, it was his father that actually set up the original, as the head of the Air Force, the original, well, then the Army Air Corps, the original plan on that.
[02:49:21.112 --> 02:49:28.196]  And that was because our government used errant, well, remote control weapons by Bobby Kennedy, Jr.
[02:49:30.743 --> 02:49:32.844]  The old man's, uh, Joseph Kennedy Jr.
[02:49:32.844 --> 02:49:41.870]  You know, his plane got shot down as he was remote controlling in a chase plane a B-17 loaded up as a cruise missile against Berlin.
[02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:45.553]  I think he lost and won the, uh, service stars for that.
[02:49:45.553 --> 02:49:45.873]  Yeah.
[02:49:45.873 --> 02:49:48.915]  For valiant, uh, action, or gallant action in the war.
[02:49:48.915 --> 02:49:50.876]  Now my question is this, Alex.
[02:49:50.876 --> 02:50:00.022]  It would seem now that a new investigation should occur regarding the malfeasance of Rumsfeld and actually the administration
[02:50:00.805 --> 02:50:07.287]  Because, you know, what I'm amazed at is none of this information came out in the official 9-11 report.
[02:50:07.287 --> 02:50:16.490]  And I think right now, this also would be worthwhile for impeachment and prosecution of Bush in his cabinet, but especially Rumsfeld.
[02:50:16.490 --> 02:50:19.151]  And I hear he still has a desk in the Defense Department.
[02:50:19.151 --> 02:50:20.112]  Yeah, he's still getting paid.
[02:50:20.112 --> 02:50:25.934]  He's still organizing policy regarding Iran and Iraq, which is an abomination.
[02:50:25.934 --> 02:50:27.834]  And that's really all I wanted to say, Alex.
[02:50:27.834 --> 02:50:28.895]  Okay, good to hear from you.
[02:50:28.895 --> 02:50:29.695]  I appreciate the call.
[02:50:30.541 --> 02:50:33.142]  We're going to come back and take a few final calls in the final segment.

[02:51:33.107 --> 02:51:38.930]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:38.930 --> 02:51:46.573]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.276 --> 02:51:54.719]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.719 --> 02:52:06.464]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.464 --> 02:52:10.426]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.426 --> 02:52:12.687]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.687 --> 02:52:16.529]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:54:24.688 --> 02:54:27.149]  All right, two final calls we've got time to go to.
[02:54:27.149 --> 02:54:31.070]  Doug in Tennessee and then Jeff.
[02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:32.830]  Go ahead Doug, you're on the air.
[02:54:32.830 --> 02:54:34.490]  Hey Alex, I appreciate what you do.
[02:54:34.490 --> 02:54:35.251]  Thank you.
[02:54:55.139 --> 02:54:57.359]  We know that every effect must have a cause, right?
[02:54:57.359 --> 02:54:57.920]  Yes.
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:03.201]  When it comes to Building 7, the effect is a symmetrical vertical collapse at free-fall speed.
[02:55:03.201 --> 02:55:04.721]  Now here's what we're supposed to believe.
[02:55:04.721 --> 02:55:12.682]  We're supposed to believe the damage caused by falling debris, which hit the southwest corner, is one of the causes.
[02:55:12.682 --> 02:55:16.123]  But yet that's asymmetrical damage.
[02:55:16.123 --> 02:55:20.664]  And then the structure of the building itself is radically asymmetrical.
[02:55:20.664 --> 02:55:22.604]  The thing was built on top of a Con Ed station.
[02:55:23.390 --> 02:55:23.690]  If you look
[02:55:39.398 --> 02:55:45.320]  That is, you'd have to have bombs under the main structure and then bombs on the superstructure on top of it.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:46.141]  Look, they blew it up.
[02:55:46.141 --> 02:55:47.942]  Classic controlled demolition.
[02:55:47.942 --> 02:55:50.002]  We have all the firefighters and police saying it.
[02:55:50.002 --> 02:55:52.483]  Then we have the newscast with a false start.
[02:55:52.483 --> 02:55:54.184]  It's just open and shut.
[02:55:54.184 --> 02:56:03.168]  And everybody who doesn't believe this really just needs to get the game Jenga and start playing with it and try to do a symmetrical vertical collapse.
[02:56:03.168 --> 02:56:04.688]  Explain that to people.
[02:56:04.688 --> 02:56:05.349]  Well, if you cause
[02:56:06.718 --> 02:56:21.398]  If you cause a failure on one corner or one side, which a fire would do, which a damage from free-falling debris from North Tower would do, you're going to get the thing toppling over and onto other buildings.
[02:56:22.412 --> 02:56:49.307]  and that's why you have to have control demolition falling in on its own footprint not even damaging the uh... federal uh... you know the main post office there that was twenty four feet away exactly this was a beautiful job it's undeniable you just have to look at the physics which are lost can you believe that the disarm info folks are on the dig dot com and other sites saying that it's fake video it isn't real i mean they're so delusional well i
[02:56:51.232 --> 02:56:59.037]  I sent a link to the video to everybody in my sent box that I ever sent mail to in the last five years when I do international business.
[02:56:59.037 --> 02:57:02.759]  So I hit about 30 people on Tuesday.
[02:57:02.759 --> 02:57:06.401]  And I got a reply back from one.
[02:57:06.401 --> 02:57:10.183]  Most of them, or I should say at least half of them, bounced.
[02:57:10.183 --> 02:57:11.724]  Since they're a lot of old emails.
[02:57:11.724 --> 02:57:16.907]  But everybody in the UK, which would be familiar with the BBC, and I asked them, since I don't watch BBC,
[02:57:17.905 --> 02:57:18.946]  Um, and I got a reply.
[02:57:18.946 --> 02:57:22.508]  The man in the newsroom is a regular newsreader for BBC.
[02:57:22.508 --> 02:57:32.834]  I don't recognize the woman, but I suppose she may be a reporter who isn't usually on camera, but as they couldn't fly anyone in to cover the situation, they had to use someone who is already there.
[02:57:32.834 --> 02:57:35.295]  I'm 100% sure it is authentic.
[02:57:35.295 --> 02:57:38.837]  I don't think that the newsreader would... No, no, it's admitted it's authentic.
[02:57:38.837 --> 02:57:39.458]  Look, we're out of time.
[02:57:39.458 --> 02:57:40.498]  Thanks for the call.
[02:57:40.498 --> 02:57:42.520]  Last caller here, Jeff in Kentucky.
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:42.860]  Go ahead.
[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:44.440]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:45.241]  Yes.
[02:57:45.241 --> 02:57:46.702]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:57:46.702 --> 02:57:58.368]  Just curious, you think you'll have somebody on the show in the future to talk about local economies and bottom-up governments like Ron Paul talks about, self-sufficiency, stuff like that?
[02:57:58.368 --> 02:58:01.289]  We have had guests on, but that's a very important subject.
[02:58:01.289 --> 02:58:12.855]  I'm just so busy trying to expose the fact that the government's staging terror attacks and about to start World War III, but we do tell people to get out of debt and get self-sufficient, and you don't have all the toys if you don't have the money for it.
[02:58:13.457 --> 02:58:14.457]  Absolutely.
[02:58:14.457 --> 02:58:15.778]  And another thing, the Dig.
[02:58:15.778 --> 02:58:21.420]  You've got Dig icons everywhere, and they're really a problem.
[02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:24.461]  Yeah, Dig's bad news, and we're going to expose them as a fraud.
[02:58:24.461 --> 02:58:25.301]  We've now proven it.
[02:58:25.301 --> 02:58:26.521]  They are a fraud.
[02:58:26.521 --> 02:58:27.822]  They are a lie.
[02:58:27.822 --> 02:58:29.262]  And then they control the whole thing.
[02:58:29.262 --> 02:58:30.403]  It's a fraud.
[02:58:30.403 --> 02:58:31.043]  Amen, brother.
[02:58:31.043 --> 02:58:31.903]  Freedom!
[02:58:31.903 --> 02:58:34.084]  Alright, take care.

[02:59:19.935 --> 02:59:27.760]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[02:59:27.760 --> 02:59:35.004]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:59:35.004 --> 02:59:46.932]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:59:46.932 --> 02:59:49.053]  Its multi-voltage capabilities, multiple
[02:59:49.073 --> 02:59:49.476]  We're good.
