[00:00.000 --> 00:28.880]  For a shaman of cuba's communist center committee delivered a message of anti-american invective.
[00:28.880 --> 00:34.880]  The theme of cuba's foreign policy. His audience included 500 students from Scandinavia, France
[00:34.880 --> 00:42.520]  and Britain. Some flower children. Many veterans of student riots in their homelands. They
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.000]  arrived on cut-rate charter flights and the living expenses were paid by the cuban government.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.280]  They spent their mornings working in the field. Their afternoons and political discussions.
[00:53.280 --> 00:54.960]  Their evenings like this.
[00:54.960 --> 00:59.560]  For American radicals, for American students, the most impressive feature of cuba will be
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.560]  the building of the 21st man. To be of the man of the 21st century. To build an entirely
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.440]  new consciousness. To change all of the old attitudes and to change the morality from
[01:11.440 --> 01:17.200]  one based in the individual eye and to put it into the collective we. Which much more
[01:17.200 --> 01:20.600]  enforces individuality than detracts from it.
[01:20.600 --> 01:25.760]  The people in the United States, particularly the young people, I think, look to the cuban
[01:25.760 --> 01:35.280]  revolution with hope that this offers a solution that the United States doesn't offer.
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.680]  They are crying out for freedom in the streets of Havana. This is the greatest show of discontent
[01:40.680 --> 01:47.080]  with the socialist government since the 1990s. Like back then, the trigger for this protest
[01:47.080 --> 01:53.040]  is the desperate economic situation right now. The country is suffering from food shortages.
[01:53.040 --> 01:58.520]  We are here because of the repression of the people. They are starving us to death. Havana
[01:58.520 --> 02:01.280]  is collapsing. We have no homes, nothing.
[02:01.280 --> 02:08.320]  Cubans are fed up as the Miami Herald reported in an unprecedented display of anger and frustration.
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.200]  Thousands of people took to the streets and cities and towns across Cuba to call for the
[02:13.200 --> 02:20.680]  end of the decades old dictatorship and demand food and vaccines as shortages of basic necessities
[02:20.680 --> 02:27.640]  have reached crisis proportions and COVID-19 cases have soared. Many took to the streets
[02:27.640 --> 02:33.040]  and chanted the name of a country that has long been a beacon for justice and freedom.
[02:33.040 --> 02:38.680]  But the New York Times responded by twisting the Cuban American Red Miami Herald with a
[02:38.680 --> 02:46.800]  probe to ask rewrite stating, shouting freedom and other anti-government slogans, hundreds
[02:46.800 --> 02:53.320]  of Cubans took to the streets around the country in a remarkable eruption of discontent not
[02:53.320 --> 02:55.600]  seen in 30 years.
[02:55.600 --> 03:02.600]  I'm speaking to you today because I have seen people like this before. I've seen movements
[03:02.600 --> 03:10.600]  like this before. I've seen ideas like this before. And I am here to tell you, we cannot
[03:10.600 --> 03:17.880]  let them take over our country. I heard the promises of Hidel Castro. And I can never
[03:17.880 --> 03:27.320]  forget all those who grew up around me, who looked like me, who suffered and starved and
[03:27.320 --> 03:28.320]  died.
[03:28.320 --> 03:34.720]  As the Cubans roar with shouts of down with communism, this is the socialist Democrat
[03:34.720 --> 03:42.040]  establishment's worst nightmare as a country under 56 years of communist control meets an
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.760]  inevitable turning point.
[03:43.760 --> 03:48.640]  We are not going to give up sovereignty or independence to the people or the freedom
[03:48.640 --> 03:55.240]  of this nation. And here I also ratify that we see many revolutionaries in this country,
[03:55.240 --> 03:58.760]  in this country that we are willing to give our lives. And that is not because of consignation,
[03:58.760 --> 04:06.600]  that is because of conviction. They have to go over our bodies if they want to face
[04:06.600 --> 04:07.800]  the revolution.
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.840]  Pivoting towards human independence, John Bowne reporting.
[04:12.840 --> 04:20.240]  I'm not going to take it anymore, ladies and gentlemen. That's communism fails again.
[04:20.240 --> 04:26.520]  Just went live at band.video. Hope you share it. You notice the New York Times is talking
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.920]  about how Cuba started censoring what internet they have there and cutting it off to control
[04:31.920 --> 04:32.920]  people.
[04:32.920 --> 04:38.160]  And it's a non satirical headline where they say, shouting freedom and other anti-government
[04:38.160 --> 04:43.560]  slogans. So freedom is an evil thing to shout, isn't it? When you're these type of evil folks
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.680]  that are trying to bring what they've done in Cuba here, but on steroids, some big developments
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.240]  are taking place. It's the biggest yet. When we come back, we're going to lay it all out.
[04:54.240 --> 05:01.880]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[05:01.880 --> 05:06.120]  We know that the satanic principalities of this planet want us poisoned. They want to
[05:06.120 --> 05:11.160]  attack our bodies. They want to kill us because we're made in the image of God. But God gave
[05:11.160 --> 05:17.000]  us the components of ourselves, of our bodies, to be strong. We've got everything we need.
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.440]  That's why the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine, bromide,
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.600]  you name it, instead of iodine. Our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is
[05:25.600 --> 05:30.040]  deficient and the average person is deficient. It attacks your IQ, it attacks your stamina
[05:30.040 --> 05:34.440]  and your libido and fertility particularly. Look into it. We have the purest iodine you're
[05:34.440 --> 05:38.480]  going to find anywhere on the planet in X2. And it's discounted right now with free shipping
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.320]  for 40% off in the dropper bottle. We have it for 60% off in the spray bottle. It's the
[05:42.320 --> 05:45.720]  exact same formula, but I want you to experience it yourself. If you've been on the fence about
[05:45.720 --> 05:51.080]  iodine, this is the best. Try it today. It takes about 15 days to kick in. It's exclusively
[05:51.080 --> 05:55.800]  available at infowarstore.com right now and it funds the M4. The only way you fail is
[05:55.800 --> 05:56.800]  not taking action.
[05:56.800 --> 06:18.160]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[06:50.760 --> 06:54.920]  We have no guests today other than Paul Joseph Watson in the fourth hour. I intend to cover
[06:54.920 --> 06:59.680]  the news and the developments in this war against humanity that we're chronicling and
[06:59.680 --> 07:04.320]  documenting and hopefully warning people and rallying people to resist. There have been
[07:04.320 --> 07:11.640]  a lot of just insane developments in everybody's face that are going viral right now and there
[07:11.640 --> 07:20.080]  is a giant awakening taking place. The big question is, is it happening fast enough?
[07:20.080 --> 07:26.680]  And a lot of this is just taking notice and caring. I got off here at two o'clock yesterday
[07:26.680 --> 07:31.680]  and one of our great writers, Kit Daniels, walked over and he said, look at this article
[07:31.680 --> 07:40.400]  out of Politico that came out days ago, but it's gotten zero attention and buried in it.
[07:40.400 --> 07:46.360]  It said, people are lying and saying Fauci wants to make vaccines mandatory, which he's
[07:46.360 --> 07:52.600]  announced, by the way, so they gas like you. The DNC and other think tank groups, the Southern
[07:52.600 --> 07:58.960]  Primary Law Center, ADL, they want to censor people's text messages in live time and they
[07:58.960 --> 08:05.440]  want to read them and watch everything that Americans say beyond the NSA, beyond the FBI.
[08:05.440 --> 08:14.800]  Oh, but it's a private company. It's AT&T. It's Verizon. It's Apple. It's Droid. It's
[08:14.800 --> 08:23.880]  both the phone manufacturers and the telecommunications providers. Just on a scale of 1 to 100 of
[08:23.880 --> 08:28.400]  surveillance and control, it's a 100. And we told you this was coming. We told you it
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.580]  was their holy grail. We have a clip we'll play in a moment of Oliver Darcy two years
[08:33.580 --> 08:40.360]  ago saying we need to censor Alex Jones' text messages. We should take away his ability
[08:40.360 --> 08:46.680]  to text message people. My children, my grown children, my wife, my parents, I need that
[08:46.680 --> 09:00.640]  taken away and everyone else needs to be surveilled. Let that sink in. Live time surveillance
[09:00.640 --> 09:06.160]  of your email and of your text messages. I want to explain something. Going back five
[09:06.160 --> 09:13.200]  years ago, Gmail already blocks info wars.com, the URL. And that happens at libraries, other
[09:13.200 --> 09:18.040]  places they put you in as false database as fake news or fraud. And of course they define
[09:18.040 --> 09:24.600]  anyone that resists them as that. But this really is the holy grail of control. So I'm
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.080]  glad that one of our writers read that article, thought it was important. It was just hidden
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.640]  in plain view. Socky talking to the press saying, yeah, we're getting ready to start.
[09:33.640 --> 09:38.040]  The DNC is, I guess their new national police force they've announced, that's actually
[09:38.040 --> 09:44.720]  who, and the Pentagon with trainees from the Southern Poverty Law Center in ADL to read
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.120]  all of your text messages, have them scanned by AI flag, and then they're going to block
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.800]  your ability to say certain things. And they're actually going to go into the autofill function
[09:54.800 --> 10:03.840]  and not let you type certain things even before it's been scanned when you try to send it.
[10:03.840 --> 10:10.080]  So this is the power of AI control. And I told you 10 years ago, their holy grail will
[10:10.080 --> 10:15.560]  be being able to ban certain voice prints. Well, now Facebook doesn't allow the uploading
[10:15.560 --> 10:22.040]  of any Trump clips period, unless it's by a handful of select control corporate media.
[10:22.040 --> 10:35.480]  So this is every nightmare authoritarian system that you could ever imagine. This is every
[10:35.480 --> 10:43.720]  system that a dictator of the past can only dream of. And it's here now. And so Kit Daniels
[10:43.720 --> 10:49.280]  and I wrote a story about it yesterday, I shot a special report on it. And it was posted
[10:49.280 --> 10:58.400]  in full wars.com. And then of course, the great Tucker Carlson led with it last night.
[10:58.400 --> 11:03.800]  And now it's all over the news today. And where is Congress? What are they doing about
[11:03.800 --> 11:08.920]  it? Here's some of the headlines breaking DNC announces plan to surveil and censor all
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.880]  American private text messages reports Politico. And of course, notice they first say, oh,
[11:13.880 --> 11:20.520]  just save lives with COVID. That's right. You can't talk about ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.360]  when they suppress cures, because they're criminals, big techs invested in big pharma.
[11:26.360 --> 11:32.120]  But really, then you read on it's Oh, an election disinfo, you know, we can't let Trump have
[11:32.120 --> 11:35.920]  his speeches on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube because, you know, you're not allowed to question
[11:35.920 --> 11:43.480]  the election. That's not something you're allowed to do. That's terrorism. Oh, and all
[11:43.480 --> 11:49.120]  the other information we want to load in now, you can't email or text message. And then
[11:49.120 --> 11:53.160]  they're trying to go after all the small companies and say, you've got to get on board with our
[11:53.160 --> 12:01.040]  fact checkers. This is a giant criminal mafia takeover. That is a trillion times literally
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.960]  worse than the Stasi because the Stasi would try to move in next to you and listen to you
[12:04.960 --> 12:08.480]  and get your neighbors to smile on you. And the FBI called for that last week, they said,
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.600]  let's find all your neighbors and see if somebody's criticizing the government. So see, we've
[12:13.600 --> 12:21.080]  gone off the edge of the cliff here. Breaking. DMC announced this plan to surveil and censor
[12:21.080 --> 12:27.240]  all Americans' private text messages reports political. You see, that's why M4s is so important.
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.400]  We care about them hiding things in plain view. We made a big deal about it. We triggered
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.080]  the chain reaction and it got out there. That's not about taking credit. It's about you realizing
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.480]  what you can do as well. They want to just normalize vaccine passports and implantable
[12:39.480 --> 12:44.640]  microchips and drag queen story time and all of this and just have you not get upset about
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.520]  it. And then it normalizes it. Well, we got upset about it. And now it's the top story
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.120]  in the country. That's why this platform is so key. That's what scares me is most of time
[12:53.120 --> 12:57.920]  it's us that breaks the big story that finds where they're rolling something out quietly
[12:57.920 --> 13:06.240]  and points it out. Democrat groups plan to fact check private SMS messages on all texting
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.520]  platforms. And that, of course, ladies and gentlemen, is the Southern Primary Law Center
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.160]  in ADL already reading everything you're doing. They're already inside. They just want to announce
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.040]  it and normalize it. It's already been happening. Here's the New York Post. DNC Biden allies
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.440]  want phone carriers to vet anti-vax messages. Oh, can't let the slaves. I mean, this is
[13:27.440 --> 13:31.640]  just like Cuba saying you can't protest. It's the same thing. It's just digital. What did
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.960]  the Canadian Health Minister, the head health minister say two weeks ago, he said, we can't
[13:35.960 --> 13:42.080]  ever in the martial law, people will protest our government. No speech is allowed offline.
[13:42.080 --> 13:49.400]  You're like, well, that's total authoritarianism. Yeah, they're just doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.840]  Here's another one out of the Gateway Pundit. Biden regime to monitor private communications,
[13:53.840 --> 13:59.360]  calls and private text message carriers to dispel information about vaccines. It's sent
[13:59.360 --> 14:07.680]  over social media and text messages. Here's the original Politico article quoting a press
[14:07.680 --> 14:12.040]  conference where they said, oh, we've got to stop the lies that this is forced or this
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.720]  is intimidation. Oh, we've got to stop them and election news. You know, we're trying
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.320]  to save you. Meanwhile, Fauci ran the lab, created the virus, covered up all the real
[14:23.320 --> 14:29.280]  treatments mean just openly should be in prison on death row right now. Here's Tucker Carlson,
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.160]  the great job last night covering it. Tucker Carlson, your private conversations will
[14:33.160 --> 14:39.400]  be controlled by the DNC. Here's the original article. Democrats and big tech plan to censor
[14:39.400 --> 14:45.320]  private text conversations, vaccines and elections. Breaking DNC announces plan to
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.640]  surveillance censor all Americans private text messages, reports Politico. Democrat
[14:50.640 --> 14:56.860]  group plans to fact check private SMS messages. Paul Watson, again, that means surveil you
[14:56.860 --> 15:01.040]  scan everything you're doing in your business, reading your mail. Oh, look who else is doing
[15:01.040 --> 15:08.120]  it? It's not a reason. USPS secret, semi secret internet surveillance apparatus is also on
[15:08.120 --> 15:12.240]  the street. Not worried about stolen goods. You're not worried about robberies of mail
[15:12.240 --> 15:20.880]  carriers. No, says right here on page two, that they are spying on protesters and anyone
[15:20.880 --> 15:29.280]  protesting the government. Domestically or internationally, it says right here, they're
[15:29.280 --> 15:36.760]  watching the evil patriots. Yes. Oh, it's better. The Capitol police that $2 billion
[15:36.760 --> 15:40.800]  extra they're spreading all over the country as a secret police. They say no for a request
[15:40.800 --> 15:47.560]  allowed the secret police to use army surveillance gear to monitor Americans. Oh, isn't that
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.440]  nice? So it's the total takeover for Marshall law. We're gonna play the clips when we come
[15:52.440 --> 15:56.760]  back and then get into the even bigger news. Straight ahead shock report. Wait till you
[15:56.760 --> 16:06.240]  hear it. Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.320]  person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know
[16:11.320 --> 16:15.760]  you're angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use
[16:15.760 --> 16:21.080]  every tool we've got. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show
[16:21.080 --> 16:25.960]  alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular
[16:25.960 --> 16:30.240]  shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know, take action now by texting
[16:30.240 --> 16:40.320]  the word news in EWS to 833-470-0438. That's 833-470-0438 for info or emergency news
[16:40.320 --> 16:48.160]  alerts or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications. Take

[17:01.240 --> 17:12.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[17:12.240 --> 17:37.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[17:37.240 --> 18:02.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[18:02.240 --> 18:27.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[18:27.240 --> 18:56.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[18:56.240 --> 19:21.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[19:21.240 --> 19:36.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[19:36.240 --> 19:40.240]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I've told you for more than a decade that
[19:40.240 --> 19:47.240]  the holy grail of control is live time corporate spying on you and your family with these home
[19:47.240 --> 19:55.240]  assistants, with the Amazon ring systems and others having that all wired in to corporations
[19:55.240 --> 19:59.240]  and the government to be able to totally control and run your life. And the fact that you have
[19:59.240 --> 20:05.240]  nothing to hide is not the issue. This is a predatory system that is saying you're obsolete,
[20:05.240 --> 20:10.240]  that you're not essential, that is going to use this information against you and do things
[20:10.240 --> 20:15.240]  like not let you tell people about ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, which the majority of
[20:15.240 --> 20:20.240]  the public got who were sick so they didn't die. So they weren't able to murder you.
[20:20.240 --> 20:26.240]  Fouchy, a eugenicist who helped carry out depopulation around the world, works directly with Bill Gates,
[20:26.240 --> 20:33.240]  is hopping piss that you're talking via text message and email and word of mouth.
[20:33.240 --> 20:37.240]  And so he said, I'm outraged that they're on CPAC saying don't trust the vaccine.
[20:37.240 --> 20:40.240]  Well, we've got articles out today. We'll be covering that segment.
[20:40.240 --> 20:48.240]  In the shock report, there were more COVID-19 vaccine deaths last week in the U.S. than COVID-19 deaths.
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.240]  That's an official number. FDA adds Guillain-Barre syndrome warning to Johnson & Johnson.
[20:53.240 --> 20:57.240]  We told you in the studies that already did that. We told you that a year and a half ago.
[20:57.240 --> 21:05.240]  Dad in hospital paralyzed by first COVID vaccine, continues receiving text about getting a second jab.
[21:05.240 --> 21:12.240]  All over the world, they're announcing a world ID and forced inoculation to be able to live your life.
[21:12.240 --> 21:18.240]  CNN's announcing they want that here. And you have to understand, they're going to do this by increment one way or the other
[21:18.240 --> 21:25.240]  until they are arrested. They're being elected through fraud.
[21:25.240 --> 21:31.240]  Merkel has been installed. Macron has been installed. Johnson got elected posing as a patriot.
[21:31.240 --> 21:36.240]  It's not as bad as they come in the U.K.
[21:36.240 --> 21:41.240]  And I'm going to cover that in the last segment of this hour.
[21:41.240 --> 21:50.240]  The fact that we are not in Kansas anymore, things are not going to get better until these people are arrested.
[21:50.240 --> 21:56.240]  This is not a normal political system we're fighting. This is a scientific, criminal takeover
[21:56.240 --> 22:05.240]  having press conferences with Jen Psaki saying the DNC is in talks with all text message providers
[22:05.240 --> 22:15.240]  to surveil what you do in live time and censor what you can say in your own damn private messages.
[22:15.240 --> 22:19.240]  Because they know and they complain. I've seen it on CNN.
[22:19.240 --> 22:29.240]  Oh, Bolsonaro got arrested using, excuse me, Bolsonaro got elected using WhatsApp.
[22:29.240 --> 22:35.240]  Even though he was censored off everything in Brazil, he was able to use online text messages.
[22:35.240 --> 22:42.240]  We can't let him do that. Or, oh, Alex Jones is using text messages.
[22:42.240 --> 22:50.240]  People are promoting via text message. We're reaching out to Facebook. Oliver Darcy said on CNN two years ago
[22:50.240 --> 22:57.240]  to see if he is using text messages to talk to people privately.
[22:57.240 --> 23:03.240]  And they reached out and found out I wasn't using it because I was already banned off of it.
[23:03.240 --> 23:10.240]  CNN talking about my private text messages and under this operation they've already got in place.
[23:10.240 --> 23:15.240]  It's come out that Twitter and Facebook and all of them are reading your private messages
[23:15.240 --> 23:19.240]  and Apple is reading your private messages and the droid companies are reading your private messages
[23:19.240 --> 23:26.240]  and your content providers are reading all of it. The different apps are spying on you.
[23:26.240 --> 23:33.240]  All of it is spying on you. And the major telecom providers and the cable companies
[23:33.240 --> 23:40.240]  and Netflix and Tivo, all of them. I remember when they first came out with DVRs.
[23:40.240 --> 23:46.240]  18, 19 years ago, I said these things are watching what you watch and recording a record of what you watch.
[23:46.240 --> 23:51.240]  And later they did things like erase the two episodes of Jesse Ventura that I was on,
[23:51.240 --> 23:55.240]  America Conspiracy, where I warned of all this and they admitted that they went in,
[23:55.240 --> 24:00.240]  Time Warner did, and erased the episodes off of people's DVRs without asking them.
[24:00.240 --> 24:06.240]  And it was in the Chicago Tribune. It was a big scandal that, wow, they don't want you to see this show.
[24:06.240 --> 24:15.240]  They erased it off the damn DVR. It's a technocracy, a total control system.
[24:15.240 --> 24:22.240]  And I'm going to explain, coming back, as we pose our curls and clip, what that means.
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.240]  It's like Domino's. You're like, oh, I don't care if I've done nothing wrong.
[24:26.240 --> 24:33.240]  Let them smile at me. That's taking you to a place of depopulation, of being locked down,
[24:33.240 --> 24:36.240]  of being sterilized, of being injected, of being given cancer.
[24:36.240 --> 24:41.240]  They're locking everybody down and putting Cuban-level censorship and control,
[24:41.240 --> 24:48.240]  Russian KGB-level control, East German control, because they got horrible things planned
[24:48.240 --> 24:56.240]  in the official database, more deaths from vaccines last week from the supposed COVID shot.
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.240]  We're going to cover that. Do you understand? They're making their move.
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.240]  And I told you they'd claim, oh, we're taking restrictions off,
[25:04.240 --> 25:08.240]  but they just put them right back on with more controls than before.
[25:08.240 --> 25:13.240]  And now that's being done exactly as I said, because it's an enemy plan.
[25:13.240 --> 25:18.240]  And only by admitting that and organizing legislatures and governors and society
[25:18.240 --> 25:22.240]  and shunning corporations and businesses that are the first to try to bully us in
[25:22.240 --> 25:24.240]  for these vaccine passports, can we stop them?
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.240]  Because once they get their World ID, that thing's going to tell you under a carbon rationing tax
[25:29.240 --> 25:34.240]  where you can go, what you can do, what you can eat, who you can live with, everything.
[25:34.240 --> 25:37.240]  They admit that's the plan.
[25:37.240 --> 25:42.240]  This global internet ID is for social credit control.
[25:42.240 --> 25:44.240]  It is for surveillance.
[25:44.240 --> 25:47.240]  And it's all being shoehorned in under the name of COVID.
[25:47.240 --> 25:53.240]  Oh, we're going to read your text messages and censor them for COVID and elections and other news.
[25:53.240 --> 25:58.240]  Just bombshell over the top, unprecedented.
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.240]  Hitler on steroids.
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.240]  And here they are, almost two years ago, talking about what it's really all about,
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.240]  silencing their number one enemy who's aware of their criminal activity,
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.240]  because if everybody ever figures out that what I'm telling you is their real plan,
[26:14.240 --> 26:16.240]  not my opinion, it's game over.
[26:16.240 --> 26:19.240]  They're taking you to a hellish dystopia.
[26:19.240 --> 26:22.240]  Here's CNN from two years ago.
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.240]  We'll be banning Alex Jones and Infowars from not only their main platform, Facebook,
[26:27.240 --> 26:28.240]  but also from Instagram.
[26:28.240 --> 26:31.240]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp,
[26:31.240 --> 26:33.240]  which is also owned by Facebook.
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.240]  And a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.240]  whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts.
[26:40.240 --> 26:43.240]  Yeah, you can't let people have private text messages accounts.
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.240]  I mean, what's next?
[26:44.240 --> 26:46.240]  Like, are they allowed to even have a house or children?
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.240]  Maybe own a gun?
[26:47.240 --> 26:50.240]  I mean, next they're going to want to be able to rally or demonstrate.
[26:50.240 --> 26:51.240]  You can't do that.
[26:51.240 --> 26:56.240]  I mean, that'll overturn the regime, just like Cuba.
[26:56.240 --> 26:57.240]  And there's a whole other one.
[26:57.240 --> 27:01.240]  We can't find the clip with him with Brian Stelter where they talk about,
[27:01.240 --> 27:04.240]  yeah, Bolsonaro got elected with text messages.
[27:04.240 --> 27:07.240]  Yeah, Alex Jones is getting around us.
[27:07.240 --> 27:08.240]  His fans are spreading the words.
[27:08.240 --> 27:10.240]  He's still on air via text message.
[27:10.240 --> 27:12.240]  We've just got to get in those text messages.
[27:12.240 --> 27:15.240]  We just, you know, you know, you're right.
[27:15.240 --> 27:18.240]  Brian Stelter says, Oliver, we've just got to get in that private email
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.240]  and those text messages.
[27:19.240 --> 27:21.240]  Yeah, we're the good guys.
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.240]  We can't let those dirty Americans talk.
[27:23.240 --> 27:26.240]  Yeah, we got to shut them up right now.
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.240]  Don't worry.
[27:27.240 --> 27:28.240]  We will, though.
[27:28.240 --> 27:29.240]  They're the bad guys.
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.240]  And then I saw him the hallway in DC and said, how dare you try to take my speech
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.240]  and Twitter said, that's it.
[27:35.240 --> 27:36.240]  You're finally completely banned.
[27:36.240 --> 27:38.240]  You were mean to Oliver Darcy.
[27:38.240 --> 27:40.240]  You're not even allowed to criticize him.
[27:40.240 --> 27:43.240]  A good little censor that wants to read your text messages and censor you.
[27:43.240 --> 27:50.240]  He's a hero like Chilchescu or Hitler or Stalin or Mao or O'Brien in 1984.
[27:50.240 --> 27:52.240]  Alex Jones is a bad man.
[27:52.240 --> 27:54.240]  He doesn't want you to read everybody's text messages.
[27:54.240 --> 27:57.240]  He wants you to have privacy, a bad man.
[27:57.240 --> 28:01.240]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.240]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[28:05.240 --> 28:08.240]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.240]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[28:13.240 --> 28:18.240]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[28:18.240 --> 28:25.240]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[28:25.240 --> 28:31.240]  Get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[28:31.240 --> 28:33.240]  I need your help more than ever now.
[28:33.240 --> 28:37.240]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[28:37.240 --> 28:42.240]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[28:42.240 --> 28:48.240]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.240]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.240]  All of it empowers humanity. All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[28:57.240 --> 28:59.240]  Thank you so much.
[28:59.240 --> 29:05.240]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido for life.
[29:05.240 --> 29:09.240]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[29:09.240 --> 29:11.240]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[29:11.240 --> 29:13.240]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.240]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[29:15.240 --> 29:17.240]  But what's in that food? Iodine.
[29:17.240 --> 29:23.240]  If your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate, and the food itself is lacking.
[29:23.240 --> 29:26.240]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine,
[29:26.240 --> 29:31.240]  and governments are lowering the allowance you're supposedly going to need to have because they want control.
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful. Our products are just as powerful.
[29:35.240 --> 29:41.240]  Experience clean iodine today. It's discounted 40% off in the dropper bottle, 60% off in the spray bottle.

[29:54.240 --> 29:58.240]  Take action. Find out what you're missing. Get the missing link. Get X2.
[29:58.240 --> 30:07.240]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[30:07.240 --> 30:11.240]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[30:11.240 --> 30:16.240]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power.
[30:16.240 --> 30:23.240]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[30:23.240 --> 30:31.240]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated. They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[30:31.240 --> 30:40.240]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long. We've got a private label with info wars on them for $14.95
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.240]  because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family, these systems,
[30:44.240 --> 30:48.240]  to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.240]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use. It's a great way to spend more time with your family
[30:52.240 --> 30:56.240]  and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[30:56.240 --> 31:11.240]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[31:26.240 --> 31:34.240]  Info wars, because there's a war on for your mind. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[31:34.240 --> 31:41.240]  I intend to open the phones up in the second and third hour today and I intend, if not in the next segment,
[31:41.240 --> 31:47.240]  at the start of the next hour, to explain exactly how they're going to close the net,
[31:47.240 --> 31:54.240]  the noose around our necks and slowly destroy us in the next few years and just what the world's going to look like
[31:54.240 --> 32:01.240]  then if we don't turn this around. I would suggest you record this because if we're unable to stop them
[32:01.240 --> 32:06.240]  very soon, the next six months to a year, we're not going to be on the air anymore
[32:06.240 --> 32:11.240]  and that's going to be a major canary in the coal mine really for the end of this phase
[32:11.240 --> 32:16.240]  and then it's going to be a much, much darker, long, horrible future for humanity.
[32:16.240 --> 32:20.240]  I've really tried to warn everybody as best I could. I've done the research.
[32:20.240 --> 32:27.240]  I've had the experts on. I've studied the globalist and this is a forced dystopic takeover
[32:27.240 --> 32:34.240]  that is designed to bring us into a depopulation position. It is a post-industrial world.
[32:34.240 --> 32:43.240]  What do you think a post-industrial world is going to look like? It's going to look like Mad Max meets THX1138.
[32:43.240 --> 32:51.240]  Poor starving people that are massively decimated with no medicine or healthcare living as slaves
[32:51.240 --> 32:58.240]  in the ruins of cities in some rural areas with high-tech globalist command bases
[32:58.240 --> 33:04.240]  with super technology above the law. That is their stated goal is to collapse the nation state
[33:04.240 --> 33:09.240]  under global government and then have the rise of nation states.
[33:09.240 --> 33:14.240]  Excuse me, that's a Freudian slip. We need nation states. The rise of city states
[33:14.240 --> 33:19.240]  controlled by the globalists like the Vatican, like Israel, like the Club of Rome
[33:19.240 --> 33:24.240]  is pushed for with the city of London, within London. So there is the headline.
[33:24.240 --> 33:36.240]  The globalists must be arrested and their system dismantled now or billions will die.
[33:36.240 --> 33:43.240]  Now you understand tens of millions of already starved to death on top of who would already
[33:43.240 --> 33:47.240]  starve to death each year. You understand the third world is completely collapsing
[33:47.240 --> 33:51.240]  and the UN is organizing it into giant migrant flows to invade and take us over.
[33:51.240 --> 34:00.240]  You understand crime has literally doubled and tripled and quadrupled all over the world.
[34:00.240 --> 34:05.240]  This isn't a zombie apocalypse movie. This is the controlled demolition of the planet
[34:05.240 --> 34:10.240]  and the New World Order is on the news saying it's all being done because of climate change
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.240]  or it's all being done because of racism or it's all being done because of that.
[34:14.240 --> 34:21.240]  No, it's being done by them purposely carrying out a global lockdown that they knew would take
[34:21.240 --> 34:26.240]  half the world population into starvation within one year of a lockdown
[34:26.240 --> 34:34.240]  and they've only increased it now in Africa and India and other areas.
[34:34.240 --> 34:39.240]  It is a time bomb that is a chain reaction of time bombs
[34:39.240 --> 34:43.240]  and we've already seen the first few bombs go off and now like dominoes falling
[34:43.240 --> 34:50.240]  it's only going to get more intense. So this morning I've got my parents coming over for dinner tonight
[34:50.240 --> 34:55.240]  and they're smart but I'm just going to tell them like all bets are off
[34:55.240 --> 35:00.240]  and we need to have a discussion about how we protect ourselves at this point
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.240]  because we tried to stop the New World Order takeover, we tried to stop Operation Lockstep
[35:05.240 --> 35:09.240]  we tried to stop the initiation of this, they did it anyways.
[35:09.240 --> 35:15.240]  And I'll explain coming up shortly the next hour why but just to give you a little prelude
[35:15.240 --> 35:18.240]  they had to because we exposed their long term strategic plan.
[35:18.240 --> 35:20.240]  They were always going to do what they're doing now.
[35:20.240 --> 35:23.240]  They were planning to launch it around 2030 instead of now
[35:23.240 --> 35:27.240]  but because nationalists were taking back all these countries around the world
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.240]  they went ahead and accelerated their program.
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.240]  And so they're all in, they're committed and they don't care now.
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.240]  That's what you've got to understand, they're not going to stop
[35:37.240 --> 35:43.240]  and I want to just go ahead and get this out now.
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.240]  They always plan to release bio weapons if we tried to overthrow them.
[35:47.240 --> 35:53.240]  They always plan to use race specific weapons if any type of populist or Christian group
[35:53.240 --> 35:58.240]  or nationalist group ever got control of enough countries to challenge their world government plan.
[35:58.240 --> 36:01.240]  And they were always planning the depopulation regardless later
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.240]  once they thought they had us under their thumb and could do it in orderly fashion
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.240]  but they will do it in a disorderly fashion in an attempt to maintain control
[36:09.240 --> 36:11.240]  so they're going to kill you one way or the other.
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.240]  They're going to murder you and your family one way or another it's for a stated plan.
[36:15.240 --> 36:18.240]  The question is are you going to let them do it on their timetable in 10 years
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.240]  and succeed or you'll make them do it next year or maybe next month
[36:22.240 --> 36:26.240]  because people are going to know when your wife and your kids are flopping around dying
[36:26.240 --> 36:29.240]  with a real bio weapon or they hit you with drones with chemical weapons
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.240]  if you survive just remember you can live to fight, defeat these people
[36:33.240 --> 36:35.240]  because later you're going to know you're back against the wall.
[36:35.240 --> 36:37.240]  We're going to beat them later.
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.240]  We're going to dig them out of their armored redoubts, we're going to hunt them down.
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.240]  But I'm just telling you I'm probably obviously not going to be there, that's okay.
[36:45.240 --> 36:48.240]  I'm expending my full force against them now
[36:48.240 --> 36:51.240]  and I'm not going to pull punches, I'm not going to mention words here
[36:51.240 --> 36:53.240]  because you know what's going to happen.
[36:53.240 --> 36:55.240]  I'm not stupid, you're not either.
[36:55.240 --> 37:00.240]  You know as all this happens that I'm going to go from credible to ultra-credible
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.240]  and they're not going to allow me to be walking around very soon.
[37:03.240 --> 37:08.240]  But that's okay because I've lived a life of resistance
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.240]  and I can stand before God and say I want to know you.
[37:13.240 --> 37:20.240]  I want to be a good spirit and I've tried to be good, please let me be with you
[37:20.240 --> 37:22.240]  and that's all I care about.
[37:22.240 --> 37:25.240]  I'm not worried about these globalists and their private jets and their money
[37:25.240 --> 37:28.240]  and their mistresses and their power and oh they're going to live forever
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.240]  and oh they're going to merge with machines and oh they're going to be gods and all this.
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.240]  And I had hoped that they were just beta testing
[37:35.240 --> 37:37.240]  and that this was just to get control
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.240]  and that they didn't really have the will to go all the way through with it.
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.240]  They're going all the way through with Masty Population.
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.240]  Bill Gates and Ted Turner and David Rockefeller and Oprah Winfrey have all signed on to
[37:50.240 --> 37:53.240]  and Prince Charles and Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth
[37:53.240 --> 37:59.240]  and every damn spanking one of them have signed on to a plan to depopulate the world 90%.
[37:59.240 --> 38:04.240]  And they're going to pose as the UN medical saviors protecting you from the bio weapons
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.240]  and the chemical weapons and the radiological weapons and the electromagnetic weapons
[38:08.240 --> 38:10.240]  that they're going to be killing us all with
[38:10.240 --> 38:13.240]  and their weather weapons to starve us to death and all the rest of it.
[38:13.240 --> 38:17.240]  I'm getting to it now but I'm going to get to it next hour as well.
[38:17.240 --> 38:20.240]  So I mean imagine if I told you 10 years ago which I did
[38:20.240 --> 38:22.240]  that have the archivist looking up.
[38:22.240 --> 38:25.240]  I mean don't go too crazy but just get 10 clips.
[38:25.240 --> 38:28.240]  And I know for more than 10 years I've told you
[38:28.240 --> 38:31.240]  you'll know they're about to take over when they start saying
[38:31.240 --> 38:34.240]  we're going to read your text messages in live time with AI
[38:34.240 --> 38:36.240]  and control what you can say and what you do
[38:36.240 --> 38:38.240]  and if you send text messages we don't like
[38:38.240 --> 38:41.240]  we'll take away your texting capability
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.240]  with a social credit score.
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.240]  And I told you all that and now it's here.
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.240]  So on a scale of 1 to 100 of tyranny
[38:51.240 --> 38:54.240]  what they've got in place is a 100
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.240]  in the realm of surveillance and the potential for control.
[38:58.240 --> 39:01.240]  Now all they've got to do is implement the next phase
[39:01.240 --> 39:04.240]  which is the rounding up and the killing and the starving us to death
[39:04.240 --> 39:06.240]  and that's why we've all been told we're non-essential.
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.240]  I mean this is very draconian
[39:09.240 --> 39:12.240]  and the public is so in a daze and so drunk on entertainment
[39:12.240 --> 39:14.240]  they're not going to know what hit them
[39:14.240 --> 39:17.240]  but I personally am going to try to persevere
[39:17.240 --> 39:19.240]  as long as God wants to keep us on air
[39:19.240 --> 39:21.240]  and that's up to you how long you want to keep us on air.
[39:21.240 --> 39:23.240]  But I mean we could be on air a month, six months a year
[39:23.240 --> 39:25.240]  people could wake up, governors could wake up,
[39:25.240 --> 39:27.240]  legislators could wake up, people could organize
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.240]  we can see this monstrosity for it is
[39:30.240 --> 39:32.240]  Fauci could be arrested, Bill Gates could be arrested
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.240]  they ran the Wuhan lab, they suppressed all these treatments
[39:35.240 --> 39:37.240]  they worked with big tech to suppress treatments
[39:37.240 --> 39:39.240]  so they would make quote more money off their vaccines
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.240]  they sent sick people into nursing homes to get a higher death rate
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.240]  they denied people treatment that had pneumonia and
[39:46.240 --> 39:48.240]  flu so they get a higher death rate
[39:48.240 --> 39:50.240]  and it was all battle planned out
[39:50.240 --> 39:52.240]  but if we're going to let them sit there and kill us
[39:52.240 --> 39:54.240]  we're going to let them get away with all this murder
[39:54.240 --> 39:57.240]  they're going to go ahead with the plan.
[39:57.240 --> 40:00.240]  Let's put that headline back up there
[40:00.240 --> 40:02.240]  the globalist must be arrested
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.240]  and their system dismantled now
[40:05.240 --> 40:07.240]  our billions will die
[40:07.240 --> 40:08.240]  period
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.240]  now see
[40:09.240 --> 40:11.240]  we're at the point where I told you
[40:11.240 --> 40:13.240]  everything that's happened up until now years before
[40:13.240 --> 40:14.240]  exactly as it would happen
[40:14.240 --> 40:15.240]  it's all a new study of them
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.240]  we're not going to be here next time
[40:17.240 --> 40:18.240]  you understand?
[40:18.240 --> 40:20.240]  to tell you once this goes through
[40:20.240 --> 40:23.240]  your wife, your children, you are dead
[40:23.240 --> 40:24.240]  you're dead
[40:24.240 --> 40:26.240]  you understand? they're going to kill you
[40:26.240 --> 40:28.240]  and I can explain how they've already done it
[40:28.240 --> 40:30.240]  half the countrymen that have taken this shot
[40:30.240 --> 40:31.240]  aren't going to be here in a couple years
[40:31.240 --> 40:32.240]  which is why again
[40:32.240 --> 40:34.240]  they're not going to let us organize against that
[40:34.240 --> 40:37.240]  before they figure out they're all dead
[40:37.240 --> 40:39.240]  they're going to hit us with something much better
[40:39.240 --> 40:40.240]  so I'm just telling you
[40:40.240 --> 40:41.240]  it's all over
[40:41.240 --> 40:43.240]  almost every FBI agent
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.240]  almost every school teacher
[40:45.240 --> 40:47.240]  almost every auto mechanic farmer listening to me
[40:47.240 --> 40:49.240]  you're all dead
[40:49.240 --> 40:51.240]  they're coming to kill you
[40:51.240 --> 40:52.240]  period
[40:52.240 --> 40:54.240]  they've already killed half the country
[40:54.240 --> 40:55.240]  we have been slaughtered
[40:55.240 --> 40:56.240]  we have been murdered
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.240]  X2 has been our number one bestseller
[40:59.240 --> 41:00.240]  over the years
[41:00.240 --> 41:02.240]  deep earth crystal iodine
[41:02.240 --> 41:04.240]  the good halogen in its essential
[41:04.240 --> 41:06.240]  for all actions in the body
[41:06.240 --> 41:07.240]  you must have it to live
[41:07.240 --> 41:09.240]  the UN estimates 2 billion plus people
[41:09.240 --> 41:10.240]  have cognitive disabilities
[41:10.240 --> 41:11.240]  because they don't have it in iodine
[41:11.240 --> 41:13.240]  we have X2 in two different bottles
[41:13.240 --> 41:15.240]  same amount in each bottle
[41:15.240 --> 41:16.240]  but one has a spray top
[41:16.240 --> 41:17.240]  one has a dropper top
[41:17.240 --> 41:19.240]  60% off on the spray top
[41:19.240 --> 41:22.240]  40% off on the dropper top
[41:22.240 --> 41:23.240]  for a limited time
[41:23.240 --> 41:24.240]  because they're both selling out
[41:24.240 --> 41:26.240]  I want to thank all the supporters
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.240]  that have gotten these over the years
[41:27.240 --> 41:28.240]  they're amazing
[41:28.240 --> 41:30.240]  so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it
[41:30.240 --> 41:32.240]  but this deal is really for folks
[41:32.240 --> 41:33.240]  that have been on the fence
[41:33.240 --> 41:34.240]  and haven't experienced
[41:34.240 --> 41:35.240]  the good halogen for yourself
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.240]  so X2 in the dropper bottle
[41:37.240 --> 41:38.240]  and the spray bottle
[41:38.240 --> 41:40.240]  60 and 40% off for a limited time
[41:40.240 --> 41:42.240]  because it's selling out right now
[41:42.240 --> 41:43.240]  at infowarstore.com
[41:43.240 --> 41:44.240]  but we're going to keep this cell going
[41:44.240 --> 41:45.240]  until it sells out
[41:45.240 --> 41:47.240]  probably take about two weeks

[44:25.240 --> 44:27.240]  and for the rest of the world
[44:27.240 --> 44:29.240]  that the UN will use as a weapon
[44:29.240 --> 44:31.240]  to then have us under such a crisis
[44:31.240 --> 44:32.240]  under such a load
[44:32.240 --> 44:34.240]  capitulate to the UN
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.240]  whatever agreements they want us to sign
[44:36.240 --> 44:38.240]  hoping that they will stop the blood
[44:38.240 --> 44:40.240]  of tens of millions of refugees
[44:40.240 --> 44:41.240]  not fleeing COVID
[44:41.240 --> 44:43.240]  or climate change
[44:43.240 --> 44:45.240]  as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying
[44:45.240 --> 44:46.240]  and Bill Gates are saying
[44:46.240 --> 44:49.240]  but fleeing the year long lockdowns
[44:49.240 --> 44:50.240]  that the UN and Bill Gates
[44:50.240 --> 44:52.240]  ordered them to institute
[44:52.240 --> 44:53.240]  or they wouldn't get more
[44:53.240 --> 44:54.240]  IMF
[44:54.240 --> 44:55.240]  than money
[44:55.240 --> 44:56.240]  and that's why
[44:56.240 --> 44:57.240]  we have to really get educated
[44:57.240 --> 44:59.240]  about the globalist
[45:15.240 --> 45:17.240]  Ah, the good old days
[45:17.240 --> 45:19.240]  Adam LaGrange
[45:19.240 --> 45:20.240]  the ranch
[45:20.240 --> 45:21.240]  the chicken ranch
[45:21.240 --> 45:23.240]  the whorehouse
[45:23.240 --> 45:25.240]  T.C. Top
[45:26.240 --> 45:28.240]  they got some nice girls
[45:34.240 --> 45:36.240]  right down the road from Austin
[45:42.240 --> 45:43.240]  none of them kidnapped though
[45:43.240 --> 45:44.240]  that are 15
[45:44.240 --> 45:46.240]  like
[45:46.240 --> 45:47.240]  Mr. Branson
[45:47.240 --> 45:49.240]  and Lolita Express
[45:49.240 --> 45:53.240]  and all of the Clintons
[46:01.240 --> 46:03.240]  alright let's get serious
[46:03.240 --> 46:06.240]  you understand this is a depopulation plan
[46:06.240 --> 46:08.240]  and they have it all wargamed out
[46:08.240 --> 46:10.240]  each phase to clamp down
[46:10.240 --> 46:11.240]  take more liberties
[46:11.240 --> 46:13.240]  then open it up a little bit
[46:13.240 --> 46:14.240]  convince you that going along
[46:14.240 --> 46:15.240]  with the world ID
[46:15.240 --> 46:17.240]  and the force inoculation
[46:17.240 --> 46:19.240]  the implantable microchip
[46:19.240 --> 46:20.240]  that they're now announcing
[46:20.240 --> 46:22.240]  that you'll be free once you do that
[46:22.240 --> 46:23.240]  and then oh sorry
[46:23.240 --> 46:24.240]  you're not free
[46:24.240 --> 46:26.240]  there's more you've got to do
[46:26.240 --> 46:27.240]  and then once they've got you trained
[46:27.240 --> 46:29.240]  to go into real martial law
[46:29.240 --> 46:30.240]  then they're going to start
[46:30.240 --> 46:31.240]  the real depopulation
[46:31.240 --> 46:32.240]  but they need to make sure
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.240]  you behave yourselves
[46:33.240 --> 46:36.240]  while they're killing you
[46:36.240 --> 46:38.240]  this is all beta
[46:38.240 --> 46:40.240]  and I'm going to explain again
[46:40.240 --> 46:41.240]  they didn't spend trillions of dollars
[46:41.240 --> 46:43.240]  and set up world government
[46:43.240 --> 46:45.240]  for the express mission of depopulation
[46:45.240 --> 46:48.240]  they don't do it
[46:48.240 --> 46:50.240]  and I know it's horrible
[46:50.240 --> 46:51.240]  listen
[46:51.240 --> 46:53.240]  I'm having trouble coming to grips with this
[46:53.240 --> 46:54.240]  I can't believe they're actually
[46:54.240 --> 46:55.240]  going ahead with it either
[46:55.240 --> 46:58.240]  and my wife and family
[46:58.240 --> 46:59.240]  want to go to movies
[46:59.240 --> 47:00.240]  they want to go out on the boat
[47:00.240 --> 47:01.240]  they want to have fun
[47:01.240 --> 47:03.240]  I can't even do it anymore
[47:03.240 --> 47:05.240]  because I know the timetable
[47:05.240 --> 47:06.240]  it's like we've all been given
[47:06.240 --> 47:08.240]  death sentences of a month
[47:08.240 --> 47:09.240]  six months a year
[47:09.240 --> 47:12.240]  two years
[47:12.240 --> 47:14.240]  I've got hundreds of articles here
[47:14.240 --> 47:15.240]  and a secret arrest
[47:15.240 --> 47:16.240]  tortured death
[47:16.240 --> 47:17.240]  no free speech
[47:17.240 --> 47:19.240]  collapsing countries
[47:19.240 --> 47:21.240]  all these presidents
[47:21.240 --> 47:22.240]  now it's four of them
[47:22.240 --> 47:24.240]  that didn't allow forced inoculation
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.240]  they've all been killed
[47:28.240 --> 47:29.240]  I just watched Dick Durbin
[47:29.240 --> 47:31.240]  in the coffee room
[47:31.240 --> 47:34.240]  Rob did grab in the clip
[47:34.240 --> 47:35.240]  have a Freudian slip
[47:35.240 --> 47:36.240]  and say that the vaccines
[47:36.240 --> 47:37.240]  already killed millions
[47:37.240 --> 47:39.240]  we're going to get that clip in a moment
[47:39.240 --> 47:40.240]  let me get to the Tucker Carlson thing
[47:40.240 --> 47:41.240]  and then I'm going to settle down
[47:41.240 --> 47:43.240]  and actually lay out
[47:43.240 --> 47:44.240]  I've said I'm going to lay out
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.240]  their master plan
[47:45.240 --> 47:46.240]  and I've done it to a certain extent
[47:46.240 --> 47:47.240]  but I really want to go through
[47:47.240 --> 47:49.240]  the intricacies of this
[47:49.240 --> 47:50.240]  so that you understand
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.240]  that I'm not blowing smoke at you
[47:51.240 --> 47:52.240]  and I know you know that
[47:52.240 --> 47:54.240]  but I mean
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.240]  I don't want to say these things
[47:56.240 --> 47:57.240]  and it hurts me really bad
[47:57.240 --> 47:59.240]  to say these things
[47:59.240 --> 48:01.240]  and I'll tell you why it hurts me
[48:01.240 --> 48:03.240]  I don't like admitting it's real to myself
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.240]  and I want to explain something to you
[48:05.240 --> 48:07.240]  when I put out headlines like
[48:07.240 --> 48:08.240]  the globalists must be arrested
[48:08.240 --> 48:09.240]  and their system is dismantled now
[48:09.240 --> 48:11.240]  our billions will die
[48:11.240 --> 48:13.240]  that moves at one second
[48:13.240 --> 48:14.240]  closer on the clock
[48:14.240 --> 48:16.240]  for them to smash me flatter than a pancake
[48:16.240 --> 48:17.240]  and I'm a tough guy
[48:17.240 --> 48:18.240]  I got a lot of courage
[48:18.240 --> 48:19.240]  I'm not going to back down
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.240]  but I don't enjoy
[48:21.240 --> 48:23.240]  messing with these people
[48:23.240 --> 48:25.240]  this isn't some macho exercise
[48:25.240 --> 48:26.240]  for me to sit up here
[48:26.240 --> 48:27.240]  and poke these people
[48:27.240 --> 48:29.240]  they're attacking us
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.240]  they're not going to stop
[48:30.240 --> 48:32.240]  and the God I follow
[48:32.240 --> 48:35.240]  spiritually tells me to fight them
[48:37.240 --> 48:39.240]  and God's pissed off at me right now
[48:39.240 --> 48:41.240]  that I'm not doing enough
[48:43.240 --> 48:45.240]  and I don't know how the rest of you
[48:45.240 --> 48:47.240]  are even operating
[48:47.240 --> 48:48.240]  I know a lot of you are pissed off
[48:48.240 --> 48:49.240]  but man
[48:49.240 --> 48:51.240]  we are being assaulted
[48:51.240 --> 48:53.240]  our laws are all being violated
[48:53.240 --> 48:54.240]  every canon of basic freedom
[48:54.240 --> 48:56.240]  is being crapped on
[48:56.240 --> 48:58.240]  you know yesterday
[48:58.240 --> 49:00.240]  somewhere here in my stack
[49:00.240 --> 49:02.240]  I covered the
[49:04.240 --> 49:07.240]  rainbow dildo butt monkey
[49:07.240 --> 49:09.240]  and I saw comments and things
[49:09.240 --> 49:11.240]  and people thinking I made that up
[49:11.240 --> 49:13.240]  I didn't read half of it
[49:13.240 --> 49:15.240]  the man had a fake penis on
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.240]  with a fake butt naked
[49:18.240 --> 49:20.240]  with a fake vagina hanging down
[49:20.240 --> 49:21.240]  like a turkey gobbler
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.240]  and a fake women's breast
[49:23.240 --> 49:25.240]  I wouldn't even show it on air
[49:25.240 --> 49:26.240]  and little kids came up
[49:26.240 --> 49:28.240]  and sat on the dildo
[49:28.240 --> 49:30.240]  at the library
[49:30.240 --> 49:31.240]  so you see it's worse
[49:31.240 --> 49:33.240]  than what I just told you
[49:33.240 --> 49:34.240]  you want me to show it to you?
[49:34.240 --> 49:36.240]  our TV stations will take us off air
[49:36.240 --> 49:38.240]  it's not fit for adults to see
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.240]  it's only God for five year olds
[49:40.240 --> 49:42.240]  you think they're funding that on purpose
[49:42.240 --> 49:44.240]  because they're playing freaking games?
[49:46.240 --> 49:48.240]  these people ain't playing games
[49:48.240 --> 49:50.240]  they're gonna kill everybody
[49:52.240 --> 49:54.240]  they don't show the bottom
[49:56.240 --> 49:58.240]  governments and men
[49:58.240 --> 50:00.240]  with fake genitals hanging down
[50:00.240 --> 50:01.240]  and plastic butts
[50:01.240 --> 50:02.240]  and plastic breasts
[50:02.240 --> 50:03.240]  and the women go
[50:03.240 --> 50:05.240]  and put their children on their laps
[50:05.240 --> 50:07.240]  as part of a satanic ritual
[50:12.240 --> 50:14.240]  it's all to condition us
[50:14.240 --> 50:16.240]  to accept anything they want
[50:16.240 --> 50:18.240]  it is a satanic
[50:18.240 --> 50:20.240]  Jacobin French Revolution
[50:20.240 --> 50:22.240]  2.0
[50:24.240 --> 50:26.240]  and the idiots
[50:26.240 --> 50:28.240]  going along with this thinking
[50:28.240 --> 50:29.240]  they're gonna get power out of it
[50:29.240 --> 50:30.240]  are fools
[50:30.240 --> 50:32.240]  alright look I haven't gotten to the Tucker Carlson thing yet
[50:32.240 --> 50:35.240]  you even need me to play Tucker Carlson
[50:35.240 --> 50:37.240]  doing a great job calmly
[50:38.240 --> 50:41.240]  saying this is unprecedented
[50:41.240 --> 50:43.240]  unmitigated evil
[50:45.240 --> 50:47.240]  I told you guys not to show it
[50:47.240 --> 50:48.240]  take it down
[50:52.240 --> 50:54.240]  our adult TV stations don't want
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.240]  what children are subjected to to be seen
[50:56.240 --> 50:58.240]  I'm not against TV stations I understand
[50:58.240 --> 50:59.240]  I don't want to look at it either
[50:59.240 --> 51:01.240]  you want to see it at someoneinfullwars.com
[51:01.240 --> 51:03.240]  but I just noticed people thought I was exaggerating
[51:03.240 --> 51:05.240]  oh there's not a thing called
[51:05.240 --> 51:07.240]  rainbow dildo butt monkey
[51:09.240 --> 51:11.240]  oh that's what it is
[51:11.240 --> 51:13.240]  and the liberal women take their small children up
[51:13.240 --> 51:15.240]  to sit in the lap of these people
[51:15.240 --> 51:17.240]  and it's turned out a bunch of them are
[51:17.240 --> 51:19.240]  aggravated sex offenders that rape children
[51:19.240 --> 51:20.240]  oh really you think so
[51:20.240 --> 51:22.240]  god that's a stretch
[51:24.240 --> 51:26.240]  and you look at the faces of these crazy men
[51:26.240 --> 51:28.240]  they look like they've been to hell and back
[51:28.240 --> 51:30.240]  they look like they've been to another dimension
[51:30.240 --> 51:32.240]  the lights are on
[51:32.240 --> 51:34.240]  ain't nobody home
[51:38.240 --> 51:40.240]  you know the photos
[51:40.240 --> 51:42.240]  of the democrats loaded up on private jets
[51:42.240 --> 51:44.240]  being flown to DC
[51:44.240 --> 51:46.240]  drinking and partying and smoozing
[51:46.240 --> 51:48.240]  while they leave
[51:48.240 --> 51:50.240]  for the second time so the legislature
[51:50.240 --> 51:52.240]  can't pass laws
[51:52.240 --> 51:54.240]  you just look at how simple minded
[51:54.240 --> 51:56.240]  and dumb these smiling democrats are
[51:56.240 --> 51:58.240]  you know they're bad enough
[51:58.240 --> 52:00.240]  what about the republicans
[52:00.240 --> 52:02.240]  presiding over all this
[52:04.240 --> 52:06.240]  because the deep state and the democrats
[52:06.240 --> 52:08.240]  are going for broke
[52:08.240 --> 52:10.240]  there'll be nothing left when they're done
[52:12.240 --> 52:14.240]  he now says he's going to have them arrested
[52:14.240 --> 52:16.240]  yeah well
[52:16.240 --> 52:18.240]  you can't arrest them under state law
[52:18.240 --> 52:20.240]  for walking off their sworn duty
[52:20.240 --> 52:22.240]  of the legislature if they're not here
[52:22.240 --> 52:24.240]  so you need to just say
[52:24.240 --> 52:26.240]  that they didn't vote
[52:26.240 --> 52:28.240]  and have an emergency quorum
[52:28.240 --> 52:30.240]  and override their askings
[52:30.240 --> 52:32.240]  you got the votes to pass your law
[52:32.240 --> 52:34.240]  yeah that's them on a bus going to the private jet
[52:34.240 --> 52:36.240]  photos of them no mask on the private jet
[52:36.240 --> 52:38.240]  but they sure as hell want you
[52:40.240 --> 52:42.240]  to wear your mask when you're a kid
[52:42.240 --> 52:44.240]  because they're abusive in a power cult
[52:44.240 --> 52:46.240]  doing what the mega corporations and megabanks want
[52:46.240 --> 52:48.240]  well I'm not funded by the big megabanks
[52:48.240 --> 52:50.240]  and if you want to keep us on air however long
[52:50.240 --> 52:52.240]  we're supposed to I'll just tell you this
[52:52.240 --> 52:54.240]  info wars is history
[52:54.240 --> 52:56.240]  what you've done is history and I mean that is a double entendre
[52:56.240 --> 52:58.240]  we've done historical things
[52:58.240 --> 53:00.240]  and we can easily be history very very soon
[53:00.240 --> 53:02.240]  the timetable coming
[53:02.240 --> 53:04.240]  and that means everybody's going to be off the air
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.240]  except for a few select loveless operations
[53:06.240 --> 53:08.240]  with the internet kill switch they've already got
[53:08.240 --> 53:10.240]  and that's in the news
[53:10.240 --> 53:12.240]  hell the internet kill switch is just the next step
[53:12.240 --> 53:14.240]  once they're quote reading all your private messages
[53:14.240 --> 53:16.240]  better watch what you say
[53:16.240 --> 53:18.240]  oh we're going to send you a message you're being watched
[53:18.240 --> 53:20.240]  by the ADL
[53:20.240 --> 53:22.240]  and the southern primary law center
[53:22.240 --> 53:24.240]  the democratic party that's in their words
[53:24.240 --> 53:26.240]  we're watching what you say
[53:26.240 --> 53:28.240]  to your husband to your wife to your boss
[53:28.240 --> 53:30.240]  to your employees to your pastor
[53:32.240 --> 53:34.240]  you're like well that that can't happen
[53:34.240 --> 53:36.240]  damn it can't happen it is happening
[53:38.240 --> 53:40.240]  so listen
[53:40.240 --> 53:42.240]  get a t-shirt get a book
[53:42.240 --> 53:44.240]  get a film for our war chest
[53:44.240 --> 53:46.240]  so that we can stay on air
[53:46.240 --> 53:48.240]  as long
[53:48.240 --> 53:50.240]  as possible and know that we have
[53:52.240 --> 53:54.240]  deep earth crystal highest quality atomic iodine
[53:54.240 --> 53:56.240]  so it goes right into your cells
[53:56.240 --> 53:58.240]  in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle
[53:58.240 --> 54:00.240]  for 60% off for the spray bottle
[54:00.240 --> 54:02.240]  exact same iodine exact same amount
[54:02.240 --> 54:04.240]  we're just doing 60 because that's what I said
[54:04.240 --> 54:06.240]  and we got 40 on the dropper
[54:06.240 --> 54:08.240]  both are going to sell out
[54:08.240 --> 54:10.240]  the dropper quicker
[54:10.240 --> 54:12.240]  than the spray bottle and that's why
[54:12.240 --> 54:14.240]  the spray bottle is 60
[54:14.240 --> 54:16.240]  and the dropper is
[54:16.240 --> 54:18.240]  40% off
[54:18.240 --> 54:20.240]  and it changed my life
[54:20.240 --> 54:22.240]  it does so much where I remember to take it
[54:22.240 --> 54:24.240]  the energy, the focus
[54:24.240 --> 54:26.240]  it's about libido
[54:26.240 --> 54:28.240]  it's about everything, it is essential in your body
[54:28.240 --> 54:30.240]  they bombard you with the bad halogens
[54:30.240 --> 54:32.240]  the fluoride, the bromine, the chloride
[54:32.240 --> 54:34.240]  this is the good halogen iodine
[54:34.240 --> 54:36.240]  most iodine is bound to other things
[54:36.240 --> 54:38.240]  so your body can't absorb it
[54:38.240 --> 54:40.240]  this is not bound so your body can't absorb it
[54:40.240 --> 54:42.240]  thousands of 5 star reviews

[55:14.240 --> 55:16.240]  other organic ingredients
[55:16.240 --> 55:18.240]  it's made out of
[55:18.240 --> 55:20.240]  a bunch of different types of wheat sprouts

[55:44.240 --> 55:46.240]  people are about to see
[55:46.240 --> 55:48.240]  if they get hit by the globalist takeover
[55:50.240 --> 55:52.240]  Jacob in Ohio
[55:52.240 --> 55:54.240]  welcome go ahead
[55:54.240 --> 55:56.240]  hey how's it going Alex

[56:00.240 --> 56:02.240]  it's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[56:02.240 --> 56:04.240]  with all the gaslighting, moralization
[56:04.240 --> 56:06.240]  and absurdity
[56:06.240 --> 56:08.240]  alright Eric in New Hampshire
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.240]  Eric thanks for calling go ahead
[56:10.240 --> 56:12.240]  hey Alex thanks for taking my call
[56:12.240 --> 56:14.240]  if I could I just want to throw a quick plug out
[56:14.240 --> 56:16.240]  for the product
[56:16.240 --> 56:18.240]  the X2 does wonders
[56:18.240 --> 56:20.240]  they recommend it to everybody
[56:20.240 --> 56:22.240]  you're on the fence about it
[56:22.240 --> 56:24.240]  get off the fence, get the product
[56:24.240 --> 56:26.240]  support the infowar
[56:26.240 --> 56:28.240]  Tyler in Maine you're on the year
[56:28.240 --> 56:30.240]  thanks for holding go ahead
[56:30.240 --> 56:32.240]  hey Alex it's great to be on with you
[56:32.240 --> 56:34.240]  it's an honor
[56:34.240 --> 56:36.240]  honor to talk to you
[56:36.240 --> 56:38.240]  and it helps with the bedroom
[56:38.240 --> 56:40.240]  so just number one for a few of you
[56:40.240 --> 56:42.240]  well it definitely works it's not a joke
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.240]  absolutely
[56:50.240 --> 56:52.240]  what are champions made of
[56:52.240 --> 57:04.240]  here's a man who can show you
[57:52.240 --> 57:54.240]  to the Alex Jones show
[58:16.240 --> 58:18.240]  alright I'm going to do my best to calm down
[58:18.240 --> 58:20.240]  and then I'm going to
[58:24.240 --> 58:26.240]  come back in the next segment
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.240]  and calmly get into their master plan
[58:28.240 --> 58:30.240]  and how to stop them
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.240]  but I understand a lot of people aren't going to listen now
[58:32.240 --> 58:34.240]  so you'll listen later
[58:34.240 --> 58:36.240]  when it happens
[58:36.240 --> 58:38.240]  and then I'm going to tell you in that scenario
[58:38.240 --> 58:40.240]  how you can beat them as well
[58:40.240 --> 58:42.240]  but then it's going to be a lot harder
[58:42.240 --> 58:44.240]  and obviously more are going to die
[58:44.240 --> 58:46.240]  but they will be defeated
[58:46.240 --> 58:48.240]  and they're going to be a champion for their god
[58:48.240 --> 58:50.240]  they're very very satanic
[58:50.240 --> 58:52.240]  but let's go ahead and prepare for this information
[58:52.240 --> 58:54.240]  with the special report
[58:54.240 --> 58:56.240]  humanity versus the eugenics
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.240]  cult choose your side
[59:02.240 --> 59:04.240]  this isn't the pop eugenics
[59:04.240 --> 59:06.240]  of let's strengthen the race
[59:06.240 --> 59:08.240]  of humanity
[59:08.240 --> 59:10.240]  by promoting breeding of individuals
[59:10.240 --> 59:12.240]  with higher IQs or things like this
[59:12.240 --> 59:14.240]  and of course that leads to hell
[59:14.240 --> 59:16.240]  that's why it's been rejected by the general public
[59:16.240 --> 59:18.240]  we had major wars over it
[59:18.240 --> 59:20.240]  people who are crippled or mentally handicapped
[59:20.240 --> 59:22.240]  are cast to death
[59:22.240 --> 59:24.240]  on the grounds that they are
[59:24.240 --> 59:26.240]  inferior beings
[59:26.240 --> 59:28.240]  but now it's back
[59:28.240 --> 59:30.240]  and it's literally trying to sterilize our children
[59:30.240 --> 59:32.240]  it's trying to force deadly things into our bodies
[59:32.240 --> 59:34.240]  it is almost inexplicable
[59:34.240 --> 59:36.240]  why people
[59:36.240 --> 59:38.240]  when they see the data in front of them
[59:38.240 --> 59:40.240]  that they don't get vaccinated
[59:40.240 --> 59:42.240]  I repeat
[59:42.240 --> 59:44.240]  there will be no return to the old normal
[59:44.240 --> 59:46.240]  for the foreseeable future
[59:46.240 --> 59:48.240]  so people assume
[59:48.240 --> 59:50.240]  we are just going back
[59:50.240 --> 59:52.240]  to the good old world
[59:52.240 --> 59:54.240]  which we had
[59:54.240 --> 59:56.240]  and everything will be normal again
[59:56.240 --> 59:58.240]  in how we are used to normal
[59:58.240 --> 1:00:00.240]  in the old fashioned
[1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:02.240]  this is
[1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:04.240]  let's say fiction
[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:06.240]  and what we really need to do at this point
[1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:08.240]  is to make vaccination the easy choice
[1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:10.240]  it needs to be hard for people to remain
[1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:12.240]  unvaccinated
[1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:14.240]  right now it's kind of the opposite
[1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:16.240]  it's easy if you are unvaccinated
[1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:18.240]  you can do everything you want to do anyway
[1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:20.240]  but at some point these mandates
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:22.240]  by workplaces, by schools
[1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:24.240]  I think it will be important to say
[1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.240]  hey you can opt out but if you want to opt out
[1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:28.240]  you have to sign these forms
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:30.240]  you have to get twice weekly testing
[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:32.240]  basically we need to make getting vaccinated
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:34.240]  the easy choice
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:36.240]  the globalist have triggered their planetary
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:38.240]  the population operation
[1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:40.240]  they are willing to do
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:42.240]  they are not putting fluoride in the water to lower our IQs
[1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:44.240]  and then you get
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:46.240]  Obama's White House Tsar
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:48.240]  John P. Aldrin
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:50.240]  who co-wrote the big 1100 page textbook
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:52.240]  Ecoscience published in 1974
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:54.240]  that is a Ph.D. level
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:56.240]  book for the elites on how to carry out
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:58.240]  world government and depopulation
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:00.240]  and how inoculations
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:02.240]  and fluoride in the water will be used
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:04.240]  to lower fertility
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:06.240]  and IQ
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:08.240]  are saying they've never seen
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:10.240]  brains look like this
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:12.240]  swollen
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:14.240]  bloody messes
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:15.240]  holes
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:16.240]  eaten
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:18.240]  in all the tissue
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.240]  liquefaction
[1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:22.240]  Annie Vanjeest
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:24.240]  was known as a super mom
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:26.240]  a master multitasker
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:28.240]  and a staunch animal rescue supporter
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:30.240]  her death certificate notes
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:32.240]  a natural death specifically from
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:34.240]  an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:36.240]  or bleeding in the brain
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:38.240]  in a statement her family says
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:40.240]  the 35-year-old wife and mother of four died
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:42.240]  quote as the result of complications
[1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:44.240]  after receiving the Johnson & Johnson
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:46.240]  COVID-19 vaccine
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.240]  but at this point neither doctors
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:50.240]  nor the CDC have any way to know that
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:52.240]  for sure
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:54.240]  now the most trusted people
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:56.240]  come out and say this is eating the brains
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:58.240]  and it's in the literature it does it
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:00.240]  and it's in all the studies
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:02.240]  and holding America and the world
[1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:04.240]  underwater drowning us
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:06.240]  killing us is big tech hiding this
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.240]  and I got another article right here
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:10.240]  OM45 who got a job at John Hopkins
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:12.240]  hospital dies
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.240]  in John Hopkins hospital
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:16.240]  after she got the second shot
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:18.240]  and they said yeah the vaccine reaction
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:20.240]  swole her brain
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:22.240]  until all the blood vessels
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:24.240]  popped
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.240]  and it was a long
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:28.240]  horrifyingly painful death the family said
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:30.240]  she went from being in great shape and totally happy
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:32.240]  to deader than
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:34.240]  a doornail and they're killing everybody
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:36.240]  right in front of us and testing to see what we'll do
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:38.240]  because they know that we will
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:40.240]  adapt by
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:42.240]  not overcoming we will adapt
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:44.240]  by submitting because they've got us in that
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:46.240]  captured learned helplessness
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:48.240]  mass Stockholm syndrome place
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:54.240]  we tried to stop it but the new owner's here
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.240]  iodine is one of the most important
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:00.240]  drivers in the body for fertility
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:02.240]  for cellular function for libido
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:04.240]  for life if you don't have iodine
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:06.240]  you die in a matter of months
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:08.240]  so if you don't have oxygen you die in four minutes
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:10.240]  you don't have water you die in a week or so
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:12.240]  you don't have food a month or so
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:14.240]  but what's in that food iodine
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:16.240]  but if your food doesn't have that
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:18.240]  atomic pure iodine you can't
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:20.240]  operate and the food itself is lacking
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:22.240]  that's why most people on earth
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.240]  are deficient in iodine and
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:26.240]  governments are lowering the allowance you're
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:28.240]  supposedly need to have because they want control

[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:12.240]  broadcasting worldwide
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:14.240]  it's Alex Jones
[1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.240]  so the Rockefeller family
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:20.240]  with the British Empire
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:22.240]  set up
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:24.240]  the United Nations to establish
[1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:26.240]  world government for the
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:28.240]  express goal of depopulation you can look that up
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:30.240]  yourself now it's all over the news they're very proud of it
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:32.240]  the very people that say they want to
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.240]  depopulate us to quote save the earth
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:36.240]  they've cast themselves as the heroes
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:38.240]  they are the very ones
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:40.240]  now say we all need to take this shot to save
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:42.240]  our lives they love us so much
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:44.240]  and we look at all the studies
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:46.240]  it doesn't protect you
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:48.240]  doesn't protect you from the coronavirus
[1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:50.240]  in fact most people getting sick and dying
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:52.240]  they had the vaccine
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:54.240]  and now they're saying oh it looks like
[1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:56.240]  the immunity doesn't work Pfizer says
[1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:58.240]  need a booster shot
[1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:00.240]  well Bill Gates said a year and a half ago
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:02.240]  once this all came out you need five shots a year
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:04.240]  it's all been pre-programmed it's all a lie
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:06.240]  and so when they get you to do one thing
[1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:08.240]  oh just take the shot life will go back to normal
[1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:10.240]  oh sorry still wear the mask
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:12.240]  gotta have more shots
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:14.240]  oh and we're still gonna say you're not essential
[1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:16.240]  oh and you need a digital ID
[1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:18.240]  to prove you've got it
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:20.240]  and then in the future they admit
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:22.240]  oh that's part of a carbon tax
[1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.240]  where we tell you what is essential travel
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:26.240]  what isn't and so we're gonna tax you
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:28.240]  when you go places you're not supposed to
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:30.240]  or when you eat the wrong meal or do the wrong thing
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:32.240]  this is all being officially announced
[1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:34.240]  right now
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:36.240]  in Europe in Australia
[1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:38.240]  but then it comes here next
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.240]  Canada still under lockdown
[1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:42.240]  and their head health minister says
[1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:44.240]  to stop people talking
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.240]  and you're like well that's just insane
[1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:48.240]  they've played the clip people can't believe it
[1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:50.240]  well now the Democrats come out
[1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:52.240]  and press conference and say
[1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:54.240]  yeah we can't let people
[1:05:54.240 --> 1:05:56.240]  question Dr. Fauci and the UN
[1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:58.240]  just like big tech says you can't question them
[1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:00.240]  when they suppress 99%
[1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:02.240]  effective treatments for deadly vaccines
[1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:04.240]  even though they ran the Wuhan lab
[1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:06.240]  and they own the vaccine patents
[1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:08.240]  and they have total conflict of interest
[1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:10.240]  and they're known liars trust the science
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:12.240]  which means don't question
[1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:14.240]  which is the opposite of science
[1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:16.240]  and do whatever they say
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:18.240]  and then Klaus Schwab writes
[1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:20.240]  books and says
[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:22.240]  on French TV
[1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:24.240]  there's going to be a crisis soon
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:26.240]  and once the crisis
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:28.240]  happens with the virus
[1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:30.240]  it will never go back to normal
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.240]  the lockdown will cut into society
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.240]  and will never be reversed
[1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:36.240]  there will be no going back to normal
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:38.240]  I just played the clip last segment
[1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:40.240]  that cue it up again please
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:42.240]  right in the first minute
[1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:44.240]  it will never go back to normal
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:46.240]  ever
[1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:48.240]  and it will save you
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:50.240]  save the earth by cutting carbon
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.240]  and now they're saying
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:54.240]  with the new global ID
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:56.240]  you have on that iPhone
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:06:58.240]  or next on a bracelet and then a chip
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:00.240]  he says
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:02.240]  the chip is next
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:04.240]  he says
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:06.240]  to buy and sell
[1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:08.240]  they're already abusing us
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:10.240]  they're already lying to us and the DNC says
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:12.240]  sell your private text messages
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:14.240]  with a
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  special train consortium
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:18.240]  that no disinformation on medical
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:20.240]  and political and on the elections
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:26.240]  oh my goodness
[1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:28.240]  well who ran
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:30.240]  the fact checking it was the Wuhan lab
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:32.240]  had more than 20 people
[1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:34.240]  employed including the head
[1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.240]  of the COVID-19 vaccine program
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:38.240]  which put out the parameters
[1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:40.240]  and pharma companies of what they wanted them to do
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:42.240]  don't scan the RNA of the virus
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:44.240]  we want all these vaccines to block
[1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:46.240]  the protein of the virus
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:48.240]  and so that woman, that medical doctor
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:50.240]  look her up was the main fact checker
[1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:52.240]  with Peter Dazik
[1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:54.240]  for Facebook
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:56.240]  and the British Medical Journal
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:58.240]  they ran the program
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:00.240]  they ran the operation
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:02.240]  and then they ran the fact checking parameters
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:04.240]  of what was allowed
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:06.240]  on Twitter, YouTube, Google, Facebook
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  and Apple
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:10.240]  because if you're going to launch an attack like this
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:12.240]  and take over society with it
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:14.240]  you better have all the gatekeepers in place
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:16.240]  you better have all the people that run the surveillance in place
[1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:18.240]  you better have control of law enforcement
[1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:20.240]  you better have control of the national health services
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:22.240]  you better have control of the WHO
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:24.240]  yeah there she is
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:26.240]  Ed, Facebook fact checker
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:28.240]  worked at Wuhan Biolab
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:30.240]  ruled out virus leak while debunking articles
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:32.240]  and ran
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:34.240]  the anti-COVID-19
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:36.240]  vaccine program
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:38.240]  that we know they had listed in an IMF World Bank document
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:40.240]  in 2018
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:42.240]  and she ran the program for
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:46.240]  Peter Dazik and who did he work for
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.240]  in the direct oh Dr. Anthony
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:50.240]  Fauci
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:52.240]  and they've got the patent
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:54.240]  she's got the patent on
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:56.240]  the vaccine
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:58.240]  and you go wait the vaccine
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:00.240]  why do you think
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:02.240]  J&J, Moderna, AstraZeneca
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:04.240]  Pfizer
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:06.240]  and all the others
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.240]  that the West made
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:10.240]  don't attack the RNA of the virus
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:12.240]  because that wouldn't hurt you
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:14.240]  might make you sick with a side effect
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:16.240]  might be a contaminated vaccine
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:18.240]  if there's something else in there
[1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:20.240]  your body will learn immunity to that too
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:22.240]  whether it's fetal tissue, peanuts, whatever
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.240]  no no no no no no no no no
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:26.240]  no
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  it's all for the protein
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:30.240]  which again is in all our bodies
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:32.240]  at Chapel Hill, North Carolina
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:34.240]  and University of Texas, Galveston
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:36.240]  knowing it killed
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:38.240]  almost all the rats and all the ferrets
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:40.240]  when they gave them a vaccine
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:42.240]  for the spike protein
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:44.240]  they developed it, they tested it for a decade
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:46.240]  and now they're murdering you with it
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:48.240]  ha ha ha ha
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:50.240]  liberal and it's in the news
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:52.240]  we'll cover it next segment
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:54.240]  that
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:58.240]  there's more deaths last week
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:00.240]  from COVID vaccines they admit
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.240]  than from COVID which most of that's fake anyways
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:04.240]  and they're just
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:06.240]  testing the gaslighting
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:08.240]  and the murdering of us in public
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:10.240]  and so what's the answer, well I told you what's the answer
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:12.240]  the globalists must be arrested
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:14.240]  and their system dismantled now
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:16.240]  or billions will die
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:22.240]  you know I don't fear what they're going to do to me
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:24.240]  for standing up for humanity and the right thing
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:26.240]  I fear God
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:28.240]  and I never ask God for anything
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  but that I have strength to be a good person
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:32.240]  and to make me be an upright person
[1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:34.240]  and give me discernment
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:36.240]  God's given me discernment
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:38.240]  but I have prayed that in all this
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:40.240]  that my family be spared but it's all in God's plan
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:42.240]  and I don't know if God will answer that
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:44.240]  selfish prayer I have but
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:46.240]  I just simply hope
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:48.240]  that all of you realize
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:50.240]  that you better get right with God right now
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:52.240]  because your church isn't going to tell you about this
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:54.240]  your synagogues aren't going to tell you about it
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:56.240]  your local liberal thing
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:58.240]  because they're all working for the system
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:00.240]  they're all trying to just be non-threatening
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:02.240]  and be little betas and go along
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:04.240]  to get along and just receive the information
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:06.240]  from on high and the globalist
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:10.240]  but you don't have to have me tell you
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.240]  you're going to have to go that once they do lockdowns
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.240]  then they'll say take an ID
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:16.240]  take a shot then you can have freedom
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:18.240]  even when you do it you don't get freedom
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:20.240]  they got you in a bear trap
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:22.240]  they got you by the balls
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:24.240]  and submitting to them
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:26.240]  only makes it worse
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.240]  when you submit to the first 15 days
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.240]  to slow the curve
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:32.240]  the flatten the curve
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:34.240]  and then oh just wear a mask for a month and it's a year and a half
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:36.240]  and oh just and then as soon as real opposition
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:38.240]  mounts at governmental levels
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:40.240]  they pull back okay you can reopen
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.240]  we got to re-close
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:44.240]  every time we mount opposition
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:46.240]  and I'm going to stop the dominoes from falling
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:48.240]  and put a hand up they go oh no no no we're not going to fight
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:50.240]  we're not going to push this
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:52.240]  so you remove your hand
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:54.240]  and they can keep knocking the dominoes down
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:56.240]  you have to just bull through
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:58.240]  and say they blocked the treatments
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:00.240]  they committed war crimes
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:02.240]  they committed crimes against humanity
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.240]  they rolled out any legal vaccine they knew was dangerous
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:06.240]  violating the Nuremberg code
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:08.240]  we got to go on the offense against them
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:10.240]  or they're going to continue to do this
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:12.240]  through the process of slow attrition
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:14.240]  and control
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:16.240]  you see these dominoes
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:18.240]  for your TV viewer
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:20.240]  they are a archetype
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:24.240]  they are an image
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:28.240]  a microcosm of all of us
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:30.240]  and so you think go along with just one thing
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:32.240]  they do and it'll all be over
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:34.240]  it'll stop no when you go along with one thing
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:36.240]  then it lets them do the next thing and the next thing
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.240]  and the next thing and then very quickly you're off
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:40.240]  the edge of the cliff
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  very quickly
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:48.240]  it's game over
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:50.240]  you see that
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:52.240]  and you see ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:54.240]  the dominoes are falling right now
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:56.240]  and we need somebody
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.240]  a governor
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:00.240]  a religious leader
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:02.240]  maybe an old lady who refuses to sit at the back of the bus
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:04.240]  we need somebody to stick their hand
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:06.240]  in front of the dominoes and stop them
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:08.240]  because these dominoes aren't falling for good
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  they're falling for bad
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:12.240]  the globalists knew humanity had awoken
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:14.240]  they knew their new ruler was in trouble
[1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:16.240]  they already had these plans on the shelf
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:18.240]  later to depopulate
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:20.240]  and later to distract if anybody ever resisted them
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  well we did resist them
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:24.240]  so they implemented the global crisis
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:26.240]  to make us the enemy
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:28.240]  to make us all suspect
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:30.240]  to disappear and arrest whoever they wanted
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:32.240]  to be able to surveil us
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:34.240]  to tell us we're reading your private text messages
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:36.240]  for your own good

[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:40.240]  there's still time ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:42.240]  there's still time I'm going to tell you
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:44.240]  what it's going to look like if you submit
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.240]  submission is death
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:48.240]  resistance is victory

[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:58.240]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:00.240]  because they're super computers
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:02.240]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:04.240]  everywhere we go what we do
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  but because they have great cameras
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:08.240]  and great recording systems
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:10.240]  and great ways to communicate
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:12.240]  I still have one because this Trojan horse
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:14.240]  this Promethean fire has a lot of power
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:16.240]  but when I'm not using it I lock it up
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:18.240]  in a high quality Faraday cage
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:20.240]  a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com

[1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:34.240]  with info wars on them
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:36.240]  for 1495
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  because I want you to get them
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:40.240]  and I want you to buy friends and family
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:42.240]  these systems to educate them
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.240]  about what these smart phones really are
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:46.240]  this is a great way to limit your phone
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:48.240]  time use it's a great way to spend more time
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:50.240]  with your family and it's a great way to know
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:52.240]  you're not being tracked by the criminal global
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:54.240]  assistance they're 50% off right now
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:56.240]  at infowarstore.com
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:58.240]  the world is awakening
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:00.240]  the world is beginning to understand
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:02.240]  the globalist paradigm
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  they are discovering the globalist
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.240]  the elites the manipulation
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:08.240]  the CFR the trilateral commission
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:10.240]  the Bilderberg group the bohemian grove
[1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:12.240]  the club of Rome
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:14.240]  and so
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:16.240]  even though it seems like the globalists are winning
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:18.240]  the truth is
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.240]  they've had to come out the open to attack
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:22.240]  human freedom because they're actually losing
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:24.240]  we have forced them
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:26.240]  out in the open
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:28.240]  as bad as these times are
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:30.240]  a lot of negative things are about to happen
[1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:32.240]  realize humanity is winning
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.240]  you've got to trust in the plan of God
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:36.240]  and trust in the plan of God's justice
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.240]  that is invincible
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:40.240]  that is ethereal
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:42.240]  timeless and unstoppable
[1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:44.240]  so don't trust in man trust in God
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:46.240]  to lead God and direct your soul
[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:48.240]  and then take action against the globalists
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:50.240]  and realize you've got my commitment
[1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:52.240]  from Alex Jones and my crew to you
[1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:54.240]  we will never back down from the globalists
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:56.240]  we will never surrender
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:00.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:16.240]  defending the republic
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:18.240]  from enemies foreign
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.240]  and domestic
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:22.240]  it's Alex Jones
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:24.240]  so I became aware
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:26.240]  30 plus years ago
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:28.240]  of a globalist population program
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:30.240]  I read it in books
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:32.240]  by people like G.A. B. Griffin
[1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:34.240]  written in the 60's and 70's
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:36.240]  and I went and looked it up at the library
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:38.240]  and just found it incredible
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.240]  that
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:44.240]  wow I'd read about Hitler and I'd read about
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:46.240]  Stalin and Mao
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:48.240]  and the things they've done killing hundreds of millions of people
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:50.240]  total
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:52.240]  then I learned they've been financed
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:54.240]  by these very people from Anthony Sutton
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:56.240]  the main archives for Congress who had all the documents
[1:17:56.240 --> 1:17:58.240]  and leaked them
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:00.240]  the classified documents
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:02.240]  and I remember going to the library
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:04.240]  and it was all real what I read in these books was true
[1:18:04.240 --> 1:18:06.240]  I was holding
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.240]  the print offs of the newspapers in my hands
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:12.240]  and you know people would tell me
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:14.240]  hey let's go out and get drunk
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:16.240]  and I'd already been a party animal before that
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:18.240]  but I really woke up about 17
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:20.240]  and I'd say I don't want to drink anymore
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:22.240]  it was a lot of years I didn't even drink or anything
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:24.240]  I got back to it later
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:26.240]  and when I discovered this I just felt a mission
[1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:28.240]  that
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:30.240]  that the same people that funded
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:32.240]  Hitler, Stalin and Mao are in control
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:34.240]  and they're going to do all this
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:36.240]  they're taking over and they got this whole plan
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:40.240]  and here we are
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:42.240]  gosh almighty
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.240]  I'm 47
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:46.240]  I've been awake since about 16
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:48.240]  until about 17
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.240]  how many years ago was that
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:52.240]  they thought I was a space alien
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:54.240]  at the UT library
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:56.240]  when I was talking to librarians
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:58.240]  and they were like are you a college student
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:00.240]  I'm like no I'm here for these documents
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:02.240]  well that's in the stacks of the microfilm
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:04.240]  sure I'll get it for you
[1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.240]  and I'd be like oh is that $10
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:08.240]  I'll just give it to you free
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:10.240]  what are you looking up the New York Times for
[1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:12.240]  from 1976 well David Rockefeller
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:14.240]  and I'd be sitting with a librarian
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:16.240]  we're going to bring in communism like Mao Zedong said
[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:18.240]  and now you got Charlie Munger
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:20.240]  standing on TV with Warren Buffett
[1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:22.240]  I mean this is real folks
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:24.240]  but it's one thing
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:26.240]  to be knowing it's coming
[1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:30.240]  I liken it to maybe
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.240]  in that slow motion we've all been in a car wreck
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:34.240]  or we've all seen something horrible in our life where it happens
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.240]  and you just can't believe you're witnessing it
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:38.240]  I saw a Corvette driving 125 miles an hour
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:40.240]  blow a tire and flipping a race on a highway
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:42.240]  over a lake
[1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:44.240]  and on a bridge on a lake
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:46.240]  and explode and people's heads
[1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:48.240]  the guy's head got cut off
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:50.240]  one person's arm part way
[1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:52.240]  and by the time I pulled over in the truck
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:54.240]  seconds after it got out
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:56.240]  I was watching the guy's head almost completely cut off
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:58.240]  and the body was trying to get up
[1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:00.240]  and then I saw this other person's arm
[1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:02.240]  half cut off
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:04.240]  and you know why it was so personal
[1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:08.240]  it was my friends
[1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:10.240]  and I was behind them racing with them
[1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:12.240]  we were in a truck
[1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:14.240]  and I wasn't even driving
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:16.240]  I was 15, my buddy was driving
[1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:18.240]  he was 16 and they were racing
[1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:20.240]  and I remember my buddy saying I'm not speeding
[1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:22.240]  I'm not going past 120 so we were back from them
[1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:24.240]  but about 20 cars
[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:26.240]  but by the time that thing blew out
[1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:28.240]  and then spun and all that happened
[1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:30.240]  by the time that happened and we pulled up
[1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:32.240]  it was just instantaneous and I got out of the car
[1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:34.240]  and they flipped over onto
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:36.240]  the railroad trestle right there
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:38.240]  and I just sat there
[1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:40.240]  and looked at that and I watched that
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:42.240]  it's the same thing, it's like the slow motion
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:44.240]  of that corvette spinning and all those pieces
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:46.240]  and watching those bodies fly
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:48.240]  and that's the slow motion
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:50.240]  I mean they really just killed 20 million people
[1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:52.240]  that means all the Facebook workers
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:54.240]  all the Twitter workers
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:56.240]  all the YouTube workers
[1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:58.240]  all of you
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:00.240]  that blocked the ivermectin
[1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:02.240]  and blocked the hydroxychloroquine
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:04.240]  you helped murder all those people
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:06.240]  and then you helped murder the 20 something million
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.240]  on top of all the other dead people
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.240]  you did that
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:16.240]  and you don't even care
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:18.240]  because it's modern warfare
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  you get to sit back like a technocrat
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.240]  and turn the economy off and then all you got to do
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:24.240]  working at big tech is censor everybody talking about it
[1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:26.240]  and you sit back and watch everybody die
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:28.240]  and then you point your finger at me
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:30.240]  and call me a racist, what the hell does that even mean?
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:34.240]  I said I'd play the Tucker Carlson thing
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:36.240]  and I got all this other news to hit
[1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:38.240]  and
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:40.240]  I'm going to have to take some time off
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:44.240]  I'm not complaining
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:46.240]  I almost feel like my mission is complete
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:48.240]  I really do
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:50.240]  I feel like we're here now
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:52.240]  and if people don't do anything about it
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:54.240]  it's not that I don't want to keep working
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:56.240]  I don't want to keep talking
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:58.240]  I just at a certain point
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:00.240]  why do I have to go find
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.240]  the Politico article
[1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:04.240]  saying we're spying on all your text messages
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:06.240]  that are going to control them
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:08.240]  and make a big deal about it
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:10.240]  why?
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:12.240]  it almost becomes absurd
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:14.240]  that it's us over and over and over again
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.240]  that have basic instincts
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:18.240]  and listen
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:22.240]  it's not that I don't want to keep fighting these people
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:24.240]  with all my heart I do
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:26.240]  I just
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:30.240]  I can't take it anymore
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  I don't think you can take it anymore either
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:36.240]  I mean we're destroying our planet
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:38.240]  they're not killing everybody to save the earth
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:42.240]  they're doing it to take full control and play God
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:46.240]  and then you just look at the average leftist
[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:48.240]  I mean they look like demon possessed creatures
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:52.240]  and
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:56.240]  if we had churches in this world
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:22:58.240]  and if we had leaders in this world
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:00.240]  we would never have gotten to this point
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:02.240]  and
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:04.240]  again there's this really obscene
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.240]  crazy thing about all this
[1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:10.240]  where
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:14.240]  knowing how bad all this is
[1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:18.240]  makes it really hard
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:20.240]  for me to care about anything
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:22.240]  does that make sense?
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:26.240]  I mean I don't care if I'll get fat
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:28.240]  I don't care if my hair is falling out
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:30.240]  I don't even I mean the stress I can take now
[1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:32.240]  is way worse than I used to take
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:34.240]  just because I'm now so accustomed
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:36.240]  to living under this lie
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:38.240]  and living under this enemy media
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.240]  and living under all these
[1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:42.240]  pedophile leftists
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:44.240]  and I've just gotten to the point where
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:48.240]  I don't want to be around them anymore
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:50.240]  and that means I don't want to look at Joe Biden
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:52.240]  I don't want to look at Kamala Harris
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:54.240]  I don't want to look at Boris Johnson
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:56.240]  I don't want to look at McCron
[1:23:56.240 --> 1:23:58.240]  and Merkel
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:00.240]  and all these people
[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:02.240]  I mean I didn't know that we could produce
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:04.240]  so much fake garbage
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:06.240]  filth
[1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:08.240]  I didn't know that people would sit there
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:10.240]  and take it from these people
[1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:12.240]  I got clip after clip
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:14.240]  of them announcing permanent martial law
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:16.240]  I'd easily leave your house
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:18.240]  forced inoculations
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:20.240]  I mean this is just all over the top
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.240]  and then oh yeah
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:26.240]  the ADL that's called for my arrest
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:28.240]  in the Southern Primary Law Center
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:30.240]  is now in everybody's text messages
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.240]  I told you that
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:34.240]  running it all spying on you
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:36.240]  and they're announcing
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:38.240]  they're not going to let you send messages
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:40.240]  that they don't agree with
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:42.240]  I mean it's ridiculous
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:44.240]  and they're all like hunchback
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  ugly, weird, neurotic middle patients
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:48.240]  because that's who they are
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.240]  a normal person would not want to read everybody's text messages
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:52.240]  a normal person would not even imagine something like that
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:56.240]  but these are people that came up
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:58.240]  with
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  Rainbow Dildo
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:04.240]  Butt Monkey Man
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:06.240]  who I can't even show you an image of
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:08.240]  the children come to the library and sit in his lap
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:10.240]  funded by the UK government
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:12.240]  it's not enough to call it drag queen story time
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:14.240]  some demon creature dressed like a
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:16.240]  a clown
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:18.240]  but now they've got fake breasts
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:20.240]  a huge fake butt vagina
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  and penis hanging now
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:24.240]  and then women bring their children to them
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:26.240]  I mean that's what runs the thing
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:28.240]  that's what it is
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:30.240]  it wants to tear you
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:32.240]  then from limb it is a psychotic
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:34.240]  predator
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:36.240]  it is the gates of hell opened
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:38.240]  demons released
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:40.240]  to have their way with us, period
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.240]  and we conjured it by our acquiescence
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.240]  we
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:46.240]  opened the gates of hell
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:48.240]  we turned Satan loose
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:50.240]  and now we're all going to die
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:56.240]  Gerald in South Carolina
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:25:58.240]  go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.240]  hey Alex welcome
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:02.240]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:04.240]  of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:06.240]  wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:08.240]  of you for a year okay
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:10.240]  I'm a double amputee and I have
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:12.240]  bacteria infection on my lung
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:14.240]  that'll never go away
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.240]  living defense saved my life
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:18.240]  they had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:20.240]  that almost killed me
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:22.240]  living defense brought me back
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.240]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.240]  Jesus is saying as to where we
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:28.240]  are right now this is Matthew
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:30.240]  24 verse 9 then they
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:32.240]  shall deliver you up to be
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:34.240]  afflicted and shall
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:36.240]  kill you and you shall be hated
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:38.240]  of all nations for my name's sake
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:40.240]  and then shall many be
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:42.240]  offended and shall betray one another
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:44.240]  and shall hate one another
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:46.240]  that's right where we're at brother and that's
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:48.240]  because God's name is on the
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:50.240]  founding of this country no matter what they say
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:52.240]  and that's why the enemy hates it because

[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:21.520]  all right let's get into it right now the guys dug up something really amazing Rob one of the
[1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:32.080]  producers did not rob do the other great rob and it's powerful that's a whole another story
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:35.760]  so i'm banned out video and after i give the number out and take some of your calls we'll get to it
[1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:41.920]  but chris carter is a listener and chris carter said some nice things about us we've talked to
[1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:47.280]  chris a little bit and chris admitted the cia came to him and told him what to say
[1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:53.920]  hey in a lot of these episodes he wasn't sure why he was he was asking me why
[1:31:54.960 --> 1:32:03.360]  but it says uh predictive programming injection with spike protein used to destroy people's immune
[1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:19.280]  systems and slowly killed them with a soft kill weapon 1994 november 11th episode
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:23.280]  probably the cia went that out then
[1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:30.880]  when they're doing it 28 years later 27 years later
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:39.760]  something big question in them
[1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:52.880]  because there's a galactic rule that they got a post
[1:32:54.640 --> 1:33:01.520]  in the newspaper or on tv in a public place they got a rider on the wall like an ezekiel
[1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:06.000]  sees the hand running on the wall what's going to be done so you've got a chance to change your
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:10.240]  future like when you're going to condemn a building or when you're going to take somebody's
[1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:14.960]  property they had big property taxes on you got it for a year longer depending on local law
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:18.960]  running ad every month saying i'm going to take this property
[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:27.760]  and i've been told just like chris carter i think figured it out
[1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:32.880]  well the only people in hollywood defended me when i got the platform three years ago
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:39.200]  was chris carter said he said alex jones in the races he's a good man he cares about humanity
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:42.560]  thank you chris that was the hollywood reporter if i remember correctly
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:53.760]  well see chris heard me many many years ago explain why the cia came to him and why they
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:34:00.240]  planted the lone gunman episodes on them where the government hijacked the jet by remote control
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:02.960]  the flight of the world trade center to blame it on his son ben laden
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:11.200]  and trigger the war on terror which would later be used against the american people
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:22.880]  and i got chris's attention when i said chris i bet the cia brought you that and chris responded
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:27.680]  back in the news and said yes people have asked where that came from it was the cia
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:35.520]  they give us a lot of ideas for our show and then chris asked why do they do that they don't
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:41.200]  tell me well now you know chris but i think you're a smart guy i think you already knew that didn't
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:45.360]  you chris hell let's go to the clip now because i'm gonna hit the tucker crawls thing in your

[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:03.280]  good work sneaking out these charts talk to me about pants plenty of room down there
[1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:08.880]  you look down molder tell you why you're welcome to come over saturday night we're all hopping on
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:14.400]  the internet to nitpick the scientific inaccuracies of earth two i'm doing my laundry the chart shows
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:18.560]  abnormal protein change in the blood the amino acid sequence is in a combination i've never seen
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:24.960]  before i downloaded scully's medical data to the newest loan gunman he goes by the name the thinker
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:34.240]  this guy's a hacking genius what the thinker reports the protein chains are the byproducts of
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:40.640]  branched dna branched dna the cutting edge of genetic engineering a biological equivalent
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:46.960]  of a silicon microchip this is way beyond cutting edge this is technology 50 years down the line
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:52.560]  what's it used for could be a tracking system developmental stages of a biological marker
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:57.680]  you mean a high-tech identity card or something as insidious as grafting a human to something
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:04.960]  inhuman good theories gentlemen but all for naught this branch dna is inactive it's waste
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:09.680]  product whoever was experimenting on scully is finished now it's nothing more than a biological
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:18.560]  poison well she live
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:28.400]  um her immune system has been decimated and uh i doubt even a healthy human body has the ability
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:39.920]  to fight this moulder there's nothing you can do and now more people are dying from the covid
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:45.840]  vaccine it's official will show me come back and from the supposed virus but see they know

[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:33.200]  sounding this topic i'm trying to get folks to wake up and realize how much trouble we're in
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:37.680]  they create a crisis they pose the saviors they say do what we say the crisis will end
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:44.080]  then the crisis gets worse more power more control you've got to reject the ruling class you've
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:48.240]  got to reject everything they say you've got to realize everything they push is poison and lies
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:55.840]  and you've got to warn others that's the only hope we've gone and the good news is so many
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:01.120]  governors so many legislators people like joe rogan people like um tucker carlson
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:07.440]  are really waking up and getting hardcore and i know it sounds crazy to come out and do a show
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:13.120]  on eugenics and depopulation that fouchie should be arrested but that's what fouchie's done and
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:21.200]  that's now what tucker carlson's talking about and so yeah that's our job was to say things
[1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:27.360]  that were unpopular because they were true and these are scary things i'm gonna play part of
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:32.000]  the tucker carlson report from last night he did 20 minutes on this an incredible monologue
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:37.600]  without their suppressing treatments while they run the censorship and how that's criminal
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:42.080]  yeah they think they're above the law they think they're safe they they can commit these crimes
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:45.680]  we've got to wake up to their program and their conspiracy and say no to it
[1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:51.600]  so i'm gonna play some tucker carlson but first again i want to stay on air as long as possible

[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:43.040]  blowout special it says 40 off we might want to put on the ad that it's 60 off of the spray bottle
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:50.160]  cap which is the same bottle same amount everything it's 40 to 60 off they said what do you want to
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:56.960]  do and i said well whatever we got less of we'll say 40 and then whatever we have more of we'll
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:01.760]  say 60 but it's the same bottle the same everything there's a different cap the spray bottle is the
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:09.120]  best deal uh but it's going to sell out too so yeah 12 dollars that's almost at cost but i just
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:14.800]  want to get it out there it's a lost leader 4.8 stars look at all those reviews info or store

[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:34.880]  say we're going to read all your text messages they'd all be arrested but all the dnc threw big tech
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:39.040]  in that partnership says oh yeah it's totally normal you already put up with censorship everything
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:44.160]  else we're reading your text messages and now we want to censor them in live time here it is last
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:49.280]  march as the first big clusters of coronavirus cases started to appear in this country media
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:54.240]  executives in silicon valley coordinated with officials in washington to determine how much
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:59.200]  the public would be allowed to know about the growing epidemic that was killing them mark zucker
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:05.200]  burg of facebook emailed tony fouchie to nyh to assure him that facebook users would only see tony
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:10.640]  fouchie's approved guidance on covet 19 twitter and google did effectively the same twitter and google
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:17.200]  eliminated any post that deviated from washington's official line in many cases they censored
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.640]  information from frontline physicians that was both medically sound it was the science
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:29.840]  and potentially lifesaving posts about treatments for example were downplayed they never apologized
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:35.040]  for this they probably never will historians will assess it they will likely record the early days of
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:41.120]  covet 19 as a turning point in our society an unprecedented assault on our most basic civil
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.880]  liberties that somehow very few people seem to notice when it first started happening the usual
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:50.640]  stuages and think tank libertarians assured us at the time that none of this was a big deal
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:56.720]  solace multinational media monopolies censoring essential medical information no problem that's
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:02.720]  how the free market works build your own google if you don't like it start your own nyh and in any
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:07.040]  case in private you can still say what you want you're still free it's not like this is north
[1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:13.920]  korea so calm down conspiracy nut you're starting to sound like alex jones most of us obeyed we
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:19.680]  dutifully calmed down went back to netflix we shouldn't have today we learned that by the
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:26.400]  administration considers censorship applicable to private speech as well what you say in private
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:32.000]  when you're alone with your phone you won't be able to say or read what you want because the dnc
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.680]  plans to control and apparently they have the ability to control the flow of information that
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:41.920]  you receive on your phone nothing that questions official regime regime policy will reach you
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:47.040]  according to a report in politico and believe it or not we are quoting it here directly
[1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:52.560]  biden allied groups including the democratic national committee are planning to engage fact
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:59.280]  checkers more aggressively and work with sms carriers text carriers to dispel misinformation
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:04.560]  about vaccines that is sent over social media and text message now we're going to say that again
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:09.520]  because it is a sentence we never thought we would see written in english the dnc is planning to
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:17.920]  censor any quote misinformation about vaccines that you receive privately over text message so
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:24.240]  what is misinformation means here's the thing you should know misinformation is not the same
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:31.040]  as false information as factually inaccurate information misinformation can be factually
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:36.960]  true in fact it very often is factually true and that's why they're angry about it misinformation
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:42.320]  is instead anything the biden administration does not want you to know including for example how
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:46.720]  effective the covid vaccines actually are and what the potential side effects might be from taking
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:51.120]  them so let's say you're interested to find out that information and you looked it up from the
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.680]  biden administration's own websites let's see you start with the veyres database which records
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.640]  vaccine harm you no longer are allowed to text what you find on their databases to other people
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:08.400]  in this country the country you were born in your private conversations will be controlled
[1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:14.720]  by the dnc is that the picture of a free country looks like we should have worried about civil
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:18.960]  liberties last year when all of this started oh but it's a global health emergency we have no
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:24.880]  choice things will go back to normal when it ends but will they go back to normal if the government
[1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:31.440]  can ban discussion of the drug they are making you take what can't they do and by the way it's
[1:51:31.440 --> 1:51:37.040]  worth wondering why are they doing this now why are they expanding censorship of conversation about
[1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:42.080]  the pandemic as the pandemic were scenes the covid vaccines have been around for more than seven
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:47.920]  months pretty much everyone who wants one has had one you can get the shot very easily they're free
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:53.600]  according to the administration this vaccine works perfectly and that means that vaccinated
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:57.280]  people are protected from covid they're bulletproof they can't get sick that's why they took the
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:03.680]  vaccine in the first place so why is official washington so angry at the people who won't get
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:09.440]  vaccinated how precisely do they pose a threat it makes you think once you think about it that maybe
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:15.280]  none of this is really about covid maybe it's about social control tony fousy all but admitted
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:20.800]  that just the other day on television here's what he said i know you've been very clear that the
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:26.800]  government isn't mandating vaccines but do you think it's generally a good idea for businesses
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:36.160]  or schools to require vaccinations right i have been of this opinion and i remain of that opinion
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:43.840]  that i do believe at the local level jake there should be more mandates i have been of the opinion
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:47.600]  there should be more mandates but actually they didn't tell us that do you remember hearing that
[1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:52.080]  when they first told that the vaccine were for mandates no they said we're not for mandates
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:56.800]  actually but now they are these drugs will be mandatory many places they already are if you
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.760]  want to get an education for example you've got to take one many questions arise from this deep
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:06.880]  questions about civil liberties and what it means to be a free country but even on a medical level
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:12.000]  questions arrive for example do we know enough to make these drugs mandatory just today the
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:17.040]  washroom post reports that the fda is preparing to announce a new warning and i believe has just
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:21.120]  announced tonight for the j and j corona all right look we're going to come back and play a
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:27.840]  little bit more of this and i'm going right to your phone calls brett raman brian jake john michael
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:34.720]  david and others our number three is straight ahead and again only recognizing this is 21st
[1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:40.160]  century war and a corporate global takeover can be that's why i keep harping how bad things are
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:47.360]  because admitting it is how we win so we have free shipping double patriot points through this weekend
[1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:54.400]  and our big loss leader is x2 in the in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:59.200]  percent off and your purchase funds the m4 but seriously the un admits two plus billion people
[1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:03.600]  have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine you need to experience it for yourself
[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:07.520]  takes two weeks to a month to kick in try it and tell me what you think you can't lose your
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:13.520]  funding the info warm and again i can harp on this all day but just like our information is dead
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:20.400]  on from research i'm telling you i couldn't do what i do without deep breath crystal iodine
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:27.280]  and x2 just in the stamina and mental focus area it's incredible what it did for libido is incredible
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:32.640]  when i don't take it i feel the difference when i do take it i'm so empowered get your x2 today
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:38.640]  discounted the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take under your tongue at infowarstore.com
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:47.040]  the globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful deep breath crystal iodine is
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:21.040]  in the war store hotline
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:56:10.040]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:12.040]  America is a racist evil country.
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:14.040]  The North Korea is good.
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:26.040]  I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they've been leaving.
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:37.040]  But when they're running down our country, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:44.040]  Running down, running down a whale's life, our fighting men have fought and died to feed.
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:46.040]  You don't let it leave it.
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:48.040]  You don't let it leave it.
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:53.040]  Let this song that I'm singing be a warning to you.
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.040]  When you're running down our country, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:58.040]  Oh, singing in.
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:03.040]  Oh, COVID-19 cases are surging in 45 states in one hot spot.
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:09.040]  Hospitals' pages are younger than ever. Doctors says, yeah, they got one probably crazy doctor there.
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:14.040]  And of course, you know, people that are vaccinated get really sick because they have an autoimmune response down to regular cold viruses,
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:16.040]  and that's their plan.
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:20.040]  And they're going to say, all the new dead are new COVID viruses and new COVID variants.
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  I told you that a year and a half ago, and it's happening now.
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:28.040]  Let's put a little bit more of what Tucker Carlson had to say and we'll come back in the next segment to write your calls.
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:35.040]  Today, the Washington Post reports that the FDA is preparing to announce a new warning, and I believe has just announced tonight,
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:38.040]  for the J&J coronavirus vaccine, Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:43.040]  They say it's been linked to a nerve disorder called GBS, which can cause paralysis and has.
[1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:50.040]  Millions of people in this country alone have taken the Johnson & Johnson shot, but other vaccines could be implicated as well.
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:55.040]  According to the VAERS database, again, maintained by the Biden administration, which tracks vaccine side effects,
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:00.040]  GBS has been reported as a potential symptom for every other COVID vaccine, too.
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  That's not a small thing.
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:06.040]  And if it sounds familiar, then you must be over 40 and have a decent memory.
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:07.040]  Maybe you don't smoke a lot of weed.
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:16.040]  You may recall that in 1976, the federal government ended its mass vaccination program for influenza after several hundred people came down with GBS.
[1:58:16.040 --> 1:58:22.040]  People started asking questions, and very quickly, the Ford administration determined that the vaccine was not worth the risk.
[1:58:22.040 --> 1:58:27.040]  But that's not happening now. People are not asking those questions because they can't.
[1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:29.040]  They're not allowed to in public.
[1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:35.040]  This is one of the only platforms in all American media that can operate outside the control of the tech monopolies and ask obvious questions,
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:41.040]  not because we're against vaccines or certainly not, but because you have a right to know a lot before you take medicine.
[1:58:41.040 --> 1:58:45.040]  But Tony Fauci isn't stopping the vaccines in the U.S.
[1:58:45.040 --> 1:58:51.040]  Instead, he's accusing anyone who has questions about the vaccine of having some kind of sinister political motivation.
[1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:54.040]  They must be queuing on.
[1:58:54.040 --> 1:59:02.040]  You know, Jake, it's an inexplicable pushing back on the part of some people about getting vaccinated.
[1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:10.040]  I mean, we've got to put aside this ideological difference or differences thinking that somebody's forcing you to do something.
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:14.040]  I really don't have a good explanation, Jake, about why this is happening.
[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:18.040]  I mean, it's ideological rigidity, I think.
[1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:21.040]  There's no reason not to get vaccinated.
[1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:30.040]  Why are we having red states and places in the South that are very highly ideological in one way not wanting to get vaccination?
[1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:36.040]  So Fauci on the one hand says, this should be mandatory.
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:38.040]  I want more mandates.
[1:59:38.040 --> 1:59:42.040]  And then moments later says, for some reason, people think we're forcing this on them.
[1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:44.040]  And that's quote, inexplicable.
[1:59:44.040 --> 1:59:49.040]  They must be right-wingers. You think if you're interviewing them, you'll say, wait a second, didn't you just say it should be mandated?
[1:59:49.040 --> 1:59:53.040]  Maybe that's why they think it's mandated because you just said it was.
[1:59:53.040 --> 2:00:02.040]  But Fauci's claim that the resistance to the vaccine is somehow political is a bad faith attack posing as science.
[2:00:02.040 --> 2:00:03.040]  It's untrue.
[2:00:03.040 --> 2:00:11.040]  In fact, it has been the Democratic Party, very much Anthony Fauci's party, that has engaged in partisan discussion about the vaccine from the very first day.
[2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:19.040]  It wasn't even a year ago, September 2020, that Kamala Harris herself announced that the coronavirus vaccine might be dangerous.
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:21.040]  Why? Because Donald Trump oversaw its development.
[2:00:21.040 --> 2:00:26.040]  And this, Kamala Harris said, and we're quoting, is going to be an issue for all of us.
[2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:30.040]  Really, no longer an issue because Kamala Harris is now in charge.
[2:00:30.040 --> 2:00:37.040]  So now that she's in charge, anyone who asks any questions at all, totally nonpartisan questions, must be a white supremacist.
[2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:46.040]  Here's Dick Durbin of Illinois doing his best today to divide the country further along partisan lines because that helps him.
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:52.040]  And tar anyone who wants more information about a specific drug as a lunatic who's against all vaccines.
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:56.040]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:01:03.040]  First off, green fiber capsules, highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:06.040]  This is an incredible formula everybody should be taking in.
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:09.040]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:11.040]  It's an amazing product. It's our newest product.
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:15.040]  It's 50% off out of the gates, infowarsstore.com.
[2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:23.040]  Then we have both types of X2s, the exact same X2 as a bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60 and 40% off depending on which one.
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:25.040]  They're both excellent at infowarsstore.com.
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:33.040]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:35.040]  It's all available at infowarsstore.com.
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:43.040]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:45.040]  And it funds the infowar.
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:51.040]  Experience deeper crystal iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at infowarsstore.com.
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:02:12.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  So I don't say this to act like the show's powerful or the show's big because what I'm doing is incredibly dangerous for myself and my family.
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:32.040]  But it's a responsibility I have, so I'm very proud to do it.
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:38.040]  I'm glad I smelled this out 30 years ago and got the position we're in now to try to resist it.
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:42.040]  But there's either one of two things.
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:50.040]  This is either all a simulation, and I'm some alien on a spaceship somewhere playing a video game where I'm a human on Earth battling a depopulation program.
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:53.040]  And this is all virtual reality, and it seems incredibly real.
[2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:57.040]  And the video game lasts 47 years and I'm about to die or whatever.
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:03.040]  I mean, either, and a lot of big banker heads and a lot of big tech people think it's all a simulation.
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:10.040]  And there's articles about the head of mega America thinks it's all fake and dark matter is five times more powerful than the rest of matter.
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:16.040]  And so it's a majority view by techies that we're held in some alien simulation.
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:17.040]  This is all fake.
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:21.040]  So maybe no one's actually listening right now.
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:23.040]  And this is all an alien simulation.
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:27.040]  And in the simulation, I'm the guy that knew about it and I'm the guy that warned about it.
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:33.040]  And finally, Joe Rogan's listening and he's the big podcaster and, and, you know, I talk to him all the time.
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:39.040]  And, oh, and then the other big top TV host is Tucker Carlson and we're buddies and we're battling the tyranny together.
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:45.040]  And, oh, I got a call by this foreign president and they're listening and we're developing a plan to fight the New World Order.
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:50.040]  And I'm like, OK, is this a simulation?
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:52.040]  Because that would be a lot better.
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.040]  We're not killing everybody in Africa.
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:57.040]  Henry Kissinger is not real.
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:03:59.040]  Prince Phillips not real.
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:01.040]  And it's all a simulation.
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:03.040]  And it means my mother's not real.
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:04.040]  My dad's not real.
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:05.040]  My four children aren't real.
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:08.040]  My wife's not real.
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:10.040]  My crew isn't real.
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:12.040]  John over there running the boom is not real.
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:15.040]  But John, you're real, aren't you, John?
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:16.040]  John thinks he's real.
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:18.040]  John thinks he's real.
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:20.040]  My grandma was real, damn it.
[2:04:20.040 --> 2:04:22.040]  My granddaddy was real.
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:25.040]  Because, let me tell you, you imagine being Alex Jones.
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:32.040]  Like, I knew they were planning all this and I saw them doing it and now it's all happening and I'm still on air.
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:36.040]  And I'm just wondering,
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:41.040]  would the Scientific American running the headlines confirm we live in a simulation?
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:44.040]  Or is that just a cop out so people say, oh, I can't handle this simulation?
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:45.040]  No.
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:46.040]  The third dimension is real.
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:47.040]  The plan is real.
[2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:55.040]  God made this as a genetic, real-world, real-life simulation.
[2:04:55.040 --> 2:05:04.040]  One of my dad's older cousins was a big guy in Vietnam and we would go to Pamela Reunions
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:07.040]  and he had a leather jacket he wore one time.
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:13.040]  It said Southeast Asia War Games, 1964, 1973, or wherever it was.
[2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:15.040]  Second place.
[2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:20.040]  So even those guys, like, joke that that was all just a simulation or all a big joke,
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:23.040]  like the comedian or whatever would tell you.
[2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:25.040]  But look, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[2:05:25.040 --> 2:05:27.040]  Honestly, this is not a simulation.
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:34.040]  Brett and Koki and Ramon and Brian and Jake and John and Michael and Dave, you're all real.
[2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:41.040]  So we're really living on a real planet in the universe with globalist world government trying to depopulate us right now
[2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:44.040]  and lying to us everywhere and this is all a big test.
[2:05:44.040 --> 2:05:46.040]  So this is not a simulation.
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:48.040]  So it's real.
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:50.040]  But it's a little bit strange.
[2:05:50.040 --> 2:05:52.040]  So who's up first here?
[2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:55.040]  Who has been holding longest?
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:06:00.040]  That would be Dave in the great state of what's left of it.
[2:06:00.040 --> 2:06:02.040]  Democrat-occupied Texas.
[2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:04.040]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:11.040]  Hey, Alex, this is Dave and I just wanted to talk about the stuff that Harrison was talking about this morning.
[2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:17.040]  The riots that are going on with Zoomer supporters in South Africa.
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:23.040]  And Harrison was saying that that's what we're going to be looking like in five to ten years.
[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:29.040]  And I just wanted to say is that something that you agree with?
[2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:30.040]  Absolutely.
[2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:33.040]  The globalists are collapsing the world economy.
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:37.040]  They're stealing all the wealth and they want to make the final collapse racial
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:44.040]  to blame economic collapse on black versus white crime, white versus black crime and that class.
[2:06:44.040 --> 2:06:50.040]  So definitely they want to hide the global collapse between a racial, cultural crisis.
[2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:52.040]  So that's not class warfare.
[2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:58.040]  Realizing the globalists instituted a worldwide lockdown that now led to this chain reaction of a cutoff of resources.
[2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:06.040]  So the globalists are exercising their will to collapse the world economy to decrease world population and consolidate power.
[2:07:06.040 --> 2:07:07.040]  Yeah.
[2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:13.040]  But what we got going on in South Africa is Jacob Dove's supporters are upset that he's going off to jail.
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:21.040]  And so the allegory or the way you would lay that on us would be Trump supporters then, you know,
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:31.040]  gluten and rioting in five to ten years when Trump goes to jail because of what he's got going on with his business and whatnot.
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:32.040]  Well, you're right.
[2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:37.040]  They're rioting there because they're mad that the former president got arrested.
[2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:40.040]  But there's already all the crises.
[2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:46.040]  It's like Biden saying, oh, you rioted because of COVID-19 in Cuba.
[2:07:46.040 --> 2:07:49.040]  People rioted because there's not enough food there.
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:52.040]  So I mean, listen, here's the deal.
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:56.040]  I don't deal in a bunch of esoteric riddles and things like that.
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:57.040]  Harrison does his show.
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:58.040]  He's got his views.
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:07:59.040]  I've got my views.
[2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:04.040]  You're going to have world destabilization accelerate as there's lack of food.
[2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:06.040]  And that's a fact.
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:13.040]  And the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg group and the Davos group did all this to create a worldwide collapse in their own words.
[2:08:13.040 --> 2:08:15.040]  So that's the big main issue.
[2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:23.040]  Certainly there's going to be exacerbating triggers in the regions that then, again, trigger that or detonate that.
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:28.040]  But instead of making it about Harrison Smith, tell me your view about this.
[2:08:28.040 --> 2:08:33.040]  My view is that it's all a load of hooey.
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:38.040]  And everything that you guys push is nothing but nonsense.
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:46.040]  You take whatever is true and factual and you just turn it on its head.
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:48.040]  I mean, in March of last year.
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:49.040]  Well, let's stop.
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:50.040]  You called in.
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:51.040]  You called in, Dave.
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:53.040]  And you're just the first guy to call in.
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:54.040]  So I went to you first.
[2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:56.040]  You're a real caller, right?
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:57.040]  Yeah, I'm a real caller.
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:08:58.040]  Okay.
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:08:59.040]  Nobody censored you.
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:00.040]  You're on here.
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:01.040]  I'm not.
[2:09:01.040 --> 2:09:03.040]  I mean, I watch Harrison a couple of days a week.
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:04.040]  I'm usually busy in the morning.
[2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:06.040]  I watch a couple of days a week, but I'm busy afternoon.
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:08.040]  I think they're good guys.
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:09.040]  I think they're funny and smart.
[2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:10.040]  So they have a show.
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:15.040]  They don't agree with me on quite a few things, but I don't understand world destabilization.
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:20.040]  Listen, you know, half the world spends about half their paycheck on food.
[2:09:20.040 --> 2:09:28.040]  So if you do a worldwide lockdown and all the numbers in actuary show, it'll cause massive civil unrest.
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:29.040]  Yeah.
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:32.040]  And so you're saying we're talking about global destabilization.
[2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:39.040]  I know what you just said in Africa and not blaming people pissed about a president being arrested, a former president.
[2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:48.040]  You're saying it's about that instead of the economic hardship of a year and a half of lockdown, which was the total preparatory operation for it.
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:50.040]  What you're already seeing all over the planet.
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:53.040]  So it's two different.
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:56.040]  Here's an analogy and I'll let you get your point in.
[2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:58.040]  But listen to me.
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:02.040]  It's like the springtime in Texas or Kansas or Missouri or Oklahoma.
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:14.040]  And you got a cold, northern coming in with all that hot air out of the Gulf of Mexico and cold air and hot air hit and it causes a lot of violent turbulence and forms tornadoes.
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:23.040]  You're saying the tornadoes being caused by the arrest of the president, former president, that would be the hot air out of the Gulf of Mexico.
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:27.040]  We're saying it's being caused by the cold air from the Arctic.
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:28.040]  We're both right.
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:31.040]  Do you under, can't people ever get two things in their mind at once?
[2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:33.040]  Or does that not make sense to you?
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:35.040]  Oh, it makes sense.
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:37.040]  It's still a bunch of hooey.
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:39.040]  Well, that's a fancy word.
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:42.040]  Is that a $3 word or a $5 word?
[2:10:42.040 --> 2:10:45.040]  It's not a big old, a bunch of hooey.
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:47.040]  Oh, like, we're going to have world IDs.
[2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:48.040]  We're going to have world government.
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:50.040]  We're going to have forced inoculations.
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:54.040]  They're going to release a virus of great lockdowns, films I made 14 years ago.
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:10:59.040]  Oh, well, hey, someday I'll be as big as you and I won't be full of hooey.
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:01.040]  Dave, Dave, you stay there.
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:02.040]  I'm going to come back to Dave.
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:05.040]  Dave is not full of hooey.
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:11.040]  And so we're going to let him speak three or four minutes on the other side as long as he doesn't say hooey again.
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:18.040]  He can't say the same phrase again because he's got to actually back up what that defines.
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:23.040]  Hooey is a nice word for defecation, for feces, for crap.
[2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:31.040]  So I do want to hear from you how I'm full of crap because my entire soul is turned towards truth.
[2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:35.040]  And I know that I'm a rose-colored darkly and I distort that truth.
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:38.040]  But there is no one trying to find truth more than me.
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:41.040]  I want you to reprove me. I want you to edify me.
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:45.040]  I want you to baptize me in truth, Dave, when we return.
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:51.040]  I want you to complete me. I want you to sanctify me.
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:55.040]  I don't like coming to you and saying this to be our last broadcast.
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:11:59.040]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:02.040]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:07.040]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:13.040]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:20.040]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:25.040]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:27.040]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:36.040]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:42.040]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:47.040]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:51.040]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[2:12:51.040 --> 2:12:53.040]  Thank you so much.
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:56.040]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:02.040]  Deep Earth Crystal iodine, the good halogen, it is essential for all actions in the body.
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:03.040]  You must have it to live.
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:07.040]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have a iodine.
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:13.040]  We have X2 in two different bottles, the same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:20.040]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:23.040]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten me some of the years.
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:26.040]  They're amazing, so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:31.040]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:39.040]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infohorsetour.com.
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:41.040]  We're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[2:13:41.040 --> 2:13:43.040]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:44.040]  Don't procrastinate.
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:14:02.040]  Take advantage of this special right now at infohorsetour.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:25.040]  So, last summer, we saw billions and billions and billions of dollars in damage.
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:30.040]  Thousands of businesses and homes burned down all over the United States.
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:36.040]  And this caller called in and used a magic word like Alakazam or open sesame.
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:37.040]  He said hooey.
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:39.040]  I said, well, give me your proof.
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:40.040]  Hooey.
[2:14:40.040 --> 2:14:45.040]  Like, suey, come here, pig, you know, suey, suey.
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:46.040]  Suey's Latin for pig.
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:48.040]  Here, pig, here, pig.
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:49.040]  He used that magic.
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:50.040]  Whoa.
[2:14:50.040 --> 2:14:51.040]  I was like, whoa.
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:52.040]  He used that word.
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:53.040]  I felt it on my knees.
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:57.040]  I knew that I'd reached an intellectual level that I'd never even imagined.
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:14:59.040]  I'd seen the face of God.
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:02.040]  So, Harrison Smith, I didn't watch his show this morning.
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:03.040]  I caught a little bit of it.
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:04.040]  I didn't catch the part you're talking about.
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:08.040]  He said, what you see in the South Africa culture war is coming here.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:09.040]  Well, the left's certainly trying it.
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:15.040]  We just saw looting and riding last year and still this year in the United States.
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.040]  So saying that what you saw in South Africa is coming here, I think you could actually
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:23.040]  say what we saw in America has gone to South Africa.
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:27.040]  So that sounds like some hooey from you in Texas there, Dave.
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:37.040]  Well, what I'm saying is specious that is coming out of info wars is this whole bit about
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:38.040]  COVID in general.
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:39.040]  Yes.
[2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:47.040]  Locking down everything has devastated businesses, devastated people, being alone at home.
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:48.040]  All right.
[2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:50.040]  It hasn't devastated big tech in the big mix.
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:52.040]  They doubled the problem.
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:55.040]  They're the ones behind it.
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:01.040]  But if you cast your mind back to March of last year, when you and Adam were on the program
[2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:07.040]  saying it's over for humanity, there will be nothing but loan survivors.
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:12.040]  That was your stance over a year ago.
[2:16:12.040 --> 2:16:13.040]  Nope.
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:14.040]  We got to play the clip.
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:15.040]  That was not my stance.
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:16.040]  Mike Adams was a smart guy.
[2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:17.040]  Hold on a minute.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:19.040]  You're not going to make false statements here.
[2:16:19.040 --> 2:16:22.040]  Mike Adams was on Sunday and he said I was right.
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:24.040]  The virus wasn't as bad as I said.
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:28.040]  I said they're going to use the virus as a pretext for a global lockdown because I had
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:32.040]  Operation Lockstep from the Rockefellers about their plan.
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:33.040]  You're wrong again.
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:34.040]  Step is bullshit.
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:37.040]  We can't cause, it's got to let you go.
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:38.040]  Hey, listen.
[2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:40.040]  Here's the good part about the world.
[2:16:40.040 --> 2:16:42.040]  You don't have to listen to this show.
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:43.040]  All right.
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:48.040]  Where we told you 10 years ago they're going to take over your private text messages and
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:50.040]  censor them, which they now have announced.
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:54.040]  You don't have to tune into the lies of Alex Jones.
[2:16:54.040 --> 2:16:56.040]  Have I been wrong before?
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:57.040]  Absolutely.
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:01.040]  But that's a misrepresentation what you said about what we said.
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:02.040]  Absolutely not true.
[2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:04.040]  There you go.
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:06.040]  That's just a little bit of counting coup there.
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:09.040]  That's a guy showing everybody how big he is, which is great.
[2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:11.040]  I'm not against somebody disagreeing.
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:12.040]  A lot of times people disagree.
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:13.040]  They're actually right about me.
[2:17:13.040 --> 2:17:17.040]  But that was not the case right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:19.040]  Now we're not going to get to 15-20 phone calls the rest of this hour.
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:22.040]  Paul wants to come up if I go that long with somebody.
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:24.040]  Let's talk to Koki in Illinois.
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:25.040]  You're on the air.
[2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:26.040]  Koki, thanks for calling.
[2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:27.040]  Hey, Alex.
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:30.040]  Just want to say thank you so much for everything you do, man.
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:31.040]  Thank you, brother.
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:32.040]  All right.
[2:17:32.040 --> 2:17:37.040]  So there are some things that I disagree with you on for sure, but it just amazes me how
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:41.040]  many people haven't read documents like lock stuff and things like that.
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:47.040]  And they are, you know, they're certain that everything you're saying is bullshit.
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:49.040]  You cussed again, brother.
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:51.040]  Listen, listen, I got to let you go.
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:55.040]  I'm going to explain to everybody something right now and I'm going to just be real slow
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:17:57.040]  about this.
[2:17:57.040 --> 2:18:02.040]  We have a delay in there that delays the show five minutes.
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:03.040]  Okay.
[2:18:03.040 --> 2:18:05.040]  I'm five minutes, five seconds.
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:12.040]  And once you cuss, we have to hit the delay button because if you do it again, we're not
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:13.040]  going to catch it.
[2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:18.040]  So I've got to let you go when you call in, when you cuss.
[2:18:18.040 --> 2:18:20.040]  The last guy cussed, I had to let him go.
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:23.040]  The next guy cussed, I got to let him go.
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:26.040]  And it's not because you're calling in disagreeing with me.
[2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:27.040]  That's entertaining.
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:28.040]  That's informative.
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:30.040]  Hell, I'm wrong about a lot of stuff.
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:31.040]  Please correct me.
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:36.040]  Just I'm on hundreds of radio stations.
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:38.040]  And CNN's allowed to cuss.
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:39.040]  FCC does nothing.
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:40.040]  MSNBC.
[2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:43.040]  We've had stations fine before.
[2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:46.040]  $4,000.
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:50.040]  That's the first five is $4,000 for you cussing on there.
[2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:55.040]  Don't do it anymore or your leftist calling in trying to get us in trouble.
[2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:57.040]  And maybe that's the last two people were.
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:01.040]  I don't know that, but don't do it.
[2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:03.040]  Don't do it anymore to my show.
[2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:05.040]  Maybe I shouldn't take calls.
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:07.040]  Maybe, maybe you win.
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:10.040]  Maybe I'll just read some more dis info here.
[2:19:10.040 --> 2:19:11.040]  You know what?
[2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:14.040]  Just for those guys want to shut my show down, I'm going to plug right now.
[2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:21.040]  We'll come back and I'm going to go to Brett, Ramon, Ryan, Jake, John, Michael and others.
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:23.040]  And those guys don't frustrate me.
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:33.040]  It's just, I have you on the talk and you can say it's wrong all day, but the Federal Communications Commission wants to shut us down.
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:42.040]  And leftists are listening to every radio station we're on, waiting to hear somebody say one of those six, seven deadly words.
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:45.040]  Which I think you've got a right to say it doesn't shock me.
[2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:53.040]  You're going to have drag queen story time, the convicted pedophile with a full erection through paintings, you know, rubbing up against kids on TV and oh, that's liberal.
[2:19:53.040 --> 2:19:54.040]  Oh, that's great.
[2:19:54.040 --> 2:19:57.040]  Somebody says it's SH-T on air.
[2:19:57.040 --> 2:19:58.040]  My God, it's the end of the world.
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:00.040]  Alex Jones is a devil.
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:02.040]  Shut his radio stations down.
[2:20:02.040 --> 2:20:05.040]  But I'm not going to do that to our radio stations.
[2:20:05.040 --> 2:20:07.040]  Not going to do it.
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:10.040]  You hung up on yourselves.
[2:20:10.040 --> 2:20:29.040]  And since you're trying to shut us down, I'm going to talk to our great listeners and our family of supporters and just say, I've got a lot of reporters and a lot of crew and a lot of people I'm trying to hire and I'm trying to get on board to expand what we're doing.
[2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:31.040]  And I can't do that without support.
[2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:34.040]  I can't stay on air without your support.
[2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:43.040]  And we've got products that are amazing, so get them at infowarstore.com today.
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:50.040]  We have at 60% off, not 40% off, like that ad says, which will probably never change.
[2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:51.040]  That's okay.
[2:20:51.040 --> 2:20:57.040]  Because we're so sophisticated and so controlled and control our information and half of it's wrong.
[2:20:57.040 --> 2:20:59.040]  It's 40% off for the dropper bottle.
[2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:01.040]  It's 60% off for the spray bottle.
[2:21:01.040 --> 2:21:03.040]  That is basically at cost.
[2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:05.040]  I need the funds to run the operation.
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:07.040]  It's the good halogen.
[2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:09.040]  Your whole body runs off of.
[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:11.040]  It's infowarstore.com.
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:13.040]  Or you can simply call toll free.
[2:21:13.040 --> 2:21:16.040]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:21.040]  And now we've got in stock green fiber capsules that are beyond fiber.
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:26.040]  They're really total amino acid supercharged systems.
[2:21:26.040 --> 2:21:31.040]  It's no secret that our unhealthy modern diets are slowly killing us.
[2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:39.040]  Most people are eating highly processed foods that are lacking high quality antioxidants, vitamins, enzymes, and organic fiber.
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:43.040]  It's virtually impossible to maintain a perfect diet in our modern world.
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:53.040]  With the new organic greens fiber caps, infowarstore.com, we're making it easier than ever to take in organic greens and sprouts that are loaded with healthy fiber.
[2:21:53.040 --> 2:22:04.040]  Made with seven organic greens that contain natural enzymes for healthy digestion, this one serving of new greens fiber caps, which are concentrated, contains as much as three cups of iceberg lettuce and fiber.
[2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:06.040]  And fiber is a sign issue.
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:10.040]  Wheatgrass is an excellent source of many different vitamins and minerals.
[2:22:10.040 --> 2:22:18.040]  Of its 17 amino acids, eight are considered essential, meaning your body cannot produce them and you must obtain them from food sources.
[2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:28.040]  Black sprouts are excellent sources of antioxidants, vitamin A, B, C, E, and essential amino acids, calcium, magnesium, iron, niacin, phosphorus, and potassium.
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:39.040]  The formula has loaded with organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, and so much more.
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:48.040]  It's available out of the gates at infowarstore.com, 33% off, $19.95, and it funds our operation. Something that's seminar-lib-tar callers absolutely hate.
[2:22:53.040 --> 2:22:55.040]  Your voice counts.
[2:22:55.040 --> 2:23:00.040]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:23:00.040 --> 2:23:03.040]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:04.040]  They know you're angry.
[2:23:04.040 --> 2:23:10.040]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[2:23:10.040 --> 2:23:21.040]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles, and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[2:23:48.040 --> 2:24:01.040]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:09.040]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality.
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:18.040]  It's specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:29.040]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:24:29.040 --> 2:24:41.040]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:47.040]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the Info Wars store. Never been a better time than right now.
[2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:51.040]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:25:00.040]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're super computers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:09.040]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:15.040]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:24.040]  And we finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, that fit almost all types of androids and iPhones, and 50% off, $14.95.
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:41.040]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long. We've got a private label for them, Full Wars on them, for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:49.040]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use. It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:52.040]  They're 50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:59.040]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:05.040]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:13.040]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:19.040]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:28.040]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:37.040]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation.
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:48.040]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:59.040]  That's the end of the day at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:23.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:26.040]  Welcome, Dano.
[2:27:26.040 --> 2:27:33.040]  All right, look, I got loaded phone lines. I'm not going to spend 10 minutes for each caller anymore as they just go, oh, I'm going to accuse Alex of something.
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:36.040]  He'll just stay in a feedback loop with me until I cuss.
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:45.040]  So let's just go in the order your calls are received. Brent in South Dakota, then we'll speak to Jake in Arizona. Go ahead, Brent.
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:48.040]  Alex, how are you doing today? Good, brother. Good to talk to you.
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:56.040]  Hey, you too. So I wanted to call and basically, excuse me, it sounds like it feels like we're no longer in a peaceful revolution.
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:27:58.040]  It feels like we're already in a violent revolution.
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:10.040]  I agree. They are assaulting us with deadly vaccines, with virus variants, with 5G, with BLM, with antifa, with open borders, with demoralization, saying we're enemies.
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:13.040]  Yeah, we're in a war. America's under attack.
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:19.040]  Absolutely. And I mean, just because bullets are flying doesn't mean people aren't dying. I mean, so we are in a violent revolution already.
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:27.040]  You know, I mean, with the mainstream propaganda going around with all the misinformation that they're putting out, I mean, it's just absolutely absurd.
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:31.040]  I agree. So what do we do? He says, come into ahead, brother. Tell us about it.
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:41.040]  Well, excuse me, I'm not sure how we go about it because we're still divided in our own ranks, too. We can't get along internally. It's crazy.
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:49.040]  You'll have some senators that say one thing, but they won't get behind other senators, you know, kind of like Ted Cruz won't get behind Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:58.040]  I mean, we all need, we're on the same side here. We need to stop this. And they're the ones that need to really come together and say, hey, we want to live.
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:06.040]  We want humanity. And they're not doing it. And that's, until that happens, I don't think there's really a lot more that we can do.
[2:29:06.040 --> 2:29:09.040]  I mean, we can keep pushing them, but it just doesn't feel like there's anything else that...
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:14.040]  Well, I told people a year ago, they're going to have contact tracers come to your door and try to intimidate you.
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:21.040]  I mean, I told people they're going to say, oh, sorry, the vaccine doesn't work. You need booster shots because it was in all the white papers.
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  Now it's happening. And so the question is, what do we do? It's all a planned out fraud.
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:40.040]  It is 100%. And I, you know, I guess we just keep fighting the best we can and keep going. I mean, I'm pushing over. I mean, I haven't really been politically active until about a year, a year and a half ago.
[2:29:40.040 --> 2:29:46.040]  And I'm pushing, I mean, I'm going to be going to the Freedom Fest that we're having up here next week, which will be pretty good because Daniel Keith will be there.
[2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:56.040]  So, but I mean, we got to keep connecting and try and get those human connections and band together without everybody we possibly can.
[2:29:56.040 --> 2:30:11.040]  Well, my friend, God bless you and I appreciate your call. We have the footage we'll air next segment of contact tracers coming to your door in their mask, in their outfits, all in their theater.
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:21.040]  Like, oh, we don't know if you've had shots. Oh, we got to wear a mask. It's all theater. It's all garbage. It's all the new medical police state is their excuse.
[2:30:21.040 --> 2:30:27.040]  And it's so dangerous. That's coming up next segment. But right now let's air a short clip.
[2:30:27.040 --> 2:30:35.040]  This is a U.S. Senator Durbin having a Freudian slip today. This happened today. Here it is.
[2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:47.040]  Here's the reality. We have millions who've died across the world by this vaccine. We may never have an accurate count. We have hundreds of thousands who have died in the United States.
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:55.040]  Senator Dick Durbin reignites the debate about deaths and injuries caused by vaccines.
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:31:02.040]  The senator from Illinois delivered a speech Monday criticizing media outlets for highlighting reports of vaccine deaths.
[2:31:02.040 --> 2:31:14.040]  He suddenly stated millions of people died by this vaccine according to the CDC system that 9200 Americans could have died from the vaccine so far.
[2:31:14.040 --> 2:31:20.040]  And about one in 40 they think is reported to be as high as 100. Look at this article.
[2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:30.040]  Who epidemiologist says it was devastating to see fans enjoying Europe's final unmasked? Oh my God, we're not under UN hysteria and control. How horrible.
[2:31:30.040 --> 2:31:37.040]  Shock report. There were more COVID-19 vaccine deaths last week in the U.S. and COVID-19 deaths. See it for yourself.
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:48.040]  Getawaybunna.com. Articles also on infowars.com. Whatever you do, share it. Oh, FDA adds Guillain-Barre. That's being paralyzed to warning to Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
[2:31:48.040 --> 2:32:06.040]  Oh, type in vaccines linked to Guillain-Barre, infowars.com. You'll get hundreds of shows. I did. They know damn well what they're doing. Damn well. Damn well.
[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:11.040]  Let's go to Jake and Arizona. Jake, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:13.040]  Alex, hey, thanks for getting to my call.
[2:32:13.040 --> 2:32:15.040]  Yes, sir. Thank you.
[2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:22.040]  Great. I would love to do a product plug and I would like to share with you one of the vaccine incentive.
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:26.040]  Absolutely. We're not screening your call, brother. You're live on air. Go ahead.
[2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:36.040]  Okay. And also pose a listener concern that I think relates directly to sort of the simulation aspect that you touched on earlier.
[2:32:36.040 --> 2:32:38.040]  I want to hear you, brother. Go give it to us.
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:51.040]  Okay. So I'm on X2, X3. I abused steroids for a long time. Recently, my girlfriend and I wanted to get pregnant. You know, I stopped. I was taking the X2, the X3 alternating.
[2:32:51.040 --> 2:33:02.040]  And I had no idea that it would be so swift, but like a month later, boom, she's pregnant. And surprise, congratulations.
[2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:10.040]  Well, brother, they admit they put fluoride in the water to lower fertility. Well, what's the opposite of fluoride? It's iodine. So I'm glad you had that effect, brother.
[2:33:10.040 --> 2:33:13.040]  Oh, yeah. It was miraculous. So thank you so much.
[2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:14.040]  Thank you, brother.
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:22.040]  All right. So my girlfriend works at the hospital. And, you know, like I just shared with you, she's pregnant, right? She's not going to take the vaccine. She's a smart girl.
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:29.040]  And I guess a lot of her friends aren't going to take the vaccine either. But so there's this pushback that we've been hearing from within the medical community.
[2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:34.040]  And it really exists because the people that are, you know, free thinking.
[2:33:34.040 --> 2:33:43.040]  Oh, they're ordering the injections all over the world. But while denying it's happening. So because if they don't get the majority to do it, they have trouble bullying a large minority.
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:45.040]  So that's why they're in so much trouble. Beautiful.
[2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:58.040]  Oh, for sure. So late recently, like this last week, something came down through the email where they're starting this incentive program where if you wear this badge, you have to present your vaccine credentials to get this badge.
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:05.040]  But if you wear this badge, there's somebody that's going around the hospital doling out a thousand bucks to people with the back, the back.
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:09.040]  Oh, Bill Watson loves this so much because we can kill you.
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:13.040]  That's worth millions and millions of dollars of benefits on the payout.
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:27.040]  Right. So do you think that doctors that are making to $300,000 a year plus are going to be worried about, you know, like a poultry lottery when, you know, it could affect their kids and, you know, maybe they're aware of the science.
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:38.040]  No, it's going to affect the people that are like cleaning, you know, the janitorial crews, the people that a thousand dollars could like make or break them over the course of a month or two.
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:42.040]  But no, this is all Nuremberg violations, cut the economy off, make you poor.
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:44.040]  Say you can't go outside till you take it.
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:46.040]  It all violates the Nuremberg code.
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:49.040]  Great points, Jake. Appreciate your call.
[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:50.040]  Amazing story.
[2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:54.040]  All right. Up next, Ramon in Las Vegas.
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:34:55.040]  Welcome.
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:57.040]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[2:34:57.040 --> 2:34:58.040]  Good to talk to you.
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:08.040]  Hey, so I had a quick question, man. So I was just going back to like when you brought up that TI and that Candace Owens deal with, you know, he was saying like, oh, Barrick was never great or what have you.
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:24.040]  And you did a big listing of one of the studio maps there about how like where slavery came from and what have you. So my question is, since most of the slavery that came to the United States came from Central, like Central Africa, the average monthly income right there right now is somewhere around $500.
[2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:36.040]  So my question is, albeit taboo, is do these BLM people, Colin Kaepernick, all these people, do they think that they would be better off had slavery now brought black people to America?
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:42.040]  You know, that still doesn't endorse slavery. It's a bad thing.
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:43.040]  No, right, right.
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:58.040]  But that's what, but that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. And so Kaepernick claiming some ancient thing in history to project on the modern people is done by Nike that runs slave camps in China. It's a discredited distraction in my view.
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:09.040]  Right. And you're absolutely right. And I just kind of think about that and wonder because, you know, like, because I'm Puerto Rican, so I was a product of the slave trade. So that that question actually would affect me as well.
[2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:17.040]  So and that was kind of well thinking, you know, he said, well, it doesn't sound to me, I'm going to have to hold you over Ramon. This is a big conversation, but it doesn't sound to me like you're a victim. You get it.
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:28.040]  What does adversity in your ancestry past mean? It just means we've been through adversity. What matters is what's currently happening now and what you stand for. I want to get your point when we come back. Sorry, I went to you late.
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:38.040]  Colin Kaepernick works for a bloodthirsty globalist organization under Bill Gates's control that is carrying out the population of Africa. Remember that.
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:50.040]  If you're going to murder Africa, you've got to have a black face. Though Kaepernick really isn't a black person. He's the product of two communist white parents.
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:37:01.040]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years. Deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen, it is essential for all actions in the body. You must have it to live.
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:11.040]  The U.N. estimates two billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine. We have X2 at two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:21.040]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out. I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten these over the years. They're amazing.
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:29.040]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it. But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[2:37:29.040 --> 2:37:37.040]  So X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:37:37.040 --> 2:37:47.040]  But we're going to keep this deal going until it sells out and probably take about two weeks. Don't procrastinate. Take advantage of this special right now at infowarstore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:57.040]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:27.040]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:39:05.040]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:20.040]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:27.040]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well, that's where infowarst comes in.
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:41.040]  You fund us, you support infowarstore.com, you get great products at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalist says is unpopular, what the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:51.040]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at infowarstore.com.
[2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:57.040]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead.
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:39:58.040]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:39:59.040]  Good.
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:10.040]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:14.040]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:25.040]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the infowar.
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:28.040]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:31.040]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:32.040]  Honored to talk to you.
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:42.040]  Awesome. So, firstly, I wanted to do was say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it. And it helps in the bedroom.
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:44.040]  So just number one.
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:46.040]  It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:48.040]  Absolutely.
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:58.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:58.040 --> 2:41:24.040]  It's the final segment of our three. That means the main Alex Jones transmissions about to end in Paul Joseph Watson from her United Kingdoms mechanic command base.
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:29.040]  We'll be taking over as a war with a destroyer.
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:33.040]  All right, Ramon, you were bringing up slavery and Colin Kaepernick.
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:42.040]  And I just think they're opening old wounds here to try to create fights as you're a big mega corporation, raping and looting the country.
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:48.040]  You want to try to divert people into divide and conquer. That's the oldest trick of the book. What do you think?
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:56.040]  Well, yeah, like I said, because I want to think about LeBron James and, you know, all these other people are coming out and they've made all these millions of dollars.
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:05.040]  You know, let's, you know, let's, let's look and see, you know, how, how hypothetically, how would life have been different for African Americans had the slavery not brought them to.
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:11.040]  And like you said before, though, be careful because just because you weren't brought to America doesn't mean that slaves wouldn't have been taken somewhere else.
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:21.040]  You know, so like you said, make the best out of adversity. And I think, like you said, they're cutting open, cutting open old wounds and just trying to kind of use that to bleed everything out.
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:27.040]  Well, my point is we're all being put into globalist big tech medical tyranny slavery saying we're not essential.
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:34.040]  You got to take this dangerous shot to have a job or leave your house. I mean, I've got all these world leaders saying we're going to make it uncomfortable.
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:38.040]  You can't go to the mall. You can't go to a restaurant. You can't have a job.
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:42.040]  If we don't put an experimental shot in you, that's crazy.
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:48.040]  Yeah, that's absolutely crazy. And like I said, I'm real divided with my family, too, because I have a brother who works in Washington, D.C.
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:55.040]  And like we, we, we lock horns so hard when it comes to like politics and things about Biden and Trump.
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:43:02.040]  And that's another thing, too, when it came to Trump, I heard a lot of stuff because USP264 just took place this Saturday and I was there at E.P. Security.
[2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:08.040]  And they, you know, you read Newsweek and you read all these other people and they're talking about, oh, he was booed and he was jeered.
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:15.040]  Like, no, I can tell you right now that when Conor McGregor walked out, it was an equivalent to when Donald Trump walked out.
[2:43:15.040 --> 2:43:21.040]  Oh, Trump's more popular than ever. And they want to destroy Trump because he wasn't an independent president.
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:26.040]  That means he was perfect, but he was president. And that's what they fear is real leaders and populist movements.
[2:43:26.040 --> 2:43:39.040]  Thank you so much for mowing great points. Chelsea's calling from the United Kingdom where they've announced, oh, freedom means checkpoints and medical IDs and intimidation for inoculation,
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:46.040]  but not as bad as France or Greece where they said it's forced. You will do it. You'll never leave your house again. My God.
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:52.040]  So, Chelsea, your, your take on this education centers and prison towns in the U.K.
[2:43:52.040 --> 2:44:01.040]  Yeah, I just heard about this recently. Six of these prison towns have been approved so far.
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:09.040]  One is in construction already and they will consist of classrooms and workshops for reeducation.
[2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:17.040]  So I'm wondering where all these prisoners are going to come from for these prison towns.
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:25.040]  Oh, I know about reeducation camp documents that came out from the Army under Obama. I know they've got plans for forced quarantines.
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:34.040]  The U.N.'s announced all over the Western world. It's hard to begin to tell us more about what you learned about what they're setting up in the U.K.
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:45.040]  I just read a few articles yesterday. The first thing I saw was a video online of a construction worker going into one of the prisons that's currently being built.
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:53.040]  And he drives through it recording. Yeah, we just pulled up the footage. So, yeah. So they're calling them prison towns.
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:45:03.040]  Mm-hmm. It's insane. And then I looked into it more in their articles saying it consists of classrooms and workshops.
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:11.040]  And it will be great to be economy. So I'm guessing it's going to be like a slave camp kind of like Chinese setup thing.
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:16.040]  They've announced they're reading all our private tech messages run by the DNC. I mean, it's like, wow.
[2:45:16.040 --> 2:45:20.040]  I mean, it's just like we went over the edge of a cliff. This is insane. I didn't know about the prison camps.
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:25.040]  Tell me where the guys just searched U.K. prison towns and pulled up what you're talking about.
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:33.040]  Giant sprawling, I guess, towns that will be slave camps for those that, what is the news saying? Those that don't submit?
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:41.040]  Um, basically, yeah. So they're probably going to implement laws that if you don't get the vaccination or you don't wear your mask,
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:47.040]  you will be sent to these towns and be reeducated. And it's insane.
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:52.040]  Well, that was always the plan. The U.N. said those that don't accept the shot will be sent to quarantine towns.
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:46:00.040]  Canada already set them up last year. But wow, to see the footage of those giant facilities they're building.
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:05.040]  Wow. This is really the perfect takeover, isn't it? Wow, there it is.
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:12.040]  How come nobody talking about this? Yidon said they're building prisons around the country. A friend knows people working on this one.
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:18.040]  And that's Wellingboro prison. It's massive, the size of the town. It's supposed to be for quarantining.
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:26.040]  What the hell are these plates? Wow. God, it's that they always said in the U.N. documents, they put us in reeducation camps.
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:32.040]  Wow, there it is. Yeah. And now they're just building it right in front of your face. It's insane.
[2:46:32.040 --> 2:46:38.040]  So I just wanted to shed light on it because nobody's talking about this and they're here building them.
[2:46:38.040 --> 2:46:42.040]  It's a total authoritarian takeover. Can you believe it, Chelsea?
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:48.040]  No. It's unmind blown when I saw that video. I was just like, wow.
[2:46:48.040 --> 2:46:54.040]  And they said that the people in there are not to be called prisoners but residents.
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:47:01.040]  That's what they say as well. Well, I see some of the articles. Give us the articles you're talking about because I'm intrigued here.
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:07.040]  I mean, hell, I played the Canadian minister last week saying, we're going to keep everybody in martial law forever.
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:11.040]  You can't be allowed to walk around and talk to people. You might oppose what we're about to do.
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:18.040]  This is a communist takeover hiding behind a virus. And where are our Republican governors? Where are they? Where are they?
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:23.040]  Boris Johnson's supposedly a conservative. He's leading the attack.
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:28.040]  Yeah, our conservatives are not conservatives. There's no such thing over here.
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:34.040]  Well, what are people saying about these giant reeducation camps they're building?
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:38.040]  Nobody knows about them. I just saw it from a video and then...
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:48.040]  By the way, guys, show that video again of the facility they're building. I mean, they're building gigantic reeducation camps and they drive into the big giant prison gates.
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:53.040]  My God. This is how the left's going to win, folks. They are...
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:48:00.040]  We've approved so far. Six of them approved so far. So who... Who in these prisons fall? Six of them.
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:09.040]  We don't... Our country's not this big. You know, it's like the size of one state. Six of these prison towns. Insane.
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:17.040]  And of course, once everybody accepts the prison towns, there's already, whether it's Canada, Australia, New Zealand, all the Crown Countries, Commonwealth Countries,
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:22.040]  when you fly in 14 days locked up.
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:27.040]  I mean, they just trained everybody. They did it.
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:35.040]  It's scary. It's scary to see it actually unfold. I remember watching you, like, years ago and I'd think,
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:44.040]  yeah, but it's not really happening. And now it's just happening. Like, everything you said would happen is just happening. It's crazy.
[2:48:44.040 --> 2:48:49.040]  Well, I appreciate your call. God bless you, Chelsea. Give us updates as it unfolds. Wow.
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:53.040]  Let's jam in on their call before we go to break. Come back with more.
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.040]  Let's talk to Brian in Michigan. Brian, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:58.040]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:48:59.040]  Good, brother. Go ahead.
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:00.040]  Can I have 90 seconds?
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:01.040]  Yeah, please.
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:07.040]  All right. The Apocalypse of Abraham, Chapter 29. If you look at that, Donald Trump makes a very good appearance.
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:11.040]  And they're just saying it could be. Not how I'm doing is asking questions.
[2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:15.040]  He spoke the physical into existence from the spiritual, the quantum realm.
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:21.040]  That means that everything, every law that applies in the physical, our world, is from the quantum realm.
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:25.040]  That means that you look at Isaac Newton where every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:27.040]  The same would apply with our conscious thought, right?
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:36.040]  So if we're at right now, 5,988, because if you look at Revelation 13, 3.5 years, right?
[2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:41.040]  So Revelation 13.5, and there was given unto him a mouse speaking great things.
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:45.040]  And blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and 2 months.
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:50.040]  That would be 3.5 years. Jesus was ministering for 3.5 years.
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:54.040]  If you go to Revelation 20, Satan is bound.
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:56.040]  And I saw the angel come down in heaven.
[2:49:56.040 --> 2:50:01.040]  And the key to the bottomless pit and the great chain on his hand, he laid hold of the dragon.
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:04.040]  Who do you think the dragon is? The dragon is China. The chai comms are going to be coming.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:09.040]  Right now, if you go backwards, 2,000 years, Jesus Christ is 21 years old.
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:16.040]  In 2,029, it's going to be the beginning of...
[2:50:16.040 --> 2:50:21.040]  By the way, the globalists say the beginning of humanity begins in 2029.
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:23.040]  They say that. That's official.
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:27.040]  What's incredible is they are fulfilling it all themselves.
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:35.040]  0.5 years of tribulations that we're going to have. And if you go to Noah's prayer, after the flood, Noah had a prayer with his sons.
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:37.040]  It's in Jubilee's, the book of Jubilee's.
[2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:44.040]  One tenth of the demons will be locked up, will be left to torment men until just before the great judgment.
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:49.040]  The great judgment would be for 3.5 years that these demons are released.
[2:50:49.040 --> 2:50:59.040]  10 out of 10 spiritual strength will be for 3.5 years of Jesus' ministering that he did for 3.5 years.
[2:50:59.040 --> 2:51:08.040]  That said, if we're at right now year 5,988 on the line of creation, two lines are running. Creation and evolution.
[2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:13.040]  Evolution is creation is. Right now we're at year 5,988.
[2:51:13.040 --> 2:51:20.040]  What's going to happen at year 6,000? If there's one day and the earth was created in six days, and there's one day to 1,000 years on earth,
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:26.040]  when we're at year 5,988, all I'm asking is what happens at year 6,000?
[2:51:26.040 --> 2:51:33.040]  Well, sure, to be re-revelation, there's 1,000 years after that where the devils chained and unchanged for a short time again,
[2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:37.040]  and then God rolls up the universe in a scroll and starts it all over again.
[2:51:37.040 --> 2:51:40.040]  Whatever's about to happen, it's big.
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:47.040]  I never had a marketing plan for Imple Wars. I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to funder operation.
[2:51:47.040 --> 2:51:52.040]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[2:51:52.040 --> 2:51:57.040]  I treat you like I want to be treated. It's very, very simple. It's instinctive. It's spiritual. It's what I do.
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:00.040]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:07.040]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[2:52:07.040 --> 2:52:11.040]  And so I'm going to catch 22. When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[2:52:11.040 --> 2:52:14.040]  But we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[2:52:14.040 --> 2:52:19.040]  And so I'm going to catch 22. I need to sell products at full price, but I can't. I got to sell them at discount.
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:26.040]  And so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[2:52:26.040 --> 2:52:29.040]  It won't be available for months, so get it.
[2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:37.040]  X2 is selling out at infowarstore.com for 40% and 60% off with double patriot points and free shipping because why?
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:41.040]  That's when you buy it. We need your funds or it'll be off air. It's an amazing product.
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:48.040]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:52:58.040]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[2:52:58.040 --> 2:53:09.040]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[2:53:09.040 --> 2:53:18.040]  We have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:24.040]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible.
[2:53:24.040 --> 2:53:37.040]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable. So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[2:53:37.040 --> 2:53:54.040]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[2:53:54.040 --> 2:54:09.040]  We've got five minutes left for Paul Joseph Watson takes over on the On Show show. We're going to go to Jack, Chris, and Seth. You can each person a minute and a half.
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:29.040]  Alex, let me be on your show again. Three weeks ago, General Flynn was doing an interview with Anne Vanderstiel, and he was warning not to worry about the zombie people, not to worry about the UFOs, but to worry about a false flag event coming because of the elections, what is being coming out.
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:42.040]  And so here we are now. They're censoring our phones. They're starting to censoring our internets. They're taking down their Twitters. And here on the ground floor, we've been pushing this out to get it all out about the shot and the graphing.
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:45.040]  They're getting ready to move something big.
[2:54:45.040 --> 2:54:53.040]  Absolutely. And what I feel that folks really need to do is start paying attention, paying attention to you because you are right.
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:55:02.040]  I've listened to you for years. You got to listen to Mike Adams, Stu Peters. You got to listen to all those guys out there. We are out here warning you as well.
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:11.040]  We are out here telling you folks that this is coming and they're not going to stop until they get us here on the floor. We are not scared of these globalists.
[2:55:11.040 --> 2:55:18.040]  We are taking them head on. We are spreading the messages and will continue to do so. We trust in God and we trust in you, Alex.
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:24.040]  I trust in you, brother, and I trust in God, of course. And I agree. These enemies are servants of Satan.
[2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:35.040]  Don't think they've got the keys to the earth just because they're trying all this. This can be taken away from them. They are going to fail, but they are slaves of Satan. They can't help it, Jack. I appreciate your call.
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:41.040]  Great points. Talk to him for an hour. Talk to him for an hour. We've got to move here. Let's talk to Chris in California. Go ahead, Chris.
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:43.040]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:44.040]  I'm all right, brother.
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:54.040]  Good. Good. I just had a quick thing to say. I don't know if you've already mentioned this earlier in the show. If you guys already have articles, but the Bill Gates filed for a patent.
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:58.040]  This was yesterday in the interview with Nick Fleming.
[2:55:58.040 --> 2:56:20.040]  It's the RBGCR Intel. This was an Intel update of Bill Gates filed a patent with a publication number of W0202060606. So if you write that down, it's very interesting.
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:35.040]  That's a real patent. It got filed about two years ago by Bill Gates. There it is on screen to track everybody with an injectable system or with a biometric tracking control system via cryptocurrency.
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:46.040]  Yes. To me, it sounds like the mark. I mean, I don't want to put any conspiracy out there, but I just find that being a little...
[2:56:46.040 --> 2:57:02.040]  Sounds like the mark. They're saying you can't buy or sell unless you take some deadly shot. Damn right, it's the mark. Some mark that changes your DNA and puts their digital marker on you. They are marking us, folks, as cattle to whatever it is they're selling the planet out to.
[2:57:02.040 --> 2:57:18.040]  And after hearing this interview, as Nick Fleming said, and you quote, Bill Gates is doing the devil's work and reading Revelation 13 verse 16 through 18, it's right on the dot for me. So I just thought I'd get that out.
[2:57:18.040 --> 2:57:27.040]  No, brother, you're dead on. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Last caller before Paul Watson takes over. Seth in Florida, go ahead.
[2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:39.040]  Hey, Alex, this is a... I'm just going to start it out here. In March, my dad, he took the first shot of his vaccine. It was Moderna. He got real congested.
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:58:00.040]  He thought he just needs a knock. He thought it was allergies. Took the second shot. Within a day, urine turned blood red. He had an autoimmune reaction. It shut down his kidneys, and it really just hadn't been able to get over it. He's on the right track, but he's on dialysis indefinitely.
[2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:04.040]  Yeah, your dad is tougher. He'd be dead, brother. They're going to kill billions.
[2:58:04.040 --> 2:58:12.040]  Let me tell you, he's a prominent Methodist pastor in Tallahassee, and if he didn't believe in God, I believe he'd be gone.
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:16.040]  Well, is he going to warn people now?
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:31.040]  He's been warning people, but the thing is, I warned him before, and he's told me so many times I should have listened to you. And, you know, it's just because I've listened to your show that I know this stuff about what's going on, and I tried to tell people, and they don't want to listen.
[2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:40.040]  Hold on. Paul Joseph Watson is taking over at 10 after. But I want you to come back and finish the story of what happened to your father, a Methodist preacher in Tallahassee, Florida.
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:59:09.040]  I'll have a side. We've got the Summit News Hour, Summit.News. Paul Watson taking over in about three, four minutes. I'm going to come back and let's set them forward to finish up.
[2:59:10.040 --> 2:59:22.040]  The Summit Pure Iodine, it can't operate, and the food itself is lacking. That's why most people on Earth are deficient in iodine, and governments are lowering the allowance you're supposedly going to need to have because they want control.
[2:59:22.040 --> 2:59:35.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful. Our products are just as powerful. Experience Clean Iodine today. It's discounted 40% off in the dropper bottle, 60% off in the spray bottle. You take it to your mouth. Pure Atomic Iodine with free shipping.
[2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:45.040]  Double Patriot Points at infowarstore.com. Don't wait any longer. Just like our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful. They don't want you to experience this. Get it today at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:45.040 --> 3:00:09.040]  Take action. Find out what you're missing. Get the missing link. Get X2.
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:38.040]  All right. Paul Joseph Watson takes over in T-minus three minutes with the Summit News Hour every Tuesday to 3 p.m. Central. But I had to hold this caller over to just recap what happened to your dad, Methodist preacher, where this is going, how he's doing, another testimony,
[3:00:38.040 --> 3:00:55.040]  and he has in Florida a recap and restart. You got about two minutes. All right. In March, my dad took the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, and he got really congested. He had multiple things. They tell you our side effects, you know, heart inflammation, all these stuff.
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:01:15.040]  He took the second shot after that, and immediately the next day, he found blood in his urine. So they tried to say that it wasn't a reaction to the vaccine, but then about three days later, they finally met somebody at the hospital that was willing to rule it out because of this rash that was going on because of the capillaries.
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:29.040]  It was a capillary rash that formed whenever you have a blood problem with your kidneys because that's where it was attacking. And it caused immunoglobulin A reaction in his gut.
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:48.040]  And basically, he had a very hard time with it at first and even had a minor QIA about two weeks after it, but he's on the better track now, but he's on dialysis indefinitely and even more so after he gets off a dialysis and his kidney function goes back to where it's supposed to be.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:02:00.040]  They think they're going to try to use chemo cytoxin to build a wall around his other organs to make it to where he'll be able to survive any other autoimmune reaction.
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:07.040]  So they're admitting his body's killing itself because you give someone an injection that attacks the spike protein that's in all your organs.
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:18.040]  And so now they want to give chemotherapy to kill his immune system because his body's been turned against himself. What a diabolical sick attack by Fauci who tested all this out on animals for where they did this to us.
[3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:20.040]  What a monster.
[3:02:20.040 --> 3:02:34.040]  I agree completely certain. You know, it's just, it's sad that we even have to go through this, that there's enough information out there available to people to realize what's really going on and they're not taking hold of it.
[3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:38.040]  But what can you do besides doing what you're doing and warning people?
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:41.040]  Well, Seth, they're murdering psychotics throughout history.
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:48.040]  And like Joseph Mengele of the Nazis and the Nuremberg Code, Fauci and Gates and all them are admitted eugenicists that want to reduce population.
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:54.040]  They've done this on purpose and we project our own goodness onto them and can't believe they're doing this to us.
[3:02:54.040 --> 3:02:56.040]  And so that's why they're getting away with it.
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:03:06.040]  They go to prison, like I've said to this entire broadcast, globalists must be arrested and their system dismantled now or billions will die.
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:10.040]  And if we don't do our duty, it's on us before God.
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:11.040]  That's it.
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:14.040]  I can believe you, man.
[3:03:14.040 --> 3:03:17.040]  And I just want to product plug real quick, man.
[3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:18.040]  I take X2.
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:19.040]  I've got X3.
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:20.040]  I've taken alpha power.
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:22.040]  I've taken primal youth.
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:24.040]  I've taken vaso beats.
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:26.040]  I've got ultra 12.
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:27.040]  You name it.
[3:03:27.040 --> 3:03:31.040]  Pretty much if you've got a product, I'm willing to try it and I like them all, man.
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:32.040]  Well, thank you, sir.
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:38.040]  What I really care about is getting your dad now that he's seen what these poison shots do to get up and speak out.
[3:03:38.040 --> 3:03:40.040]  Is he speaking out about what happened to him?
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:41.040]  Yes, sir.
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:43.040]  He went through about three weeks ago.
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:45.040]  He's coming out of a grocery store now.
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:49.040]  People signing up for the vaccine lines and he was telling him, you know, don't don't do it.
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:51.040]  He's like, there's no reason for it.
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:53.040]  And ultimately it comes down to this, man.
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:04:01.040]  If you really believe in God and you believe in salvation, what about something you can inject into yourself can save you?
[3:04:01.040 --> 3:04:02.040]  That's just the ultimate thing.
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:03.040]  Well, that's it.
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:04.040]  Plus saying we shouldn't interact.
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:06.040]  We shouldn't breathe on each other.
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:07.040]  We should be inhuman.
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:11.040]  We should be mechanical run by Big Pharma with its whole giant evil history.
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:12.040]  All right.
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:13.040]  That's it for me.
[3:04:13.040 --> 3:04:19.040]  I appreciate Paul Joseph Watson being here and Paul Joseph Watson takes over right now.
[3:04:19.040 --> 3:04:24.040]  Then Owen Troyer and the war room 3 p.m. Everybody tell folks tune in now.
[3:04:24.040 --> 3:04:25.040]  Paul's got a lot to say.
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:26.040]  Here it is.
[3:04:26.040 --> 3:04:52.040]  The summit news hour live from London, England.
[3:04:52.040 --> 3:04:59.040]  It's Paul Joseph Watson with summit dot news.
[3:04:59.040 --> 3:05:09.040]  And we're live with the summit news hour where I'm going to spend much of the rest of the hour talking about soccer, which I'm sure is going to delight our American listeners,
[3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:14.040]  given that they probably have as much interest in soccer as I have in baseball.
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:24.040]  But this is more than just a sport. This is a delineation of fork in the road when it comes to the culture war in the United Kingdom in England.
[3:05:24.040 --> 3:05:47.040]  Because this Euro 2020 tournament, the past three, four weeks has been the welkist sports tournament, at least the welkist football tournament ever staged and that was embodied to no greater degree than via the England football team to the point where the captain Harry Kane was wearing an LGBT armband for one of the matches.
[3:05:47.040 --> 3:06:01.040]  To the point where we had a three week debate about the fact that the team before every single match took the knee for BLM as a purely political message, despite their desperate claims to suggest that it isn't political.
[3:06:01.040 --> 3:06:18.040]  Again, because they've kind of embraced and absorbed these religious ritualistic rights as a dogmatic religious belief system. So when you even raise the prospect that now you're taking a political stance, you're making a political gesture,
[3:06:18.040 --> 3:06:29.040]  they can't even fathom that that would be an argument because they've absorbed it so deep into their dogmatic religious cult that this is what we must do and it's not even a political debate.
[3:06:29.040 --> 3:06:45.040]  Well, they did that before every match. This was billed as a team full of immigrants. This was diversity being a strength, not quite a strength if you actually live in England when it comes to stabbings, terrorist attacks, grooming gangs,
[3:06:45.040 --> 3:06:54.040]  but because 11 multimillionaires can kick a ball around a field, apparently that proves that indeed diversity is a strength.
[3:06:54.040 --> 3:07:08.040]  So the success of the English team in reaching the final was kind of played up by the media and by leftists as a big stub of the nose to people on the right, to populists who think that sport shouldn't be politicized,
[3:07:08.040 --> 3:07:18.040]  that it shouldn't be hijacked to push far left extremist divisive rhetoric and promotion for extremist violent groups such as Black Lives Matter.
[3:07:18.040 --> 3:07:35.040]  That was a big thumb in the nose and England's progress to the final of the competition gave them the capital to grandstand and claim that they were right all along that indeed diversity is a strength again because a bunch of multimillionaires can kick a ball around the field.
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:48.040]  That was their hill that they chose to die on. England, as it turned out, had a quite easy route to the final as soon as they faced a team that was actually of any quality. Surprise, surprise.
[3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:53.040]  They lost. And what a shame that was. What a crying shame.
[3:07:53.040 --> 3:08:05.040]  So in the immediate aftermath of England losing on penalties, they had to turn around the narrative because they had had the narrative set up all along that this was a win for mass immigration.
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:13.040]  This was a win for diversity. This was a win for anti-racism BLM. This was a win for the LGBT movement.
[3:08:13.040 --> 3:08:24.040]  This was the biggest snob in the nose imaginable, uniting the country around any progressive patriotism. Well, they bolded it up because they lost a penalty shootout.
[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:42.040]  And many people are now claiming that the manager of the England football team, Gareth Southgate, deliberately chose three Black players to take the last three crucial penalties to send a political message to again rub people's noses in it that diversity is indeed a strength.
[3:08:42.040 --> 3:08:51.040]  The problem being that those three Black footballers missed all their penalties. England lost. Italy won the tournament.
[3:08:51.040 --> 3:09:04.040]  But then in the immediate aftermath, there was a media, a leftist backlash over racist social media messages sent to those three Black football players who missed their crucial spot kicks.
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:18.040]  And as I'm going to explain after the break, this is being, again, regurgitated into this narrative that England is a racist country full of gammon, beer-swilling, pot-bellied louts who just all hate Black people and want to abuse them.
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:28.040]  When you actually dig into who was sending these racist messages on Instagram and Twitter, the vast majority of them were not from England.
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:35.040]  They were from India and the Middle East, but the media doesn't care about that because they've got a narrative to fulfill.
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:43.040]  I'm going to get into that and more on the latest coronavirus lockdown news here in the United Kingdom and more after the break summit.
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:59.040]  The news is going.
[3:10:14.040 --> 3:10:22.040]  But one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60 and 40% off, depending on which one. They're both excellent at infowarstore.com.
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:29.040]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:40.040]  It's all available at infowarstore.com. The new green fiber capsules, 50% off and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:48.040]  And it funds the info war. Experience deep earth crystal iodine for yourself and keep your gut healthy at infowarstore.com.
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:58.040]  X2 has been our number one best seller over the years. Deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen, it is essential for all actions in the body.
[3:10:58.040 --> 3:11:03.040]  You must have it to live. The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:16.040]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top. 60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:21.040]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years, they're amazing, so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:27.040]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:35.040]  So X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:39.040]  But we're going to keep this deal going until it sells out, probably take about two weeks.
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:58.040]  We're going to keep this deal going until it sells out, probably take about two weeks.
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:11.040]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:17.040]  So authorities in England were all set to announce a four-day bank holiday.
[3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:22.040]  They were preparing to erect statues of England football team manager Gareth Southgate in central London.
[3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:30.040]  They were preparing to hand out nighthoods to some of the England football players, and none of that happened because they lost.
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:36.040]  One of the reasons that they lost, and this is what many people have pointed out, and I'm trying to explain this for American listeners,
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:42.040]  because I know you don't really care about football, soccer, but there are five penalty kicks, right?
[3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:45.040]  England and Italy, they drew, went to extra time.
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:53.040]  The score was still 1-1, so the only way to decide the match was each team takes five penalty kicks from the penalty spot.
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:13:02.040]  Now, it turned out that it came down to the last kick, and England needed to score this penalty kick to stay in the competition.
[3:13:02.040 --> 3:13:05.040]  If they missed the penalty, they were out of the competition.
[3:13:05.040 --> 3:13:15.040]  And the manager, Gareth Southgate, who is basically an insipid, anodyne, woke idiot who just repeats all the platitudes that he's expected to.
[3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:18.040]  He's a company man. He's a safe bet. He's an idiot.
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:31.040]  He chose the crucial fifth England penalty. He chose to give it to a 19-year-old black teenager who had never taken a professional penalty in his entire life.
[3:13:31.040 --> 3:13:36.040]  Now, bear in mind the two penalty kick-takers before that were also black. They both missed their penalties.
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:47.040]  There were other players in the team who were older, had more experience on the big stage, and had scored more penalties in actual competitive football matches.
[3:13:47.040 --> 3:13:57.040]  But the woke progressive white England manager, Gareth Southgate, chose to give the crucial fifth penalty with the weight of the nation on this kid's shoulders
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:02.040]  to a 19-year-old boy, basically, who'd never taken a professional penalty in his life.
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:08.040]  Did he do that because he wanted to rub everyone's noses in it and send a political message?
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:13.040]  That's still up for debate. What's not up for debate is that he missed that penalty.
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:15.040]  England crashed out of the tournament.
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:26.040]  And then almost immediately within hours, the media had started this narrative that there were vast amounts of racist comments being aimed at these three black footballs
[3:14:26.040 --> 3:14:30.040]  on social media and that they were coming from England supporters.
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:33.040]  I've tracked this every single time.
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:42.040]  Every single time there's a controversy over a black footballer being racially abused on social media, you go and look at the handles of these accounts.
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:47.040]  You go and look at their names. They're all Muslim names. They're all Middle Eastern names.
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:52.040]  And that's being documented in the aftermath of this story, headline.
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:59.040]  Critics point to country of origin after controversy over racist messages sent to black in England footballers.
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:05.040]  Some claim that Managing Arab Southgate deliberately chose black players to take Lash 3 crucial kicks, I've been through that.
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:11.040]  However, after England lost reports of the Instagram Twitter accounts of the three players being flooded with racial slurs and monkey emojis,
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:13.040]  immediately began to circulate.
[3:15:13.040 --> 3:15:18.040]  This led, and this has increased, this has intensified in the past couple of days,
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:25.040]  for calls for the government to hunt down the identities of those responsible with authorities vowing to, quote,
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:29.040]  make an example of the culprits.
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:36.040]  There's also a petition which calls for the government to pass a law that mandates people provide a verified ID
[3:15:36.040 --> 3:15:40.040]  before they're even allowed to open a social media account.
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:44.040]  That petition has over 633,000 signatures.
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:52.040]  So immediately the narrative was exploited to try and expand state power to try and decrease internet freedom,
[3:15:52.040 --> 3:16:00.040]  eviscerate internet anonymity, and increase censorship based on the fact that these three black footballers were being abused.
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:04.040]  When you looked at who was doing the actual abuse, they weren't English.
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:06.040]  They didn't have English names.
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:14.040]  They were primarily from countries like India, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, and a study showed that.
[3:16:14.040 --> 3:16:18.040]  Charlie Pete has said the biggest thing about the racial abuse of footballers in England,
[3:16:18.040 --> 3:16:22.040]  that always gets cut from the narrative, is that most of it comes from abroad.
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:26.040]  Tory MP Michael Frabricant called on UK Home Secretary, Priti Patel,
[3:16:26.040 --> 3:16:33.040]  to investigate what proportion of the racist abuse directed at England players after the Euros actually originated in the UK.
[3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:37.040]  I don't want anyone talking about it from this angle, which is the truthful angle,
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:45.040]  because it doesn't give them the pretext, it doesn't grease the skids for domestic internet censorship in the United Kingdom,
[3:16:45.040 --> 3:16:53.040]  and the passage of a law that mandates you provide a government ID before you're even allowed to open a social media account.
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:17:03.040]  Always the excuse is exploited to expand state power, on all the usual idiotic social media influencers fell for it right away,
[3:17:03.040 --> 3:17:09.040]  and are pushing it, despite the fact that the vast majority of people, and I linked to screenshots of this in the article,
[3:17:09.040 --> 3:17:17.040]  who were racially abusing the England footballers, had Muslim or Middle Eastern names or Indian names,
[3:17:17.040 --> 3:17:25.040]  and indeed, someone did a Semrush analysis of racist comments and emojis posted in the hours after the match ended,
[3:17:25.040 --> 3:17:33.040]  and that showed that the top countries of origin are India, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:40.040]  So the entire media narrative is that there was a racist backlash against black England footballers,
[3:17:40.040 --> 3:17:46.040]  by white English people, because they missed those crucial three penalties and lost the match.
[3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:53.040]  That narrative, that fake narrative, was then exploited to push for people to be, quote, made an example of.
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:17:58.040]  They want to treat them worse than pedophiles and terrorists, as I'm going to get into,
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:05.040]  and to grease the skids for the complete evisceration of online anonymity and the passage of an internet ID,
[3:18:05.040 --> 3:18:11.040]  which has been a globalist aim for the best part of the past 20 years.
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:15.040]  We were literally publishing stories about it 15 years ago.
[3:18:15.040 --> 3:18:21.040]  And this is all based on the narrative that England is an intolerant racist country that abuses its own black football players,
[3:18:21.040 --> 3:18:26.040]  completely not the case, and that was proven by another article.
[3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:31.040]  This is out of the Daily Mail from back in March earlier this year.
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:39.040]  So the revealed 7 out of 10 social media posts abusing Premier League players come from trolls overseas.
[3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:46.040]  So social media abuse of top tier footballs originates outside of the UK in 7 out of 10 cases,
[3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:50.040]  according to data collected by the Premier League.
[3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:58.040]  So at least 70% of it, and I would argue more from what I'm seeing, comes from outside the country.
[3:18:58.040 --> 3:19:04.040]  It comes from people in countries that are more racist than England, which is still a predominantly white country,
[3:19:04.040 --> 3:19:13.040]  because that's the fact that leftists who live in this utopia still can't seem to grasp that racism is way worse in non-white countries.
[3:19:13.040 --> 3:19:20.040]  Have you seen how Chinese people treat even other Chinese people who have darker skin complexions?
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:26.040]  Have you seen how black people get treated in Chinese airports?
[3:19:26.040 --> 3:19:31.040]  Have you seen how the Indian caste system works and how that works in other countries?
[3:19:31.040 --> 3:19:35.040]  The only countries in which slavery still exists are all non-white.
[3:19:35.040 --> 3:19:41.040]  Yes, other countries are way more racist than Western, white, European countries.
[3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:47.040]  It's way worse. That's one reason why you have the racial abuse of black England footballers,
[3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:51.040]  because that's just what they do. That's how they get their jollies.
[3:19:51.040 --> 3:19:57.040]  Also, you have a lot of angry people who placed giant bets on England winning this tournament.
[3:19:57.040 --> 3:20:02.040]  Those bets came to nothing because these three footballers missed their penalties,
[3:20:02.040 --> 3:20:05.040]  so then they're lashing out by racially abusing them.
[3:20:05.040 --> 3:20:09.040]  Again, most of the messages come from outside of the country.
[3:20:09.040 --> 3:20:17.040]  For the media to drum up this narrative that this is a white working-class English gammon problem,
[3:20:17.040 --> 3:20:23.040]  that these potbelly drunkards are going on social media and abusing football players because they missed penalties,
[3:20:23.040 --> 3:20:29.040]  the stats do not bury out, but they're going to push this narrative to completely eviscerate
[3:20:29.040 --> 3:20:35.040]  internet anonymity, internet freedom, and to literally hunt down and make an example out of people
[3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:39.040]  who don't even live in the country.
[3:20:39.040 --> 3:20:42.040]  Going to get into COVID and the lightest on the restrictions on the other side.
[3:20:42.040 --> 3:20:47.040]  Summit.News, I'm going.
[3:20:47.040 --> 3:20:53.040]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:53.040 --> 3:20:59.040]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:20:59.040 --> 3:21:02.040]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[3:21:02.040 --> 3:21:04.040]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say,
[3:21:04.040 --> 3:21:07.040]  hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:12.040]  But it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:14.040]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:21:14.040 --> 3:21:18.040]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups,
[3:21:18.040 --> 3:21:19.040]  and we're still here.
[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:23.040]  And as this whole new world order comes out and be open, our credibility's showing up.
[3:21:23.040 --> 3:21:25.040]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:27.040]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:21:27.040 --> 3:21:31.040]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[3:21:31.040 --> 3:21:36.040]  You can't have Info Wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:21:36.040 --> 3:21:39.040]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:44.040]  So thank you all, and get an InfoWareStore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:21:44.040 --> 3:21:45.040]  supplements and so much more.
[3:21:45.040 --> 3:21:47.040]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWare.
[3:21:47.040 --> 3:21:48.040]  Thank you.
[3:21:48.040 --> 3:21:51.040]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:52.040]  Hey, Alex.
[3:21:52.040 --> 3:21:53.040]  Welcome.
[3:21:53.040 --> 3:21:58.040]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[3:21:58.040 --> 3:22:01.040]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[3:22:01.040 --> 3:22:07.040]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[3:22:07.040 --> 3:22:09.040]  Living Defense saved my life.
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:13.040]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:15.040]  Living Defense brought me back.
[3:22:15.040 --> 3:22:21.040]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:23.040]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[3:22:23.040 --> 3:22:48.040]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:57.040]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[3:22:57.040 --> 3:23:06.040]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[3:23:06.040 --> 3:23:13.040]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:21.040]  They finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:25.040]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:38.040]  We've got a private label for them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family of these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[3:23:38.040 --> 3:23:46.040]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:49.040]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:52.040 --> 3:23:54.040]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:55.040]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[3:23:55.040 --> 3:23:56.040]  Good, bro.
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:23:57.040]  Great last caller.
[3:23:57.040 --> 3:24:00.040]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[3:24:00.040 --> 3:24:06.040]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:08.040]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[3:24:08.040 --> 3:24:10.040]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:11.040]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:12.040]  Hey, Alex.
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:13.040]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:24:13.040 --> 3:24:16.040]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product.
[3:24:16.040 --> 3:24:18.040]  The X2Coop does wonders.
[3:24:18.040 --> 3:24:20.040]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:23.040]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the infowar.
[3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:25.040]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[3:24:25.040 --> 3:24:26.040]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:27.040]  Hey, Alex.
[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:28.040]  It's great to be on with you.
[3:24:28.040 --> 3:24:29.040]  It's an honor.
[3:24:29.040 --> 3:24:30.040]  Honored to talk to you.
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:31.040]  Awesome.
[3:24:31.040 --> 3:24:36.040]  What I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:38.040]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:40.040]  All right, it helps in the bedroom.
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:42.040]  So just number one for a few of you.
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:43.040]  I like that one.
[3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:44.040]  It works.
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:45.040]  It's not a joke.
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:46.040]  Absolutely.
[3:24:46.040 --> 3:24:56.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:25:15.040]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:22.040]  We're continuing to talk about this racial abuse controversy in the United Kingdom, which
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:27.040]  has been exploited by all the usual suspects to push for more internet censorship, regulation,
[3:25:27.040 --> 3:25:32.040]  internet ID, which they've been trying to get for the best part of 20 years now.
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:36.040]  I remember articles about it literally in the early 2000s.
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:42.040]  Of course, that's used across the world by repressive regimes to silence, track down,
[3:25:42.040 --> 3:25:44.040]  hunt down true political dissidents.
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:49.040]  So it's no surprise that they would want to copy authoritarian regimes like Communist
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:54.040]  China and introduce that based off the back of idiot social media influencers and YouTubers
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:26:00.040]  who don't know what the hell is going on and just get railroaded by this fee-mongering propaganda
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:04.040]  about racial abuse into supporting it, promoting their little petitions.
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:09.040]  Despite the fact that the vast majority of the abuse is coming from people in Egypt,
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:14.040]  United Arab Emirates, India, and all these other Middle Eastern South Asian countries.
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:19.040]  The facts don't matter, though, when there's a bandwagon to jump on as per usual.
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:24.040]  Toby Young tweeted to put the scale of the racist abuse the England players receive on
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:26.040]  Twitter into context.
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:32.040]  The Guardian analyzed more than 585,000 tweets aimed at the players during the group stages
[3:26:32.040 --> 3:26:36.040]  and found 44 explicitly racist messages.
[3:26:36.040 --> 3:26:41.040]  That's 0.0075% of the total.
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:48.040]  This is the big racial abuse controversy that we're being told is so deadly serious.
[3:26:48.040 --> 3:26:53.040]  Paul Embery tweeted, when an idiot fan invades the pitch, the TV cameras quite rightly turn away
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:58.040]  to ensure he doesn't get the publicity he craves and to discourage others from doing the same.
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:04.040]  When a tiny number of idiots racially abuse players, we give them wall-to-wall media coverage.
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:05.040]  Go figure.
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:08.040]  Yeah, have you heard of Don't Feed the Trolls?
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:12.040]  So one of the primary reasons they do this every time is because they know they're going
[3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:16.040]  to get saturation media coverage for the next week.
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:17.040]  That's what they won.
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:20.040]  That's what they get.
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:25.040]  Boris Johnson holds showdown with social media firms demanding that the update game,
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:31.040]  as PM says, details of anonymous racist trolls who abuse Euro 2020 pouncy misses must be handed over.
[3:27:31.040 --> 3:27:33.040]  Instagram has a feature.
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:39.040]  Twitter has a feature where you can control who replies to your Instagram post or your tweets.
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:43.040]  You can set it so only your followers can reply to them.
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:45.040]  You can block whoever you want.
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:48.040]  That doesn't matter, though, because that's not what they really care about.
[3:27:48.040 --> 3:27:53.040]  They really care about grabbing even more power.
[3:27:53.040 --> 3:27:56.040]  And now we come to this idiot.
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:28:01.040]  Radio host says racists should have bank accounts, citizenship stripped.
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:08.040]  This is Mike Graham, who you may remember as the guy who tried to ruin Marcus Meacham
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:11.040]  Count Dankill's life over the Nazi pug joke.
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:17.040]  This guy supposedly a center right populist host on the radio.
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:23.040]  Well, now he's called for, quote, racist to be stripped of their bank accounts, passports and other life necessities,
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:28.040]  treating them worse than literal sex traffickers and terrorists, by the way.
[3:28:28.040 --> 3:28:34.040]  An interesting assertion given that Graham himself has been denounced as a racist numerous times before.
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:29:02.040]  We have a 35 second clip of these moronic comments that you made earlier today on Talk Radio, and here it is.
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:28.040]  Yeah, great idea, Mike. Why don't we just hang them on the jibbit on the radio?
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:33.040]  Yeah, great idea, Mike. Why don't we just hang them on the jibbit on the street corner as well?
[3:29:33.040 --> 3:29:42.040]  I don't think stripping them of statehood and citizenship and passports and bank accounts is enough if they said something mean on the internet.
[3:29:42.040 --> 3:29:45.040]  And after all, who gets to decide who is racist?
[3:29:45.040 --> 3:29:50.040]  You know someone who has been denounced as a racist on numerous occasions?
[3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:53.040]  Well, it's Mike Graham himself.
[3:29:53.040 --> 3:30:02.040]  In 2019, Graham said, I hate polls live on air, prompting a listener to phone in and accuse him of being racist, but hating Polish people.
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:05.040]  And I mean, surely the accusation alone is enough, right?
[3:30:05.040 --> 3:30:10.040]  Why don't we seize your bank account? Why don't we take your passport?
[3:30:10.040 --> 3:30:12.040]  What an idiot.
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:17.040]  He was actually seriously accused of racism and actually was racist.
[3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:28.040]  In 2020, where he was accused of anti-Irish racism after he repeatedly called Twitter user John O'Connell a paddy several times.
[3:30:28.040 --> 3:30:33.040]  This is after he said Celtic Football Club was a pedophile football club, by the way.
[3:30:33.040 --> 3:30:37.040]  So apparently Mike Graham can say offensive things on Twitter.
[3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:46.040]  He can call Irish people anti-Irish racial slurs all day long on Twitter, but he gets to keep his bank account.
[3:30:46.040 --> 3:30:48.040]  He gets to keep his passport.
[3:30:48.040 --> 3:30:52.040]  He gets to remain a citizen of the United Kingdom.
[3:30:52.040 --> 3:30:53.040]  Think about this.
[3:30:53.040 --> 3:31:02.040]  He's literally calling for, quote, racist, the definition of which is so vague and slippery at this point, that anything is racism.
[3:31:02.040 --> 3:31:06.040]  We had an article today about how soap dispensers were racist, for God's sake.
[3:31:06.040 --> 3:31:23.040]  And you want to empower people who think everything's racist to have the power to strip people of their citizenship, their passports, their bank accounts, their benefits to make it impossible for them to live other than on a park bench at best, if that.
[3:31:23.040 --> 3:31:31.040]  When you yourself have been accused of being racist on numerous occasions before, who the hell are you pandering to?
[3:31:31.040 --> 3:31:42.040]  Some idiot on GB News this morning, which is supposed to be the anti-woke news channel, got down on one knee and started blathering on about how great Black Lives Matter was.
[3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:45.040]  Another complete idiot.
[3:31:45.040 --> 3:31:47.040]  These people aren't genuinely right-wing.
[3:31:47.040 --> 3:31:48.040]  They're not genuinely conservative.
[3:31:48.040 --> 3:31:55.040]  They're not genuinely putting up a fight against this woke takeover by these ideological jihadists.
[3:31:55.040 --> 3:31:59.040]  They're all complete grifters, and this proves it yet again.
[3:31:59.040 --> 3:32:12.040]  He's literally calling for people who cause offence on the internet, boo-hoo, which basically everything is at this point, to be treated worse than terrorists, worse than violent convicted criminals.
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:17.040]  Even violent convicted criminals can still process financial transactions.
[3:32:17.040 --> 3:32:22.040]  They don't get their citizenship, their statehood, their passport removed.
[3:32:22.040 --> 3:32:34.040]  He's calling for them to be treated worse than that. Absolute moronic idiocy, once again, from Mike Graham, but he's got a lot of form, so no surprise.
[3:32:34.040 --> 3:32:36.040]  There.
[3:32:36.040 --> 3:32:54.040]  Sean Kebney on Twitter, meanwhile, says that being a racist isn't an opinion you're entitled to. If you discriminate against someone because of their ethnicity, you're dangerous, you deserve to be vilified, you deserve to lose your job, you're not being cancelled, you're being left behind by a society that rejects you.
[3:32:54.040 --> 3:33:11.040]  This is a journalist who I believe worked for the BBC, and again he's saying, quote, if you discriminate against someone because of their ethnicity, you're dangerous. That's quite awkward, because Mr Kevney's employer, the BBC, does precisely that.
[3:33:11.040 --> 3:33:27.040]  Headline, how is this legal? BBC bans white people from applying for spring watch and one job, and one show job. The BBC has found itself at the centre of discrimination storm after banning white people from applying for a production management role.
[3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:43.040]  There's one furious critic using, imagine the riots if it had been the other way round. So I agree with Sean Kebney that it is dangerous to discriminate against someone because of their ethnicity. Well, your employer does precisely that.
[3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:58.040]  Meanwhile, Theodore Darwin pulled the British author rights, the worldview of the providential class. He says that, if despite everything immigrants or people of immigrant descent, especially those of different races are prospering and integrating well into society,
[3:33:58.040 --> 3:34:16.040]  there is no need of a providential class of academics, journalists, bureaucrats and others to rescue them from the slough of disbun supposedly brought about by prejudice and discrimination. Many a career opportunity would be lost if there were no systemic injustices of this sort to entangle.
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:37.040]  The only solution is felt to be virtually totalitarian control over society by the providential class. And that's precisely what they're doing in the aftermath of this racist messages abuse controversy, completely mischaracterising it,
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:47.040]  completely hiding the true origin source of it, to clamp down on our freedoms, to create internet ID and more online censorship. Some of that news will be back.
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:56.040]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:34:56.040 --> 3:35:12.040]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:22.040]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:27.040]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:35:27.040 --> 3:35:40.040]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root.
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:52.040]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:36:12.040]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:22.040]  Thank you for joining us today.
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:50.040]  Anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:37:01.040]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God,
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:13.040]  and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will. Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:20.040]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean,
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:26.040]  or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:34.040]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[3:37:34.040 --> 3:37:42.040]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:48.040]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:52.040]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:37:59.040]  First off, green fiber capsules, highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.

[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:20.040]  Then we have both types of X2s, exactly next to the bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60% and 40% off depending on which one.
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:22.040]  They're both excellent at m4sore.com.
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:30.040]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.

[3:38:51.040 --> 3:39:00.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:16.040]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:34.040]  We're going to switch gears to COVID now because we've got the big freedom day on July 19th where we get back all the freedoms that we should have had anyway from the gracious government who people have been genuflecting to after being brainwashed by their behavioral psychologists for the past 16 months.
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:50.040]  Paul last week found that 40% of the British public wanted mask mandates to remain in place forever. That's how much they've been terrorized and traumatized and made into lily livid, limp-risted, yellow bellies by this propaganda.
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:40:04.040]  When you actually look at the stats, the fear mongering doesn't seem to be too justified.
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:12.040]  New figures released by researchers in the UK show that just 25 under 18s died from COVID from March 2020 to February 2021.
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:25.040]  Two thirds of whom had chronic health conditions and that lockdown measures aimed at children, quote, may prove a greater risk than of SARS COVID-19 itself.
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:35.040]  Numbers show that there's around one in 500,000 chance of children dying from coronavirus in England and that includes victims of pre-existing medical conditions like heart disease and cancer.
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:51.040]  But still, apparently, we have to vaccinate them all despite the fact that 25 over the course of a year of this deadly pandemic have died and two thirds of them had chronic health conditions.
[3:40:51.040 --> 3:41:04.040]  Yet we still have to vaccinate all the kids despite the fact that obviously more of them are going to die from complications from the vaccine and the virus itself because virtue signaling is more important than actually saving lives.
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:14.040]  The USA show epidemiologist says it was, quote, devastating to see fans enjoying Euro's final and masks. Oh my God, they weren't wearing masks.
[3:41:14.040 --> 3:41:24.040]  The leading World Health Organization epidemiologist says it was devastating to see crowds at Wembley enjoying the European Championships final without wearing face masks.
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:31.040]  66,000 fans gathered inside the stadium to see Italy defeat England again, what a shame that was.
[3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:41.040]  On Sunday night, Maria van Keurkove expressed her disgust that supporters were able to enjoy the match on mass despite it being outdoors and within existing COVID-19 rules for mass to not be required.
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:49.040]  So she had a big kissy fit about it on Twitter. She said, the COVID-19 pandemic is not taking a break tonight.
[3:41:49.040 --> 3:41:59.040]  SARS COVID Delta variant will take advantage of unvaccinated people in crowded settings, unmasked, screaming, shouting, singing, devastating.
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:01.040]  That was a hissy fit.
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:16.040]  So apparently people being allowed to go back to normal life is devastating despite the fact that the government literally held numerous major trials at sporting events where the spread of COVID-19 was found to be infinitesimal as a result with people not wearing masks.
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:24.040]  The fans who attended the game were made to provide proof of vaccination or negative COVID tests on condition of entry, which they're now going to roll out to the rest of society.
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:40.040]  By the way, I'll get on to that in the next bit. Of course, we know with masks, the great saint himself, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Jesus returned, the Pope, all in one God himself, God of science admitted.
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:49.040]  In February 2020, the store bought face mask quote is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.
[3:42:49.040 --> 3:42:52.040]  Don't talk about that anymore, do they?
[3:42:52.040 --> 3:43:02.040]  There was only one major peer reviewed study as to the efficacy of masks. By the way, it took place in Denmark, involved 6000 participants.
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:12.040]  And it found that quote, there was no statistically significant difference between those who wore masks and those who did not when it came to being infected by COVID-19.
[3:43:12.040 --> 3:43:18.040]  And yet they're still trying to keep these mask mandates in place for eternity forever.
[3:43:18.040 --> 3:43:33.040]  And on that subject, the famous British author Peter Hitchens appeared on our fingers GB news to talk about how masks are indeed a pure form of virtue signaling completely useless and completely ineffective.
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:36.040]  Here is that clip.
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:54.040]  People should continue to assert that they work since the government itself and the World Health Organization right up until June last year were perfectly clear that they made very little difference either in protecting people from infection or from preventing them from passing on infection.
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:44:06.040]  There has been only one major randomized controlled trial into the effectiveness of masks, the down mass trial, which went largely unreported by most British media.
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:16.040]  And what that said was that the difference between those who wore masks and those who did not in actually getting infected was statistically insignificant.
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:30.040]  So I think there should be a bit less confident about asserting that masks work in themselves. The other simple point here that we have to make is that there is a big difference between the loose cloth masks, which are commonly worn by the public,
[3:44:30.040 --> 3:44:42.040]  and the sort of masks which are worn in hospitals, which are the N95 type particularly, which costs an awful lot more, which can only be worn once, which is touched while it's being worn becomes useless.
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:48.040]  And it's entirely different both in nature and use from the things which are being worn.
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:59.040]  And the other thing is that there doesn't seem to be any serious correlation between mask usage and the levels of infections and Covid around the world if you compare all countries.
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:13.040]  The other thing we must remember is a fascinating scoop by Deborah Cohen, the medical correspondent of BBC Newsnight, a year ago now, when the World Health Organization reversed its position on masks.
[3:45:13.040 --> 3:45:23.040]  She inquired and discovered from contacts that the decision had not been taken as a result of medical information, but for political reasons.
[3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:29.040]  And she put this to her contacts at WHO and they did not in any way seek to put her off it.
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:38.040]  I think, and I think there's evidence, the reason why the British government and some others seek to continue mask wearing,
[3:45:38.040 --> 3:45:46.040]  is that they see it as a badge of compliance and that they think that if people stop wearing masks, as they have in large parts of the United States now, I believe,
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:57.040]  if they stop wearing masks, then the whole atmosphere of what I would call fear and panic created by mask wearing over the past year or so will dissipate.
[3:45:57.040 --> 3:46:10.040]  And once people stop being as afraid as they have been, the entire state of compliance, the willingness of people to do all kinds of things in the belief that they don't do them, everyone will fall ill,
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:19.040]  and they will finish. Well, you can see why they might think that. And you can argue that it might be a sensible policy to take, but I don't think it's particularly factually based.
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:31.040]  And I think people should be wary of people just asserting that it is so. If anybody ever says you will mask wear, ask them to cite the proper randomized control trials of the gold standard of this kind of study.
[3:46:31.040 --> 3:46:41.040]  Ask them to cite the randomized controls of the control trial, which actually shows what they're saying is true.
[3:46:41.040 --> 3:46:48.040]  Meanwhile, despite the fact that as Peter Hitchens explained there, there's no evidence that masks actually reduce COVID-19 transmission.
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:56.040]  The Telegraph reports COVID passports and masks required at sporting events in England after due line 19. Oh, so it isn't Freedom Day.
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:06.040]  Oh, well, lifting all the restrictions. No, you're not. No, you're not. You're introducing vaccine passports, which you denied you were doing for months on end while secretly funding them.
[3:47:06.040 --> 3:47:13.040]  Now fans attending sporting events in England after due line 19 will require a COVID passport and will be told to wear masks.
[3:47:13.040 --> 3:47:26.040]  And of course, the cost of getting a negative COVID test every time you want to enter into a theater, a venue, whatever a sports stadium are extremely prohibitive for most people.
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:32.040]  So it's another way to force them to get the much vaunted vaccine.
[3:47:32.040 --> 3:47:46.040]  Forage predicts government could bring back restrictions by September. That's precisely what they're planning to do. It never ends. Meanwhile, in France, Macron announces those without COVID vaccine pass will be banned from routine life activities.
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:58.040]  Oh, but it's not mandatory. You just won't be able to go into a shopping mall, a cafe, a hospital, a bar, a cinema, an educational institution, basically anywhere unless you get the vaccine.
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:12.040]  But it's not mandatory. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that those who don't have a COVID pass will be banned from participating in basic life activities, such as visiting shopping malls, restaurants and using public transport.
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:20.040]  Now they tried to pass this, by the way, back in December on the banning of people who were unvaccinated using public transport.
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:33.040]  There were fierce protests against it and they had to roll it back. Will it be rolled back now? Where are the yellow vests, the gilets jaunes, to fight back against this obvious state tyranny?
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:52.040]  What they did in France in an effort to force more people to take the vaccine was to remove free COVID PCR tests because they'd previously been free. Now people have to pay for them. They're not going to be able to afford to pay for them because France economy's basically been in the mud for the past 15 years.
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:49:06.040]  So make it financially unsustainable for most people to continually have to take negative COVID tests to go about daily activities. So they will be forced to take the vaccine, but it's not mandatory.
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:18.040]  CNN doctorate needs to be hard for people to remain unvaccinated and medical experts suggested that in order to force more people to get vaccinated, life should be made as difficult as possible for those who are still opting not to take the shots.
[3:49:18.040 --> 3:49:32.040]  That's what it's all about. Identifying the dissidents who don't go along with this so they can be punished by having their basic social life, their rights and mobility and everything that constitutes normal free living removed.
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:48.040]  It's going to wrap it up. Summit on news coming up next. War Room with Owen Shroyer. Don't go away.
