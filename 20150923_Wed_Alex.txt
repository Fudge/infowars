[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.200 --> 00:28.960]  they say a picture can tell a thousand words when I watched a video report that David Knight
[00:28.960 --> 00:35.560]  filed this morning that's up on info wars.com of the Pope being guarded by federal state local
[00:35.560 --> 00:43.760]  police the military but also the border patrol border of course existing is evil according
[00:43.760 --> 00:50.960]  to the Pope and his United Nations one world government doctrine so we'll be playing that
[00:50.960 --> 00:59.760]  video report coming up it's on info wars.com very very telling so I guess they can be the new
[00:59.760 --> 01:06.640]  Swiss guard for his papal excellency I was at the gym this morning for about an hour and a half I
[01:06.640 --> 01:15.200]  walked in I got an elliptical to warm up and they had all the TVs on with the Pope about to speak
[01:15.200 --> 01:25.280]  with Obama speaking and so instead of listening to music I sat there and watched it and it was obscene
[01:27.920 --> 01:35.920]  the stunts oh he didn't ride in a limo he rode in a fiat this is product placement for Italy fine
[01:37.040 --> 01:42.640]  and oh he's a man of the people he doesn't want you to have air conditioning or running water and
[01:42.640 --> 01:49.440]  that's moving forward and it's not good to be prosperous it's bad he gave that speech in Cuba
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.640]  how good it is to be poor how how it makes you a greater person well statistically that's not
[01:56.640 --> 02:01.920]  really true yes if you're ultra rich you tend to be more corrupt on average Christ was absolutely
[02:01.920 --> 02:09.200]  right when he said it's easier for a rich man or it's easier for camel to go to the eye of a needle
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.800]  than it is for a rich man to get into heaven of course he was pointing directly at the gate
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.640]  one of the smallest gates in Jerusalem
[02:18.800 --> 02:26.960]  that a camel would have to get on its knees to go through because it's only about five feet tall
[02:28.240 --> 02:35.280]  so see all of this is in context but just selling the idea that prosperity and wealth itself
[02:35.280 --> 02:49.600]  is evil is cultural warfare it is class envy it is classical cultural Marxism 101 and it's
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.440]  always from Warren Buffett or the Pope or David Rockefeller or the Queen of England it's always
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.280]  some organization and some organizational leader controlling trillions and trillions and trillions
[03:01.280 --> 03:10.720]  of untold dollars and euros and land and banks and private jets and helicopters and palaces
[03:11.600 --> 03:19.440]  lecturing people that they can't have prosperity as if prosperity itself is inherently bad the new
[03:21.680 --> 03:29.840]  prosperity is hating yourself austerity and not having anything while the leader tax exempt
[03:29.840 --> 03:34.640]  and live in the equivalent of modern elysium fields
[03:39.360 --> 03:44.320]  you don't hear the pope criticizing Saudi Arabia for its incredible separation of
[03:44.320 --> 03:50.320]  haves and have nots in a command and control economy where fraudulently the royal house
[03:50.320 --> 03:58.000]  has 95 of the wealth 95 you don't hear from the pope that since we went into a collectivist world
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.280]  system that the west has gone from having depending on which sector which area roughly
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.400]  five percent of the population with maybe thirty forty fifty percent of the wealth depending on
[04:10.400 --> 04:17.440]  what error now it's one percent with more than half so the more collectivist it gets the more
[04:17.440 --> 04:23.440]  ultra rich you get and the more giant masses of poor you have which is why you've always got
[04:23.440 --> 04:30.960]  monopoly men like pope Francis engaging in class warfare saying let's redistribute wealth
[04:30.960 --> 04:34.880]  because they want to control all the wealth because it's a weapon against their monopoly
[04:35.680 --> 04:40.000]  i mean look at these sickening headlines white house compares president to the pope
[04:41.360 --> 04:47.280]  they say in the washington post other publications that obama is basking in his aura
[04:47.280 --> 04:56.160]  the aura of soran faithful facing waver religious freedom challenges and more stay with us
[04:59.040 --> 05:04.400]  k daniels info wars dot com did you know that pope frances has strong ties to communism
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.880]  frances is a member of the jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology which many
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.200]  have labeled christianized marxism they're the reason why communism and socialism has
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.360]  persevered for so long in latin america and it's not a coincidence that cuba's current
[05:17.360 --> 05:23.120]  leader rile castro prays pope frances for his anti-cafas stands castro like frances was also
[05:23.120 --> 05:28.400]  brought up by the jesuits starting to make sense now why frances is constantly calling for carbon
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.120]  taxes and more government and also did you know the recent reconciliation between the us and cuba
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.480]  was spearheaded by pope frances to the benefit of castro vatican researcher leo zigami wrote an
[05:38.480 --> 05:43.440]  excellent article on info wars dot com entitled vatican flag to fly over the new world order
[05:43.440 --> 05:49.120]  which breaks it all down zigami wrote rock obama and rile castros mundalis left his agenda is

[08:15.520 --> 08:27.920]  i'm gonna do some things today that i haven't done successfully in more than 15 years i've
[08:27.920 --> 08:31.920]  on air almost 21 years and early on in talk radio
[08:34.880 --> 08:39.840]  before i went to this television setup i would have a big bank of calls direct in front of me
[08:39.840 --> 08:44.720]  with flashing lights and a screen right in front of my face where i would see the callers and then i
[08:44.720 --> 08:48.800]  would just go to one after the other sometimes i've ran for an hour or two hours sometimes i
[08:48.800 --> 08:54.720]  have a guest on for an hour or two hours but most days most nights back then i was a talk show host
[08:54.720 --> 09:01.840]  at night i would take sometimes a hundred phone calls and when i've attempted this the last few
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.920]  years i've got a little bit better i'll take 30 40 calls if i really try you're in the whole show
[09:05.920 --> 09:11.600]  but i think today we've got peter schiff coming on about his accurate prediction that they would
[09:11.600 --> 09:18.400]  not uh up interest rates well i've opened phones on economics with him but i think it's important in
[09:18.400 --> 09:25.280]  the first hour and the third hour today to take a lot of phone calls on the pope what do you think
[09:25.280 --> 09:32.000]  of his visit but so we can get to callers just don't thank me and just please get specifically to
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.840]  what you think of this pope what you think of this visit make your point i'm gonna go to the next
[09:35.840 --> 09:41.760]  person that way we can get to all of you it's not a slide on anyone it's an act of respect that i would
[09:41.760 --> 09:53.360]  try to control the show more and actually go to your calls 800 259 9231 800 259 9231
[09:54.160 --> 10:00.960]  is the toll-free number to join us 800 259 9231 oh and one last provides though first time callers
[10:00.960 --> 10:07.120]  in the first few rounds then we'll have a free for all coming up in the second and third hour 800
[10:07.120 --> 10:17.440]  259 9231 we have a clip we're going to be playing pope frances says climate change cannot be ignored
[10:18.080 --> 10:25.840]  and he calls it air pollution water vapor and carbon dioxide two elements of the carbon cycle
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.040]  flow without those two elements we would have no life on terra firma this planet
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.200]  the third rock out from the sun in this solar system
[10:40.640 --> 10:44.880]  we need water we need sunlight we need carbon dioxide
[10:47.120 --> 10:53.200]  carbon dioxide water sunshine ladies and gentlemen
[10:53.200 --> 11:02.480]  and of course oxygen and they are attacking two of the four legs of the stool and only abject
[11:02.480 --> 11:09.840]  total mindless ignorance could bring us to this point i was in the gym this morning and i was
[11:09.840 --> 11:18.160]  watching a whole bunch of people because they had all the tv's for every reason focused on the
[11:18.160 --> 11:28.000]  jesuit socialist slash marxist pope clearly acting like he's this big deep smart person
[11:29.760 --> 11:37.120]  and and and sitting there in his white robes for his great purity
[11:37.120 --> 11:48.240]  selling dehumanization deindustrialization and genocide those aren't words that's what he's
[11:48.240 --> 11:55.440]  doing to usher in the one world government and it's capstone a global carbon tax to track and
[11:55.440 --> 11:59.840]  trace every movement we make to tax every movement we make and to totally control
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.920]  society and to selectively enforce the takedown of all human activity because if you tax what
[12:05.920 --> 12:13.920]  humans exhaled as the new york times set a decade ago a tax on breathing and if you then
[12:14.800 --> 12:22.080]  tax water vapor saying it's evil and tell folks it's pollution why you can get away with anything
[12:22.080 --> 12:31.280]  you want it really is unprecedented in fact let's just go to this clip of the pope praising
[12:31.280 --> 12:41.120]  president obama for the bill they introduced yesterday to further accelerate the shutdown
[12:41.120 --> 12:48.640]  of what industry we have left let's understand something spain germany the uk australia and
[12:48.640 --> 12:56.880]  the united states as well as canada are the world leaders in turning off carbon dioxide and water
[12:56.880 --> 13:06.800]  vapor and we're also the world leaders in losing our industrial base is crippling china india mexico
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.560]  and 160 plus other third world countries make zero cuts and don't even put scrubbers on their
[13:12.560 --> 13:20.720]  power plants or factories and are spewing pure death particular into the air and they'll do
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.040]  particular tests sometimes on the news and go yeah there's a lot of lead mercury arctic in the
[13:25.040 --> 13:33.120]  air must be our power plants must be our air they know full well the jet stream that comes in goes
[13:33.120 --> 13:39.280]  right over china picks all that up and dumps from the middle of new mexico to the middle of louisiana
[13:39.280 --> 13:45.680]  and central texas is the prime center of the toilet bowl in fact i really ought to move my
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.480]  family out of here talk about killing myself to live and i love texas everybody's like oh the
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.920]  allergies are whole horrible i was born here but now i'm sick all the time i can't breathe
[13:55.920 --> 14:04.400]  because china literally uses us as a porta potty i mean the studies are there look up
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.920]  jet stream from china dumps over texas the prime quadrant the center of the bullseye
[14:11.920 --> 14:20.640]  is austin texas because the jet stream comes in low from 30 40 000 feet and then dumps in
[14:20.640 --> 14:26.320]  point blank it moves back and forth but it dumps between new mexico and louisiana and it's just
[14:26.320 --> 14:31.280]  moving that particular coil of it it goes all around the world right over us there's other
[14:31.280 --> 14:39.600]  dump points as well i mean the pope said let's restrict dirty power plants enlisted the toxins
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.440]  and let's you know real real i'd be yeah yeah that's a good pope right there instead he's like
[14:44.400 --> 14:51.200]  the west must do more to cut the carbon emissions and the air pollution and they use the public's
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.280]  ignorance texas always gets haze and when it rains in the late uh spring my dad's a pilot
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.480]  he's been a pilot since he was 13 he grew up witnessing it in east texas and every time
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.080]  you get up in the morning and it rained during the night and by noon there's a haze they get on
[15:08.080 --> 15:14.160]  the news and they say smog alert that's why we need all these emissions controls and the news will
[15:14.160 --> 15:25.840]  say look at the smog yeah it's smog when you're in la and there's mountains blocking that bowl
[15:28.400 --> 15:34.640]  when the settlers showed up from spain they wrote about la and talked about the indians
[15:34.640 --> 15:43.440]  the natives fires creating a a haze in the sky but i don't want to digress off into all of this
[15:45.680 --> 15:51.120]  it's just amazing to know that what the pope's pushing is a death sentence
[15:53.040 --> 15:57.520]  and everything he says is alive basically he comes out and says i'm not a leftist
[15:57.520 --> 16:07.760]  but he's going to meet with america's prisoners in prisons and basically say free them but he
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.520]  wouldn't criticize castro and all of his political dissidents upwards of a half million that are in
[16:13.520 --> 16:24.640]  prison and they've shut down a bunch of subways and things you know he would have flown by helicopter
[16:24.640 --> 16:28.800]  and said i don't want to create a traffic jam i'm going to fly by helicopter but instead he did the
[16:28.800 --> 16:33.360]  whole big motorcade to shut everything down but don't worry he did the stunt of riding in a fiat
[16:33.360 --> 16:35.600]  look he's a little guy he's normal
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.480]  and he was protected by the border patrol they've got them off the northern border now to protect
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.400]  him which is fitting because he doesn't want us to have a border but he lives behind 35 and 40 foot
[16:50.400 --> 16:58.400]  and 50 foot walls around the vatican city he's got a giant fortress full of swiss paramilitary
[16:58.400 --> 17:07.120]  guards hired mercenaries the vatican is rumored to have hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.480]  they admittedly own more property than anybody in the world are you see the vatican selling
[17:12.480 --> 17:19.280]  that property quote give it to the port no it's all meant to sell austerity to us to train us
[17:19.280 --> 17:25.920]  to be abject slaves yeah and i apologize you might say 35 50 foot walls at some points the
[17:25.920 --> 17:32.160]  vatican walls are over 100 feet tall as tv viewers can see right there that at that point it's well
[17:32.160 --> 17:42.960]  over 100 feet tall tax exempt and i got to sit here and hear this slime bag that's what he is
[17:43.920 --> 17:48.640]  of a captured catholic church taken over by the pedophiles blackmailed by the left
[17:48.640 --> 17:58.320]  and now that they've taken it over worldwide you're hearing total and complete worship by the media a
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.200]  basque in his glow an angel christlike oh he's so wonderful
[18:08.160 --> 18:12.880]  he's calling for one world religion oh my gosh let's go to the sickening clip here it is
[18:12.880 --> 18:25.600]  as the son of an immigrant family i'm happy to be a guest in this country
[18:26.400 --> 18:40.080]  which was largely built by such families during my visit i will have the honor of addressing congress
[18:40.080 --> 18:51.840]  where i hope as a brother of this country to offer words of encouragement to those called to
[18:51.840 --> 19:02.160]  guide the nation's political future in fidelity to its founding principles i find it encouraging
[19:02.160 --> 19:11.360]  that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution
[19:11.360 --> 19:20.640]  it's not air pollution it's carbon dioxide and water accepting the urgency it seems clear to me
[19:20.640 --> 19:33.280]  also that climate change is a problem we can no longer be left to a future generation okay
[19:33.920 --> 19:39.440]  and uh bro is the erstal center of the universe just just asking because you're the big scientist
[19:39.440 --> 19:47.120]  here and you tell us what reality is if he gets his way a billion people will starve to death
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.560]  the next 10 years i mean it's just a death sentence to the third world but everyone says we must
[19:52.560 --> 20:01.120]  bask in his glow i'm gonna vomit we'll be right back most of us already know that taking a fish

[24:06.560 --> 24:10.880]  welcome back i'm alice jones your host the globalists are making their move right now
[24:10.880 --> 24:16.800]  their concerted effort to establish a planetary government that taxes all human activity under
[24:16.800 --> 24:23.120]  carbon taxes the UN admits that over a hundred billion dollars has been spent in the last 30
[24:23.120 --> 24:27.760]  years promoting the idea of global warming now that's been proven to be a fraud they just say
[24:27.760 --> 24:34.240]  climate change period they're the saviors you live like they say you live or you are a enviro
[24:34.240 --> 24:40.880]  terrorist while they genetically engineer while they toxic waste dump while they create chimera
[24:40.880 --> 24:47.360]  species while they try to play god and literally destroy the planet we hear nothing from the pup
[24:47.360 --> 24:55.520]  about baby organ harvesting in america we hear nothing from him about the big mega central
[24:55.520 --> 25:00.560]  banks looting everyone and being tax exempt it's all how the public shouldn't have air conditioning
[25:00.560 --> 25:08.880]  and shouldn't have cars this is to make us poor and totally control us it is a vicious criminal
[25:08.880 --> 25:16.320]  attack and that's why the pope gave his speech in cuba you can pull up the transcript in spanish
[25:18.240 --> 25:24.800]  where he says the beauty of the poor the grace of the poor how any type of wealth is bad how the
[25:24.800 --> 25:33.440]  poor are the better well that's how the communists want you the ultra rich above the law with the
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.440]  pope with a completely captured catholic church and folks people say that john poll you know the
[25:39.440 --> 25:45.360]  second stuff wasn't good whatever he criticized communism he promoted free market because he
[25:45.360 --> 25:51.040]  promoted family he promoted not having abortion people claimed he had been a new world order take
[25:51.040 --> 25:59.040]  over and i didn't go along with that but let me tell you this guy is bad news i mean he's really
[25:59.040 --> 26:04.320]  bad he will hurt poor people and that's the worst part that i'm going to your phone calls i was there
[26:04.320 --> 26:11.280]  in the gym this morning and i watched an immigrant because i talked to the guys the nice guys here
[26:11.280 --> 26:20.320]  legally uh west african janitor cleaning up some trash cans wiping some stuff off and he had such
[26:20.320 --> 26:27.120]  pride looking at obama and looking at the pope and just had loving his eyes when those two would
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.960]  slit his throat in a minute if they thought it'd give him more power i mean there's no debating
[26:32.960 --> 26:41.120]  this is in my opinion these are evil evil men and they've just got these hard work and poor people
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.760]  with all this austerity talk and how beautiful it is to be poor and we're going to get the rich
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.320]  people and you know we're going to redistribute the wealth when it's designed to destroy any avenue
[26:52.320 --> 26:58.160]  they've got to become self-sufficient it's total plantation behavior
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.360]  you know who invented the plantations the romans
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.880]  and you know who picked them back up with some of their operations in latin america
[27:13.520 --> 27:20.160]  in mesoamerica and the americas the jesuits most of the other catholic orders did not keep people
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.680]  as slaves and it did it actually built people up i've studied the history in depth there was
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.880]  abuses here abuses there but in many areas it was a force to build up civilization and actually
[27:30.880 --> 27:36.480]  empower people there were a lot of abuses i'm not defending it but comparing it to the jesuits the
[27:36.480 --> 27:43.760]  jesuits created communism marx and engels just picked it back up and i always knew this i read
[27:43.760 --> 27:47.280]  it in the history books i understood it but i didn't think the public could understand it
[27:47.280 --> 27:53.440]  between jesuits and catholics there's a lot of different jesuits out there who aren't in the
[27:53.440 --> 27:59.280]  inner circles that aren't aware of this who mean well i know that for a fact and now though you
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.560]  cannot deny that the jesuits are making a planetary pull for a world government with
[28:04.560 --> 28:11.040]  communist philosophy with the world elite exempt from at all the new royalty i mean this is an
[28:11.040 --> 28:21.440]  obama nation desolation this is just unspeakably cold-blooded and evil to watch him sit up there
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.760]  with his hand out to all these poor people promising them a future knowing full well in
[28:27.760 --> 28:36.560]  virginia 21 which he's endorsing fully it's designed to impoverish i mean i'm not getting
[28:36.560 --> 28:45.120]  tears by us right now it was melodrama my physical body my cells and my spirit literally gets chills
[28:45.120 --> 28:50.320]  up my back a headache and i start crying i started crying on the elliptical sort of getting tears in
[28:50.320 --> 28:54.800]  my eyes and i i asked them to turn some of it off and folks were kind of sick of it so they
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.760]  started turning it off it was on eight different televisions because they're going to kill a billion
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.640]  people with this with this alone i mean a billion people Stalin said one person is a one man dies
[29:06.640 --> 29:13.280]  it's a tragedy 10 000 dies is statistic and it's just like you're not going to hear a word out of
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.920]  them about the millions of kids being harvested can't believe i'm saying millions of kids being
[29:17.920 --> 29:22.160]  harvested a whole bunch of democratic party groups came out yesterday and endorsed pedophilia
[29:22.160 --> 29:31.680]  i mean they're just moving on every front god help us god help us i i mean they are just taken
[29:31.680 --> 29:36.960]  over and everything else forced inoculations they're announcing our kids belong to them
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.600]  they're opening the borders they're just engaged in every evil you can imagine i mean these people
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.880]  are statements i will say it hope frances is a devil worship i can tell you right now he wants
[29:46.880 --> 29:54.640]  to kill people we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.040 --> 30:05.280]  a new global news fact checking project was announced yesterday and it will be funded by two
[30:05.280 --> 30:12.080]  organizations with close ties to the obama white house the project which says it will be focused
[30:12.080 --> 30:18.560]  on holding public officials accountable is funded by grants from the omittier network and the national
[30:18.560 --> 30:24.640]  endowment for democracy the omittier network is headed up by ebay founder pierre omittier
[30:24.640 --> 30:30.960]  visitor logs reveal that omittier has visited the white house a half a dozen times since 2009
[30:30.960 --> 30:37.440]  the national endowment for democracy nad is infamously known for their role in uprisings
[30:37.440 --> 30:44.000]  attempted coups and acts of regime change so it's operation mockingbird all over again as these
[30:44.000 --> 30:50.240]  connections clearly illustrate how the white house funded news fact checking project will

[33:12.880 --> 33:21.840]  dot com front line report it's alex jones you know i can't help it i had a headache i was upset
[33:21.840 --> 33:27.840]  until i called the pope of devil worship and now i feel better because if you won't talk about the
[33:27.840 --> 33:33.120]  mass harvesting of dead babies if you won't talk about gmo's destroying god's creation on record
[33:33.120 --> 33:38.640]  causing incredible mutations and animals that eat it if you won't talk about how the world government
[33:38.640 --> 33:44.320]  has a plan to carry out eugenics how the eu is meant to enslave europe no instead he promotes
[33:45.120 --> 33:50.400]  the eu he promotes carbon taxes he promotes things that we know are a massive death sentence
[33:51.680 --> 33:57.040]  do you understand folks that in the third world if 50 percent of your income starts going to food
[33:57.040 --> 34:02.400]  above that line massive starvation kicks in 40 plus million people starve to death every year
[34:02.400 --> 34:09.920]  it was 30 million just a decade ago and if they cut off the carbon to the third world you will see
[34:09.920 --> 34:16.640]  massive die-offs so he wants to flood the west with third world populations to politically control
[34:16.640 --> 34:22.480]  them and make them socialist but then not help those countries they destroy libya they destroy
[34:22.480 --> 34:30.960]  south africa they destabilize countries not a word about the economic hitman in latin america
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.440]  not a word about all this when he first got in three years ago two and a half years ago
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.360]  he did say there's too much debt debt needs to be forgiven by these central banks but it was and i
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.920]  was like that's pretty good i don't usually like leftist but that's a and then it was all just right
[34:45.920 --> 34:50.640]  at front a little bit of good stuff and i was like i don't know about pope frances he might be good
[34:50.640 --> 34:57.680]  and then now he's just letting us know who he is it is a death sentence yes i'm for free market
[34:57.680 --> 35:05.200]  it's not free market if nigeria in 1949 you can look this up bars a billion dollars they've paid
[35:05.200 --> 35:10.960]  over a hundred billion in interest on it and they still owe over a hundred billion on it is it fair
[35:10.960 --> 35:18.400]  to pay 200 billion on a billion that's loan sharking all over the country they're changing
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.040]  laws where used to you couldn't have payday loans you know with 20 interest a week they're getting
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.520]  rid of the laws the republicans are going along with the democrats in places like arkansas
[35:27.520 --> 35:35.360]  to screw people over interest is fine but there should be laws on abusing poor people and that's
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.400]  what i don't like yes there are some poor people that choose to be poor who are very austere very
[35:40.400 --> 35:47.520]  christ like my dad had an older cousin who invented uh just a very famous piece of computer equipment
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.920]  and made fabulous amounts of money i'm gonna leave it at that fabulous he gave it all to the
[35:53.920 --> 36:01.200]  salvation army and drove around an almost broke down car ministering to people he's not alive
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.160]  anymore now that is christlike when the pope talks about being poor and the spirit of the poor
[36:06.160 --> 36:12.080]  that's when you choose to be like that christ could have been the king of the planet but he
[36:12.080 --> 36:19.360]  chose to be poor as an example to not distract people from the message but the pope twists that
[36:19.360 --> 36:24.000]  with austere that's so cool to be poor that's what obama went to african said you can't have
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.920]  air conditioning you can't have cars not we got to make them cleaner we got to make them better
[36:27.920 --> 36:35.040]  just look you're not getting them and if you give the african's cars and if you give them air
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.160]  conditioning and if you give them industry i mean wouldn't you love it if africa was big
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.560]  beautiful hotels and those wonderful lakes and resorts and you could just jump on an airplane
[36:42.560 --> 36:48.080]  and go there and hang out but the globalists don't want that they want on record to the royal
[36:48.080 --> 36:53.280]  commission on population 1949 to keep them in squalor to control them so they can get the
[36:53.280 --> 37:02.640]  resources for nothing africa has been held down and it's the same message that's what
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.520]  the modern catholic church wants that's what obama wants it's what the socialists want
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.800]  is a bunch of dumbed down idiots that they control anthony you're here to cover health news we're

[40:00.080 --> 40:08.240]  not prosecute in fatal car crash because it's a god all right tell me your your your take i mean
[40:08.240 --> 40:13.600]  listening to the pope it sounded like i would use that voice for like an evil spider that
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.920]  crawls in people's ears and takes control of them in a movie that once the alien spiders are in your
[40:17.920 --> 40:23.440]  brain that's what you sound like is the pope i mean you know i don't want to say he's a pbp but i'm
[40:23.440 --> 40:28.480]  telling you it's a great tonality isn't it yeah we know the pope had a great pr marketing strategy
[40:28.480 --> 40:32.160]  whoever was on his advisory team was amazing because in the very beginning he came out and
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.160]  said a lot of really good things that everyone liked it was universal it was beyond party lines
[40:36.160 --> 40:40.480]  you know we should help people oh my god this pope is amazing how could he say those things and then
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.880]  he comes here and he's like we need to come together it's your fault all these things are
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.240]  higher than taxes coming coming and it's interesting too because you notice no one actually talks
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.320]  about the solutions they always blame other people right so the pope and obama up there saying it's
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.400]  people that have money in the united states that you're the reason africa is destabilized no i'm
[40:58.400 --> 41:03.200]  pretty sure it's actually people like you that just destabilized africa it was obama they blew
[41:03.200 --> 41:08.080]  up libya absolutely and they go in and they do bombing runs and they say people in america that
[41:08.080 --> 41:14.880]  make over $50,000 per year are evil it's like it's total mental illness they don't realize that they
[41:14.880 --> 41:19.120]  realize they're the ultra rich class warfare of course of course but they don't talk about real
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.840]  injustices like you're talking about these insane pedophile articles means it's demented it's
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.400]  absolutely insane but they're up there talking about things that are global issues sure but
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.000]  they're blaming the wrong parties and they're contriving it making it all weird and stuff and
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.360]  obama's sitting up there just listening and just not did you see obama basking in the glow the media
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.640]  said of course well he bows to the pope too we've all seen that you know so time and time again it
[41:42.640 --> 41:47.280]  reminds us that these people come in and blame us for things that they're doing and i'm tired of it
[41:47.280 --> 41:51.440]  i mean it's just like the the banking cartel blaming us for the economy and you ruined the 2008
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.160]  economy because you bought houses really is that what happened they blame us for everything that they
[41:56.160 --> 42:01.040]  do and no you gave loans and ran scams and gave them the poor people that couldn't pay it but that
[42:01.040 --> 42:06.240]  was a distraction that's not the reason for the subprime it's admitted they sold the same houses
[42:06.240 --> 42:14.320]  10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 in some cases over 100 times in the derivatives market the central banks
[42:14.320 --> 42:19.920]  did it not me yep and it's all fake money but notice they got the poor the actual poor that we
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.000]  care about and actually want to talk about every day they got the poor and then they blame the
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.720]  middle class americans right they don't they don't know where would the poor be if the middle class
[42:28.720 --> 42:32.800]  wasn't getting their haircut wasn't getting their car wash wasn't getting their yard cut i mean it's
[42:32.800 --> 42:38.720]  just insane and it's it's also the people don't seem to understand they're being blamed you we
[42:38.720 --> 42:42.720]  all are part of this class that they're blaming they're not blaming the point zero zero one percent
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.240]  they're saying anyone that has anything but francis is blaming poverty on the middle class americans
[42:48.240 --> 42:54.560]  when every actuary shows wealth true independent wealth creates more wealth and makes people around
[42:54.560 --> 42:58.640]  it rich well they know that too but not to mention they're the ones gutting the poor and then blaming
[42:58.640 --> 43:03.840]  us it's total insanity if they are doing the exact same things they're claiming we're doing it's
[43:03.840 --> 43:09.280]  making a construct of fear and self-blame last warfare exactly it's class warfare but they're
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.160]  getting away with it and footing us with the bill it's a total scam system oh yeah it's just insane
[43:14.880 --> 43:19.120]  well i want to see i want to do a white house petition to have the white house ask the pope
[43:19.120 --> 43:24.400]  to give up first disclose the secret bank accounts and property of the vatican remedy the greatest
[43:24.400 --> 43:28.800]  in the world and that they have half of it to the poor you know how much secret stuff they have in
[43:28.800 --> 43:32.720]  the vatican all this insanity are going on over there they don't even disclose what they even have
[43:33.360 --> 43:37.120]  relics and everything like that they admittedly own the most private land in the world
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.480]  yep but that's fine that he's not the vatican is great don't you understand we the queen of
[43:42.480 --> 43:46.720]  england shoots her mouth off about raising taxes for the poor and she's the second biggest landowner
[43:46.720 --> 43:52.000]  in the world i mean shut up you witch they don't understand that money well they understand her too
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.640]  they're blaming us but with wealth comes great responsibility to actually help people and you
[43:56.640 --> 44:00.720]  can choose to morally do that you can be like henry ford and build factories and pay folks
[44:00.720 --> 44:04.880]  enough to buy your car and i don't think henry ford was perfect he had a lot of problems but
[44:04.880 --> 44:09.360]  he understood an economy that makes everybody wealthy is what would be good for manufacturing
[44:09.360 --> 44:14.000]  and build a civilization the globalists want to go the opposite against that they want to
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.320]  shut down civilization and have it be unevenly distributed let's go to phone calls i want to
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.600]  get into your your your health news here in a moment thanks for holding first up mark in tennessee
[44:23.600 --> 44:28.080]  you're on the air talk about his lordship his excellency uh they had horns going
[44:30.640 --> 44:34.880]  i mean it's like the royalty had arrived but i guess he is the oldest longest serving
[44:34.880 --> 44:38.960]  continual total monarch by the way why is a religious figure on all of our television
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.040]  screens but at the same time they're trashing saying that any form of belief is evil and that
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.360]  nothing is real but oh it's worse if the oh it's like they say heterosexual stuff is now bad and
[44:47.360 --> 44:52.000]  evil and families are bad but pedophilia is good so basic christian values are bad we're
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.560]  being persecuted but oh this guy he's fine he's great though because he says what what they
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.240]  believe in he's the talking well the reason he's great is they have stuff bigger than the swiss
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.760]  bank accounts and the elite put their money in there right so all christian values are bad except
[45:03.760 --> 45:08.400]  when the pope comes then he is a worshipful king of all of ours and we should listen to
[45:08.400 --> 45:13.040]  every word he says makes sense yep mark are you from tennessee thanks for calling go ahead

[49:53.760 --> 50:00.960]  little points here um with the uh jesuit pope you're exactly right on the money this guy is
[50:00.960 --> 50:07.040]  about as bad as they get if you research jesuits i encourage everyone to do so but um this stuff's
[50:07.040 --> 50:13.040]  been on my mind since last night had a dream and in my dream uh you've seen the signs no
[50:13.040 --> 50:19.520]  justice no peace yes and in the dream the signs changed and they said which get here my hair
[50:19.520 --> 50:25.360]  stood up but it said no character no rights and then i'm like holy cow how everything's such an
[50:25.360 --> 50:32.400]  abomination and the the worst parts of humanity are being accepted and pushed like you said demoralize
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.560]  us and the fact is no character no rights and that's that's exactly how they'll bring us down
[50:38.560 --> 50:44.400]  through this but on the jesuits they would come into uh they would start a conflict keep them
[50:44.400 --> 50:48.800]  apart and if it looked like they would get back together then the jesuit they would send in a
[50:48.800 --> 50:53.760]  jesuit to get them to shake hands and then the credit goes to the jesuits and then also there
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.560]  was about a hundred different uh world leaders throughout history i gotta jump i gotta jump

[56:18.880 --> 56:23.840]  fruit intake from fruit juices over here and why that's coming up briefly we got some really
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.840]  exciting news we did a limited run of this at first it's sold out in a week child ease is back in
[56:29.840 --> 56:35.600]  this is a big four ounce bottle of basically herbs and essential oils this is the number one
[56:35.600 --> 56:41.440]  national bestseller private label to us and we sell it at a little bit lower price uh but i might
[56:41.440 --> 56:46.240]  even say the company it's just this is anthony tell folks child ease is now back in you give your
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.520]  kids a couple tablespoons of this one in the morning one at night it just absolutely changes
[56:51.520 --> 56:57.360]  in in my experience their entire mood and outlook it works like a charm tell folks about child ease
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.000]  that's right so the original formula has been sold for 20 years we tweaked it added some stuff made
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.840]  it in my opinion a little bit better but it has been one of the best sellers for 20 years though i
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.080]  think this formula is even more powerful though and it has been sold out for months i mean you
[57:10.080 --> 57:13.200]  launched i think it sold out in two weeks and we haven't had it for months because it's really hard
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.000]  to make this new specific formula that we have and it has things like chamomile sorry i forgot
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.840]  that point it's a tweak i'm a nationwide bestseller yeah yeah so that's like things like lemon
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.920]  balm extract and chamomile and what's cool is also i think in that folder over there we have some
[57:25.920 --> 57:29.280]  reviews from people that talked about using it for their kids but they're also using it for
[57:29.280 --> 57:34.400]  themselves so it's not just for kids it's made for children it's made to naturally soothe their
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.360]  brains and kind of relax them a little bit because if you think about it with the television and the
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.240]  insanity and the food additives kids are more stressed out now than ever before i think yeah i

[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.600]  my daughter you know was starting to get ready to go through puberty she hasn't yet but she's
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.320]  really gross spurting she'd wake up some at night do stuff if i religiously give this to her
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.320]  she sleeps the night doesn't wake up wandering around that you know instead of you know drink out

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.920]  products don't taste good so that's a different thing too but so we talked about earlier some
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.600]  people are just taking themselves not just giving it to their kids this is from button in canada
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.840]  says helps me focus in a calm natural way i take it with supermail vitality and other info

[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.600]  giving it to their kids and i've done that as well obviously testing it out and it really does
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.760]  just kind of calm you out i think it's a great product overall not just for children but it
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.200]  is specifically made for kids and i don't have side effects from brain force but sometimes
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:11.120]  i take it a little too late and then i can't go to sleep and i drink about a double dose of this
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.240]  consult your physician first but i take a good good lead dose of it if you take it with knockout
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.880]  though whoa i wouldn't do that because the two combined i've done that but i'd say a knockout
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.040]  works like a charm it's back in this is how we find the operation i mean we've set out
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.080]  to bringing the most hardcore affordable products out there that are true game changers so some of
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.920]  them are just famous you know staples that we've tweaked for major manufacturers that are high
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:39.200]  quality others are game changers that we've basically invented like dna force absolutely dna
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.640]  force 20 off info warslife.com okay the few minutes we got left anthony i know you're going to be
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.400]  hosting the show tomorrow in the fourth hour but let's get into this other news so 28 years for
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.760]  salmonella peanut executive has been sentenced to 28 years which is pretty much a life sentence for
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.800]  him did he really know they were shipping it out apparently apparently but it's really just to make
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.880]  a statement to everyone else right this is really just a scare food producers a federal judge handed
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.840]  parnell a 28 year prison sentence the toughest penalty ever for a corporate executive in a
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.800]  food poisoning outbreak he's 61 and unless he wins an appeal he will serve out most of his term
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.800]  his brother and food broker also received a 20 year sentence and the plant's quality assurance
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.880]  manager was given five years so that's a big deal and then here's one here's a quote although his
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.360]  sentence is less than maximum it is the longest sentence ever in a food poisoning case but but
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.080]  did he admit because i followed it some it couldn't find out did he admit that he knowingly did it
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.520]  it's really really complex here's an example though hospitals cover up deadly fungus kills a
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.280]  bunch of people that's in the news they don't get in trouble well meanwhile i was going to say also
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.960]  big drug manufacturers and like it just came out that the paxil metadata showed that it caused
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.920]  suicide in teens but they just pay fines and no one cares or Pfizer pays fines so the point is
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.800]  they selectively burn people when they want because that guy was a smaller manufacturer
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.200]  they're setting the present to go after little guys well that's how tyson shut down all the
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.160]  other chicken produce there's a bigger piece too there's an article in forbs that says fda needs
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.960]  more funding and it came out because of this so they're going to say hey there was salmonella in
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.920]  this peanut in this peanut butter we need to get more money for the fda and bureaucratic systems
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.080]  to look at everybody harder we need to have more billions of dollars for this or else people are
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.160]  going to die meanwhile big farmer does whatever they want and kills everybody but it's like oh
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.120]  there was salmonella and peanut butter we need to get more funding for the fda immediately more
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:36.080]  bureaucracy but if you're a tyson you can have thousands of violations you don't get in trouble
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:41.840]  but a small mom and pop you're shut down for one exactly it's setting a precedent big corporations
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.640]  do what they want the chickens sit in generations of their own feces that's fine mon santo does whatever
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:52.160]  they want uh simply insane thank you anthony good she already great job more on that tomorrow when he

[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.000]  it's not a coincidence that cuba's current leader rile castro prays pope francis for his

[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:01.680]  the federal reserve would not raise interest rates now they're saying it might come in a few months
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.960]  and i was talking when i was in oma ham over the weekend where there is a federal reserve
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:15.760]  based bank system i was talking to someone who works for the federal reserve i'm just gonna
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:22.800]  leave it at that and they said at least from their fed head that they didn't think it was a good idea
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:29.520]  that rates hadn't gone up and that they were pressuring out of that particular based bank
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.800]  was tied into kansas city but the oma ham ranch was pressuring them to raise interest rates
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:43.600]  and i told this federal reserve official that i thought that peter schiff and others were right
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.720]  that they couldn't raise them because that would really make the economy implode obviously
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.640]  peter schiff said they should raise them but they're not going to raise them and he's been
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:10:01.920]  proven right yet again so peter schiff joins us euro pac.com now we're going to then also get into
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.680]  some of the other reports that tie into this whole cashless society control grid intelligent car

[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:38.320]  u.s government policy to allow afghan allies to rape little boys you cannot make this up
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:46.800]  and now democratic party connected publications like salon are coming out saying don't be mean
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:56.400]  to pedophiles it's only their sexual attraction it's their persuasion don't be hateful so what
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.480]  of your persuasion was torturing women to death would that be okay i mean i was watching this
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.240]  video from a university with feminists saying basically all sex is rape and university reports
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.480]  23 of women have been patted or kissed at parties and that's right now so so men
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.680]  patting a woman on the rear end at a drunken party is rape but
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:26.160]  body parts of babies being sold that's no big deal and pedophilia being promoted that's okay
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.000]  and putting transgender bathrooms into confused kids is okay i mean this is a takeover
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.120]  that is taking place and i'm all over the map here i've never really asked petershift
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.120]  his take on the moral decline of this country i know he's kind of a paleo conservative slash
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.880]  libertarian was ron paul's chief advisor in his first campaign uh but you know us libertarians
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:53.440]  are living let live but we're being conquered by the cultural marxist who really are driven by
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.120]  their need to overthrow everything good and decent and so i want to get into your prediction
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.160]  becoming you know accurate and true yet again where you see the economy going so much more the pubs
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.640]  visit phone calls whole nine yards whole shooting match but first off culturally petershift uh you
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:16.640]  know as a father as a husband uh as a patriot i mean do you ever do you ever scratch your head
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.040]  and think how much worse can it get i mean are liberals really this sick and freakish uh in their
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.440]  behavior i don't know if you've seen the article suddenly now the new movement is pedophilia uh
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:32.080]  what is your view on just all the craziness well look i don't know how much worse it's
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.280]  going to get but you know i wanted to go over with you how much worse it's gotten for my father
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.760]  and this probably shows you where we are at a nation when this is how we treat our our prisoners
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.960]  and of course remember my my dad being a political prisoner but he's nonviolent and i want to just
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.920]  for a book he wrote for a book he wrote the judge said 10 years ago you won't go to prison if you
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.480]  stop writing the book and stop speaking your father said no a true political president like
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.040]  north korea please continue urwin chef so let me tell you what happened so i went and visited him
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.600]  i hadn't seen him in a while because you know they isolated him out in uh fort worth texas
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.520]  supposedly because he could get better medical care there this is the irony of it he used to be
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:20.640]  at a place called odesville which was in new york close to my house easy to visit uh no long lines
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:26.800]  he liked it um you know there was a huge jewish population there he was like the canter rabbi
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.880]  you know he he was enjoying his uh captivity to the extent that you can but when he turned 80
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.320]  which was seven years ago they said well you're too old to be at odesville you need to be in this
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:44.160]  special camp and they sent them first to talarote indiana uh and then to fort worth texas but of
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.120]  course he rarely gets visitors because he doesn't know anybody you know i had to take a plane rent
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:55.200]  the car it's a big deal and by the way to interrupt you tara hoot is the maximum security execution
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.000]  center so they sent him to the most part they also have a they have a lower security facility he
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.760]  wasn't he wasn't there but it's not the camp that he was at in in odesville but in any event so
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.360]  i went to visit him and the way it works in this prison is depending on what your prison
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.080]  number is if it ends in an odd number an even number you can either visit on a saturday or
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.480]  sunday you can't visit on both days because a lot of people want to visit their loved ones on the
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.320]  weekends and so they split it up so my dad happened to be on a saturday now also they have visiting
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:33.120]  friday night so i booked my plane reservation about a week ago i flew in friday to visit him
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.520]  friday night i was going to see him saturday day you get about six or seven hours on saturday
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.040]  friday night was going to be a two-day visit so i got there on friday evening for the scheduled
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.320]  visiting hours and when i get there there's nobody there and there's a couple of guards there and
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.000]  they said well why are you here and i said well i'm here to visit my father he's an inmate and i
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.400]  said oh uh you know we don't do evening visits anymore uh we changed that last week and i said
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.800]  well gee why didn't you say something about it i mean i looked at the website i called up no one
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.200]  said anything and they said well you know we put a sign out front and i said well a sign out front
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.160]  what good does that do me i can't see from connecticut your sign here in fort worth i mean these guys
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.760]  couldn't care less that people are making arrangements based on the visiting hours and then
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.200]  they just changed them abruptly without note it without any total arrogance yeah in fact when i went
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.080]  back to my hotel room that night i checked the website and it still had the visiting hours being
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.800]  friday night they still haven't even put on the and the website that they changed it so anyway i
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.680]  came back the following morning and i got there when it started and of course it's not even that
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.840]  long a line maybe 40 people took me two hours to get in the front door you know i mean two hours on
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.760]  a line that wasn't that long that's how slow they process meanwhile in the parking lot is now filled
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:58.160]  you know because of some obama mandate all federal buildings have to have uh covered parking with
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.040]  solar panels and they're spending a fortune covering the parking lots with solar panels
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.440]  meanwhile you know there's there's no benches to even sit down when you're standing you know
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.800]  waiting for two hours but when i finally got in there they pulled me aside and they said oh
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.320]  we got some news for you so you can't just go right in and visit now i have no idea what it is
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.280]  far as i mean my father died so i'm waiting another 20 minutes or so in this little room
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.240]  for some woman to come out to tell me why i can't visit my father and it turns out that he had been
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:33.680]  admitted into the hospital the day before and of course they'll never tell you when they bring
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.800]  your loved one to the hospital because theoretically that's when we could plan the escape see if they
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.840]  told us that they were taking my father to the hospital we could you know you know try to ambush
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.240]  the ambulance and break him out of jail so to make sure that we don't do that they don't say
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.560]  anything so they tell me my father is in jail and by the way your dad has cancer we'd add that
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.000]  yes he has cancer so i go to the hospital and first of all in order to get into his room
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.640]  there's two armed guards right by his door armed guards guarding my dad he's 87 and he's almost
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.680]  blind he can in fact he couldn't even see my face he could just see a blurry outline of my face
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.360]  of course if they had taken care of his eyes he probably has really bad cataracts but maybe he
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.960]  could see but in any event they have two armed guards we're paying taxpayers to guard my 87-year-old
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.720]  father and i get in there he shackled to the bed right he's got a handcuffed around his ankle and
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.640]  he's you know he shackled to the bed but the thing is he and he's in he's in really bad shape and
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.480]  here's this is the the worst part about it so i got to talk to a doctor who had been examining him
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.280]  and probably i never would have been able to speak to this doctor had i not been in the hospital at
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:50.480]  the time and the doctor first tells me that my father when he was originally diagnosed with cancer
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.840]  according to the prison records he refused treatment now my father screamed like no i didn't
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.880]  why would i ever refuse treatment somehow because my father told me i said well what's the treatment
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.040]  that they're recommending and they told him there's nothing we can do there's no treatment but now
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.520]  according to the records my father refused treatment so they dummy the records up it's just
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:16.080]  a total collapse of civilization not carrying total fraud but here's the worst part so the doctor
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.800]  tells me now that the cancer has spread and she shows me his cat scans and that the cancer has
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.480]  spread to all these other organs at his body not just his lungs but she also says you know look at
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.800]  his head she sees these uh marks and she thinks he has melanoma and she thinks in her opinion and we
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.640]  don't have all the tests yet but what she thinks is that he doesn't really have a lung cancer he has
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:44.400]  melanoma that went undetected and untreated and spread to the rest of his body so in other words
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.680]  they brought my father to this facility because of how great the medical attention is he basically
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.800]  got no medical attention whatsoever he had melanoma which could have been cured probably a few years
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.600]  ago but they did nothing about it and they wait until it's basically infected his entire body
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.600]  and now i have no idea how much more time he has left to live i mean i don't know that he's even
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:08.240]  going to live to get out unbelievable i know this is hard for you but i probably had your dad on
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.840]  let's not exaggerate 30 times i got him help get him on the gc n radio network help get him syndicated
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.840]  probably one of the reasons he got in so much trouble this show but got very popular i picked up
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.160]  by a bunch of radio stations and i tell you usually i don't like to go out to eat and you know talk
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.400]  about politics with folks i get enough of it already i just your dad was so fun to eat dinner
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.880]  with i probably had dinner with your dad 10 times and it personally gets to me to think about him
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.760]  being tortured like this and he's and and then i think about you his son what you must be going
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.280]  through i mean he should be out of prison right now he's a political dissident just to see him
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:47.520]  there you know all by himself withering away maybe 140 pounds his skin and bones he's not eating
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.240]  he's all by himself you know i'm he's starting to lose his mental capacity probably dementia
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:57.680]  meanwhile you know everybody i talk to says yes we the people at the prison want him out
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.920]  right but he's still not out the bureaucracy the wheels turn so slowly we can't even get a dying
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.920]  man out of prison we have to sit him in a hospital with arm guards shackled to a bed he's got no
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.640]  visitors there's no family members around and basically the prison system killed him he's been
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.920]  in jail for 10 years already it was a 13 year sentence which really was a death sentence for a
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:25.760]  nonviolent so-called crime basically standing up for his constitutional rights standing up for
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:30.560]  the american people trying to get the government to abide by the constitution and this is what they
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:35.920]  do to him and they could do it to any of us people don't have empathy they're insane but i think
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.480]  people maybe your audience maybe we can do something to demand that they let them out we need i think
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:47.040]  we need a congressional investigation of the prison both in in texas at fort worth and in
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.400]  terrahote what kind of medical attention did my father receive you've got an elderly patient in
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.200]  your care or prisoner what medical attention did he get because you know we're all talking about
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:02.080]  turning over healthcare to the government obama care well the government is in charge of healthcare
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:08.880]  in a prison and this is what happens when the government is in charge of anything and it gets
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.760]  worse and worse and everybody passes the buck at every level there's a breakdown in fact i was
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:18.160]  thinking obama care earlier i'm glad you brought that up i mean we know it's hell in england we
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.800]  know it's bad in canada we know government on healthcare is a disaster and now we're going
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:28.960]  under it uh and and then now the left is so empowered they're now coming out for pedophilia
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.120]  i mean these people are insane think about how government works i asked the people why does
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.240]  he have to be chained to the bed well because it's not it's not comfortable to be lying in a bed
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.640]  when you're handcuffed to it and i said well can you at least take the cuffs off no those are
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:48.560]  regulations because you might escape how is my father 87 can barely walk and it's almost completely
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:53.760]  blind how is he going to overpower the two arms well see that's the centralization that's the
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.400]  centralization where i had great jelly i wasn't thinking about it a farmer's market in Omaha
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.200]  i was bringing it back to my mom they find it they interrogate me for 30 minutes why do i have this
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.240]  how dare me you know i'm lucky that i'm allowed to leave and with a straight face i said with a
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:13.360]  straight face my grape jelly's bad you know this is a joke and they said well sir it's our regulation
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.880]  see they don't give these people any leeway for common sense they're like robots now i know they
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.040]  can't think for themselves they're like well if we take the handcuffs off your off your dad
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.320]  well we have to do it for everybody no you don't you got an 87 year old guy that can barely walk
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.680]  and is legally blind take the cuffs off him he's not going anywhere yeah he was a 30 year old convicted
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.280]  pedophile child rapist came up the wall and punched him in the stomach i mean i'm being
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:43.280]  sarcastic but obviously a blind guy with cancer you don't need to chain him down no and especially
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.720]  when you have two armed guards where is he going to go there's no i mean it is insane but this is
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.680]  government this is how government operates this is how government functions that's why you want to
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.040]  absolutely limit government to its smallest possible capacity that's what the founding fathers
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.080]  tried to do with the constitution my father tried to stand up for that document and forced the
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.400]  government to abide by it because the courts have let the government get away with murder and in this
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.280]  case they are getting away with murder because they're murdering my dad well i know it must be hard for
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.760]  you uh did you tell them folks on the outside are rooting for him and that people are reading
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.280]  his book more than ever i did i did tell him i told him i was going to go on your show and
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.440]  i was going to talk about it you know he you know he wants to get the word out there he wants people
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:31.040]  to understand what's going on in this country and i tell you i've never seen him or listened to him
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.520]  more negative about what he thinks is going to happen economically i mean he is really really
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:40.240]  worried tell us what your dad has to say he's a smart guy tell us well you know he didn't he
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.880]  couldn't say much because he's losing his short term memory so he a lot of the things he just kept
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.120]  saying to me over and over again without any recollection that he had already told me but
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.840]  he is very concerned about the financial position of the u.s economy and what's going to happen when
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.840]  the dollar collapses or the fed has to or the congress has to admit that they can't make
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:02.560]  social security payments they can't make any of these payments and there's you know riots and food
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:10.080]  shortages and energy blackouts i mean he's really really nervous about the civil unrest that he sees
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:15.360]  developing in the united states as a result of this this problem blowing up but i think you know we
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.360]  can get into a later segment of next one and talk about you know what's going on in the economy and
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.720]  the federal i skipped the break let's get into the meat potatoes i'm not going to even play the
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.360]  clips you're on record at your opac dot com uh you were on record being criticized the national
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.760]  media for saying they will not raise interest rates uh and now they haven't raised interest rates
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.400]  break that down and the latest since you were on a month ago well first of all the important thing
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.640]  is the excuse right because everybody is still buying the lie this is part of the show so janet
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.560]  yellen came out and said okay like we were gonna raise interest rates but now we're not because of
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.200]  china like we're worried about these problems overseas and so we're not going to raise rates
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.960]  and the media buys it right but that's not the truth janet yellen is lying i said this in the
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.200]  beginning that they are going to come up with one excuse after another and it doesn't even matter
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.720]  what the excuse is it's whatever makes the most sense at the time whatever is the most convenient
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.080]  that's what they're going to blame it on because look what janet yellen said the same the same
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.080]  playbook she said we're not raising rates now but we may raise them in october well that's in six
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:23.120]  weeks well if the fed is so worried about the problems in china they're not going to go away
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.840]  in the next six weeks so why not say we're not raising rates in october either because that's
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.400]  not their playbook the script that they've been operating under is pretend we're going to raise
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.680]  interest rates in the future but just don't raise them now and the whole reason for this is to make
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.800]  believe that there's a real recovery and that they're confident they can raise rates and they come
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.040]  up with one excuse after another why they don't raise them because if they ever did raise them
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.520]  it would pierce the recovery myth because the air would come out of the bubble that much faster
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.640]  we'd be right back in recession we'd have another financial crisis and they'd be doing qe4 and they
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:04.400]  would look like fools and to show how disconnected they are even the fed head uh up in Omaha thinks
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.400]  they're really going to raise it in the next few months to show how the new york fed is keeping the
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.120]  other fed groups out of the loop break down how that whole group works because people think it's
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.320]  just one unified federal reserve they don't understand how the real board works well you
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.960]  have various member banks you have different people that are part of the federal open market
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.320]  committee so they all have a voice but i think it's easy to dissent if you know that the majority
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.560]  is going to make sure that your dissenting opinion doesn't actually happen right so it's
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.800]  easy to say hey i think we should raise rates when you know everybody else is going to make sure that
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.600]  rates don't go up right so then you could look like you're the responsible one uh but everybody
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.880]  else is preventing the rate hike but i'm sure even the guys that say they want to raise rates if it
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.840]  came right down to it and their voice was the vote was decided but they don't want to raise rates
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.880]  because that will expose the myth sure the fed the fed wants to pretend they can raise rates
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.920]  because theoretically raising rates is a sign that everything is better right but they want to
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.720]  pretend everything is better without proving it so will you accurately hit the nail on the head
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:13.120]  and you told cnbc and we put the article up this video you said just last week you said i predicted
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.640]  what the fed would do correctly now i'm going to predict what the stocks are going to do
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.640]  let's get into that but i actually never said anything about what the stock market was going to
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.760]  do on that interview but i do believe that the headline let me give you the headline then so
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.440]  you know we'll put it back on screen uh it's uh shiff i'm right about the fed i'll be right about
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.600]  stocks so what's that about yeah i don't know where they got the headline on stocks but you
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.000]  know the only thing i did say is that i thought that the stock market needed qe4 in order to not
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.840]  fall which is what i believe i think i think that the just keeping interest rates at zero
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:54.240]  is not enough to support the market this market is really propped up it's a huge bubble it needs
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.000]  air it needs qe4 to stop from deflating it needs the fed to keep buying the bonds right
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.400]  well absolutely well that is qe4 and it needs to if the fed has to expand its balance sheet
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.360]  if it wants to stop a bear market and i believe it does want to stop a bear market it's not going
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.720]  to admit that it's not going to say that's the reason but it also wants to prop up the banks
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:20.480]  it wants to prop up the real estate market you know this reminds me a lot what's going on now
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:26.480]  you go back to 2006 i'm going to put together another video of some of these clips again of
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:32.240]  me talking about the housing bubble which was so incredibly obvious to me and should have been
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.360]  obvious to everybody but it wasn't you know what was going on and what was going to happen
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:44.160]  when that bubble burst and it's the same thing all over again this is so incredibly obvious yet
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.080]  everybody is oblivious to the problem and how it's going to be resolved and maybe i don't know is the
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:55.120]  fed this dumb or do they know it now and are they just lying and covered up sure let me ask this
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.560]  question is the classic damn if you do damn if you don't we're going to break in one minute but
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:04.720]  try to answer it now or after explain to people how it's bad if we do keep doing the qe but how
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:10.320]  it's bad if we don't but then it's probably better to go ahead and raise interest rates explain that
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.720]  when we come back peter shifts our guest and when i know we got phone calls about the pope i'm going
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.160]  to work here and we can get his take on that as well his answer is wealth redistribution his answers
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.680]  class warfare when he's exempt from taxes and above the law and they've got headlines about
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.600]  obama basking in the aura i mean i'm gonna throw up here in a minute i mean i this is truly sickening
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:37.680]  to have a marxist pope i mean we're in deep trouble and that's all i can say is we are in
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.760]  deep trouble i mean if you think the economy's bad now wait till they bring in more government
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:51.280]  control more taxes this is really bad news stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:04.880]  a new global news fact checking project was announced yesterday and it will be funded by
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:11.360]  two organizations with close ties to the obama white house the project which says it will be
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.840]  focused on holding public officials accountable is funded by grants from the omittier network and the
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:23.680]  national endowment for democracy the omittier network is headed up by ebay founder pierre
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.280]  omittier visitor logs reveal that omittier has visited the white house a half a dozen times
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:36.400]  since 2009 the national endowment for democracy nad is infamously known for their role in
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:43.440]  uprisings attempted coups and acts of regime change so its operation mockingbird all over again
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:49.920]  as these connections clearly illustrate how the white house funded news fact checking project
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:56.720]  will undoubtedly be yet another exercise in spin and manipulation you can learn more right now

[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.920]  under management predicted the the many of the bubbles implosions predicted if you don't know
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.520]  who he is most of you do the situation with the housing bubble before it happened in 2008
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:12.240]  has predicted that we would see a worldwide economic uh recession and a depression the last
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.920]  few years we're now entering into that most areas of the world are in a depression or in conflict
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.720]  we're not seeing that yet here because we're like islands are just mountains in the ocean
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.520]  and as water rises it covers other islands that aren't as high but the water's rising the question
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:31.520]  is how high will it rise so peter that was my question before the break for the folks that
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:38.720]  just joined us i'll recap it you say we're in trouble if we continue qe we're not in we're in
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:43.600]  trouble if we get rid of it but we should get rid of it what do you see coming down the road as
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.040]  they don't get rid of it and why is it better to get rid of it and raise interest rates well you
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:54.800]  know it's just like a drug addict i may use this analogy a lot but you know if you're addicted to
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:00.080]  drugs and you make a decision that you're going to kick that habit and you check yourself into a
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:05.280]  rehabilitation center right your life is going to change for in the short run and it's going to get
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:10.080]  a whole lot worse right apparently i guess if you're doing drugs you're having a good time that's
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.960]  maybe why you're taking drugs you feel great you're high but if you make a decision that you want to
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.080]  kick that habit and you go to rehab now you're going through withdrawal right you're not you know
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:24.640]  going to club med you're not going to have a good time you're going to have to you know adjust to a
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.840]  normal life and so that means a big change in the way you live your life but it's better than
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:36.160]  continuing to do drugs and then maybe being dead in a hospital bed of an overdose and and that's
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:42.240]  where we are you know we've got this phony economy that's propped up on the this monetary heroine
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.840]  and we need to stop we need to you know we we need to go into economic rehab that's what would happen
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:54.400]  if the fed raised rates it wouldn't be fun but it would be a positive step it would be a healing
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.040]  experience as we restructure the economy what would that look like it would mean that we had
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.120]  to stop spending money tear apart credit cards live within our means asset prices would come down
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.000]  like stocks in real estate a lot of that's the good part is that is that what we need would get
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.960]  cheaper well yeah well the cost of living would go down hold look um home ownership is at the lowest
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:24.240]  it's been since 1967 it's like a 48 year low but if you take out the older people for young people
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.840]  in their 20s 30s 40s it's never been this low why because real estate prices are too high well if
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.320]  the government lets the bubble pop real estate prices will plunge and a lot of people who are
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.240]  renting might be able to afford to buy a house you know a lot of things will become more this
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.960]  economy is only good for the engineers at the top who know where the market's going to go who get the
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.000]  money first they're the ones riding the bubbles all the rest of us get screwed by it but you know
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.160]  a lot of things are going to change but right now americans we buy a lot of stuff on credit
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.640]  we have a lot of cheap stuff coming in from china we take it from granted but it's going to change
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.720]  i mean americans are going to have to stop throwing things out and buying new stuff
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.960]  we're going to have to repair the stuff that we have because we don't have the factories anymore
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:09.840]  and we keep we can't keep borrowing money to import the things that other people produce with their
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:17.360]  factory so this is going to be a painful adjustment process back to a viable economy that grows based
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:25.040]  on underconsumption saving and investment where the consuming is the reward for the the economic
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.840]  growth the concede the production and the savings we've got it backwards we claim that we're a
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.520]  consumer based economy you can't have an economy based on consumption it's a disaster it's a bubble
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.080]  which is what we have but the fed wants to perpetuate this the fed doesn't want anybody
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.320]  going to rehab the fed doesn't want people realizing that that's where we need to be
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.040]  they want to keep the party going they want to keep the high going so they are going to come
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.600]  back with more qe they are going to keep rates at zero but they don't want to admit that that's
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.240]  what they're doing so they have to come up with excuses and reasons to say you didn't just predict
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.280]  and i'm not kissing your brother it's true you didn't just predict that they wouldn't raise it
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.200]  you explained years ago what the roped up was the philosophy and now that i look at it you can really
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:15.760]  see them teasing people and creating this illusion but then always pushing it out how long do you
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.720]  think till they do finally raise it or if they decided to just never do it i mean how far will
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:27.120]  they inflate this currency well i think their plan if they can pull it off is not to raise rates
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.640]  and then to have some bad stuff happen and they can say you know we were ready to do it everything
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.440]  was working everything was going great but something happened that nobody could have possibly anticipated
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:42.160]  and because of this crazy event that happened somewhere in the world you know we're going
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.720]  to have to well we're going to have to postpone what we were going to do we're going to have to
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.160]  do qe4 because qe everything we know it works because it had worked you know and the whole
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:57.440]  idea talking about raising rates allows the fed to claim victory right they get to eat have their
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.920]  cake and eat it too because they can claim like everything is great we're going to raise rates
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.400]  but they don't actually raise rates because the easy part is bringing rates to zero
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.120]  any central bank could do that the impossible part is lifting them back up again once you've
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.360]  got everybody addicted to zero sure what does it signify that china is moving out of us treasuries
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:22.160]  i mean what does that signify well i think that china is a smart i think they can read the writing
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.480]  that that americans can't i think they they have a lot of treasuries and they want to get rid of
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.560]  them and i think it's not just china you have countries all around the world that have loaded
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.960]  up on treasuries they're going to sell is that the beginning of moving towards the exes because
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:38.560]  you've been saying in the last few years that when we see them starting to dump us bonds
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.840]  that's the big sign i think it is a big sign and you know right now there's still speculators
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:49.440]  buying the dollar on the idea that the us economy is sound and that the fed is going to raise rates
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.960]  but it's all because the fed says it is i mean if you actually look at all the economic data
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.560]  that comes out every day it's weak the data hasn't been this week since the great recession
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.760]  yet nobody pays attention to the actual data they just look at janet yellen and as long as janet
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.560]  yellen says everything is great nobody cares what the data is they're all waiting for the pipe pipe
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.360]  or janet yellen it's again it's like you know the emperor has no clothes no one wants to admit
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.680]  the emperor's naked until janet yellen says it you know let me ask you this and i want to go
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:25.280]  some phone calls uh you're making you put your crystal ball cap on and i'm not making a prediction
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.040]  here but in your gut what you tell your wife what you tell your family what you're telling our audience
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.160]  now how do you see this going down the next six months what do you see happening this fall
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.680]  a lot of folks like dent and others that have been pretty accurate like you they think it's
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.000]  imminent uh that it's going to get a lot worse a lot quicker but we know they've got a lot of weird
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.440]  tricks up their sleeves the market's so rigged now interest rates the stock market that they can
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.400]  you know suspend reality for a while longer kind of like wiley coyote runs out over the cliff
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.040]  and for a minute he doesn't fall because he's not really in the real world he's on
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:03.680]  easy you know he's being drawn by mel blank yeah well it's not till he looks down that he realizes
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:09.440]  he's no longer on the ground exactly that that wiley coyote phenomenon is going to happen because
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.160]  a lot of americans don't realize there's nothing beneath their feet but air and what's keeping it
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:21.200]  going is just defense credibility but how much longer can it maintain credibility by by bluffing
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.840]  it's going to raise rates but never delivering and if it actually does deliver on a rate hike it's
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:29.920]  just going to accelerate the collapse that much further because it's a fed does raise rates by
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.160]  a quarter point the markets are going to start anticipating the next quarter and the next quarter
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.600]  and it's going to unravel even faster so they're damned that they do and they're there that they
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:42.800]  don't which is why i think they're going to take the path of least resistance which is leave rates
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.960]  at zero and keep pretending they're going to raise them until there's something that happens where
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.840]  they have to do qe4 and maybe it's going to be the jobs numbers i mean at some point these job
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:56.080]  numbers are going to turn south with everything else i mean all the other data has already turned
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:02.160]  to recession the only thing left is the employment data and that's coming but don't they admit most
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:07.200]  of the employment numbers are cooked anyways they don't admit that although janet yellen even in her
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.560]  last statement when she's when they didn't raise rates she said we're still waiting to see improvement
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:17.520]  in the labor market what improvement is she waiting for if the unemployment rate is as low as it is
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.880]  and the and the employment market is as great as she says it is why does she need to improve more
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:29.120]  that just proves she's lying she knows that the labor market is lousy and if it's lousy now in
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.760]  september it ain't going to be any better in october or december in fact it's probably going to be
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:39.200]  worse well do you think dentin others are right to that they think by later this fall or winter
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:46.720]  we're going to see a huge stock market plunge well look i don't think the federal reserve
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:53.360]  is going to allow a huge stock market plunge i think at some point if it looks like the market
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:46:00.400]  is in danger of that big a decline qe4 is going to be announced they're not going to allow their
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.440]  own bubble to deflate they spend years blowing air into it they're not going to let it you know
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:11.200]  implode so she's going to stop the stock market from collapsing if i thought that the fed was
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.600]  actually going to raise rates the way everybody believes they're going to do then the stock market
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.320]  would crash and maybe that would be right but if the fed does what i believe they're going to do
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:26.800]  and you know comes with more qe then it's the dollar that's going to crash not the the stock
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.720]  market in fact what's putting pressure on all the emerging markets commodities gold is the belief
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.760]  that the fed is going to tighten monetary policy that's what's crushing the entire world and until
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.880]  janet yellen admits she's not going to do that uh then it's not going to change and the irony of
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.160]  it is janet yellen is saying i don't want to raise rates because of the problems overseas the problems
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.760]  overseas are because she's going to raise rates or everybody thinks she's going to go it's like
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:57.920]  cnbc she can't it's like cnbc famously a few years ago said aren't we all just slaves of central banks
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:03.600]  and then they cut the five guests all agreeing i mean this is really i guess the great question
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:11.040]  now can central banks and bureaucrats suspend economic reality and can they pump a bubble up
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.280]  to zimbabwe proportions and not have any blowback from that and i just think common sense says it
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:23.440]  can't now look all bubbles pop uh and the problem is the bigger they get before they pop the more
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.520]  damage when they pop and this is the biggest one yet and remember you know people i was on cnbc
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.760]  and the guys got nations were saying peter how could how's it possible that you're right and
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.080]  everybody else is wrong well you know what that's what happened that's what happened with the housing
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:43.280]  bubble and again i'm not the only one but they're not that many of us but yes i was right and almost
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.320]  everybody was wrong all the big banks including the federal reserve including janet yellen were
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:53.360]  completely oblivious to the housing bubble and any of the consequences that we're going to hit the
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.720]  economy when that bubble burst i laid it out exactly the way it happened and here we are again
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:05.280]  fast forward 2015 it's the same could it be chicago the same answer could it be could it be la could
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.480]  it be uh portorico going bankrupt i mean we don't know what the trigger war with russia
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.200]  i mean who knows what could trigger this thing going crazy well look just just the threat of
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:20.800]  higher interest rates is what's doing it after seven years of zero percent but my point is
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:27.840]  we are around the corner from a much worse economic crisis than 2008 but 2008 was still big
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.720]  it was the worst downturn since the great depression and nobody in the halls of power
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.240]  saw it nobody didn't want to see it emia nobody and nobody in wall street nobody at the fed nobody
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.600]  just a handful of people that they thought were crackpots some of those crackpots got very rich
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:50.000]  but you know very few people saw it and now it's the same situation all over again i agree i want
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.320]  to go to some calls here on the pond if i get your take after we take one or two because it ties in
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:00.720]  economically his answer is for government uh desi or uh in louisiana you're on the air thanks for
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:07.680]  holding your take on his excellency visiting uh uh obama and this huge socialist love fest uh go
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:14.080]  ahead you're on the air well uh what i honor alex to be on your show i just want to thank my friend
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:21.120]  nob who turned me on to your show about two years ago first time caller uh you nailed this pope alex
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:30.720]  uh he's totally evil uh him and uh king jihad barack obama two pieces of pod things that you
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:36.400]  talked about two years ago when i first listened they're coming to pass uh the catholic church
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:44.560]  in uh the vatican city over there totally evil i just wanted to thank you for being on uh for
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.200]  being on your show alex and uh go to another caller thank well god bless you we're gonna
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.440]  go to break your moment come back with more on this but i'm never get into religion i don't bash
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.600]  protestants catholics jews indians there's good people all over but this pope is so political
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:05.280]  and he's here to lecture america how the we couldn't have air conditioning i mean this is austerity
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.200]  and it seems like him and obama are joining forces the un's coming out of the closet for
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.880]  world government this pope's announced world government what's going on peter schiff we're
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:18.080]  going to skip this network break yeah you know if the pope really cared about the people i mean
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.360]  again you know maybe he does but if he really understood and wants to help he should be embracing
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.880]  capitalism freedom that's what lifts people out of poverty i mean it's not government programs
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:34.000]  government programs create and perpetuate and we know that it's a historical fact yes he ought
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.360]  instead of just reading the bible he should read history he should understand what made america so
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:44.720]  wealthy in the first place and it was the absence of government everybody wanted to come here
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:51.760]  here yes he's here you know you know we did more certainly to lift people out of poverty than
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:56.320]  any other country now unfortunately ever since the government declared war on poverty poverty
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.440]  has been on the rise but before the government decided to battle poverty capitalism was destroyed
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:07.520]  they started battling in the 40s and now we've got the biggest wealth redistribution the biggest
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:13.600]  divide the smallest middle class ever yeah i mean we we need less government right redistributing a
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:19.840]  shrinking pie is not the solution yet you know it sounds good you know but even you know in the bible
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.000]  that you know they talk about what you've tied 10 percent i mean they don't even they don't really
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:31.520]  you know endorse or recommend socialism there so i don't know you know why the church has
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:37.440]  officially embraced the doctrine that has so failed miserably throughout time i mean look at these
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:42.240]  countries that have been communists you know look at the rampant poverty i mean look at all the
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:47.440]  poverty in africa i mean it's not because of freedom and capitalism that there's so many
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:52.720]  poor people uh in sub-saharan africa i mean look at what the governments are doing to their own
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:57.520]  people in these countries go there and lecture those governments now the fact of the matter is
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.080]  there are problems in america but it's because the government is doing too much not because they're
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:07.840]  not doing enough well that's absolutely a fact and he didn't criticize for though castro in his
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:12.320]  half a million political dissidents in jail he's going to come here and criticize our prisons which
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:16.720]  would be fine if he criticized the communist prisons i'm all for criticizing prisons we just
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:22.000]  did it earlier in the hour it's just it's just what why are why is the whole power structure
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.960]  whether it's warren buffett or bad mouthing capitalism when they've gotten so rich from it
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:31.760]  yeah well again it's a lot of people like to be like you know that's part of the problem because
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:38.240]  so many other people embrace socialism and it makes you look good if you you know you pretend or you
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:43.840]  show your compassion by how much you're in favor of these government programs but of course you know
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.400]  being compassionate and generous with somebody else's money is very easy and there are a lot of
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:54.160]  liberals that that that want to do that but again that's just theft rebranded as democracy but it's
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:58.640]  still wrong and if you know if the pope is a religious man and of course he is he knows that
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:03.120]  theft is wrong right if there's a commandment there that says don't steal it doesn't have a
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:08.080]  little asterisk by it unless the government does it for you right you can't vote for other people
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:13.200]  to steal for you if it's wrong to steal then it's wrong to do it indirectly through elected politicians
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.840]  bingo bingo absolutely on target shifting gears and letting the calls bring up other topics that
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:23.120]  i'd like to ask you about refugees Saudi Arabia Qatar and eight other countries won't take one
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:28.880]  single person Saudi Arabia quarterback destabilizing syria running those jihad forces that's all
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.760]  admitted it's been declassified our government's working with the radicals then they lecture us
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.960]  bill in minnesota wants to comment on the quote refugees or migrants i'm gonna go to my neighbor's
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:45.120]  house and hey i'm moving into your bedroom i want uh food i want my medical bills paid i'm a migrant
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.480]  i mean it's it's it's it's stealing uh it's just but why is the west the only group told
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:55.200]  we've got to pay for everything again it's because of our Judeo-Christian ethic they know
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.360]  we're the nicest people in the world i'm not saying other countries are bad but let's face it
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:04.480]  we are literally a bunch of bleeding heart chumps and it's killing us folks it's killing us
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:10.560]  bill in minnesota you're on the air with peter shiff welcome hey honor to be on with both of you guys
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:17.360]  um i gotta say a couple weeks ago when you had an article up about these migrants and i just call
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.320]  them invaders i mean that's all they are they're just invading countries that were sovereign
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:27.920]  and thinking that they can get a free ride but here's the deal you had an article up about how
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:35.840]  german officials were telling german women not to dress provocatively around these muslims
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:40.480]  because they don't get it they might rape you yeah yeah that's happening this is political
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:45.600]  correctness we have to give up our culture of freedom under their political that's a great
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.040]  question i'm gonna go back to you bill but i want to ask peter ship this question what do you make
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.160]  of the migrant crisis what do you make of the politically correct the radical liberals will
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.960]  never criticize radical islam i mean i don't get it why won't the feminists we've sent reporters
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:03.440]  and gone to feminist events they will not say one word about radical islam and then they're
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:08.960]  telling german women basically start conforming to sharia law what what is the love affair with
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.240]  the left and radical islam well you know i think they find it hard uh to criticize because they
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.280]  don't want that criticism to blow back on themselves because people may be able to connect the dots
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.360]  and see what the similarities are and you know they want to focus on oh the countries you know
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.600]  where the migrants are going you know what's wrong there why aren't they you know welcome
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.880]  in another way they should what about where these people are fleeing and what ideology and what type
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.680]  of governments they're fleeing from i mean that is the problem it's the problem isn't that you know
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.680]  that that they're they're coming to certain countries but why are they leaving the countries
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:47.120]  that they're leaving and of course the only problems would be if these people walk into the
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:52.480]  you know the social welfare states of these other european countries why don't we just have freedom
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:57.840]  you know it's the welfare that's drawing it it's the welfare look we had all these immigrants
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:05.280]  way more immigrants were coming to new york my grandparents among them 1880 1890 1900 1910 they
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.480]  were they were flooding in and there was no problem they were all absorbed into into the into the
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.960]  culture into the economy they were productive there was no welfare there was no food stamps there
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.120]  wasn't a single government program to help the immigrants that were coming to this country
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:25.120]  by the boatload far more than the refugees do we have but there was no welfare there was no
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.960]  welfare and migrants whether they were from whether they were from russia whether they were
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.120]  from ireland or from england or whether they were from wherever they wanted to be americans
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.440]  yeah and they wanted to be americans not because there was a government to take care of them
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:42.400]  because there was no government to bother them. They wanted freedom. That's what they came here for
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.800]  and that's what they got and we all benefited from it. They were escaping mafias. They were
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.320]  escaping. I was reading today, Italy can't even do business. The mafia's taken over.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:54.240]  So more Italians want to leave and go somewhere else. I mean, it's the same deal. Just let me
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.880]  build my furniture. Let me make my shoes. Let me have my restaurant. Let me build my factory.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.800]  Get off my back. That's what made this country great. Bill, anything else on that point?
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:10.000]  Yeah, I mean, it put a pit in my stomach after looking at the picture that you had on your story
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:16.800]  on info wars about how German officials are telling German born and raised women how to dress
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:23.040]  around these new invaders and you shot a girl in a miniskirt and how miniskirts are supposed to be
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:28.720]  banned now. Just don't do it because you might get raped. I mean, what kind of world do we live in?
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.840]  And I asked a question about a senator here in Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:39.840]  They are both begging to bring in more of these Arabs, these Muslims. And here's the deal.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:47.600]  Why do Democrat women feminists want more Muslims here? Because Muslims do not treat women well
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.280]  at all. Well, listen, here's the deal. I don't want to say a lot of Muslims are good at working
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.320]  people. There are a lot of radicals, Islam's becoming radicalized. The West is helping this.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:01.200]  And that's a good way to end the interview to ask the Democrats on average. I'm not a Republican,
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:05.520]  but I mean, Democrats hate America. They hate freedom. They want to mount America's head on the
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.560]  wall. We're like a trophy. And so they're like spoiled kids, throwing a fit wrecking the house.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:16.400]  What do you think in closing, Peter Schiff? Well, you know, I think that this is near the end.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:21.280]  I mean, all of this, all the stuff that's going on, these are all you asked earlier on the show
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:27.200]  about signs. This is it. This is not normal, right? I think the beginning of the end was the 2008
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.840]  financial crisis. I know you got to go do want 60 second break, 70 second, come back and finish
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:36.880]  up your point of this is not healthy. This is the sign of the end. And then we'll let you get out
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:40.800]  of here. We'll also talk about how folks get put some nice pressure on the president to let

[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:54.080 --> 02:00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:27.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:34.400]  Hittershipofuropack.com is our guest final segment with him. Then we're gonna go back to your phone
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:41.920]  calls for a segment. Then I've got a reporters in DC covering the papal visitation, the socialist
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.480]  nightmare, trying to get a billion Catholic followers to go against what all the other
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:51.760]  popes and Catholics were who were anti-communist. I mean, what a nightmare. Pierre shifts our
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:01:00.160]  guess. We were talking about the West wanting to import unskilled people, 90% males coming
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:04.000]  and screaming, give me everything free, throwing rocks at everybody. I mean, it really is nightmare
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.840]  images. The media is trying to cover it up. And the caller said, what does this signify? And you
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:14.160]  said it signifies that we've entered an insane asylum land, basically the end. Put a bookend on
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.760]  that. And also how you think we could put more pressure in a nice way on that prison.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.960]  And then the Bureau of Prisons to release the political prisoner, Irwin Schiff, your father,
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.400]  because do they really want to martyr on their hands? Do they want him to die in prison?
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:33.920]  Well, you know, I think they are gonna potentially martyr. I mean, even if he doesn't die in prison,
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:39.520]  you know, he may be dying as a result of his having been in prison because of the incompetent
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:45.920]  way he was cared for in supposedly a medical facility. You know, he could have stayed in
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:51.280]  Otisville where he was enjoying himself and had regular visits, but no, they had to move him
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.640]  across the country so he can get medical attention. And then he got none. And maybe a routine melanoma
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:03.200]  that could have been cured ended up as a life threatening or death sentence, a cancer as it
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.400]  spread throughout all the organs of his body. So what can people do? I don't know. You know,
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:14.160]  I mean, you can call a congressman and put pressure, let him out, get an investigation
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.920]  of the prison. I think it's a disgrace what's happening. But if even the people in the prison
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:24.560]  say, yes, we want to let him out, well, let him out, but this is government. Nothing can be done.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.680]  You can't make a decision. Everything's got to go through so many different layers of bureaucracy
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:34.720]  that things that a private company could do or a private citizen could do in a minute
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.480]  takes the government's months and maybe they can't even get it done. So we have to put some
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:43.840]  outside pressure because they're certainly not moving on their own. But the final thoughts on
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:50.000]  this end game, again, I think this thing started one rabble in 2008. That was the beginning of
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:56.080]  the end. This is the period, the unwinding of this massive bubble that began in 1971.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.640]  When we went off the gold standard, it's been a long time in coming. Guys like my dad were
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:06.240]  criticizing it back in the seventies. He saw it coming from a mile away. And, you know,
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.800]  he may not live long enough to ultimately see the consequence. In fact, if you go and you
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:16.800]  read my dad's book, the biggest con, which came out in 1973, 1974, I still have some copies.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:23.760]  You can order them at a shift radio. It's a fantastic book, but it's amazing how far into
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:29.360]  the future my father saw and how much of what he wrote in that book has happened since he wrote it.
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:33.120]  Well, he's one of the original Patriot leaders and we stand on his shoulders.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:36.160]  And I just hope he knows. I don't feel appreciate the work he's done because
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:40.720]  I mean, everything he exposed the IRS for political persecution, that's all come out.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.400]  He exposed the private federal reserve. You know, I don't have many of those books left.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:51.600]  And I've been autographing the ones that I sell with my signature. I can't get my dad's signature
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.680]  on, but it's on the bookstore at shift radio.com, the biggest con. I also have some copies of his
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.000]  book, the kingdom of malts, another one of my favorites, which, you know, that's also up there
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.960]  too. I've got more of those, but I am running very low on, on the biggest cons. But, you know,
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.840]  what people can do about this? Look, you know, people make fun of me. Oh, Peter, you know,
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:15.440]  look, you've been saying the dollar's going to go down. The dollar's gone up, you know,
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:19.360]  it's gone up, but it's not going to stay up. It's only because people don't understand what the
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:23.760]  Fed is going to do. They don't understand the bubble in the US economy. They're fooled. They're
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.480]  just as blind as they were. The same guys that are buying the dollar were buying the subprime
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:33.120]  mortgages. They were completely convinced they were doing the right thing and they lost everything.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.360]  The people who are buying the dollar is going to lose everything. People who bet against subprime
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.760]  made a lot of money. You got to bet against the dollar. And the way you do that is you invest
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:47.920]  outside the US, you buy stocks in the few countries that are real safe havens like Switzerland or
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.160]  Singapore or New Zealand. And we're helping our clients do that at your Pacific capital,
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.640]  europeac.com. Very exciting. Peter, we're out of time. Thank you so much. We'll pray for your dad.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.560]  Thank you so much. We'll be back. Stay with us. A new global news fact checking project was announced
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:09.440]  yesterday and it will be funded by two organizations with close ties to the Obama White House. The
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:15.920]  project, which says it will be focused on holding public officials accountable, is funded by grants
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:21.920]  from the Omidier Network and the National Endowment for Democracy. The Omidier Network is headed up
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:28.240]  by eBay founder Pierre Omidier. Visitor logs reveal that Omidier has visited the White House a half
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:35.760]  a dozen times since 2009. The National Endowment for Democracy, NED, is infamously known for their
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:42.640]  role in uprisings, attempted coups, and acts of regime change. So it's Operation Mockingbird all
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:49.200]  over again as these connections clearly illustrate how the White House funded news fact checking
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:56.240]  project will undoubtedly be yet another exercise in spin and manipulation. You can learn more right

[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:10.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.200]  We're living on the edge because the globalists are manipulating and orchestrating and greasing
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:24.960]  the skids of crises that poses the saviors and bring in their world government. Some threats
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:31.200]  are real they talk about others like climate change are made up. Climate is always changing.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:40.000]  It's all a giant power grab. We're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:44.400]  I was just listening to one of those news pieces during the break that Darren McBreen produced
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.600]  and I'm glad he did that because it was in the stack and I hadn't covered it yet.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.600]  I need to do a detailed report on this because two years ago we had a article
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:00.560]  headline Pentagon promises to stop lying because of drudge report
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:08.640]  and I gave it that headline because they talked about the drudge report and said we can't lie
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.800]  because the drudge report and sites like it can expose us in real time
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:17.920]  but I also gave it the headline because the media was in a big demonization campaign against the
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:22.400]  drudge report at that time and I knew they'd probably pick it up and they did and it would
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:29.120]  then backfire against them and I point out in that article that a month before they'd quote
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:37.840]  legalized in Congress removed a law repealed a law that banned the CIA domestically planning
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:43.760]  false news and information and other federal agencies the governmental accountability office
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:48.880]  a few years before had said it was illegal it was already going on but that it should be
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.800]  it should be stopped so Congress's answer it's kind of when Congress got caught
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.800]  eight years ago insider trading they passed a law the next year legalizing insider trading
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:04.480]  for Congress that's like a pedophile being caught and so you you know then Congress passes a law
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.840]  saying it's okay hey I don't care if Congress passes a law saying pedophiles can rape kids
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.720]  I catch you going up for my kids I'm going to beat your brains out it's not a threat I'm going to
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:21.840]  kill you so just default you try to torture my kids try to rape and try to kill them I'm coming
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:26.320]  after you there isn't any mammal out there worth its salt that won't fight for its young
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.200]  and that's the ultimate final domination your kids belong to us
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:37.520]  we're going to give them inoculations parents you know aren't the parents I mean this is a
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:45.280]  rubbing your nose in an activity by a cult of scum good people don't desire the power the scum does
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:53.760]  good people the smarter someone is the better they are the nicer they are the cooler they are in
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:59.840]  my experience the more reclusive they are the more they don't want to tell people what to do the
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.320]  more they don't want employees the more they just got a few friends people they like hobbies they like
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:11.680]  they want to be left alone I mean the older I get people think I'm an extrovert overall and I can be
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:17.120]  when I need to be but the truth is I like to be alone or with just a few people I'm very introverted
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:21.200]  and I'm not saying I'm the greatest guy since sliced bread but you know I don't want to screw
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:26.400]  folks over I really care about people getting a fair shake I don't dislike people that are smarter
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.960]  than I am or better looking or more successful I admire them and I thought growing up everybody
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:35.520]  was like me well everybody didn't like us folks the listeners of this audit you know this show or
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:42.240]  good people I've met you I know you and so we don't want to be in control we don't but if we
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:48.000]  don't take the country in the world back the scum is going to be in control so we got a job to do
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.720]  and we can beat these people but another whistleblower there's over 500 of them now that have gone
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:01.760]  public it was 50 than 200 and 300 more former head of defense intelligence the general deputy
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.560]  had the CIA saying yes we've been told the lie about all kind of niceness they're taking over
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.920]  everywhere we're helping them it's horrible and really that's a cover their butt exercise because
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:17.680]  it's so bold to fund people murdering every question they get their hands on
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:26.000]  and Obama threw his family in Kenya they're in northern eastern Africa shipping money into
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.480]  the muslim brotherhood I mean this is really dastardly I mean this is there's a new James
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:36.240]  Bond movie coming out with specter I mean specter are cupcakes compared to this okay I mean these
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:42.080]  are really bad people and folks say well why are you still on the air well I've been threatened
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.240]  they've tried to buy me off I've been attacked over the years but it's been silent you know I get
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:53.120]  demonized and and I get assassinated in the media now I mean just yesterday without really looking I
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:13:00.800]  saw in my inbox Houston Chronicle was it New York Daily News uh other newspapers just with flat
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:07.520]  out lies about what I say and what I stand for so I mean I guess I should be glad they're just
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:14.400]  trying to assassinate my name but it doesn't really matter because the message already got out so you
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:20.480]  can destroy me all day long if you're too obvious about it it makes me a martyr which is answering
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.880]  the question of why I'm still alive but they're really into a very reckless phase I don't know
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.480]  there may become a time where they come lock me up make something up I mean who knows what it'll be
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:36.320]  I just hope you realize whatever it is and I hope it doesn't happen because I need to take care of
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.080]  my children but if it does it does it's just part of the part of the deal
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:47.840]  I mean I think I'll be fulfilled if they set me up or put me in prison or kill me I don't want to
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:53.600]  be fulfilled my flesh doesn't want to be fulfilled but that really is probably my destiny and I hate
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.240]  to speak such things aloud but I just want to say I'm a winner I didn't screw anybody over I'm not
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.040]  a parasite I love everybody who stands for justice and I hate those that want to dump people down and
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:08.800]  control folks and people just have to make the decision what side you're on because as you can see
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:12.640]  it's rapidly approaching the time where you're not going to be able to sit in the middle anymore
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:17.520]  do you support harvesting babies organs do you support pedophilia
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:23.120]  people are like man I'm getting all these emails you said they'd announce pedophilia next
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:29.840]  in the next few months and it's happening how did you know man it's not hard to know these people
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:34.400]  are evil I mean I know them I've studied them I've gotten inside their minds
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:41.200]  and if people could get inside the elite's minds when I go to your calls you would realize there's no
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:48.960]  no question they got to be fought I mean even if you're a lazy person you realize how horrible
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.640]  it's going to get under this they want tyranny in place because they know you're going to stand
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:56.960]  up and fight back they want tyranny in place because they know it's going to get so bad
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:05.280]  you're not going to have a choice but to fight back need to fight back now while we still got a chance
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:15.280]  and I'm not looking for trouble the globalists are looking for us we didn't start this
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:22.800]  Rick Santorum says he's vindicated media White House Salon goes soft on pedophilia
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.680]  yeah the media the White House is doing it federal judges are saying hey you know some 30-year-old
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:34.320]  guy wants to date your 12-year-old daughter it's okay as if your 12-year-old daughter can make that
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:44.000]  decision and now we're the squares because we don't want to grab five-year-olds out of backyards
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:48.640]  now I want to grab pedophiles and beat the brains out I mean I'll just be honest with you
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:53.280]  my instinct is I ever catch somebody abusing a child raping a child I'm gonna kill them
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.360]  I don't like talking about killing people folks but I mean that's my instinct I'm just being honest
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:07.440]  with you and the people in this government if this stuff continues to expand you're going to
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:12.240]  be held accountable I'm telling you right now you've been pushing and pushing and pushing so long
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:20.560]  it's time for you to back off you understand but I know you won't all right um anyways getting back
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:26.720]  to White House propaganda whistleblower intelligence on ISIS being grossly thrown to the side scent
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:32.800]  come analysts given implied orders not to report facts on the ground in Iraq regarding terrorist
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:36.880]  activity a retired army sergeant has further revealed the US military intelligence reports
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:41.120]  regarding terrorist activity in Iraq are being fundamentally manipulated and changed in order
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:45.760]  to fit with the positive public statements made by the Obama administration that's just a sergeant
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:51.760]  we've had the general over the whole thing go public then the reporter goes so the White House
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:56.960]  was just dumb I didn't know it was funding al-qaeda he goes no we were ordered to it was an order
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:04.480]  and that dub tells what this White House link group saw us bankrolled new fact checking network
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:10.480]  so you think Snopes is bad with some lady with a cat she tells you what reality is
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:16.320]  project fundable organizations that funded Kiev coup and this is just private groups doing what's
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:23.120]  over the top with CIA backing domestically operation mockingbird with the endowment for
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:32.960]  democracy that's George Soros they're going to study how to quote fact check everything and tell
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:38.560]  us what reality is and of course also they're going to quote decide how to package information to
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.720]  manipulate us that's what the CIA announced last week I mean this is so hardcore
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:50.160]  David New York thanks for holding you're on the air welcome hey Alex how you doing doing all right
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:57.840]  man okay and when you mentioned uh children you know being able to choose whatever at age 12 I
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:03.280]  guess now at alleged 11 they're trying to push it where they can accept uh one of the new 146
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.840]  vaccines they're coming down the line yeah they're saying parents don't matter we the state are going
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:13.200]  to come in like pedophiles and get involved with your kids one of the first things that and probably
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.920]  the only things I heard the Pope say and it was shortly shortly after he got off the plane was that
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:24.160]  some dear lady had said mentioned that he wasn't wearing uh you know the ruby slippers a scarlet
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:30.000]  slippers and he grew wearing white ones that he must be the antipope and I'm thinking why in a world
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.360]  would he say something like that other than people are talking you know about him about being the
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:39.920]  black pope and you know how bad he's supposed to be and so they're trying to he's flunking it he's
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.400]  throwing in our face you said what you want about past pups I were I reserve judgment because they
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:49.680]  were anti-communist pro-family this guy is just how can you have a pope saying these things
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:56.960]  the talking heads we're making fun of uh I guess family uh South Park's coming out now with an
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:03.040]  episode where uh one of the people in the town is talking about not the wall that we did doubt we
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:09.840]  need to keep the people coming across the border from entering our schools well you know Philadelphia
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:15.680]  just within the last few weeks mentioned that uh with all the immigrants they have come and they
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.840]  have 60 different countries and 40 different languages so I guess you have to have an interpreter
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:26.800]  for each of the 40 different languages they're creating a tower of babel and then the democrat
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:33.040]  managers make sure no one assimilates well the pope wants us to practice being poor well I think
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:40.480]  they're gonna do it just through school taxes you know it's not uh too hard to see oh god
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.920]  sure go ahead okay you know we we know what the Trojan horse is and obviously we've all said you
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:51.920]  know I should come across the border but actually it's a different horse and it's a stalking horse
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:56.880]  a pretext concealing one's real intentions tell us stay there I got my reporters popping in

[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:15.680]  alex jones here back live jacari jackson is in dc they're going to be following the pokes three
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:21.120]  state trip they got there yesterday before he arrived they found a bunch of powerful reports
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:29.520]  at info wars dot com and for the info wars nightly news uh jacari jackson with david night joins us
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:37.920]  from the ground jacari jacari jackson on washington dc that's right alex we hear right outside the
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.920]  white house that you can see behind me and to look at it right now a couple hours after the pope
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:45.440]  gave his speech you really wouldn't know anything happened here besides the barricades that are
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:50.000]  left behind this was the area while it was that last night when they had the signs posted saying
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.640]  that you need a government issued id to enter the premises but now they've opened it back up
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:59.280]  as is the case for most of the area surrounding the white house they had it blocked off in several
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:03.360]  blocks uh every direction around the thing you couldn't get anywhere close to it except to go
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:07.600]  through one of the checkpoints and we showed you guys those videos uh the tsa actually doing
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:12.000]  checkpoints and i know uh you were happy to see that alex not that you're happy that it happened
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.840]  but to show people that the tsa is out in the streets doing these type of procedures
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.360]  they're looking through people's bags we got that on camera digging through people's bags
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.960]  picking out the contents you know flipping through people's pocketbooks and doing all that kind of
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:27.840]  show how the tsa is meant to be the new national police force yes and they said it was a conspiracy
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:32.000]  theory they said it would never happen when we got documented proof right outside the white house
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.480]  that was going on now as far as the speech itself you know we had all of our gear all our big
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.960]  backpacks and stuff so we couldn't get into the actual grounds where the pope was speaking
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:45.040]  but we could hear him over the loudspeakers we could hear the people cheering uh the estimates
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:50.880]  i saw a cnn said something like 11 000 people were expected out here so i guess that's a
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:56.160]  fair assessment now as far as uh it's getting footage of the pope we didn't get too close to him i
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:01.200]  think it's close as we don't care we who cares about i mean we can see what he says and does
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.440]  it's about reporting on the security theater that's taking place and what people are saying
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:10.160]  yes and when we were out there speaking to the people you know ask people was it worth your
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:13.680]  time to come out here and see the pope they said absolutely you know people the area where i was
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:20.320]  in i saw him for maybe 30 seconds through a very high-powered zoomed lens uh then i saw him about
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.880]  36 i said you know it's worth their time that's worth their day to come out here and see the pope
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.760]  it just to see him for that very brief by interaction jacari what do you make of the pope
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:35.760]  saying that carbon dioxide and water vapor is air pollution and praising the new un treaty
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:42.560]  well you know i'm definitely not a fan of uh this carbon tax credit scheme they have going
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.400]  they're watching fox news last night and it's probably the first time i've ever agreed with
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:51.200]  bill o'reilly and i doubt if i ever will again when he was talking about uh the carbon situation
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.080]  and the carbon credits and all that he says it's more of a pollution problem than it is a climate
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:59.760]  change problem i do agree with that because i often meet people who mix apples and oranges they
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:03.600]  say what about this type of pollution what about that type of pollution i say yes i do agree with
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:08.400]  that but we do have that situation but to say that we need a carbon credit scheme to make all
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:14.160]  that stuff go away it does not make any sense to me at all but many people they were you know happy
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:19.600]  just to see the pope for a few minutes but the uh the theater i asked people do you think the pope
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:24.480]  has enough security many people said i hope so even though we have uh i don't know thousands upon
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:28.720]  thousands of people out here to protect the pope the border patrols out here to protect the pope
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.200]  as david night documented they're not on the southern border trying to secure that situation
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:37.840]  hell they're up here guarding the pope at the white house so it's very interesting to me that
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:42.080]  the pope who clamors for open borders was guarded actually by the border patrol i thought there was
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:49.360]  quite uh ironic well it's funny he wants walls he wants security but as a nation we're supposedly
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:55.360]  not supposed to have any security but then internally we've got the tsa searching us
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:01.920]  violating the fourth amendment to get miles away from his holiness yeah that's right i mean like
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:05.520]  so i walked through this area last night you know i could walk through free and open now you know it's
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:11.840]  pretty much uh blocked off barricade you know a little barricade city within a city so you know
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:16.160]  the people pretty much have been receptive to the message so far no problems that i've seen but
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:20.080]  we'll move on to the next area and try to see what's happening in places like new york and
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.600]  philadelphia that's right he's going to new york next to speak at the u n you're going to be
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:30.320]  covering that with david night our own david night and then he's going to philly and no discussion
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:36.400]  of the aborted babies the organ harvesting no discussion of anything under pressure he's reversed
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:40.480]  himself saying stop talking about abortion so much and he said we should protect all of the
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:47.120]  weak including babies the unborn so i'll uh give him that he's also said he's not a leftist i don't
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:53.200]  know how it's not leftist to say prosperity is bad and being poor is good that's really the
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:59.200]  goal of socialism is to make you dependent yeah well we've seen people like obama he goes over to
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.840]  africa i believe it was and said that if africans get air-conditioned the planet would boil over
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.600]  and all these people talking about you know his carbon footprint and all this even though he may
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:12.720]  drive in some little fiat popemobile he has i don't know how many armed guards riding around
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:17.280]  their big suburban suvs he had all it is is a publicity stunt same thing with obama
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:21.440]  he opts on air force one he has all these people falling around in the modicates talking about
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:26.560]  our carbon footprint no they have the big carbon footprints well jacari great report on the tsa
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:30.160]  david night's excellent report on the border patrol these are reports that nobody else is
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.640]  filing mainstream media just goes with the scripts that basically the second coming of christ has
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.440]  happened the pope is here he's endorsed obama i mean it's like he's the false prophet and obama's
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:44.160]  the antichrist or something i'm not saying that but it's like a warm-up model of that great job
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:48.640]  jacari we're gonna come back and get david night to take briefly then more calls and news we're on
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:57.600]  the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:04.320]  k daniels info wars dot com did you know that pope francis has strong ties to communism
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:08.800]  francis is a member of the jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology which many
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:13.680]  have labeled christianized marxism the other reason why communism and socialism has preserved
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:18.640]  for so long in latin america and it's not a coincidence that cuba's current leader rile castro
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:23.680]  praise pope francis for his anti-cafla stance castro like francis was also brought up by the
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:29.360]  jesuits starting to make sense now why francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes and more
[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:33.200]  government and also did you know the recent reconciliation between the u.s and cuba was
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:38.400]  spearheaded by pope francis to the benefit of castro vatican researcher leo zigami wrote an
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:43.600]  excellent article on info wars dot com entitled vatican flag to fly over the new world order which
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:49.440]  breaks it all down zigami wrote rock obama and rile castros mundalis left his agenda is guided

[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:25.680]  force out now to be in three states i guess we got video in dc searching people miles away from
[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:30.800]  the ponuf you're not going to really hear anything about the border patrol being called in to protect
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:37.760]  him as well just ridiculous and believe me i don't want anything to happen to this pope that
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:44.000]  turned him into a martyr it just shows the globalists are moving on every front they're making
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.920]  announcements forced inoculations all over the world pedophilia they say is good open borders
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:56.480]  is good your women belong to us ha ha ha we're going to be radical jihadis in we're going to

[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:09.280]  the story out in california the two rich uh arab's teenagers driving you know million
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.920]  dollar ferrari's and lamborghini's around through tiny streets at 100 miles an hour
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:18.320]  that just illustrates when the cops pull them over and they go oh shut up you stupid americans
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:25.040]  you can't stop us we have diplomatic immunity that's what the new world order is is the globalists
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:32.400]  the big banks the big institutions are tax exempt above the law just like the vatican they can do
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:37.840]  whatever they want and then even their minions under political correctness they're above the law
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:44.960]  their hands off because it's part of the agenda everything is selectively enforced
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:50.880]  it's a very dangerous situation we're going to go back to your calls dave uh and of course matt
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:57.200]  and then margaret denise jared and others uh but i wanted to pop in with david night to
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:02.320]  get a live report from there in front of the white house with jacari jackson uh david night
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:08.720]  your observation since you've been on the ground for about 30 hours david i reporting for info wars
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:14.000]  dot com here we are in front of the white house and of course behind me alex is andrew jackson
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.160]  in front of me is jacari jackson remember andrew jackson was the guy that ted cruise said he'd
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.320]  like to see taken off the $20 bill so we didn't have to remove alexander hamilton we need to
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:28.640]  remember that it was andrew jackson who fought to stop the central bank it was alexander hamilton
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.360]  who fought to have a central bank nevertheless that's an aside today we walked literally walked
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:39.760]  around the entire security perimeter here carrying large packs i'll add uh pretty tired uh but you
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:46.160]  know when i was walking i told jacari i said when george washington was here he said he was asked
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:49.920]  about the british people are the british people free because americans only wanted to talk about
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:54.720]  liberty at the time and so we talk about liberty all the time aren't the british free and he said
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:01.360]  they walk about freely but between high walls we literally were walking around washington
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:07.040]  between high walls and helicopters over the head we had policemen lined up so thick the police line
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:13.760]  literally was a police line it wasn't any kind of uh markers there it's absolutely amazing alex
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:18.800]  and it's over the top and it shows how people as jacari pointed out with his reports when he asked
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:24.000]  people uh what do you think about this is it too much are we over the top no no we need to be safe
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.680]  people don't talk about freedom anymore they talk about the security state it grieves me to see their
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:35.200]  acceptance of this it grieves me to see all this and i understand what's behind it it's not about
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:39.760]  our safety it's about their safety it's about the safety of the elites the people who go to the
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:44.400]  bill de berg conventions the popes and the presidents who meet with each other it's about their safety
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.720]  they could care less about your safety or your freedom over here where we got we got kicked out
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:53.680]  of the park we were uh set up to call in earlier they closed the park they kept every kept everybody
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:58.800]  out uh for about an hour or so no reason given no time that they were going to come back was given
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:03.520]  so jacari and i were sitting over there waiting to get on and right across from us was the us
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:09.520]  chamber of commerce they have big banners hanging out there jobs growth hashtag jobs
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:15.040]  the us chamber of commerce is the reason on the republican side that we have open borders
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:19.280]  they're working with obama the banners mcconnell they're working with obama to make sure that we
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:23.520]  have open borders we have a pope who's guarded by the border patrol because the border patrol
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:28.400]  isn't on the border so that's the situation we got here one other thing i'd like to add to alex
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.880]  and that is this whole issue about the fiat everybody is talking about the humble pope and
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:38.560]  his fiat understand that he flew in on a private jet before he got into that fiat and when he's
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:42.080]  driving around today in the pope mobile that's provided that's a jeep that they've modified
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:46.800]  that's a chrysler fiat product i'm i'm wondering as i'm looking at this i told my wife i said
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:53.840]  this whole thing about humility it may just be a massive product placement for chrysler fiat
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:38:01.120]  it's definitely a fiat big boulderberg member took over jeep three years ago yes absolutely
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:06.000]  absolutely one other thing i want to add and that is the whole concept of liberation theology
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:09.600]  we're talking about the open borders but of course he says he comes from the Jesuits that
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:14.480]  for a while was banned by the catholic church yes the brazilian priest who started liberation
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:19.440]  theology leonardo buff let me read you what he said about this particular pope called this to
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:25.600]  der spiegel in 2013 so it's almost three years ago that he said this now he said francis will
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:32.000]  teach to the a lesson to the church we're coming out of a bitter and gloomy winter with francis
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.880]  comes the spring now this is a guy who founded liberation theology which is nothing but marxism
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:42.640]  with a thin veneer of religion on it he left the catholic church he became an environmentalist
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:48.800]  and now we have francis who he had the highest hope for would would change fundamentally change
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:54.240]  the church that there would be a springtime with this pope what he is selling is with these carbon
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.160]  credits it is an indulgence this is an indulgence to use energy that's essentially what this is
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:06.960]  going to be they want you to pay some globalist banker or algore somebody to every time you turn
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.840]  on your car every time you turn on the light switch you want to pay a tax to these guys
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.640]  that's what the carbon tax is about it doesn't even have anything to do with uh with with the
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:21.040]  environment many of these things that we're being called don't have anything to do with the environment
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:25.680]  again many of the in the environmental movement people call them watermelons they have a thin
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.960]  veneer of green and they're all red on the inside and that's really what this agenda is about
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.680]  he sold it today well he didn't have to sell it to obama but they they work together on how
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:39.600]  they're going to do this tomorrow he's going to talk to congress he's going to try to sell it to
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:43.600]  them at congress we're going to cover that at the mall there's going to be a speech and there's a
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.080]  matter that we saw you saw that report that we put up where we talked about how uh they're using
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:52.400]  the veneer of climate change in front of the capital building that looks like it's being
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:56.880]  remade into something completely different and then on friday he's going to go to the un
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:01.840]  just happens to be a general assembly they have plotted all of this for the last six months at
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:05.920]  least since the pope did the oh they've introduced the legislation yesterday right on it's all
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:13.040]  concerted i didn't see that yeah yeah so yeah they know this is this is all very carefully and
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:20.080]  program orchestrated and and fed to us in steps exactly like the agenda where the pope is going
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:25.840]  from this place to that place to this place they're leading us by the hand down this climate change
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:31.120]  agenda oh it's like watching the popes of 25 foot boa constrictor wrapping around a baby piglet
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:38.720]  squeezing its eyeballs out telling it loves it i mean it's truly disgusting yes it really is selling
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:42.720]  a globalist government agenda that's what all these treaties are about that's what the open
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:46.560]  border is about and that's what the climate change agenda is about but of course they're
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.560]  saying they're trying to make a moral case for it they're trying to make a case that it involves the
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:56.320]  family really i mean really it involves the family if you want to talk to obama talk to him about
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:02.640]  stopping the foreign wars talk to him about stopping equipping isis creating isis training isa
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:10.160]  where is the hope on the baby parts being sold in china and the u.s exactly exactly nowhere
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:17.120]  nowhere you won't hear anything about that he really is a sickening person and and and in the
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:24.480]  fiat stunt all of it was done is disgusting david what else are you planning to be covering
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:29.360]  what are the different angles you guys are going to be going over the next few days well we couldn't
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:35.440]  get access today i said we walked around a security perimeter that was unbelievable in terms of how
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:41.440]  deep that perimeter was so it was very difficult jacari got a short telephoto shot of the pope
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:47.280]  as he went by the pope mobile the jeep fiat chrysler product that he was doing this afternoon he's
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:52.480]  going to hold the spanish mass he's going to have the first canonization of someone uh that's held
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:58.800]  in the united states his canonization mass are going to declare a a former priest uh as a saint
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:04.800]  and as i point out yesterday he was someone who uh was involved with the catholic uh colonization
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:11.760]  of california he's sending a message to people this is a very controversial priest uh priest
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.960]  sarah many people have accused him of abusing indians and they even tried to get his statue
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:21.760]  removed from the california legislature but in spite of all that controversy alex he wants to
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:28.080]  hold this guy up and elevate him as an example showing how we can take back showing the hispanics
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:33.120]  and latin americans how they can take back america that's that's really what's it's all about oswan

[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:49.440]  david in new york uh you're on the air uh go ahead and finish up your point
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:53.360]  actually i got another point while i was thinking then i'll make it quick
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:56.400]  then go ahead while i was thinking it it's probably something that should be out there but
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:03.280]  it was just a i was reading about the beast before and the woman dressed in scarlet and purple
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:08.880]  that rides the yeah yeah the horror the reservation yeah and it just came to me that her name is you
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:16.000]  know and this is what came her name is gaya and it makes so much sense i'm listening to you talking
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:21.760]  about the pope riding in his fiat you know and that just popped into my head but you know what
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:26.240]  they had the fiat pop and so now that big luxury edition you just saw that he was in
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:31.840]  they're gonna call that the fiat pope wow it's a serious rollout thank you dav uh let's go
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:37.280]  ahead and talk to matt and dc thanks for holding her on the air hey i just wanted to uh let you
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:41.840]  know i went to the um national animal rights conference this year and about a third or more
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:45.520]  are the people i talked to are big fans of the show so just wanted to let you know that there
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:51.760]  is overlap in these two movements oh i'm all for real animals you know not having animal cruelty
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:57.680]  having them be treated properly uh absolutely it's the pedo people are the eugenics front group
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:03.600]  to control the animal rights movement well yeah and i wanted to have you point out to people
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:08.080]  that if they're a real environmentalist and they're trying to cut carbon if they're not vegan
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:12.080]  then you shouldn't even be listening because that the united nations already said that animal
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:18.000]  agriculture is contributes over 50 to the so-called greenhouse gas well yeah they say the flatulence
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:23.760]  of cows is going to kill us right so if they're not if they're not eating you know putting the
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:27.840]  food where their mouth is in a way of speaking then you shouldn't even be considering them
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:32.960]  environmentalists so that's that's the first that's that's the big point and that um i really think
[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:38.320]  that it starts with the animal consuming animals and like treating animal people people treat other
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:42.640]  people like animals you say it every day almost and if we don't start treating animals better it's
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:46.480]  just going to stay as bad for people i agree and if we don't treat people better we're going to treat
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:50.880]  animals worse we need to have empathy we need to understand everything comes back on a straight
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:57.200]  point does you have any comment about his lordship that arrived oh yeah actually you know i'm in dc i
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:02.320]  scored a couple tickets to uh see him tomorrow morning at outside the lawn so i'm excited to
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:06.960]  see what kind of uh what kind of practice propaganda is going to be preaching i tell you
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:12.480]  i mean he's a guy elected by a bunch of other cardinals and people act like it's like meeting a god
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:16.800]  or something but that's because folks haven't met celebrities i've just been desensitized
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:21.280]  yet to meet a lot of celebrities and stuff it's really quite boring and uh my heart rate wouldn't
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:26.000]  even go up talking to the pope other than just telling him man i tell you you know i i think
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:30.480]  you're making this up you got to know capitalism ends up helping people the most how could you be

[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:51.760]  lot of things um for their stance against the takeover of the catholic church and regardless
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:56.320]  what you think of mel gibson and some of the things he's done uh they're certainly right about what's
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:00.800]  happened to the catholic church i appreciate your call denise in minnesota you're on the air welcome
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:10.400]  hello yes go ahead i just have two quick comments one you need to write down and give to petershift

[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:25.360]  wrongfully imprisoned and this is an obvious case of this man should not be still sitting
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:32.960]  in chrism the other comment i had was i would not want to be in the pope's shoes the day he meets the
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:39.280]  lord yeah i don't think this pope even believes in god you can just see a little is just a little

[03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:49.680]  to judge him myself but the fruits of this guy and the whole evil media behind him i mean what
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:53.280]  does that tell you when the media is behind him they blackmailed the catholic church whether it
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:59.360]  was good or bad they blackmailed it they took it over and the question is who controls pub francis

[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:13.040]  oh she's gone sorry jared in kentucky you're on the air
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:20.480]  hello how you doing how needed is talk to you alex i started listening to you with my dad about
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:25.600]  20 some years ago when i was in my early and mid teen so it's it's been been neat to see you grow
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:34.640]  uh at my island yes sir all right yes i just wanted to say that uh you know you said something
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:38.880]  that with it you know got me thinking you talked about you know bullies you know and how bullies
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:44.480]  just you know with the forced inoculations now the pedophilia letting migrants come in and walk
[03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:48.480]  all over our our culture you know it's kind of they're seeing how far they can push it yes and
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:54.640]  another thing that that uh bullies do is not only they keep keep trying to you know see how far they
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:04:00.560]  can push things but they also like to uh try to provoke you know the person they're targeting to
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:04.960]  and i honestly believe that you know the elites and stuff you know i don't know that they believe
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:10.880]  in all this stuff as much as they know it really makes the people they oppose angry and i think
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:16.720]  that they're just keeping on pushing and pushing and pushing and they aren't going to stop until
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:20.960]  they basically provoke an armed confrontation i think that's what they want that's it because
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:25.600]  they know culturally we're voting with our dollars culturally the federal reserves being exposed
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:30.640]  culturally the corrupt Vatican's falling apart they know that's they want to force a confrontation
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:36.080]  of a war it's like world war one the british and others couldn't beat german ingenuity and science
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:39.920]  they were taken over the world by economics so they killed their crown prince starting the
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:44.560]  germans got mad at a war then they then the british intelligence funded hitler put him in
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:48.320]  he didn't work for him but they wound him up it's like ices and they were able to defeat germany
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:53.120]  they did a great job they got to kill 20 million germans so you're absolutely right great points
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:59.280]  Jared it is forced culture shock with the pedos all of it this is the takeover this is it a new
[03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:06.000]  global news fact checking project was announced yesterday and it will be funded by two organizations

[03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:17.280]  political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network all right welcome back to the alex jones show you're
[03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:23.840]  listening to the fourth hour overdrive i'm leon macadoo and joining me is rob dew here for the
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:28.880]  first segment of overdrive we're going to be taking some of your phone calls later on in the show
[03:08:29.920 --> 03:08:37.840]  but first we wanted to get into some of the things that are at the top of drudge we are looking at
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:44.640]  there's a story now where they're talking about a growing number of conspiracy theorists believe
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:51.280]  that california's drought is actually being caused by the government now of course the way that this
[03:08:51.280 --> 03:08:59.120]  whole thing is being reported is super condescending and you know rob do let's get into it i'm tired
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:03.360]  of this condescending thing of saying how could that even exist well let me just say this back in
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:09.040]  2009 i made a road trip with uh jason douglas and jason bermus we went in toward california
[03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:15.840]  drove up to the northern california met rosalind peterson um and met her the town she lived in
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:21.280]  met her mayor who also thought something was going on so the and rosalind worked for the agricultural
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:27.520]  board she was uh been informing all her life the farmers we went and talked to rosalind there's
[03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:32.560]  something going on there's spraying something the trees are dying right the the livestock is sick
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:37.120]  there's something going on we're not getting as much rain as we used to there's high levels of
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:41.840]  heavy metals in the snowpack these all aren't crazy people right that are coming up with this
[03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:45.680]  and and the the guy they focus on there dane wiggington we've had him on the show before
[03:09:45.680 --> 03:09:50.880]  we're actually trying to get him on for tomorrow um you know these people aren't crazy people dane
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:55.520]  is worked in the solar industry for a while and he's like noticing less solar activity hitting
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:10:01.680]  the earth he's taken a lot of a lot of things and to get lab tests done a lot of samples there we
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:06.240]  spoke into so many people and we're going to actually be airing some videos coming up in
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:12.720]  the next uh segment where we're we have experts talking about how weather modification is being
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:18.640]  used how it's been used as a weapon of warfare uh so we're we're going to get more into that
[03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:23.440]  because we have an amazing documentary from ben livingston who's the father of weather weapons
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:28.720]  this guy was uh doing cloud seating where he said they would take a small cloud run a jet
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:34.000]  through it a few times spraying in their aerosols and they would turn it into a monsoon to flood
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.480]  areas out that they wanted flooded out and they did this with precision back in the 60s
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:42.400]  this was during the vietnam war right you think they're not doing allegedly you think it's not
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:47.600]  more advanced now come on and you know i have there's a couple articles in the guardian uh
[03:10:47.600 --> 03:10:55.200]  here's one from 2012 us geo engineers to spray sun reflecting chemicals from balloon okay they're
[03:10:55.200 --> 03:10:59.200]  not doing it from balloons i'll tell you that but this is just this is the cover story oh we're
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:04.320]  doing it from balloons and you go down to the third paragraph david keith who's a big geo engineering
[03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:09.520]  proponent he's been confronted many times by other uh geoengineering activists one of the
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:13.840]  investigators has argued that solar geoengineering could be an inexpensive method to slow down global
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:18.320]  warming but other scientists warn that it could have unpredictable disastrous consequences for
[03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:22.560]  the earth's weather system and food supplies environmental groups fear that the push to
[03:11:22.560 --> 03:11:26.560]  make geoengineering a plan b for climate change will undermine efforts to reduce carbon emissions
[03:11:26.560 --> 03:11:32.080]  so they hide it on this carbon climate change bs right but this this right here what earth's
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:37.520]  weather systems and food supplies we talked to dr tim ball he was in father republic he
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:42.400]  he was the guy who's been studying the climate his whole life right and he says look the climate
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:46.880]  changes it happens all the time you can't stop climate change if you wanted to but what we're
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:52.000]  doing is trying to play god in certain areas in certain regions and by spraying stuff in the air
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:57.120]  we're basically destroying certain areas we're changing their weather systems and that's exactly
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:02.080]  the concern we have the united nations environment program where they're actually talking about
[03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:07.440]  geoengineering and how important it is uh to combat global warming and climate change but
[03:12:07.440 --> 03:12:11.280]  of course they talk about the fact that you can't mess with one part of the environment without
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:16.000]  affecting many other parts of the environment the weird version of the butterfly effect if you
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:20.480]  mess with something here it's going to change something downstream exactly and and you know
[03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:26.480]  here it is right here you have the un environment program big conspiracy theory doesn't exist the
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:30.880]  reporter you know it says to wiggington you know you sound crazy right saying that the
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:37.120]  government can control the weather well here it is right here from the un or we have a geoengineering
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:43.680]  symposiums where they're talking about these things going on experiments in aerosol solar
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:47.840]  aerosol i totally forgot about this we could actually the guys could look up geoengineering
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:53.200]  patents that are the u.s patent office right there's a list of them right it's not like one or two
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:57.920]  there's a whole list of them i mean this this is actively going on right now and it's happening
[03:12:57.920 --> 03:13:02.800]  above you it's happening everywhere i've i've shot plenty of kim trails i know what a kim
[03:13:02.800 --> 03:13:07.200]  trail looks like from a contrail and people say they don't like to use that word but i mean i call
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:12.720]  it as i see it and uh i am not a big fan of what they're trying to do to us and then how it's being
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:17.440]  played off is you're crazy if you bring it up yeah it's just regular airplane traffic there's
[03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:22.320]  more airplane traffic well and they say well why would they do that why would they do that to us
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:26.480]  when they're breathing the same air the same sky i mean these are people that don't think ahead they
[03:13:26.480 --> 03:13:31.920]  are spraying particles into the sky heavy metals aluminum things like that thinking that it's going
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:39.520]  to be blocking the sun and that is all kind of raining down on us oh no it's a conspiracy theory
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:45.440]  i don't those are patents those are patents just look away nothing to see here now this is from
[03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:53.680]  the guardian uh february 2015 spy agencies fund climate research and hunt for weather weapon and
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:59.680]  this is of course you know i think they kind of this stuff comes out years later they've already
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:06.400]  got this weapon it's already exists i actually have a clip um where michio kaku was on cbs this
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:13.280]  morning talking about the alleged use of cia uh weather weapons like you were talking about in
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:19.760]  vietnam operation pop i watch how the news anchors react to him bring this up part because too i
[03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:25.040]  remember reading the stories that china had used this during the olympics that the ussr had used
[03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:30.400]  this after chernobyl to create rain clouds i mean did those really work then we have some of these
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:37.040]  capabilities now inconclusive even in the 60s the cia used this to uh bring down monsoons during the
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:43.040]  vietnam war to wash out the vietnam governments have been well alleged to alleged to alleged to
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:48.080]  right yeah oh yes we realize that for decades now these governments have been alleged to have
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:52.160]  experimented with weather control but nothing the government's not going to sue you right i mean
[03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:55.760]  it's ridiculous the government's not going to sue him for saying that they did that we have the guy
[03:14:55.760 --> 03:15:00.880]  who did it back in the army and air force on the show we interviewed him project pop i
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:08.560]  you know and then he goes on to talk about how but we're doing this in the lab we're testing with
[03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:13.840]  these shooting these laser weapons up and they're you know manipulating the ionosphere when we are
[03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:19.760]  that has also been admitted uh that that's exactly what was going on with the harp program exactly
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:24.640]  and those harp devices are all over the world they're not just up in alaska there's a map of them
[03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:28.720]  they have some in south america some in north america and they heat the ionosphere yeah what
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:33.040]  is that gonna do well they used to launch nuclear they were talking about launching nuclear bombs
[03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:37.360]  into the atmosphere just to see what it would do so these people are not above spraying particles
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:43.280]  into the air just to see what it would do right i mean this has been going on for decades and they
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:48.720]  talk about the chinese doing it in the russians but they're all doing it and the harp system
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:54.400]  here uh this was david walker he's the deputy assistant secretary of the air force for science
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:16:00.480]  technology and engineering and he was the one who actually dropped this bombshell uh he was asked
[03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:05.120]  by lisa murkowski about i mean they were dismantling the harp program there in alaska
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:09.760]  and so he was basically admitting yeah we've we've done everything we need to do with harp we're
[03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:15.120]  still leaving it up for whoever else might want to use it and do their own testing uh but we used
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:21.600]  it for injecting energy into the ionosphere to be able to actually control it but that work's been
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:25.840]  completed they're done with it now so you know and they kind of put it off like uh we you know we
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:31.120]  messed around with harp but it wasn't really anything that we were no and then they talk about
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:36.720]  all these different um wave blast simulators and these weapons that they're using underwater
[03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:41.360]  what that could actually cause tsunamis and things like this but it's for the it's for global warming
[03:16:41.360 --> 03:16:45.360]  and instead of looking at things like you know real pollution that is going on
[03:16:46.160 --> 03:16:50.320]  you know like putting florida in the water supply you're just taking a pollutant and dumping it in
[03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:55.200]  the water supply for everybody to ingest those things are looked at also as you're crazy you're
[03:16:55.200 --> 03:17:00.960]  a conspiracy theorist but you know we're talking about carbon things what we exhale and what plants
[03:17:00.960 --> 03:17:05.840]  breathe is the big pollutant in this area so the pope's got to ride around in a fiat his little
[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:10.800]  clown car you know here's another article from the guardian geoengineering product projects around
[03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:15.680]  the world it's a whole map of projects that are currently ongoing this is in 2012 but projects that
[03:17:15.680 --> 03:17:22.000]  are ongoing to change the environment to geoengineer the environment and so you can't say this stuff
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:27.040]  doesn't exist people are doing it in many different ways right it's not just spraying stuff in in the
[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:33.520]  clouds right and it's funny because michio kaku and that in that interview he talks about how
[03:17:33.520 --> 03:17:38.320]  you know in the future if you on your wedding day you want to have a clear day you'll be able
[03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:42.880]  to use this technology you know it'll probably cost you a hundred something thousand dollars to ensure
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:48.800]  no rain can you imagine if there's just a bunch of people running around thinking that they need to
[03:17:48.800 --> 03:17:53.760]  have a rain here and then of course if there is an issue with the drought like they're having in
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:59.840]  california you know why don't they have 2000 clear days you know they're right but but that you know
[03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:04.160]  that they've got under control that they're going to put black balls on top of their reservoir
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:10.800]  to absorb heat and make it evaporate faster and grow mold and and fungus was going to grow under
[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:15.360]  these things you know the israelis did the same thing but they did it with white balls right
[03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:19.040]  they said the white balls are the way to go and they actually have them it was pretty interesting
[03:18:19.040 --> 03:18:23.440]  article they the balls had holes in them so water would fill in them so they would kind of sit in
[03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:28.560]  the water but the water would condensate evaporate to the top and then condensate immediately so there
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:32.480]  was no I mean less water loss than what you would normally have through evaporation well and then
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:37.360]  what about the fact that there's plastic leaching into the water from the hot sun beating down on it
[03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:42.400]  yeah I guess they don't care about the gingerbending chemicals going into the water at all that must
[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:46.320]  that's probably they're probably coated with bpa I mean who knows these things are probably
[03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:51.040]  going to have a solid bpa nodules right they're like this will just bypass the middle man now
[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:57.680]  we won't have to pay our plastic makers to inject these hormones the bph but yeah I you know I had
[03:18:58.560 --> 03:19:03.680]  one of the writers from Buzzfeed kind of retweeted me when I was talking about how Kylie Jenner
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:08.880]  she tweeted out to all of her you know millions of twitter followers this question about geo
[03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:14.400]  engineering and look up in the sky and what is this and of course that was the ultimate opportunity
[03:19:14.400 --> 03:19:20.000]  for for the mainstream media or whatever alternative mainstream I wouldn't call them
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:25.760]  Buzzfeed mainstream but they you know for them to just poke fun at us and say oh look look at
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:33.360]  their spring and you know this is happening it's real why why is it so hard for them to just do
[03:19:33.360 --> 03:19:38.080]  a little research just like this reporter that made fun of Dane Wiggington telling him me sounded
[03:19:38.080 --> 03:19:44.400]  crazy and let me tell you Dane's even saying that the stuff their spring is helping keep these fires
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:48.400]  going in the west too and the fires are out of control right now yeah who knows we're going to
[03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:52.880]  get him on the show pretty soon to to talk about this and break it all down so all right well we've
[03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:58.720]  got a lot more coming up we're going to talk about the pope and the 2030 UN agenda and how he ties into

[03:28:33.120 --> 03:28:38.960]  little bit of at a time and if just a normal average person looks at it for more than five
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:44.560]  minutes can see blatantly what they're doing to the west coast right you're absolutely right trisha
[03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:49.280]  thank you there is so much evidence out there online we've interviewed people where they were
[03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:56.560]  they had documented all of these silks falling from the sky getting video there's planes flying
[03:28:56.560 --> 03:29:02.480]  above and all of these silk threads are then covering their property covering it or again
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:06.720]  is a beautiful state too but it is being systematically destroyed with what is going on
[03:29:06.720 --> 03:29:11.360]  in 10 years from now if you take a snapshot now and then you take the same snapshot 10 years from
[03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:15.680]  now you're going to see some major changes some major deforestation but not from log cutting
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:20.160]  you're just going to see it from dying trees which they blame on a beetle you know it's always the
[03:29:20.160 --> 03:29:24.160]  beetle you know it's not it's not anything else it's just this one beetle that's taking everything
[03:29:24.160 --> 03:29:29.440]  down and that seems to be you know their uh their cover story for everything it's never
[03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:33.520]  the cause of people spraying things in the atmosphere that are geoengineering which is
[03:29:33.520 --> 03:29:37.920]  admitted around the world right yeah please you sound like a conspiracy theorist right now
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:44.480]  oh my goodness all right well coming up more on the pope and the 2030 agenda blueprint for a new
[03:29:44.480 --> 03:29:50.080]  world order i mean he's there with the president and they are definitely uh ramping is up and
[03:29:50.080 --> 03:30:00.880]  overdrive run alex jones and the gcn radio network over the weekend charol akinson released
[03:30:00.880 --> 03:30:05.920]  the following article what the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies she starts off with
[03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:10.400]  a new england journal of medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism
[03:30:10.400 --> 03:30:14.960]  she then discloses the consulting firm behind the study the luan group lists major vaccine makers
[03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:18.880]  among its clients in fact the luan group's parent company united health group is a key
[03:30:18.880 --> 03:30:23.920]  government partner in obama care and a subsidiary of united health group qssi was given the contract
[03:30:23.920 --> 03:30:28.400]  to build the obama care website she then looks at the astroturf propaganda campaign and some of
[03:30:28.400 --> 03:30:34.080]  the buzzwords they use like weak too small haphazard not replicated junk science flawed unrelated
[03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:39.120]  and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia
[03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:43.760]  she then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and
[03:30:43.760 --> 03:30:48.560]  brain damage in fact permanent brain damage isn't acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines and
[03:30:48.560 --> 03:30:52.720]  there's no dispute in that arena so the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine
[03:30:52.720 --> 03:30:58.080]  propaganda in your face shove this back in theirs rob do for info wars dot com and info wars nightly

[03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:19.440]  leon macadoo now let's talk about some of the stories that are up on the drudge report today
[03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:26.960]  we are once again witnessing the exploitation of a tragedy to advance the surveillance state
[03:33:26.960 --> 03:33:33.440]  now we have iris scanners being implemented on school buses after a student's death now there
[03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:39.920]  was an autistic boy he apparently wasn't able to speak so he was left forgotten about he was left
[03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:46.000]  to die on a on a school bus it was parked in a district parking lot so now a nearby school district
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:52.240]  is going to be using biometric iris scanners on these special needs buses to prevent the tragedies
[03:33:52.240 --> 03:33:57.040]  like this one from happening in the future so every time the students get on or off the bus
[03:33:57.040 --> 03:34:01.680]  they're going to have their iris scanned and then that way it'll send an alert to the bus
[03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:06.320]  driver to let them know that the child is is on the bus and that they've exited the bus
[03:34:06.320 --> 03:34:10.960]  and then if you know at the end of the night at the end of the route they can make sure
[03:34:10.960 --> 03:34:16.080]  that all of the people have been checked out so of course you know they're saying that they're
[03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:23.360]  going to be rolling this out now for your children's safety and the president of the ira trans system
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:29.520]  points out how this is a something that's happening in epic proportions nationally that there's
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:34.000]  kids are falling asleep or they're getting lost and so they're really selling this to parents as
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:38.240]  you know it's for their safety and of course that's exact same thing they did in the past with these
[03:34:38.240 --> 03:34:46.080]  implantable idea implantable microchips so now you'll recall that in 2013 they already
[03:34:46.080 --> 03:34:51.360]  tried to roll this out without parents permission they already started scanning children's irises
[03:34:51.360 --> 03:34:55.680]  without parental consent a lot of people were really mad and they said oh well we sent you a
[03:34:55.680 --> 03:35:02.880]  letter telling you you could opt out which you know that turned out to just enrage a lot of parents
[03:35:02.880 --> 03:35:08.880]  well think about this they're getting these kids i mean even universities and and elementary
[03:35:08.880 --> 03:35:16.480]  schools now are using biometric information in lieu of ids and so they're getting all of your
[03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:22.400]  children's biometric information stored in a database for your safety but now let's look at
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:28.480]  another story i mean this is the federal government who can't even keep control over their own highly
[03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:35.120]  sensitive information so we learned about the one of the largest hacks in in history here that just
[03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:39.840]  happened a few months ago with the government there at the office of personnel management
[03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:45.680]  more than 20 million people top secret clearance had their information stolen from them one of the
[03:35:45.680 --> 03:35:52.160]  victims wrote that the the office of personnel management is the agency that asks your neighbors
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:57.760]  what they know about you that could be used to blackmail you so this is the type of top secret
[03:35:57.760 --> 03:36:05.120]  sensitive information that that that was hacked into well it also turns out that includes fingerprints
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:10.640]  and you know i've previously reported how easily your fingerprints could be used to frame you
[03:36:10.640 --> 03:36:15.040]  they can make a mold of your fingerprints they could use this in phones or anything where you
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:21.920]  have to actually scan in with your fingerprints so you know that perfectly safe for the government
[03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:28.240]  to hold on to all of your children's biometric information but now check this out this is a
[03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:35.760]  story at info wars dot com also up on the drudge report fbi is merging criminal and civil fingerprint
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:40.640]  database so now you know the fbi they've always said that they they didn't have any interest in
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:46.320]  you know keeping those fingerprints that your employers scan or that you know i had to put my
[03:36:46.320 --> 03:36:52.400]  fingerprints in order to get an id here in texas but now all of that has changed the fbi is going
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:57.600]  to be merging fingerprints and biographical information um they're going to be taking all
[03:36:57.600 --> 03:37:02.320]  of that and putting it in their government database this is according to the electronic
[03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:09.280]  frontier foundation and the eff believes that this change is part of an ever-growing movement
[03:37:09.280 --> 03:37:15.440]  toward cataloging information on everyone in america and it's a movement that won't end
[03:37:15.440 --> 03:37:22.640]  with fingerprints so is this more about safety for your children or pre-crime or is it about
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:27.440]  controlling a populace especially when we're seeing more and more civil unrest and people
[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:33.760]  pretty upset about the fact that they are living in a police state and now living in a technocratic
[03:37:33.760 --> 03:37:40.720]  police state but they're going to sell you this idea that they're not they're not using it for
[03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:47.840]  any nefarious means and it's totally okay and in fact just a few months ago uh the nsa was told
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:52.960]  they needed to shut shut everything down because it was violating our constitutional rights and so
[03:37:52.960 --> 03:37:57.440]  you know they went off with their tail between their legs saying we're going to shut it all down
[03:37:57.440 --> 03:38:02.000]  but of course they're going to hold on to all of the information they've already collected
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:07.200]  now john bowne has a really great in-depth report talking about this how there's some
[03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:16.800]  quote new rules for big brother and just kind of the the falseness of them saying that everything's
[03:38:16.800 --> 03:38:23.120]  okay all your data belongs to us and they'll keep it perfectly safe let's listen to that report
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:40.640]  the privacy you expect in emails contacts notes and even location data has been easily accessible
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:45.520]  to civil law enforcement agencies like the federal trade commission and the security and exchange
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:51.520]  commission for decades the electronic communications privacy act of 1986 was signed into law by
[03:38:51.520 --> 03:38:59.200]  president reagan on october 21st 1986 title one of the ecpa or ecpa was intended to protect wire
[03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:04.400]  oral and electronic communications while in transit title two known as the stored communications
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:10.080]  act was intended to protect communications held in electronic storage and title three prohibits
[03:39:10.080 --> 03:39:15.680]  the use of pen register and or trap and trace devices to record dialing routing addressing
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:20.800]  and signaling information used in the process of transmitting wire or electronic communications
[03:39:20.800 --> 03:39:25.360]  without a court order however the law is so ancient that government agencies have been
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:32.240]  mining it for years and the provisions in title two only apply to stored emails up until 180 days
[03:39:32.240 --> 03:39:38.400]  after that your emails are fair game the cloud has also created a new treasure trove of data
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:44.320]  related to every detail of your existence the nsa's two billion dollar utah data center has
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:49.840]  been gobbling up every individual's information and storing it for pre crime surveillance and a
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:55.200]  blatant criminal exercise of violating every americans fourth amendment rights to create a culture
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:01.200]  of submission now utah senator mike lee along with senator patrick lehi and representatives
[03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:06.880]  kevin yoder and jared polis are spearheading the ecpa amendments act the act would require
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:12.720]  law enforcement to acquire a warrant to gain access to your private information regardless of how
[03:40:12.720 --> 03:40:18.240]  old it is and the government bureaucracies would be required to notify unsuspecting americans that
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:24.560]  their privacy was breached by big brother within 10 days policies that should have been set up 30
[03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:30.960]  years ago of course big brother isn't going to go down that easy five years ago the u.s. court of
[03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:36.240]  appeals for the sixth circuit found the contents of email was fully protected by the fourth amendment
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:43.360]  regardless of its age and that's effectively become the rule nationwide major service providers no
[03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:48.400]  longer turn over the contents of emails are taxed without a warrant or a legitimate warrant exception
[03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:56.320]  the ecpa amendments act simply as senator lee knows we simply codify current practice
[03:40:57.360 --> 03:41:02.560]  as some have raised concerns the bill would hamper civil regulatory agencies such as the sec
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:10.000]  well we want these agencies to be effective but there's nothing in our constitution that says
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  only certain agencies have to follow the constitution others don't have to on behalf of the sec considering
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:20.960]  the electronic communications privacy amendments act pending before your committee i shared the
[03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:25.600]  bill's goal of updating ecpa's evidence collection procedures and privacy protections to account
[03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:31.040]  for the digital age but the bill in its current form poses significant risks to the american public
[03:41:31.040 --> 03:41:37.440]  by impeding the ability of the sec and other civil law enforcement agencies to investigate and uncover
[03:41:37.440 --> 03:41:43.040]  financial fraud and other unlawful conduct i firmly believe there are ways to update ecpa that
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:48.800]  offer stronger privacy protections and observe constitutional boundaries without frustrating
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:55.280]  the legitimate ends of civil law enforcement the sec's tripartite mission is to protect investors
[03:41:55.280 --> 03:42:01.280]  maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation our division of
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:05.600]  enforcement furthers this mission by investigating potential violations of the federal securities
[03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:10.320]  laws recommending the commission bring actions against alleged fraudsters and other wrongdoers
[03:42:10.320 --> 03:42:15.920]  and litigating the sec's enforcement actions a strong enforcement program is critical to the
[03:42:15.920 --> 03:42:21.280]  sec's efforts to protect investors from fraudulent schemes and promotes investor trust and confidence
[03:42:21.280 --> 03:42:26.640]  in the integrity of our securities market the new world order detests our god-given liberty
[03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:32.880]  consequently they also have no regard for law and order and in the face of a nation increasingly
[03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:40.080]  craving liberty congresses assumed access to our private lives should be revoked as it is clearly
[03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:49.440]  violating our bill of rights john bound for info wars dot com all right well there you go there
[03:42:49.440 --> 03:42:55.600]  from the government and they are here to help and now we've got to worry about our religious
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:43:00.960]  sectors as well because this month the un is going to be launching their blueprint for a new world
[03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:08.560]  order with the help of the pope now as everyone is fawning over his holy arrival you know let's
[03:43:08.560 --> 03:43:15.680]  point out how one of the number one search terms on google was is the pope the antichrist
[03:43:15.680 --> 03:43:21.120]  which is kind of funny because several years ago that was also one of the main trending
[03:43:21.120 --> 03:43:27.360]  google searches is obama the antichrist so kind of funny there but let's talk a little bit about
[03:43:27.360 --> 03:43:33.200]  this 2030 agenda there's pretty much been a total media blackout of this now this is a coming off
[03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:39.200]  of zero hedge submitted by michael snider he did this reporting but the sustainable development
[03:43:39.200 --> 03:43:44.640]  summit is going to be held from september 25th to the 27th and some people are calling this
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:52.720]  agenda 21 on steroids and this the sustainable development is going to transform our world
[03:43:52.720 --> 03:43:59.680]  for the better by 2030 so that's just 15 years so you can really see how they're ramping this whole
[03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:04.800]  agenda up into overdrive but this is not just about the environment it also includes plans
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:11.440]  regarding economics agriculture education and gender equality ah so that would explain some of
[03:44:11.440 --> 03:44:17.920]  those controversial white house guests now this this entire planet is going to be committing to
[03:44:17.920 --> 03:44:25.600]  working toward 17 sustainable development goals and 169 specific sustainable development targets
[03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:31.200]  so this is pretty important and it's being rolled out this week and yet no one is talking about it
[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:36.400]  there of course talking about uh you know the pope and and how exciting this is and those
[03:44:36.400 --> 03:44:41.680]  controversial white house guests and what that means for Catholicism and everything like that
[03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:48.400]  and how wonderful it is that the pope is going to be leveraging his his moral high ground to
[03:44:48.400 --> 03:44:54.240]  help push the president's agenda but they're not going to openly call this a new world order now
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:45:01.360]  obviously fundamentally changing the economic development of the world that's that's exactly
[03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:06.720]  what this is a new world order and in the past this always happens we have a technocratic elite
[03:45:06.720 --> 03:45:14.800]  who promise us a utopia and what what happens is that it quickly degenerates into extreme
[03:45:14.800 --> 03:45:20.800]  forms of tyranny so this is obviously something we're going to be reporting on a lot more in-depth
[03:45:20.800 --> 03:45:26.640]  obviously tonight on the nightly news as well as in the the days rolling out but this is pretty big
[03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:32.560]  news and and obviously that's why there's also a total media blackout in the mainstream media
[03:45:32.560 --> 03:45:37.360]  now another thing let's kind of switch gears here something we've been kind of reporting on
[03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:44.080]  all week because it was so shocking the fact that they are openly now peddling pedophilia
[03:45:44.640 --> 03:45:50.880]  and you know for myself it was just so extreme yeah there should be some other resources for
[03:45:50.880 --> 03:45:55.200]  people out there who have mental disorders to go figure out how they can help themselves
[03:45:55.200 --> 03:46:01.200]  rather than just these seedy dark internet forums so i get that i get where this person
[03:46:01.200 --> 03:46:06.240]  might be coming from but the way that the piece the salon dot com article that's gotten everyone
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:12.560]  in a tizzy the way it was written was you know feel sorry for me i was a victim and you know
[03:46:12.560 --> 03:46:17.440]  what pedophilia isn't that bad and we're people too and you should be understanding and just love
[03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:24.320]  us so that was incredibly shocking so shocking in fact that alex jones decided to channel
[03:46:24.880 --> 03:46:30.960]  one of these potbelly clowns and explain to you what this is really all about how how this
[03:46:30.960 --> 03:46:37.520]  is being uh unraveled here in our society and kind of got to the heart of the matter now
[03:46:37.520 --> 03:46:42.880]  this is a video that you really have to watch for yourself so if you go to info wars dot com
[03:46:42.880 --> 03:46:48.160]  forward slash show you can watch along with us it it's there with all of the articles all the
[03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:54.960]  news clippings everything all the proof you need to see what is happening with this pushing of
[03:46:54.960 --> 03:47:04.960]  pedophilia so here's that video
[03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:18.480]  welcome children welcome to the newest trendy liberal program brought to you
[03:47:18.480 --> 03:47:27.360]  by the liberal trendy establishment media you know who's coming out of the closet now with
[03:47:27.360 --> 03:47:35.040]  federal judges reeling on it and saying it's good all over the world writers for salon dot com
[03:47:36.080 --> 03:47:43.680]  telling you it's time to love the pedophile i just said it it's all about a sexual preference
[03:47:43.680 --> 03:47:49.760]  when we grab your kid out of the back of the yard teaching how to love
[03:47:51.520 --> 03:47:54.720]  and it's all right with our preference that you belong to us
[03:47:56.640 --> 03:48:02.960]  just like melissa harris perry said your kids don't belong to you they belong to the state
[03:48:02.960 --> 03:48:07.440]  part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:11.760]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities and the
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:18.000]  people that make up the state like me so that's time for you to learn it's an act of domination
[03:48:18.880 --> 03:48:25.520]  an act of control and we're not just going to sexually abuse your children we're going to
[03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:31.200]  forcibly inoculate them with deadly pathogens known to brain damage them we're going to rape
[03:48:31.200 --> 03:48:36.560]  their brains rape their minds and make you take care of them for decades when they're autistic
[03:48:36.560 --> 03:48:43.920]  we're in diapers crying at night because that's what we like to do and you're so weak and pathetic
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:50.400]  you'll do whatever we tell you so now i'm coming right out i don't have a message to the parents
[03:48:50.400 --> 03:48:58.960]  out to have a message to the children you belong to the state and big pharma you belong to the cult
[03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:06.720]  of the pbp the potbelly pedophile we're going to take good care of let me show you we're going
[03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:13.120]  to be living now once the state takes you away once the state teaches you how to enjoy yourself
[03:49:13.120 --> 03:49:19.840]  come on in you think sandeski you think the catholic church with the pedophiles is is isolated
[03:49:19.840 --> 03:49:25.200]  it's system-wide we control this country and the world now and your children belong to us
[03:49:25.200 --> 03:49:31.840]  so mommy and daddy aren't going to be able to protect you just like all the big defense contractors
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:37.280]  caught shipping kids around who do you think they feed them to us we're going to ship the
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:41.520]  narcotics into your country we're going to take your kids we're going to do whatever we want
[03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:47.040]  we're going to sit up there on television and implant on the new trendy group it's going to be
[03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:53.840]  people used to call pedophiles now we're upstanding citizens your kids belong to us
[03:49:53.840 --> 03:50:00.480]  better get used to that and understand it kids just like california passed a law that
[03:50:00.480 --> 03:50:05.040]  kids can decide to be vaccinated even if their parents don't want all right and that was just
[03:50:05.040 --> 03:50:11.520]  a portion of this video special report put out by alex jones it's called pedophiles are people too
[03:50:11.520 --> 03:50:17.680]  you can watch it in its entirety on the alex jones youtube channel like i said some disturbing
[03:50:17.680 --> 03:50:22.640]  images in that that you know you need to trigger warning most of you kids out there in the university
[03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:28.080]  right now but it's real that's that's actually happening and why are they peddling pedophilia
[03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:33.600]  now is it because there is some sort of satanic network happening is it because the upper echelons
[03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:39.760]  of our government are involved in this or two percent of catholic priests are pedophiles according
[03:50:39.760 --> 03:50:44.640]  to the pope himself i don't know i don't really know what it's about but it is some sort of a sick
[03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:49.920]  agenda that is happening and we're not going to let this happen i've got like i said a trigger
[03:50:49.920 --> 03:50:58.320]  warning myself or anybody out there that wants to touch some kids without uh i just we'll be right back

[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:21.360]  take one of your phone calls paul in new mexico you've been holding for quite some time and you
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:30.240]  wanted to talk about the pope go ahead yeah thanks when i was talking to you um the pope you know i
[03:54:30.240 --> 03:54:37.040]  just want to make a comment sorry my voice a little crack um the pope uh the pope is the one
[03:54:37.040 --> 03:54:43.600]  who's blowing the real smoke um as he pushes a global warming hoax not the coal plant which
[03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:51.040]  is below and co2 and water vapor um we need to stop work of worshiping and feigning over any man
[03:54:51.040 --> 03:54:55.680]  no man on a white horse is going to save this country only the lord jesus christ on his white
[03:54:55.680 --> 03:55:01.360]  horse and um his followers on their white horses will save this country that's why i look sort of
[03:55:01.360 --> 03:55:05.840]  like ben carson if you didn't have this problem with the vaccine i know i mean he's totally wrong
[03:55:05.840 --> 03:55:12.080]  on that but i like him other than that because he is a christian and it's only through our faith
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:17.920]  in the lord jesus christ so we're going to ever i mean who is the ultimate campaign advisor i would
[03:55:17.920 --> 03:55:23.840]  like to have the lord jesus christ my personal campaign advisor and my life personal my life
[03:55:23.840 --> 03:55:28.320]  campaign advisor not any other campaign advisor but the lord jesus christ is who i would want to
[03:55:28.320 --> 03:55:36.720]  rely on um we need to stop selectively shutting down these coal plants to uh collectively blame
[03:55:36.720 --> 03:55:42.880]  all the coal plants they keep the they could keep the the um 30 ones open to collectively
[03:55:42.880 --> 03:55:47.840]  scapegoat and blame the entire coal industry and shut them down well exactly and that's i mean it's
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:52.480]  just a this huge argument out there and it's really just to put money in the pockets of the
[03:55:52.480 --> 03:55:56.720]  globalists and take the power away from the people i'm not against recycling i'm not against
[03:55:56.720 --> 03:56:00.160]  taking care of the planet and all of these things i mean i don't want people to think i'm
[03:56:00.160 --> 03:56:07.120]  you know anti environment here but i'm just anti bs and we i think we've thoroughly cut through
[03:56:07.120 --> 03:56:12.880]  all of that thank you so much paul and you know i agree with you i think that's just right there
[03:56:12.880 --> 03:56:17.760]  we really have nothing to fear but it is about sort of shining a light on all of these dark places
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:22.960]  for other people out there who aren't aware about what's really going on now in the last
