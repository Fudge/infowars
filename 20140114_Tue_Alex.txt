[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:45.800]  well my head is spinning a lot right now like I know a lot of yours are with so
[00:45.800 --> 00:53.120]  much news and information to cover and we're going to attempt to go over every
[00:53.120 --> 00:59.320]  level of it but there are obviously huge breaking news stories about Obama and
[00:59.320 --> 01:07.800]  secret deals with Iran we've also got Obama not waiting on legislation I've
[01:07.800 --> 01:14.040]  got a pen and I can use it to sign executive orders very serious situation
[01:14.040 --> 01:19.360]  we're going to be playing that video clip coming up as the world just gets
[01:19.360 --> 01:25.640]  crazier and crazier obviously now the Federal Reserve is openly talking about
[01:25.640 --> 01:30.240]  hyperinflation being a good thing that's the decision they've made to go with
[01:30.240 --> 01:35.400]  that while depressing the real economy adding the icing of serious
[01:35.400 --> 01:41.520]  inflation she get the worst of both worlds we're gonna be looking at that
[01:41.520 --> 01:47.520]  also the Kelly Thomas verdict cops now have licensed a murder that stories up
[01:47.520 --> 01:53.960]  on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com this is the son of a retired police
[01:53.960 --> 02:00.600]  officer who said he's ashamed that he was ever a police officer who is
[02:00.600 --> 02:05.280]  schizophrenic and had no criminal record for anything serious and they tell him
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.600]  to get up and you know move and tell him who they are and then they say if you
[02:10.600 --> 02:14.640]  don't we're gonna hurt you real bad and then they pin him down eight cops and
[02:14.640 --> 02:20.960]  killing and you know this is a 14 minute video and I'm not gonna play the whole
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.640]  thing today but I just asked one of my crew to condense it down when we've got
[02:26.640 --> 02:29.680]  a four-minute clip of it but just to show the beginning of the encounter then
[02:29.680 --> 02:33.040]  what it goes through then beating him in the head with flashlights that was
[02:33.040 --> 02:40.120]  whole face caved in a jury has found that he died of a unknown heart condition
[02:40.120 --> 02:46.080]  four days after being in a coma at the hospital and of course when you look at
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.560]  the two so-called police officers they look like they could be Hollywood stars
[02:49.560 --> 02:54.520]  to play like evil minions of a goblin or something if you look at the two
[02:54.520 --> 03:04.280]  police officers who were tried and the jury I think just out of fear and out of
[03:04.280 --> 03:12.800]  a spirit of toting found them not guilty it's a very very dangerous type
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.600]  precedent when it's all on video and before the video got released the police
[03:17.600 --> 03:24.560]  lied about what had happened and this guy I mean is obviously being slowly
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.320]  tortured to death and you've got up to eight cops sitting on him or taking
[03:30.320 --> 03:36.120]  turns holding down each leg while they beat his head in and keep saying don't
[03:36.120 --> 03:43.160]  resist don't resist and then we had that article yesterday that I'm going to get
[03:43.160 --> 03:50.240]  back into where future cop says protesters should be exterminated in
[03:50.240 --> 03:58.280]  gas chambers anyone filming police should be killed and exterminated in gas
[03:58.280 --> 04:08.720]  chambers now the person is claiming that a friend used his Facebook account while
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.320]  at his home to post the threatening message first they said it was a hack and
[04:13.320 --> 04:17.600]  the police distance themselves from him and now he's saying that look whatever
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.840]  the point is is that we don't want a standing army of people looking for an
[04:23.840 --> 04:28.720]  excuse to use too much force and kill people and let me tell you how history
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.400]  works if the police keep acting like we're in foreign enemy and keep engaging
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.960]  activity like this the public is going to start treating you like an enemy you
[04:38.960 --> 04:42.080]  have record low numbers of police being killed by the way with firearms right
[04:42.080 --> 04:47.360]  now but there's this illusion by police that the public's out to get them that's
[04:47.360 --> 04:53.280]  coming up as well huge news on the Fukushima front Google front John Kerry
[04:53.280 --> 04:58.040]  front there is just so much going on hey what about to fit Secretary Bloomberg

[08:16.680 --> 08:35.040]  GCN radio network
[08:35.040 --> 08:41.160]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live a Tuesday
[08:41.160 --> 08:51.920]  edition already the 14th day of January 2014 there is so much to cover today but
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.520]  looking at literally hundreds of news articles every single day you see trends
[08:57.520 --> 09:03.560]  in the news and all over the country police are beating people up when
[09:03.560 --> 09:07.840]  they're off duty for no reason they're shooting people in movie theaters who
[09:07.840 --> 09:11.560]  they get in arguments with they're putting guns to people's heads for fun
[09:11.560 --> 09:18.480]  they are killing their wives it's getting bad because you take a bunch of
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.200]  soldiers you teach them the public's their enemy you militarize them you put
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.760]  them on a bunch of steroids you give them instinctive killing training they're
[09:26.760 --> 09:34.240]  going to start killing people and we've got a whole stack of news on that front
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.680]  that we're going to be going over in the third hour today I'm gonna spend some
[09:40.680 --> 09:47.000]  time giving you the jury's verdict when they found the police that clearly beat
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.800]  Kelly Thomas to death out in California and how the family and others
[09:52.800 --> 09:59.600]  responded and then how that ties in to police officer puts a gun to boys
[09:59.600 --> 10:06.320]  throat and McDonald's drive-thru and other reports man shot dead at movies
[10:06.320 --> 10:12.280]  after texting by a cop who was there watching the movie the list goes on and
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.400]  on and I'm not saying the average police officer is somebody that wants to kill
[10:17.400 --> 10:22.240]  innocent people what I am saying is the government itself is more and more
[10:22.240 --> 10:29.720]  above the law on warrantless spying NSA garbage persecution of the press no bid
[10:29.720 --> 10:34.360]  contracts the court rulings that the Supreme Court ruled we're gonna cover
[10:34.360 --> 10:39.920]  this that the Monsanto can contaminate your field your canola field that
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.520]  they're next door to and that they can then send their agents usually retired
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.560]  police or FBI onto your property without a warrant to pull up a hundred of your
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.880]  plants and then go test them and a plant doesn't have one mommy and one daddy it
[10:55.880 --> 11:03.040]  can be less than 1% Monsanto genetics meaning the pollen blows across it gets
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.960]  in there and then any of their genetics is in there by the way over 98% of
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.080]  world corn varieties last time I checked and there's by the way thousands of them
[11:14.080 --> 11:17.560]  ancient varieties Mexico is probably where corn came from the first
[11:17.560 --> 11:21.760]  cultivation they've got several thousand varieties down there they are all
[11:21.760 --> 11:28.840]  98% are infected basically all of them so you've got a multi thousand year old
[11:28.840 --> 11:34.520]  corn variety it's totally natural but corn pollen blows through the atmosphere
[11:34.520 --> 11:41.840]  like juniper pollen you name it it can blow thousands of miles it goes into
[11:41.840 --> 11:47.400]  your plant the Supreme Court ruled your property everything is Monsanto's this
[11:47.400 --> 11:55.120]  will be like if I patented my dogs droppings and then I went and I put
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.760]  them on your living room table and then I come in your house without a warrant
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.280]  photographs the dog droppings on your dining table and then I go to the Supreme
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.720]  Court the Supreme Court says your house now belongs to Alex Jones because he
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.000]  went in your house and put dog droppings on your table that that is
[12:13.000 --> 12:20.520]  actually what this ruling says that is the magnitude of the criminality and so
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.400]  you're gonna see that manifestation roll downhill you're going to see the
[12:25.400 --> 12:32.600]  police the bureaucrats the government totally above the law total mafia this
[12:32.600 --> 12:35.560]  is how tyrannies work if you're gonna want to get a zoning authorization
[12:35.560 --> 12:40.560]  you're gonna have to pay off the zoning inspectors big time and maybe they
[12:40.560 --> 12:44.640]  don't want money maybe they want your wife you want to be in the theater you're
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.720]  a great actress you're going to have to service the local political officer the
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.800]  local commissar that's on record that's how it works everywhere watch the true
[12:52.800 --> 12:58.560]  story the lives of others about the Stasi and East Germany this is what it
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.560]  is to be a slave and I've just got stacks of news here the point is it's
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.080]  overwhelming it's totally and completely overwhelming they said it's key that
[13:10.080 --> 13:14.120]  you sign on to Obamacare to make it fly that means they need to con them into
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.920]  paying exorbitant prices for the services to keep the Ponzi scheme going
[13:19.920 --> 13:25.680]  Iran's leader says they've had a great victory with their nuke deal on the
[13:25.680 --> 13:33.040]  West Israel is freaking out Obama supporter leading IRS probe visit the
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.680]  White House for seven hours so you you have the supposed whitewasher
[13:37.680 --> 13:44.160]  investigator hanging out in private meetings with El Hefe in that just
[13:44.160 --> 13:52.560]  nice so continuing here we're going to continue looking at Obama nominates
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.360]  cop killer advocate to head DOJ civil rights division and I've studied the
[13:58.360 --> 14:07.280]  case of Abu Jamal and I think he's rightfully in prison but everybody gets
[14:07.280 --> 14:12.520]  into this cause celeb case on both sides the bottom line is it's like that
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.760]  homeland security head for procuring armaments said they're going to have a
[14:16.760 --> 14:19.760]  race war and kill all the whites and finally got fired after six months of
[14:19.760 --> 14:23.120]  pressure this is the type of people they're putting in the DOJ is what I
[14:23.120 --> 14:27.280]  want to point out all of you right wingers that worship the police I think
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.680]  they can do no wrong what's going to happen when they've got all the Marxist
[14:31.680 --> 14:38.320]  and socialist in charge like they've got with Eric Holder who is an
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.160]  anti-American terrorist basically you see that's why you got to keep checks
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.680]  and balances on the government just like with liberals you love Obama spying
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.840]  and persecuting the Tea Party right now and Christian groups with the NSA on the
[14:49.840 --> 14:56.040]  IRS what's going to happen when a Republican gets in bozo what's the old
[14:56.040 --> 15:03.880]  nursery rhyme jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife could eat no lean so
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.960]  between the two they lick the bladder clean you all get into party politics
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.040]  and there are some differences there in things and but at the final equation the
[15:13.040 --> 15:16.440]  same special interests are funding both sides where they get the outcome they
[15:16.440 --> 15:23.280]  want either way House Republicans introduced resolution impeach Attorney
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.920]  General Holder notice that happened last year in November now two months ago
[15:28.920 --> 15:32.120]  no one ever really covered that I mean they got a little bit of coverage but
[15:32.120 --> 15:35.160]  not the coverage it should have that bill should have been passed he should
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.120]  be impeached for all the different things where he takes all this lobbyist
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.800]  money where the fast and furious all of it and it's only going to get worse and
[15:44.800 --> 15:51.400]  you know my motto here is equal justice to all justice is blind or you get a
[15:51.400 --> 16:02.040]  tyranny and that's how it works so when you don't get a conviction and the DA
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.400]  over in LA literally you know put his head in his hand and freaked out when
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.240]  they didn't convict these two so-called cops that beat this poor man to death
[16:12.240 --> 16:15.280]  they tell them we're gonna hurt you they're sitting there flipping their
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.520]  belly clubs and then they start beating him and then he's begging him and he
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.080]  begs only encourages them and they killing and the jury when you look at
[16:25.080 --> 16:28.880]  these two cops I mean if I was gonna have central casting for total low-level
[16:28.880 --> 16:32.760]  killer thugs if I was a Hollywood producer I would hire these guys these
[16:32.760 --> 16:41.200]  guys have a future in Hollywood if they want to play the part of just absolute
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.600]  bully little wimps I mean you look at them they're little they're weak they're
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.520]  fat and I'm not putting down little fat people I'm a little overweight the point
[16:50.520 --> 16:53.840]  is is that you're not little and fat trying to go beat people up there's
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.560]  nothing like a pack of wimps like if I see really big mean-looking cops I think
[16:58.560 --> 17:01.280]  oh they're probably gonna cause a problem for whatever reason people that
[17:01.280 --> 17:04.720]  are powerful don't want to abuse their power usually just that's the way it
[17:04.720 --> 17:09.480]  works they're confident they have too much pride when I see a pack of weak
[17:09.480 --> 17:17.400]  looking socialist style cops I mean I get concerned I get really really really
[17:17.400 --> 17:22.640]  concerned when I see a pack of little short arms short leg wimps that are
[17:22.640 --> 17:25.600]  trying to act tough and trying to act evil I immediately go whoa that's
[17:25.600 --> 17:28.400]  dangerous right there just like when I'm pulpit the gas station see like five or
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.840]  six gangbanger thugs I don't care if they're white meth heads or Mexican thugs
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.240]  or you know whatever they are black thugs that matter they're all the same
[17:37.240 --> 17:41.240]  and you look at them and it's the fact that they do look weak and stupid is
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.760]  why they're dangerous they're dumb enough to kill you over nothing and you see
[17:46.760 --> 17:55.960]  scum you see trash you know trash when you see it and I look at these cops and
[17:55.960 --> 18:01.200]  I look at the way they act and the way they behave find some photos of the
[18:01.200 --> 18:09.880]  cops is type in police officers charged in Kelly death and you'll be able to find
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.840]  it and later I'm gonna put some videos together and stuff and cover this in
[18:13.840 --> 18:21.880]  the in the third hour and kind of go over it but but that's the issue here by
[18:21.880 --> 18:26.120]  the way you see this case right here this is out of a business insider
[18:26.120 --> 18:35.240]  confirmed the DA struck a deal with Mexico's most notorious drug cartel and
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.320]  of course I followed this case in the federal courts the actual documents the
[18:39.320 --> 18:42.040]  drug cartel members that got arrested went into court said we worked for the

[19:10.560 --> 19:14.120]  arrangement with Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel that allowed the organization to
[19:14.120 --> 19:17.280]  smuggle billions of dollars of drugs while Sinaloa provided information on
[19:17.280 --> 19:21.480]  rival cartels this was the CIA backed cartel trying to wipe out its

[19:49.280 --> 19:53.760]  involved as well but their investigation was full-scale so no one's gonna give it

[24:27.320 --> 24:49.120]  baby baby baby just a decade ago the United States was in the top three best
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.280]  places to do business in the world the Wall Street Journal is now reporting
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.000]  that we're not even in the top 10 and that's what globalism is you imagine
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.520]  how valuable it was the special corporate interest with NAFTA GATT and
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.800]  then all these other globalist deals to sell off American infrastructure and to
[25:09.800 --> 25:13.600]  make deals with communist China and countless other authoritarian regimes
[25:13.600 --> 25:20.080]  to move our main production offshore that was the first looting in the sellout
[25:20.080 --> 25:26.040]  of the country and replacing it is paramilitary police giant prisons that
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.680]  are basically the modern gulags and by every metric we are transferring
[25:30.680 --> 25:36.040]  ourselves from a free country to a very serious tyranny and once you start
[25:36.040 --> 25:39.280]  falling on the list of free countries we're also very low on the list of free
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.000]  countries now in major university studies in fact I thought it was last year
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.480]  major university listed us the seventh most tyrannical government in the
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.600]  world if you look at a whole bunch of different benchmarks seventh most
[25:53.600 --> 25:59.680]  tyrannical government in the world saw that study last year and we're
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.360]  definitely the most unhealthy in the world now after the Russians they're a
[26:03.360 --> 26:10.000]  close close first or second no one really knows it's by a nose and we are
[26:10.000 --> 26:17.320]  under globalism which is the modern name of Bolshevik revolution funded by the
[26:17.320 --> 26:22.600]  Rothschilds and others and if you like tyranny we'll get ready for more now I
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.920]  said I'd mention this in the next hour but if you're a TV viewer I want to just
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.400]  show folks the photo we did find it now of the two police officers that were
[26:32.400 --> 26:38.200]  charged with killing the homeless man in California and the jury found them not
[26:38.200 --> 26:45.560]  guilty and everybody's pretty freaked out because they kill him over really 20
[26:45.560 --> 26:48.640]  minutes we're going to play some of that audio and video in the next hour
[26:48.640 --> 26:54.280]  condensed down just him begging for his life and to them striking him over and
[26:54.280 --> 26:59.400]  over again as they sit on his arms and legs and feet and finally crush in his
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.760]  windpipe to shut him up begging for air and I guess they did give him mercy
[27:04.760 --> 27:09.760]  after a while and this is a police officer's son and that's what I've always
[27:09.760 --> 27:15.480]  said before this case even happened fate has a strange way of working police that
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.640]  do stuff like this when you claim you're in an honorable position and you abuse
[27:20.640 --> 27:26.360]  innocent people and you're a sadist you better be a full sadist because your
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.000]  wives your daughters your sons are gonna die of cancer early they're gonna die in
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.800]  car wrecks and they're gonna be killed by cops and other criminals I mean it's
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.720]  it's real folks you don't have to wait for judgment when you die you get judged
[27:39.720 --> 27:46.040]  twice and that's what God fearing is I don't want to do anything bad a I have
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.760]  a conscience and it doesn't feel good be when I even think about doing something
[27:50.760 --> 27:54.040]  bad to somebody who's done me wrong I go no I don't want that coming back on me
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.440]  I just let them do what they're gonna do I take the high road unless I'm cornered
[27:59.440 --> 28:06.040]  and have to defend myself and then I do it as morally as I can and my life has
[28:06.040 --> 28:09.560]  just gotten better and better since I fully embraced that and I've always
[28:09.560 --> 28:14.800]  embraced that but I'm I fully embraced for giving my enemies I have fully
[28:14.800 --> 28:19.480]  embraced understanding psychology I have fully embraced you understand this but
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.840]  you look at the photo of these cops that are gonna go free now and I'm telling
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.640]  you you look in their eyes and you and I remember watching them in the courthouse
[28:30.640 --> 28:33.440]  and in some of the court proceedings that were on television they didn't have
[28:33.440 --> 28:36.760]  the whole trial televised but I mean you look at those eyes and you look at
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.320]  those faces those are arrested development men who feel incredibly
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.720]  weakened side and who in a group of eight people want to find some weak
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.200]  homeless guy who doesn't even resist them and who panics out of fear I mean I'd
[28:49.200 --> 28:52.880]  run to if I saw a bunch of these cops walking up flipping their nightsticks
[28:52.880 --> 28:57.080]  and I'm sitting there in the cold doing nothing wrong and it turned out he
[28:57.080 --> 29:00.960]  hadn't mess with cars he had never stolen anything he was a schizophrenic guy
[29:00.960 --> 29:06.600]  living on the street and he was mentally ill and he ran and they killed him and
[29:06.600 --> 29:13.800]  I'm telling you police if you don't decry this type of activity if you don't
[29:13.800 --> 29:19.640]  cover this type of activity if you don't go over this type of activity if you
[29:19.640 --> 29:24.320]  don't say it's wrong you're going to bring all this down on you and us just
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.480]  like it's now 56 million babies that have been aborted since 73 I keep saying
[29:29.480 --> 29:33.600]  52 million that's an old number 56 million babies have been chopped up plus
[29:33.600 --> 29:37.400]  and we say they're not human well now the government's gonna say we're not

[36:55.640 --> 37:00.600]  in Mexico three of them are run by large US global banks and the CIA and the F.
[37:00.600 --> 37:05.760]  behind and that they ship the drugs in and distribute them and then even have
[37:05.760 --> 37:11.160]  deals to bust drug dealers five six levels down of course the drug dealer on
[37:11.160 --> 37:16.800]  the street doesn't even know the drugs were flown in on golden on major bank
[37:16.800 --> 37:26.200]  aircraft like Wacovia or Wells Fargo in a two-year period they flew in 378
[37:26.200 --> 37:30.560]  billion dollars according to Bloomberg articles so this is all out there it's
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.760]  just that this illustrates how the whole thing works and again when you're
[37:36.760 --> 37:40.240]  dumb enough to use drugs because people give them to you in high school and then
[37:40.240 --> 37:45.760]  five years later you're a prostitute on street get your cocaine or heroin all
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.040]  of that money gets laundered back through the banks and so your daughter
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.960]  becomes a prostitute you become a robber I guess that breaks in houses to get
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.120]  drugs or people that are on drugs you know rob those they work for and it just
[37:58.120 --> 38:01.440]  creates a total criminal culture the drugs would be incredibly inexpensive
[38:01.440 --> 38:05.440]  and seen as the blight they are if Hollywood didn't make them sexy and if
[38:05.440 --> 38:09.240]  there wasn't big profits in them because of the black market so it's simple the
[38:09.240 --> 38:13.120]  big mafia the big banks made narcotics illegal at the end of prohibition
[38:13.120 --> 38:16.840]  because they'd made their biggest profits ever when they got alcohol
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.520]  criminalized by manipulating the Christian lobby that's all on record so
[38:21.520 --> 38:24.840]  they could increase profits profits went up I don't know 5,000 percent some
[38:24.840 --> 38:28.780]  estimates are on liquor profits the police were corrupted everything was
[38:28.780 --> 38:37.240]  corrupted and when that ended the year after they made alcohol legal again after
[38:37.240 --> 38:44.160]  that decade of prohibition they in the early 30s made narcotics illegal you
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.880]  could buy cocaine heroin opium speed anything you wanted at the local drug
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.440]  store and you would go on your child would have a Coca-Cola with it with a
[38:54.440 --> 39:00.120]  scoop of ice cream that you know had a large amount of cocaine in it you maybe
[39:00.120 --> 39:04.360]  you'd have a Dr. Pepper had some cocaine and your child would have some
[39:04.360 --> 39:07.800]  cocaine and then and then and then you would they'd bounce off the walls and
[39:07.800 --> 39:12.040]  then you know you would have them come down you'd give them a some syrup some
[39:12.040 --> 39:16.160]  cough syrup some laudanum at night to make them calm down of course you were
[39:16.160 --> 39:20.200]  taking drugs as well but the point is much lower level of people took drugs
[39:20.200 --> 39:24.520]  back then and you can look at those statistics but but drug abuse was was
[39:24.520 --> 39:32.360]  much much much much lower there it is cocaine two thick drops for children if
[39:32.360 --> 39:43.480]  you just type in cocaine sold in drug stores 15 cents for how many doses you
[39:43.480 --> 39:53.240]  guys found a ton of stuff once you type in to find that Sears and Roebuck cocaine
[39:53.240 --> 39:59.000]  in the Google search images and that's what it brings up for it and you could
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.720]  order via Sears and Roebuck to 50 cases of cocaine if you wanted to and there was
[40:03.720 --> 40:06.320]  less drug use but if you're ever out in the country you got an old home place
[40:06.320 --> 40:10.280]  and you're digging around it's very valuable to do this fact I should do it
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.760]  I could make a lot of money doing it to help find the operation you could go
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.960]  dig into old junk piles in the countryside and you will find thousands of
[40:18.960 --> 40:24.040]  laudanum which is opium and cocaine bottles you name it and you can read
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.920]  the old Coca-Cola labels you know that says how much cocaine it had in it but
[40:29.920 --> 40:33.480]  of course you tell a yuppie that that Coca-Cola has cocaine or had cocaine in
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.760]  it it has decaffeinated cocaine still in it that's the mystery ingredient it's
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.440]  not a mystery it's denatured cocaine that's that's the flavor of cocaine
[40:41.440 --> 40:45.080]  with sugar and people are like no that's a conspiracy theory no it's called
[40:45.080 --> 40:49.320]  coke it's called coke for a reason I know people don't believe that it's a
[40:49.320 --> 40:57.040]  wild conspiracy theory but coke of cola is cocaine cola it's like a cocaine
[40:57.040 --> 41:03.680]  sassaparilla that's sassaparilla is a root like root beer but the whole point
[41:03.680 --> 41:07.040]  is is that this is this is the way it works and they said man why are we
[41:07.040 --> 41:09.600]  letting all these little companies ship this in and all these little drug
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.640]  stores and apothecaries why are we to just make it illegal we'll ship it right
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.280]  into the kids we'll have anti-drug programs to teach the kids how to use it
[41:18.280 --> 41:24.200]  and we will take this country over and they did it and great job and by the
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.880]  way you know you had more than 15 drug cartels in Mexico just a decade ago we
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.280]  had Celica still on retired DEA agent Vietnam veteran former board patrol
[41:33.280 --> 41:38.240]  agent before that he was Vietnam board patrol in DEA and you know he said no
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.920]  they're funding a Senola and Los Zetas to actually take out the other 10 groups
[41:43.920 --> 41:47.840]  and then they're gonna have them take each other out and they've offered for
[41:47.840 --> 41:53.720]  me to be trained to train with US military at King Ranch the pair of
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.320]  militaries to go start the war Mexico's gonna collapse said this on my show seven
[41:57.320 --> 42:01.240]  years ago that we had video then some of castle's videos are online and then it
[42:01.240 --> 42:06.200]  all broke loose we broke it on this show on record and I don't even like
[42:06.200 --> 42:09.040]  breaking stuff I'd rather it be in the news and then cover it because it's
[42:09.040 --> 42:12.680]  less dangerous for us by the way they came and set him up with guns and put
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.160]  him in prison for that for selling his neighbor a shotgun the state police with
[42:18.160 --> 42:24.600]  the ATF came and got him because you're not gonna cut in on the drugs so so
[42:24.600 --> 42:29.800]  that's what's going on and there's a New York Times had line for 2011 DEA
[42:29.800 --> 42:34.560]  Launders Mexican prophets of drug cartels yeah the DEA is listening to all
[42:34.560 --> 42:38.240]  your phones your email everything on record this has now been released three
[42:38.240 --> 42:42.160]  months ago but we already knew this to find out who's shipping in drugs that
[42:42.160 --> 42:46.040]  isn't authorized by the big banks that own the country through fraud and now
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.360]  it's come out that and then when they want to go set you up anything they
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.840]  will then create fake cases to do it and and go lie to the court how they got
[42:54.840 --> 43:00.360]  evidence so that's how it works folks when you become a drug enforcement
[43:00.360 --> 43:03.960]  agency person unless you're a total idiot on what they call the white side
[43:03.960 --> 43:08.840]  of things that pushes paper and bust low-level people they're all sitting in
[43:08.840 --> 43:16.680]  the back office laughing at you they are all drug dealers I mean basically the
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.600]  intel I've got from high-level sources is a couple years ago we passed the line
[43:20.600 --> 43:25.280]  of more than half the FBI are now corrupt more than half the DEA and they're
[43:25.280 --> 43:32.920]  all the top half and they literally make jokes and laugh all day at all of the
[43:32.920 --> 43:38.440]  people that aren't corrupt it's a huge joke just like with Frank Serpico talking
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.040]  about how it was a big joke that he wouldn't take money and he was the only
[43:41.040 --> 43:46.880]  cop in the narcotics entire New York narcotics I had him on the show the
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.440]  only one that didn't take drug money that didn't and and by the way the reason
[43:52.440 --> 43:56.720]  Serpico wouldn't do this was he was a moral guy plus he saw the rackets that
[43:56.720 --> 44:01.960]  it was involved in child trafficking everything else and he said to him he
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.760]  goes this isn't just drugs guys because he's more of a liberal he's for
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.480]  decriminalization he said this stuff is connected to everything I'm not gonna be
[44:09.480 --> 44:15.400]  part of this I'm not gonna be part of and so they shot him in the face and it
[44:15.400 --> 44:26.440]  is the incredible naivete of the general public the off-the-chart naivete that
[44:26.440 --> 44:34.160]  allows this to continue to go on I mean just stop being naive I mean I've
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.440]  probably walked over to a hundred tables of police all over the country and in
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.600]  England and other places and said hey you guys know the big banks wander all
[44:41.600 --> 44:44.240]  the drug money they'll go yep yeah we do well why don't you do something about
[44:44.240 --> 44:47.240]  that hey man they just tell us what we can do need to go change that in
[44:47.240 --> 44:54.080]  Congress Alex what I'm saying who I am and I'm like but you still stop me in a
[44:54.080 --> 44:58.040]  checkpoint now if I got drugs yeah we just do what we're told and if you don't
[44:58.040 --> 45:03.680]  mind we're having a conversation here buddy that's that's how they act yeah
[45:03.680 --> 45:09.760]  we know government deals of drugs now I'm eat my lunch leave me alone but then
[45:09.760 --> 45:13.920]  when they pull you over got any drugs in here what's going on in here I mean give
[45:13.920 --> 45:20.320]  me a break give me a break that's all I'm saying hey you're eating your lunch
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.880]  leave you alone how about you leave me alone driving down the road how about
[45:23.880 --> 45:28.080]  you stop acting like I did something that's what I'm talking about how about
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.360]  you stop finding teenagers with drugs and then throwing them in prison where
[45:31.360 --> 45:35.040]  real criminals get them and then under pressure those teenagers become hardened
[45:35.040 --> 45:40.480]  criminals the systems of fraud we got the biggest prison population in the world
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.600]  it's all designed to destroy us and corrupt us and that's what I'm saying
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.160]  and the whole things are stinking fraud and everybody knows it and I'm tired of
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.920]  it now who doesn't know it is good old boys out in the countryside they know
[45:53.920 --> 45:57.240]  they love guns they know they love Jesus they love freedom they love George
[45:57.240 --> 46:02.800]  Washer they're the best people but the worst people my magazine got distributed
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.360]  in in northeast Texas where I got family and I got phone calls and stuff and
[46:07.360 --> 46:11.400]  they said these are smart people but they said Alex the community is proud of
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.800]  you but they're talking you're promoting marijuana in your magazine because we
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.100]  had a sponsor with hemp soap and hemp powder that has zero THC there's
[46:21.100 --> 46:26.320]  hundreds of varieties of hemp only a few have THC in them totally legal and I
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.400]  said to them I said yeah but do you understand that's what they make rope
[46:30.400 --> 46:35.920]  out of makes better cotton than cotton it's it's I mean you understand it's one
[46:35.920 --> 46:40.720]  of the most amazing plants out there on record medically and they go yeah but
[46:40.720 --> 46:50.320]  it's the marijuana no no it's not so see they think marijuana is so bad that
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.320]  even if it's the type that doesn't have any THC in it it'd be like if you were
[46:55.320 --> 47:00.400]  drinking buckler non-alcoholic beer that for large long periods when I don't
[47:00.400 --> 47:04.800]  drink any you know I'm out with friends I'll drink one of those because I like
[47:04.800 --> 47:11.400]  to taste the beer that's like saying you're bad drinking buckler but you're
[47:11.400 --> 47:19.080]  not even smoking this stuff this is soap and this is hemp powder protein really
[47:19.080 --> 47:24.280]  good for your heart they're like we know that but it just looks bad see they
[47:24.280 --> 47:29.320]  think oh dirty drugs oh my gosh oh my gosh marijuana oh my gosh that's what
[47:29.320 --> 47:32.560]  the Mexican smoke that's how they sold it it was called hemp before but they
[47:32.560 --> 47:35.960]  used not even racism but just people didn't know the name when they got
[47:35.960 --> 47:43.840]  marijuana made felony in the 30s they ran news videos or news reels before
[47:43.840 --> 47:47.880]  movies of where people smoke your westerns where you smoke one hit off
[47:47.880 --> 47:52.000]  marijuana and a bunch of crazy Mexicans then kill the whole town they go from
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.040]  Mexico and the Mexicans marijuana and then they would have other ones were
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.040]  like crazy midgets murder everybody I'm not kidding these are the movies they
[48:00.040 --> 48:05.320]  met and a reefer madness where you smoke it and you murder everybody and so they
[48:05.320 --> 48:09.240]  banned hemp growing in this country when we were the number one hip producers
[48:09.240 --> 48:16.760]  in the world better than cotton better for sales better for rope and no TH they
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.120]  even banned that the churches said burn it burn it and people were arrested that
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.760]  kept growing hemp towards Washington grew him he grew the type that got you
[48:25.760 --> 48:28.880]  got you high like I've read the accounts towards Washington when he had
[48:28.880 --> 48:34.600]  toothaches his doctors said go to the apothecary and get yourself the toothache
[48:34.600 --> 48:40.120]  hemp they call it toothache or or or stomach hemp because if you had a tooth
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.440]  ache or you had a stomach ache they told you get this in your pipe and draw it
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.680]  into your lungs that'll help with the stomach ache but see this is how
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.520]  ignorant we are now George Washington we had a toothache would load up his
[48:53.520 --> 48:59.600]  tobacco pipe and smoke THC by the way I don't like it I don't use it my point is
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.360]  we've got the banks laundering the drugs running the drugs controlling drugs
[49:03.360 --> 49:05.840]  they hate marijuana because that's something you can grow so they don't
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.360]  control that and that's why there's a war on marijuana because that's the only
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.760]  thing the drug dealers don't control and they want to control it and ship it in
[49:13.760 --> 49:18.440]  out of Latin America and make the profit off that too and here it is in the
[49:18.440 --> 49:25.680]  New York Times and the El Paso Times and El Universal and info wars.com and
[49:25.680 --> 49:30.160]  prisonplanet.com what all came out in court is that they were doing it all for
[49:30.160 --> 49:39.160]  the US government and the leader of the cartel was a CIA asset and you're like
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.360]  well why did this even come out because one group of the government that wasn't
[49:42.360 --> 49:46.960]  corrupt and ended up busting him the whole government's not bad but let me
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.360]  tell you what happens to FBI agents and DEA agents that don't play ball just like
[49:51.360 --> 49:55.720]  Serpica they kill them or they audit them or they set them up or they cheat on

[54:37.880 --> 54:41.640]  prohibition they need a new racket and you know I pointed out that you can go
[54:41.640 --> 54:44.600]  out to any farmstead or area and dig into the soil and find all those
[54:44.600 --> 54:47.600]  collectible bottles that are worth hundreds of dollars a piece in some
[54:47.600 --> 54:51.600]  cases not because there's drugs in them there's dirt in them but because they
[54:51.600 --> 54:57.320]  are a collectible there's a little side issue but here it is confirm the DEA
[54:57.320 --> 55:02.760]  struck a deal they call it a deal no they set these cartels up with Mexico's
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.960]  most notorious drug cartel to let them ship in billions of dollars of drugs for
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.800]  information provided on cartels yes because they were their army to go in
[55:13.800 --> 55:22.320]  and control it Sinaloa led by El Chapo Guzman supplied 80% of the drugs
[55:22.320 --> 55:27.600]  entering the Chicago area and has a presence in cities across the US as
[55:27.600 --> 55:31.360]  Chicago is one of the main distribution hubs anywhere the trains the planes they
[55:31.360 --> 55:37.640]  all come in the police are on the take and that's why they use Chicago as their
[55:37.640 --> 55:44.240]  narcotics trafficking command base Miami Houston Los Angeles I mean it's just
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.840]  incredible the border patrol the DEA they're all there to stop small time
[55:48.840 --> 55:54.920]  operators from driving down the prices just like the FDA is there to make sure
[55:54.920 --> 55:58.840]  nobody can sell vitamins and minerals that could actually help people show
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.320]  that only big pharma has control the racket it's all about monopolies and
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.540]  turf with the new world order and the NSA is there to give the global mafia the
[56:08.540 --> 56:19.760]  intel it needs to dominate society excuse me now that said ladies and gentlemen
[56:19.760 --> 56:29.400]  coming up in the next hour the nanny secretary of defense soldiers came this
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.000]  close to having their personal lives micromanaged by the social engineer of
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.200]  the Big Apple we had a write an article about this what a nightmare scenario the
[56:40.200 --> 56:45.120]  anti-gun guy that says guns should be confiscated at gunpoint in control of
[56:45.120 --> 56:52.280]  the armed forces mayor Bloomberg Robert Gates put out a statement that he would
[56:52.280 --> 56:56.680]  have hired Michael Bloomberg as possible replacement of Secretary of Defense
[56:56.680 --> 57:01.480]  and Bloomberg is now being looked at down the road for that the guy that tried
[57:01.480 --> 57:07.040]  to use New York City and his billions of dollars from from Wall Street scams to
[57:07.040 --> 57:10.920]  then go after the rest of the country the states and cities and ban our guns
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.480]  by fiat he wants control of the military it doesn't matter globalists like him
[57:15.480 --> 57:18.000]  are already in control the military it's just they're going to make it
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.000]  official it's going to be totally official with the Federal Reserve and all
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.280]  these major posts are run by open anti-gun New World Order globalist a lot
[57:28.280 --> 57:34.840]  of them from Israel and places like France and England I mean our country
[57:34.840 --> 57:38.840]  is run by foreigners foreign technicians that will come in and do
[57:38.840 --> 57:44.760]  whatever they're told at any time so that's just some of the news that is
[57:44.760 --> 57:49.240]  coming up we're also going to look at some moves by Congress as opposed to
[57:49.240 --> 57:53.320]  rain in the NSA that's really a whitewash but that's coming up we're
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.360]  gonna look at this deal with Iran that's got a lot of people pretty freaked out
[57:58.360 --> 58:03.960]  we're also gonna look more at that Wall Street Journal article dealing with the
[58:03.960 --> 58:07.960]  US being a horrible place to do business from being rated the best place to do
[58:07.960 --> 58:14.960]  business now now one of the worst places to do business and we're also going to
[58:14.960 --> 58:22.680]  look at some of the big developments with Google that is all all coming up but
[58:22.680 --> 58:26.800]  don't worry Obama has hired one of his personal friends to a big Democrat to
[58:26.800 --> 58:31.080]  run the IRS investigation and criminal charges not expected an IRS probe
[58:31.080 --> 58:36.280]  really criminal charges aren't expected of the mafia murdering child trafficking

[1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:39.320]  Alex Jones we are now into our number two coming up in about 20 minutes we've
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.000]  got an interesting pro-gun advocate popping in on the broadcast we have some
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:49.520]  other second amendment news that we're going to be going over today as well but
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:54.240]  getting into the news right now I'm a Obamacare front youth participation low
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:59.520]  in early Obamacare enrollment and now it's coming out like I told you months
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:03.880]  ago most people who think they enrolled didn't really enroll they go in and
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.480]  they're not enrolled in anything so again the people that think that they've
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:12.360]  enrolled they know the mentality of the public people that think a lot of
[1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:15.480]  retickets gonna win they're gonna go to the casino and win they know that
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:21.760]  mentality and that's what they target and show all it is is the insurance
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:26.880]  companies being able to increase prices that's all this is period that's all it
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:30.480]  is and it allows the government to lower the quality of care and carry out
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:36.280]  eugenics 79% of Obamacare enrollees qualify for subsidies 70% of those
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.800]  enrolled need subsidies because they cannot otherwise afford the premiums
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:44.000]  they have in some cases nearly doubled so be fully go on welfare and Medicare
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:49.320]  and Medicaid then you're okay but if you try to actually still keep a job and
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:53.520]  stuff it's forced to make you go bankrupt and go on the welfare roles ahead
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:58.400]  of accelerating the full collapse but then if you try to live in your own house
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:01.680]  that you work for your whole life they're gonna raise property taxes and
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:06.320]  stuff until you have to lose the house and if you don't leave the house that's
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:11.680]  even paid for a SWAT team will come and will murder you so good they like to
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:15.360]  kill people I think they should and that's what makes them feel manly
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:20.760]  Spanish language Obamacare website is written in Spanglish so no one can
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:23.920]  understand it basically and the code doesn't even work of course it's all
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:29.240]  just fraud and another big Democratic National Committee donor has gotten the
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:34.280]  new contract to redo the last scam so see how they get more money by scamming
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:38.960]  you more money by failing at Katrina more money every time they screw up
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:44.600]  because no one ever gets held accountable there's another story here out of
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:47.320]  the Daily Caller about how a disabled family lost its health coverage and
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:51.640]  it's Obamacare's fault well of course it is and now the insurance companies are
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:59.880]  bragging publicly that they're gonna have huge profits off Obamacare of course
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:05.040]  they wrote it but there's nothing like watching them publicly brag about the
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:12.160]  entire the entire situation and Obamacare approval drops to an all-time low in
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:21.760]  Gallup so now only 38% in this whitewash poll believe that it's a good deal
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:26.840]  and boy how much you want to bet that 38% are dumber in a box of rocks I love
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:30.480]  how so-called liberals are always like how they're smart and their radio shows
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:36.000]  and TV shows are all about how they're smart and everyone else is dumb and it's
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  like they think they've arrived just because they do whatever the Democratic
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:45.120]  Party says but the Democratic Party is an incredible mafia organization that
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:48.840]  when it comes to true criminal thuggishness is white years worse than
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:51.960]  Republican Party Republicans are a bunch of establishment blue-butt lawyers
[1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:55.520]  that know how to game the whole system but keeping their hands clean most of
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:04:01.280]  the time the Democrats are street-level criminals that have taken over and work
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:05.560]  for foreign offshore banks and when you just look at how gullible their
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:11.360]  followers are it is it is really a shame to watch what schmucks they are for
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:16.840]  lack of a better pejorative more embarrassment for Obamacare as new

[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:29.040]  now have a license to murder the homeless man they beat to death over 20
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:34.240]  minutes we've got a report on that at the start of the next hour also we are
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:39.520]  now going to continue our reportage for about 10 minutes in the third hour as
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:45.000]  well from the west coast on Fukushima radiation and then a really important
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.640]  article by Michael Schneider up on info wars.com what should be done to a
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:55.400]  country that kills 56 million of its own people do you know how many babies have
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:00.520]  been murdered in America since 1973 and if you want to know why our countries
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:04.120]  have so much trouble a lot of people think they're not humans but the
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:10.320]  globalists don't think you're a human or have rights as well so you at a base
[1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:17.560]  level make these type of determinations there is nothing to underpin the
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:29.240]  society anymore once that happens now continuing here with the news this is
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:34.000]  really outrageous dealing with Obama and it's a Kit Daniels article up on
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:42.600]  info wars.com Obama supporter leading IRS probe visited White House for seven
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:47.240]  hours the White House visitor records show that the head of the criminal probe
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:51.040]  into the IRS targeting of tea party grips serious political persecution
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:55.880]  visited President Obama in 2009 after receiving an unusual invitation from the
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:58.840]  White House according to the records the White House staffer for the Office of
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:04.360]  Public Engagement requested the Justice Department Attorney Barbara Kay Bosserman
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:11.680]  come October 28th 09 to a hate crimes event at Obama's guest as a visit
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:17.520]  ultimately lasted over seven hours behind closed doors and and and folks
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:21.400]  again when you hear about hate crimes that means restricting free speech
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:27.800]  like now you've got a disability group slamming the Wolf of Wall Street because
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:36.160]  they reenacted throwing the height impaired people or midgets at a dart
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:41.760]  board well that really happened can you not show Nazi shooting people because
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:45.840]  it's hurtful because that really happened no they want to selectively
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:51.280]  decide what and can't be seen so that they can control speech that is what is
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:56.560]  going on on that front a really important article that I wanted to break down
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:04.360]  here Supreme Court hands Monsanto victory over farmers on GMO seed patents
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:10.960]  ability to sue the US Supreme Court upheld biotech giant Monsanto's claims
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:16.520]  on genetically engineered seed patents and the company's ability to sue farmers
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:21.680]  whose fields are inadvertently contaminated with Monsanto materials
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:26.720]  and this is a really big deal because I followed these cases I've interviewed
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:30.720]  Percy Smeiser from Canada I've interviewed families that are involved in
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:38.960]  this suit from Kansas and North Dakota and in corn cases in canola cases in
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:43.280]  soybean cases going back over 15 years we followed the last four or five big
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:49.840]  cases they would send in retired FBI agents or cops without warrants on
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:53.440]  people's fields to pick sometimes a hundred plants they would take them back
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:57.360]  and test them for their genetics and if they found any of their genetics less
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:02.240]  than that 1% because again plants don't have one mommy or one daddy the pollen
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:08.000]  blows in and so you know the plant can have hundreds and hundreds of different
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:13.040]  genetics from different corn plants around it contributing to it and you
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:16.080]  can show your seed records that you bought it you bought your seed from
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:19.760]  somebody else it wasn't Monsanto seed you can show you never bought Monsanto
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:23.200]  seed you could show that their seed got into your field
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:26.800]  that they contaminated you that their pollen got into your field
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:31.120]  and the courts that are totally bought off by Monsanto the federal regulators
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:36.800]  the head of the FDA the head lawyer they're all former Monsanto alumni that
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:39.760]  are revolving door four to eight years in government
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:42.960]  four to eight years in Monsanto a few more years back in government
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:46.640]  back in Monsanto and they do this revolving door
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:50.000]  are over and over again and the federal courts you know they'll have
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.240]  the federal judge's wife will work for Monsanto and they won't even be recused
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:57.760]  or the federal judge that rules for them their son will be hired right out of
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:00.080]  harvard at a million dollars a year to work for
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.720]  i mean this is how they operate and they said this would be like if i had a
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:10.320]  plant a smelting plant a gold smelting plant
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:14.720]  and my cyanide ran off the mountaintop that they used to leach out the gold out
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:20.720]  of ore these are real cases by the way and ran into your fields down below
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:25.680]  and the coffee workers picking coffee got sick and died
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:29.040]  and you got sued because your coffee later found had cyanide in it
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:33.520]  and you lose your farm Monsanto if they were the gold company the gold mining
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:37.440]  company they would come and sue you for their cyanide
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:40.480]  coming onto your property and the court would rule that even though
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:47.600]  they contaminated you that you had patent entrenched on their cyanide
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:51.280]  that's like people that go to get a breast test treatment
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:54.800]  that should cost five hundred dollars it cost a hundred thousand dollars
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:58.480]  because the company said well we patented that gene
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:04.480]  for breast cancer but that's your gene doesn't matter in fact they didn't even
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:07.600]  really patent the gene because they can just map it they claim they know it's
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:10.880]  like having a photo of a sabertooth tiger you don't actually have a sabertooth
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:13.120]  tiger and they now admit that they haven't mapped
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:17.600]  anything folks they've taken a photo of it they basically know it's makeup
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:21.440]  they call the other 96 junk it's not junk
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.280]  it is the sabertooth tiger not the photo of the sabertooth tiger it is the blue
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:28.640]  whale not the photo of the blue whale to actually
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:32.000]  truly understand the genetics that's why they can change one genetic of
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.560]  something uh trait and get what they want make a
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:37.760]  tomato last longer but then down the road
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  the it starts mutating and then you get something completely different and
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:45.040]  other things change that's why they don't
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:48.320]  aren't able to control what they're doing it's very very dangerous but this is a
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:53.360]  separate issue of where they contaminate you
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:58.400]  and then it'd be like if your neighbor
[1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:02.000]  had a bunch of depleted uranium in their backyard and then you came down with
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.440]  leukemia and they went and tested your blood and you it was because of du and
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:10.480]  they went oh you stole my du you're like no your du blew
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:15.280]  over the fence and i should sue you no no no
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:20.080]  you owe me and this is the complete overturning of justice ladies and
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:25.120]  gentlemen the high court left intact
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:30.160]  monday a federal appeals court decision that threw out a 2011 lawsuit from the
[1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:32.560]  organic seed growers and trade association
[1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:35.760]  and over and over 80 other plaintiffs against monsanto
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:40.000]  that sought to challenge the arco chemical companies
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:43.440]  agrochemical companies aggressive claims on patents
[1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:47.520]  of genetically modified seeds the suit also aimed to curb monsanto from
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:52.080]  suing anyone who field is contaminated by such
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:56.320]  seeds so this wasn't some ambulance chasing
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:03.440]  operation here by a trade federation to go after monsanto and get something
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:06.960]  this was people banding together to stop monsanto
[1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:10.240]  winning thousands of lawsuits a year in the us alone
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:14.960]  but also in europe and canada where i mean i've covered the cases here
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:18.960]  i'm not kidding they contaminate your field you've got proof that it's
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:22.240]  genetic pollution that it's only one percent or less
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:28.160]  their genetics that their pollen blew over and that they've contaminated you
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:32.960]  there have been cases where a canola farmer had canola growing in the ditch
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:35.920]  of their property a half mile away from their fields
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:40.960]  and that it was monsanto seeds that had gotten into the ditch of their property
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:44.160]  and were growing and that they had all their records and weren't growing
[1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:48.800]  monsanto crops and then the court ruled that they
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:53.520]  had infringed because monsanto seeds had gotten into the ditches
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:58.560]  and farmers believe monsanto is running around planting them in the ditches
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:02.400]  and i believe that too because they've been caught in brazil and poland and
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:05.200]  france and a bunch of other places look it up
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:10.640]  illegally planting what they call invasion plots
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.920]  where they they argue that if they've already infected a region
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:17.040]  so what now in fact that's their argument even in
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:22.400]  an article i saw over a decade ago in what's that publication national
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:25.120]  geographic they had one of the month monsanto executives saying look we're
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:27.600]  soon going to have our genetics and anything anyways but from poland
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:30.720]  you're not going to be able to escape us so just accept it and they said that's
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:34.320]  their goal to basically rewrite all the genetics so there's not even a
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:38.400]  choice so you can't get away from it so that's a major issue
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:42.240]  we've got china continuing to threaten to invade islands of the philippines
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:46.720]  and they've developed a new high-speed missile to defeat us defenses
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:50.080]  we've got a bunch of news with again obama saying
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:53.600]  he's not just waiting for legislation i've got a pen and i can use it to sign
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:57.280]  executive orders this is a dictatorial dictatorship
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:00.960]  doesn't mean he won't leave office but they've made the office a dictatorship
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:04.800]  now that's what the power structure wants so that
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:08.080]  video is coming up and then we're going to get
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:11.040]  into a mark dice video california science petition
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:15.120]  allowing us troops to commandeer their homes
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:18.640]  we're going to be breaking all of that down but when we come back from break
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:24.880]  i've seen this woman's videos josie wales i wonder if that's
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:28.080]  really her name it's cool name of it is or or is it the uh
[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:34.160]  is it a is it a gnome to plume a pen name uh she's going to be joining us uh
[1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:38.080]  josie the outlaw.com's her website she has youtube videos where she
[1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:43.280]  defends the second amendment eloquently and it's this type of action by just

[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:28.640]  and that's how we're going to turn the tide and there was a big headline
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:30.720]  yesterday in the financial times of london
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:33.920]  that libertarians not just in the u.s but worldwide
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:37.680]  are the dominant group and are growing fast we're not liberals we're not
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:42.640]  conservatives we're libertarians we're thomas jefferson constitutionalist
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:47.840]  and we are the future and so i salute her for her great shooting videos and
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:51.120]  what she's breaking down how she challenges the police and she says
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:54.640]  what side are you on will you confiscate guns i mean she's she's really

[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:15.760]  but also realize that being heard and taking action
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.440]  is the key because if more people watching and listening right now do what
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:22.400]  you've done we will win

[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.600]  aware and awake for years i mean ever since i was a little girl
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:46.240]  i first marched on marched on dc when i was about four years old
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:51.360]  um i i did a lot of reading i you know i i went through the catholic
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.600]  schooling and this and that and i had a lot of um
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:59.840]  authoritarian uh you know indoctrination to
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:04.160]  to undo but i did that you know for reading and i've been pretty i've been
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:09.120]  extremely heavily involved uh with the philadelphia activist community for the
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:12.640]  past year i've always had my finger on the pulse of
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:17.920]  you know um i don't want to say politics it's more anti-politics and
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:21.360]  what's going on for i mean for the last 17 years
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:25.440]  um but it's only the last five years that i've really
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:28.160]  you know done a lot of research in the last year that i've been
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:35.360]  heavily involved now um i don't i actually don't consider myself a constitutionalist
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:37.680]  sure you're always talking about the whole liberty movement you consider
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:42.480]  yourself more of an anarchist right uh yeah i mean i i don't think that i i
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:46.400]  don't like to label myself but i i don't you know i mean i'm sure i'm
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:50.720]  saying a small government movement uh is is rising
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:56.080]  right okay um yeah so i i started and i started we started working on the videos
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:01.440]  about oh god five four months ago maybe um and they've been out for about a month

[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:08.320]  because again i know that if we get everyone to become
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:12.080]  activist even in small ways uh it's going to change the world
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.880]  talk about your view of the second amendment where you see the battle for
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:17.920]  liberty right now okay well the second amendment i think
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:23.040]  is a great um it's a great guideline um it's a it's a nice jumping point um
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:28.240]  for people who uh you know the founding fathers had had some
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:32.160]  really great ideas when it came to preserving a liberty and the constitution
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:35.520]  was put um i'd like to believe it was put in place
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:41.760]  to serve as a check against tyranny so um as as far as the second amendment is
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.480]  concerned i although i don't like i said i don't really
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:48.640]  totally um agree with the constitution as it is i don't need you know we don't
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:51.600]  need a piece of paper to tell us what's right and wrong however
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:56.160]  uh i absolutely support the second amendment you know the first one second
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:59.040]  amendment i think it's a great guideline uh and
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:04.880]  i will do anything i can to preserve that for myself and preserve it for and
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:08.320]  help others to understand how important it is for them to preserve it

[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:54.320]  months and having a big effect we appreciate her joining us
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:58.400]  enough about uh my politics or your politics where do you see the world
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:02.080]  going do you agree that there's a global awakening that's pro-liberty
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:05.840]  what do you see the establishment doing and uh what made you decide to start
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:10.480]  going public uh for the right to protect ourselves
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:17.600]  well um i see the world going in in the direction of revolution and it's
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.000]  it's been an absolutely there's been a huge shift in consciousness and it's
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.920]  been towards toward liberty toward individual liberty and you know
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:30.160]  self ownership uh it's definitely right now revolution of
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:33.280]  the mind it's just a matter of getting all of these
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:37.840]  people who are starting to wake up uh to speak out to educate themselves um
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:43.200]  and to be able to uh you know represent these ideas uh
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:47.760]  in a in a way that other people can understand and relate to
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:51.600]  now unfortunately with you know i know that you did you covered
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:55.520]  the kelly thomas story uh these events are
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:59.520]  not few and far between they are every day and they're constant and they're
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:04.400]  growl it's just the the sheer numbers are increasing i don't know if it's
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:07.680]  because of the the documentation and you know
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:13.440]  the internet and social networking but it seems as though these events are
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:18.080]  increasing and unfortunately when the system
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:22.960]  does not no longer supports justice and no longer promotes it and and puts that
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:26.480]  into effect then the people are going to take it in their own hands
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:31.040]  unfortunately um like frogs and boiling water it's it
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.680]  it's going to be to the point where it's you know that water scalding and people
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:38.960]  are going to be angry and they're going to do whatever they can to fight back
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:43.920]  and to get out of this mess that you know we've all let ourselves get into
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:50.080]  uh i'd like it to be um a peaceful revolution and i
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.040]  i myself and i know a lot of people are doing everything
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:57.920]  in our power to make it that way uh unfortunately these events
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:01.520]  strike deep into the heart of people and they
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:06.400]  the elicit rage and anger and just it's it's
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:10.800]  this alone i'm i'm still in shock and you know nothing should surprise me at
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:16.400]  this point but it's such a tragic event and uh i don't
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:19.920]  i'm hoping for it to go well you know i like to hope for the best but prepare
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:24.720]  for the worst basically i tend to agree with you
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:28.640]  but again it is positive news that throughout the bureaucracy throughout
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:32.320]  corporations you name it people get uh that
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:35.200]  things are going in the wrong direction fast i just hope that
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:38.560]  good people like you start standing up and having their voices heard
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:42.160]  so that we can show that we're the majority and even if the system goes
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:46.240]  through with its takeover then the resistance will be that much larger
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:50.240]  and there'll be so many people saying no they can't come after all of us with
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:54.320]  their little reeducation camps and their secret police
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:58.720]  oh absolutely i completely agree and one very important thing that really needs
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:02.720]  to happen is that uh a lot of people who already
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:06.000]  understand um either i'm starting to see all these
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.400]  different types all these different you know
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:14.080]  kinds of liberty movements within the grand liberty movement um and a lot of
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:16.720]  times you know you have the debates and
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:19.520]  there are these different groups who think i want to fight this way and this
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:23.120]  is how i want to stand up to it and this is how i want to stand up to it
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:26.880]  and um you know there was a great line and you know that hunger games maybe
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.680]  that said remember who the enemy is the enemy is not us we're all awake
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:34.960]  we have to get together and strike at the root
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:40.160]  um of this evil tree and for us to do that we kind of have to get together and
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:43.760]  strike at the root together instead of just you know focusing on the
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.840]  hot button issues and you know that the divide and conquer tactic
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:52.080]  is successful is because it works um
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:56.240]  so in order for us to really make a difference all of these
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:00.480]  you know this mass amount of people who finally are awake and understand
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:04.400]  that we need to fight back need to get together and put the differences aside
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:08.720]  and focus on the main issue which in and of itself is the corrupt government
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:12.880]  and not not just in the united states but all over the world
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:16.480]  josie wells is our guest of the website's josie
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:21.200]  theoutlaw.com and again ladies and gentlemen she won't save the world i
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:24.960]  won't save the world you won't save the world but together
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:29.440]  we can really turn things around and save the world from tyranny
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:33.920]  by all of us as individuals promoting liberty it will create an incredible
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:37.600]  diversity of ideas an incredible diversity of debate
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:43.200]  and will absolutely in its cultural beauty and and its depth and breadth
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:47.040]  will you know to use a bad term for something good
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:52.000]  seduce away all of those that are bought into the left right paradigm and big
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:55.840]  government and groups think literally it will show them that
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:59.600]  there's an alternative we will build it they will come and they
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:05.280]  they are coming and we have built it and it is going to continue and my goal
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:10.640]  is to you know really see humanity truly empowered not use our technology not
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:14.160]  use our our intelligence to con each other
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:17.520]  but use our intelligence to empower one another
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.680]  and to really be a fan of humanity not to be a predator
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:25.680]  in the system to where you end up bringing down the whole system
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:31.040]  because the system is based on on fraud kind of re-encapsulate that video that
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:36.080]  we linked to on info wars.com a month or so ago I forget the exact title we can
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.600]  pull up your youtube page where you had a message for police you had a question
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:44.160]  for police and you really spelled it out there
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:47.760]  very simply but but very well said to really
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:51.440]  put the gauntlet down because police are going to be where the rubber meets the
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:55.520]  road that's where the tyrannical state is going to express their power through
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:00.080]  and that's why it's so important to target police with the truth
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:04.480]  because they're being targeted with brainwashing and globalist disinfo
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:09.200]  exactly uh well see the the reason we did that video was because I've always
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:13.520]  that's been a very serious issue with me for some time
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:16.880]  and you know I started out with the the rage and just
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:20.480]  you know screaming at them at events and and kind of just
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:23.920]  angry at them and then I started progressing
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:27.360]  and learned and I started going one on one and really doing
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:31.040]  an examination of conscience with each and every police officer
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:35.440]  and I was met with you know the entire spectrum of reactions that you can get
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:39.120]  you know I got hate I got ridicule I got um
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:44.240]  anger silence you know it's all throughout the spectrum but
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:48.800]  over and over again I found they were all extremely uncomfortable
[1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:54.240]  and time after time I found um that entire groups you know of federal agents
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:58.880]  would retreat and walk away um when you know when I would scream
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:02.960]  with them and get angry and uh try to shame them
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:07.040]  very very vocally they would only aggress and it would it would it almost
[1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:10.800]  you know fueled them and made them angrier so
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:14.160]  what we decided to do is come up with a video that basically went through an
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:19.840]  examination of conscience um and said is you know draw your line at
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:23.280]  what point are you going to harm a human being at what point will you realize
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:27.840]  that just following orders isn't an excuse to abandon your morals
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:32.000]  um remember that you were born with a conscience and
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.520]  why were you born with a conscience if you're supposed to ignore it and just
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:38.960]  blindly obey whatever an authority tells you to without
[1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:41.600]  questioning it.
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:46.240]  In closing uh for take a couple minutes to talk about whatever
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:50.000]  subject you want I always like to throw in that wildcard uh Josie Wells
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  uh and give me your take on just the state of the world
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:58.720]  and any other points that you'd like to get out to a couple million people.
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:05.040]  Well what's really important that we I released a video today about schooling
[1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:09.760]  and I think that is extremely important because I get I get a great response
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:14.080]  from you know people and you know in their 20s and up to um
[1:45:14.080 --> 1:45:17.600]  you know up to you know middle aged and and over
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:21.440]  um I think it's very important especially in this day and age where
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:24.960]  children are being raised by the internet and indoctrination camps that
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:31.280]  are called schools that um they're um targeted in a way
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:35.600]  that they're given an option uh to either be home
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:39.280]  schooled or unschooled and so this next video basically
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:44.800]  highlights um it parallels the all of the similarities between
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:47.920]  schooling in prison and explains why schooling
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:52.000]  may not be the best for your children uh you know
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  parents send their kids to school with the best intentions wanting
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:59.200]  the best future for them not understanding that that what's
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:02.720]  happening now is that these children are being just
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:09.360]  trained at such a young vulnerable age to be blind obedient subjects so I
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:13.760]  think it's it's very important to focus on the younger generation because they're
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:16.560]  the future they're the ones who in the next you know
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:22.000]  five 10 20 years we're going to be depending on and I don't plan on stopping
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:26.400]  anytime soon but this it's extremely important
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:30.160]  and um I think that right now is my main focus you know we have
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:33.520]  I have tons of videos in the works and all of those things but right now that's
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:36.320]  the most important it's it's really important to get to the younger
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:38.880]  generation
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:43.600]  so very well said um what do you think about
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:48.400]  enclosing uh Hillary Clinton being considered for defense secretary
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:52.240]  or mayor bloomberg these are people that have criminally
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:55.440]  tried to destroy the right to keep their arms these are people who are open
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:46:59.280]  enemies of this country I mean I think that illustrates how close we are
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:03.520]  to a full takeover absolutely it makes perfect sense if you understand how
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:07.200]  corrupt the government is they're perfect for the job that their bosses
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:13.040]  you know would want them to do so I think I think it's horrendous and horrible
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:18.240]  and everything should be that we can do should be done to stop it
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:22.640]  but I do I think that if if they're if they're looking for just another
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.720]  tyrant then they found them they could either one of them would
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:31.360]  would work we just kind of have to stand up and
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:34.560]  not listen to them and and look them right in the face
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:38.320]  and say no you're wrong I won't obey and I'm not going to listen to what you
[1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:41.120]  say and we have to kind of get together and
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:46.240]  and work against that all right well I look forward to you
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:50.640]  popping back in and we once we launch the new tv studio and get some of the
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:53.520]  new crew in place we're going to start looking to
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:57.120]  have correspondence in different regions of the country
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:59.840]  and we have Dan Badani on the east coast and a few others what we'd like to talk
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:03.040]  to you down the road and so if I forget get back in contact with us Josie

[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:15.760]  and file maybe a report every week and work with us part time coming up

[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:22.240]  and certainly if we get you some better equipment and stuff

[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:32.960]  microphone or even a high quality camera it looks like it's okay
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:36.000]  but the quality of your information and your spirit
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.520]  is shining through so to you and whoever's helping you

[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:24.880]  tuesday edition i have been ranting and raving quite a
[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:29.040]  bit coming up the next hour i'm gonna look at police
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:33.760]  militarization and why it's causing so many tragic deaths of citizens
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:37.920]  all numbers of police dying is weighed down but if you talk to the average cop
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:40.240]  they think the numbers of their deaths are way up they're
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:43.280]  they're absolutely being trained on average at the public
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:48.880]  is the enemy israeli defense minister says john kerry should take nobel prize
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:53.280]  and leave us be uh and uh says that they're concerned
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:56.480]  about iran getting nuclear weapons you know i'm going to be honest with you
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:55:59.600]  folks iran already has nuclear weapons Saudi Arabia already has them
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:02.400]  you notice that's been coming out now about Saudi Arabia i have high level
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:06.080]  sources uh and uh this is all about not letting
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:09.360]  them have power not letting them have nuclear power because they
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:13.840]  don't want the country to be dependent uh on its own energy they want it to be
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:17.840]  dependent on outside energy even though they have a lot of oil
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:22.000]  iran cannot refine its oil it's very hard to do that
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.760]  and so they import most of their refined gasoline now i'm not a fan of nuclear
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:30.000]  power either let's get that clear because these companies don't ever manage it
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:35.760]  correctly and you have a lot of problems but their nuclear program is peaceful
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:40.480]  but it's because they don't need to have a weaponized program
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:44.080]  because they have atomic weapons they've gotten from pakistan
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.840]  and russia and of course now you see news reports the word is they've gotten it
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:51.680]  from pakistan and russia and Saudi arabia brags okay we've got nukes too
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:55.600]  from the same place and then israel's giving them nukes i mean it's on folks
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:57:01.760]  the nukes are all over the place and uh the reason the pentagon doesn't want
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:04.560]  to attack iran i'm not defending obama by the way
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:09.120]  he wants to act like he's a a peacenik while they're activating al-qaeda forces
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:11.680]  and iran and other places to try to overthrow the government they've had
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:15.760]  sanctions you name it they're only going this quote peace
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:19.760]  route because iran did give in on a bunch of the sanctions
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:23.440]  and it's not that any side is good in this it's it's all bad it all runs from
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:26.320]  bad to worse it's a very sophisticated situation
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:31.440]  israel wants to beat war drums with iran because
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:37.440]  of the fact that that is a political domestic distraction
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:42.000]  uh for the lakudniks that run the country
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.440]  but again they're spinning this is more treason from obama
[1:57:45.440 --> 1:57:48.640]  when i guarantee you folks they're going to end up double crossing iran down the
[1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:51.760]  road uh if they can get the pentagon to go along
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:57.120]  with an attack but look the pentagon is not shrink away from a war
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:00.400]  and they're not trying to not have a war because it's some more
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:05.440]  morality issue it's an issue of they've war gamed it
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:10.960]  russia china india getting into it uh israel getting into it it's just a very
[1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:13.840]  high probability it's going to create a huge regional war
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:18.240]  and then a nuclear war and you don't want that and you got china talking about
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:21.840]  knowing into these islands that they claim are theirs off the coast of the philippines
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:26.560]  i mean this is getting crazy right now so that's what's happening on that front
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:31.600]  uh we've got the obama dictator clip that i still haven't played yet
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:34.400]  he's got a new statement about hell healers do whatever he wants outside of
[1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:41.280]  law that's coming up stay with us
[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:50.400]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:54.480]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world

[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:46.000]  against its net neutrality ruled that is a big deal the federal communications
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:49.600]  commission may appeal the ruling by the us appeals court
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:53.040]  that struck down the agency's so-called net neutrality rules according to fcc
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:56.880]  chairman tom wheeler i'm committed to managing our networks as engines of
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:00.480]  economic growth testbeds for innovative services and
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:02.720]  products and channels for all forms of speech

[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:08.960]  including for these appeals to ensure that these networks on which the
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:12.160]  internet depends continue to provide free and open platform for
[2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:15.680]  innovation expression and operate in the interest of all americans
[2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:20.000]  and folks uh normally i don't agree with the fcc
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.680]  but the fcc has been saying look you can't have
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:28.160]  telecoms that already make money hand over fist off their subscriber base
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:31.840]  and off their bandwidth base claiming that they're going to charge you more
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:35.360]  for access to certain groups websites that isn't their
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:38.240]  content i mean that'll totally kill the internet as we
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:42.240]  know it uh and there is a major move to do
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:44.720]  this and this is basically what internet two is
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:47.920]  they're talking about uh
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:54.320]  service providers charging google when their customers try to go to google
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:58.800]  and i'm no fan of google but you've got to use the separation of powers
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:01.760]  these different big globalist blocks against each other
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:05.120]  so that's why you have the legislative executive uh and judicial
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:08.640]  knowing that tyranny will try to take over all three so you have it divided up
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:12.320]  to where it can never get organized and they knew common sense would show that
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:15.440]  there'd be in fighting and so they could never organize evil
[2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:19.440]  the same way they use balkanization on us so we can't ever organize to get rid
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:22.400]  of the new world order they can't ever get properly
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:25.200]  organized because they're all fighting over stuff so
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:29.440]  it's the best of times worst of times it's our doom it's our salvation
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:32.720]  that we have separation of powers that's why when you hear oh we need to get rid
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:36.560]  of gridlock in congress and obama needs to just have executive orders and
[2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:39.600]  we're gonna play that clip here in a moment and do whatever he wants and he'll
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:42.720]  fix everything if we just give him all the power
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:49.280]  this is a big deal so let's go ahead and uh go to this clip of obama
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:54.160]  saying congress i don't need no stinking congress here it is
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:57.040]  we are not just going to be waiting for legislation
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:01.120]  in order to make sure uh that we're providing americans
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:06.160]  the kind of health that they need uh i've got a pen and i've got a fault
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:09.840]  and i can use that pen to sign executive orders
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:12.960]  and take executive actions and make creative actions that
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:16.800]  move the ball forward in helping to make sure our kids are getting the best
[2:03:16.800 --> 2:03:20.720]  education possible making sure that our businesses are getting the kind of
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:25.760]  support and help they need to grow in advance to make sure that
[2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:28.640]  people are getting the skills that they need to get those jobs that our
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:34.240]  businesses are creating and i've got a phone that allows me to convene
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:37.600]  americans from every walk of life nonprofits
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:45.040]  businesses sector university to try to bring more and more americans
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:48.720]  together around what i think is a unifying thing making sure that
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:52.720]  this is a country where if you work hard you can make it
[2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:57.360]  and so one of the things that i'm going to be talking to my cabinet about is
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:00.960]  how do we use all the tools available to us not just
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:08.240]  legislation in order to advance a mission that i think unifies all americans
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:12.080]  the belief that everybody's got to take responsibility everybody's got to work
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:16.880]  hard but if you do that you can support a family
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:23.280]  and meet the kinds of obligations that you have
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:26.960]  to yourself and your family but also to your communities and to your name
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:29.680]  all right i'm going to play this clip again when we come back it's so important
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:32.000]  i meant to get it in the first hour always wait towards the end to get to
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.960]  all the important stuff when we come back i'm going to play it again and just
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:38.400]  stop and start the whole thing because that's so important there not not just
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:42.000]  saying i'll do whatever i want because it's my job and everybody loves it
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.880]  that's all a lie and criminal but the fact that he only talks about americana
[2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:50.320]  when it's like you know we have shared responsibility to raise the debt ceiling
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:54.640]  and by the way it doesn't raise the debt and and you know this is what america's
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:05:00.480]  about it's just total fraud it's incredible
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:05.040]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:08.320]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice
[2:05:08.320 --> 2:05:13.200]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:17.120]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:21.440]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:27.040]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:32.480]  record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:36.160]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important
[2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:42.000]  unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine was the answer for myself and

[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:08.560]  going to be jam packed with news and information i want to talk about obama
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:12.880]  the dictator coming up towards the end of the hour
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:16.160]  and i'm going to play that clip again and analyze it where he says it's
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:20.800]  americans responsibility uh to basically go along
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:24.240]  with this whole system and to pay their fair share
[2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:27.760]  so the american dream is having a bunch of crooks run your life
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:32.080]  and to have him by executive action circumventing congress
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:37.200]  and uh he'll talk about the american dream and how anybody can make it working
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:41.440]  hard if you just go along with him while he does everything he can to shut down
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:45.040]  the economy everything they can to consolidate the economy in globalist
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:48.720]  hands everything they can to create a total crony
[2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:52.720]  monopoly rigged economy that's the bottom line
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:57.440]  that's what's going on here and it's a big deal that we're converting
[2:09:57.440 --> 2:10:03.120]  over uh to all of this right now there's also some powerful reports that we're
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:08.560]  going to be posting in the next hour up on info wars dot com that we're
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:11.680]  there in the brakes writing the descriptions for and getting up on the
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:15.760]  site uh that are very important where they found
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:19.680]  seven times the radiation level on the on another california beach
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:23.440]  uh versus when they went to a nuclear reactor that's active
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:27.280]  so the beach is seven times more radioactive than a reactor
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:30.400]  we've got some other fukushima news scientists to monitor california kelp
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:34.160]  forest for fukushima radiation fish are found to have 20 plus times
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:38.160]  safe radiation levels off the coast of japan that's some of the breaking news
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:41.600]  up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:45.360]  right now also steve watson has another
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:49.360]  article growing record growth for privacy search engines
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:54.320]  in wake of nsa revelations and that's the answer to big brother
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:11:00.240]  is to vote with your dollars and to use and support
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:04.480]  products and organizations and media that promote liberty and that doesn't mean
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:07.360]  any of these groups are perfect doesn't mean i'm perfect it means that if people
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:09.760]  have their heart in the right place they're trying to do a good job
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:12.240]  they're trying to be honest they're trying to give you good products good
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:17.040]  information that's who you support when you've got premeditated
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:21.200]  larcenous globalists that are manipulating the situation
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:24.080]  you've got to stand against them and really realize that they're out to get
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:28.160]  you and you've got to take it very very personal
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:32.800]  now i want to get into a really painful subject uh right now
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:37.600]  and and and just illustrate how sick it is and illustrate the humanity
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:40.720]  of the young man that was killed he wasn't a criminal
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:45.200]  he was the son of a police officer who was schizophrenic
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:49.280]  and he was homeless and the police come over and start talking about how they're
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:54.480]  going to beat him uh and and so he tries to get away
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:59.360]  uh and then over 20 minutes they beat him to death took him four days to die
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:03.520]  and a jury was told that he could have died of a heart attack
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:08.400]  uh and so they ruled that well the cops get off because they didn't kill him
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:11.680]  and that's like saying jfk wasn't killed by a bullet he was killed by a heart
[2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:14.720]  attack that's like saying a a nat that flies into your
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:17.360]  windshield when you're going 100 miles an hour
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:23.600]  that's like saying that uh the the nat died of a bacterial
[2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:26.640]  infection or a heart attack
[2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:30.240]  now there are a lot of people that are being killed by the police not just here
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.000]  but another authoritarian regimes all over the world
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.440]  uh by police that resemble hardcore criminals
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:40.720]  just from what i've seen being around really serious ex-cons and
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:43.520]  thug types i mean that's what cops more and more look like
[2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:47.040]  in big city is is just really disgusting thugs
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:52.000]  uh who've got serious problems and and and uh the da is freaking out about this
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.560]  everybody's freaking out about this because it's all on video
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:57.040]  the slow methodical killing of this guy
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:01.040]  who's begging and can't breathe and that's a game police play now
[2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:04.880]  where they jump on you knowing you can't breathe break your neck you name it
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:08.000]  uh and then if you beg please get off me i can't breathe
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:14.480]  they just sit on you until you die or until uh you pass out and then after he
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:20.080]  passed out they kept sitting on him till until he uh went into a coma
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:23.520]  and you know i see articles every couple days
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:26.800]  where an autistic kid 10 11 12 years old
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:30.480]  i'll be walking down the street and the cops pull up and say
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:35.200]  give me your id and they can't talk and and i've seen the you know the photos
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:38.880]  of these kids and videos these kids some of them squawk reviews it's clear
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:44.080]  that they're completely disabled i've seen a video where they tell a guy who's
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:48.240]  a quadriplegic get out of your wheelchair and he says i'm sorry sir i'm
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:53.120]  paralyzed from the chest down but if you take me over to that counter
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:58.240]  i can lift up with my arms and they throw him out onto the ground i think
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:00.800]  there's a bunch of those videos is one where they start kicking him and the
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:03.440]  guy broke like 15 bones when he hit the ground because their bones are like
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:06.160]  jello and they didn't get in trouble for that i mean
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:10.400]  we live in a country folks where they throw people out of wheelchairs
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:16.160]  that have calves that are like a you know uh two inches around
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:20.000]  you know in fact i have a friend who was a home depot manager
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:23.440]  it was paralyzed from the chest down and it was a big court case and later the
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:26.720]  squad car video came out the guy's like a commander at austin big
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:29.920]  giant you know guy and uh he pulls him over he
[2:14:29.920 --> 2:14:32.480]  wants to search his car he said i think you threw a cigarette out
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:35.920]  and he says what are these on your on your steering wheel
[2:14:35.920 --> 2:14:39.280]  he said those are my hand controls i'm paralyzed and he said to him and his
[2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:42.640]  wife get out and he said okay my wife's gotta get the wheelchair out of the
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:45.760]  back give it to me no you're gonna do it
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:52.640]  and he said um well i don't have crutches i have the wheelchair
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:57.440]  and he drug a guy out that's paralyzed from the middle of the chest
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:01.040]  out and beat him up and the internal affairs found it was good because he
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:06.640]  didn't follow police officers order that's like telling
[2:15:06.640 --> 2:15:11.440]  well a paralyzed person to get up and walk and it's a total narcissistic
[2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:13.920]  mental illness where people under stockham syndrome
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:16.800]  project their love of corrupt police onto them
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.880]  and then it's like a prostitute to a pimp she doesn't really scared of them
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:25.120]  she loves him because she is scared of them at a subconscious level
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:28.000]  and the fact that
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:33.200]  yeah there it is grand jury acquits a hueso police officer who killed unarmed
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:37.520]  disabled mentally ill houston man i mean i see it all the time
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:41.360]  and that's what's really scary is that
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:46.000]  is that you come up to an 11 year old naked
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:49.600]  autistic girl who's gone out of the house at night and is
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:52.800]  walking down the highway and so when they were done with her
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:56.720]  they'd broken a whole bunch of bones knocked her teeth out
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:15:59.680]  because you know she's flopping around going
[2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:04.800]  mommy mommy they always beg for mommy and these guys are doing what i say
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:09.280]  i mean just and and every fiber of me as a man
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:12.240]  but i've seen countless of these videos we could play them every day we wanted to
[2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:16.080]  but it's not even my goal to demonize the police this stuff hurts me so much i
[2:16:16.080 --> 2:16:19.280]  can't even look at it they always beg for mommy and daddy
[2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:22.080]  of course troops do that too a lot i don't care how tough you are when your
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:24.080]  guts are blown out all over the ground and you're
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:26.800]  excruciating pain you know you'll call out for who you love
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:31.040]  you'll say mom dad it'll call it for your brother your sister
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:33.680]  and the thing is when these people call it for mom and dad you see the cops
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:38.160]  getting off on it in like a sexual way they're getting off on the torture
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:44.240]  uh on on on being sadist and
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:48.640]  this is what it's like to live in north korea i've seen the north korean police
[2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:51.120]  the way they act when they're grabbing people and doing stuff i've seen the
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:54.960]  chinese communist police the way they look i've seen film reels of nazi police
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:59.920]  the way they look it's the same thing these are dangerous bad people
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:06.000]  and america has a sycophantic love of this separately the public gets society's
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.720]  breaking down so they want to believe in the police and believe there's a lot of
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:11.840]  good ones than there are and so you need the police a lot of times and the
[2:17:11.840 --> 2:17:15.360]  police do deal with a lot of bad people and that's probably part of why a lot
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:18.960]  of them become so bad but you've got to be really screwed up
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:27.120]  when you come up to a 240 pound down syndrome guy this happens all the time
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:29.840]  and you say i'm going to search your bag and the guy i've seen some of these
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:33.520]  squad car videos the guy looks like a total child like a three-year-old going
[2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:42.800]  no no and the cops sold taserum the the the mentally retarded guy'll charge him
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:45.840]  and instead of letting you know the mentally retarded guy
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:50.160]  run down the road for mommy whatever uh you follow him home to where they live
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:54.480]  you they kill him i mean you're looking at a guy with down syndrome i see this
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:58.400]  every week in the news you look at a giant fat down syndrome person not put
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:00.480]  them down they're fat just they always seem to be fat
[2:18:00.480 --> 2:18:03.520]  of the guy we're looking at right now and screens you know fat and they just
[2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:05.680]  kill him i mean that was a cop and there was some
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:10.640]  down syndrome guy going no no no you know i mean i'm not going to kill him
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:15.040]  i'm not going to even taserum the things they never even have a weapon
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:21.840]  they just they just they just kill him and it's this military idea
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:25.520]  that if you don't do exactly what i say like a checkpoint in fallujah
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:28.880]  i'm going to kill you because you're the enemy
[2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:31.680]  and i've got articles here where sheriffs deputies
[2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:35.680]  says protesters should be exterminated in gas chambers
[2:18:35.680 --> 2:18:39.920]  and that anyone that criticizes the police as an enemy
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:46.320]  really i'm an enemy this guy was a cops kid that's the only reason
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:49.440]  that was even an indictment
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:56.080]  that's the only reason and i don't know if his dad was a good cop or a bad cop
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:18:59.360]  but he said stuff like i'm ashamed that i was ever a cop and you know it's a
[2:18:59.360 --> 2:19:03.200]  really bad system and it's really corrupt yeah how do you like that cop
[2:19:03.200 --> 2:19:06.560]  did you speak out enough against bad stuff did the chickens come home to
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:08.880]  roost i'm sorry your son's dad you're probably

[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:28.720]  you pull up on a down syndrome man
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:33.200]  who is so mentally retarded you don't they don't even know where they are
[2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:37.280]  and so uh you start trying to put handcuffs on them
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:42.560]  and they pull their hand away and so you shoot them
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:45.760]  i mean i know this police didn't act like this in the past and people wouldn't
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:49.280]  put up with this in the past okay
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:54.480]  it's absolutely outrageous and and again i'm not here
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:58.080]  trying to demonize the police we need the police to wake up
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:01.520]  and be on our side because the globalists are running the country
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:04.640]  but they've gotten the police in this mentally ill position
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:07.760]  where they think they're completely above the law and that everything they do
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:11.120]  is okay because they're the moral authority no you're not your bosses know
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:13.360]  about the narcotics trafficking the big banks all
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:16.560]  wanted the money on record that's mainstream news they run the major drug
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:19.440]  cartels 90 plus percent of the drugs and drug
[2:25:19.440 --> 2:25:23.120]  money is run by the big six banks
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:27.360]  and you are run by criminals and they're trying to get you to convert
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:30.640]  purely to a criminal operation look at some of these articles then i'm going to
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:35.280]  get to the video in the audio of kelly thomas's slow execution
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:38.480]  kelly thomas verdict cops now have licensed to murder
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:41.760]  the acquittal of two fullerton california police officers and the
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:44.960]  beating death of kelly thomas a homeless man who was pummeled
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:49.040]  into a coma as he begged for his life well he begged for daddy
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:54.320]  underscores the fact that cops now have a license to murder
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:58.000]  thomas a mentally disabled homeless man was beaten tasered suffocated and
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:02.160]  pistol whipped as he lay on the street corner this huge pool of blood you can
[2:26:02.160 --> 2:26:05.600]  look at in the article being shot on by no less than six police
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:10.000]  officers either like 12 of them there during the incident july 2011
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:13.280]  and what is undoubtedly one of not the most disturbing police brutality videos
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:16.160]  ever thomas can be heard pleading for his father
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:21.600]  moaning daddy daddy they are killing me as officers prolong the assault
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:25.520]  according to the jury in the case we found officer manuel ramos
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:30.160]  and officer jay cincinelli not guilty of all charges of murder
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:34.080]  and manslaughter thomas just coincidentally chose to die
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:38.720]  of an undiagnosed heart condition in the hospital five days after the beating
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:43.600]  having never regained consciousness police claimed that the brutal pummeling
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:47.120]  they inflicted on thomas illustrated by shocking photos of his
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:51.120]  bloodied swollen body was justified response to his pathetic
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:56.480]  attempts to resist being murdered yeah and i've had cops on top of me
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:27:00.240]  before when they want to do that for fun and you know i'm able to
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:03.360]  zen out when somebody's sitting on my back and my legs and
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:07.520]  shoving my head in the ground and and and then thank god after a minute they
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:10.880]  stop and then are you on a power trip all staring at you a bunch of cowards
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:14.000]  and you're down and they get to be tough because they were bullies in school and
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.360]  but now men stood up to them and kicked their butt so they went became cops
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:20.240]  i mean i guarantee you could get thugs like this you could take 10 of them i'd
[2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:23.520]  stomp every one of them into the ground and i'm not bragging folks but should
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:27.040]  thugs start a fight with me the more the merrier that's the only time i got zilla
[2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:31.120]  even wakes up and i'm telling you these people are cowards
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:36.720]  these people are completely absolutely cowards and i know their type i know
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:39.840]  their punk type i could beat the daylights out of 10 of those
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:44.400]  any day of the week that i challenge both of them to come to austin
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:48.800]  in the ring with me bare knuckles or we'll go to vegas or wherever it's legal
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:52.960]  right now i check i challenge for charity for children's charity i challenge
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:57.120]  both of them at the same time to a bare knuckles match
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:00.640]  but they won't do it because they know what i do in that ring
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:03.760]  savagely explode take them both down in seconds
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:08.000]  the point is is that people like that make me want to throw up
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:11.200]  because they're the enemy of this country and the enemy of humanity
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:14.560]  and i'm sick of it and i'm tired of people like that
[2:28:14.560 --> 2:28:18.480]  having their way with little weak people pinned down on the ground
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:21.840]  squeezing their life out of them
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:26.560]  and i'm sick of it i hate north korean police when i see them on television
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:29.680]  and chinese communist police and the old russian
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:33.200]  nkvd seeing photos of them they make me want to throw up
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:36.480]  a bunch of cowards
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:39.040]  anyways i'm sorry i'm not trying to sit here and act tough and stuff i start
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:42.000]  flipping out when i think about this stuff the point is
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  is that i'm serious i don't want to give them an open invitation
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:49.680]  if they think they're so tough we'll go to vegas i've got the connections
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:53.760]  if my connections the ufc will put it on i'll get in the ring with both of them
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:57.840]  and i'm not even a boxer i want in the ring with both of them bare knuckles
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:01.920]  in los vegas come on cowards both of you let's go in the ring
[2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:06.400]  right now right now cowards but you won't do that will you
[2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:10.960]  no no no no no you're justified in the hospital and all of it went along with
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:15.280]  you it's unbelievable how these people operate
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:21.600]  and what they're up to and what they do it is absolutely disgusting
[2:29:21.600 --> 2:29:24.000]  all right i'm going to settle down and come back and get into the other news
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.480]  that ties into this and play the audio in the video

[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:42.000]  Jones
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:51.400]  Back live, ladies and gentlemen, the great threat to our families, our Providence, our
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:55.320]  well-being, our wealth, our fortune is tyranny.
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:34:01.720]  We've seen it thousands of times throughout history, and it is rising its ugly head yet
[2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:03.320]  again, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:34:03.320 --> 2:34:06.840]  Now, I've only aired this audio once or twice before.
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:11.680]  The guys are always wanting to air it to illustrate, but it makes me so upset to hear it and watch
[2:34:11.680 --> 2:34:18.480]  it, to watch cowards killing an innocent person and using a bunch of legalese to do it that
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:25.440]  I don't like to play it because I empathize with the weak and the oppressed because that's
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:27.200]  just my instincts.
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:33.800]  And I absolutely go wild in my mind thinking about bullies and thugs and cowards and not
[2:34:33.800 --> 2:34:34.800]  just bad police.
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:41.120]  I don't like, I won't go downtown because if a group of gang members is walking around
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:44.360]  and says something to me or as a group acts like thugs, and I've been with friends before,
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:49.840]  they've seen this, it's not good because it's like a fight or flight situation, I immediately
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:52.160]  want to start attacking people.
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:57.160]  And that's a normal instinct in men to defend their families against bad guys.
[2:34:57.160 --> 2:35:01.800]  You're not supposed to have that killer instinct on good people or on people that aren't actually
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:09.360]  a threat, but they hire thugs that have the instinct, but it's twisted and it's cowardly.
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:15.080]  Like these guys run when they're outnumbered, they don't charge when they're outnumbered.
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:20.480]  See a man wants to charge when they're outnumbered and then when they're not outnumbered, they
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:25.400]  retreat because the instinct is, well, if I'm outnumbered, I'm cornered.
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:27.800]  That's when you can really be a man.
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:30.560]  That's why old women can pick up cars off kids.
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:35.440]  That's a drug right there because your brain says this is good, you're fighting five bad
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:40.000]  guys, they've got your cornered, let them have it.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:44.760]  But the few times I was in a fight and wasn't completely in the right, I got my butt kicked
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:47.200]  because my body didn't even respond.
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:50.320]  I had no strength.
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:55.440]  And then the person that after they gave me a few good licks and I couldn't get mad and
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:01.800]  couldn't even get going, they're like, all right, now you had enough because they had
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:02.800]  the moral high ground.
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:06.560]  There's only a few times in my life that I look back and I didn't have the total moral
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:11.200]  high ground and I was just a run of the mill guy.
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:14.680]  But the times in my life growing up in Dallas where one guy starts a fight, you beat them
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:19.280]  and their buddies jump in and then it's just you black out and it's like you're like, you're
[2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:22.040]  like a whistle noise and it's on, man.
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:28.560]  And the whole point is that you watch cops just enjoying themselves sitting on this guy
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:34.320]  and bashing his head in the ground and hitting him with their guns and hitting him with flash
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:39.120]  lights and just beating his head completely in and then still sitting on him after he's
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:43.760]  brain dead and then being proud of themselves and strutting around around his body.
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:45.960]  You got to watch the whole 21 minutes.
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:52.280]  It's such an act of intense cowardice that it makes you ashamed to be a human and ashamed
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:53.760]  to be a man.
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:56.120]  And if I was the average cop out there, I would be extremely ashamed.
[2:36:56.120 --> 2:36:59.760]  I said, I'd open the phones up for police out there, but you know, police are afraid
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:02.440]  somebody will hear him calling on the show and there's a lot of good police out there.
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:09.000]  But I'd like to hear from former police, current police or even active duty soldiers.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:13.480]  When you watch video like this and then you watch the ensuing cover up, does it make you
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:14.480]  feel good?
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:21.320]  And when you look at the way these cops look, I didn't see one Dallas cop that looked like
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:24.520]  a criminal and I'm sure there were some that aren't good when I was up there.
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:27.400]  And then I saw the sheriff's deputies that were special hired goons.
[2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:30.240]  They all look like this, but bigger.
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:33.640]  And they have that look of they've got something to prove.
[2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:34.720]  They're not really men.
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:36.640]  They're not really tough.
[2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:37.640]  They're wimps.
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:40.360]  There's nothing worse than a wimp trying to be a man.
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:46.480]  I'm telling you right now, there's nothing worse than that and I'm sick of it.
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:50.680]  And I'm calling them out at the base level of this sick cult that the police have become
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:53.640]  just like every other third world country of how they're above the law and they're great.
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:57.360]  I'd like to hear from police and military out there, 800-259-9231.
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:05.720]  We're going to go right to your calls after I play this, but 800-259-9231.
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:08.360]  Future cop says he's about to be a sheriff's deputy.
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:13.280]  Protesters should be exterminated in gas chambers and then anyone that videotapes police should
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:14.280]  be basically killed.
[2:38:14.280 --> 2:38:15.680]  I mean, just amazing.
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:20.640]  Man shot dead at movies after texting by retired Tampa cop.
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:26.400]  We've got another article here where the cop didn't like what's happened, so put a gun
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:28.440]  to a kid's throat in McDonald's.
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:32.960]  And you see these videos all the time where a couple pull their gun out, there's a waitress
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:35.480]  doesn't give them quick enough service.
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:37.040]  And then they'll defend them.
[2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:44.000]  It's like the cops that came in in Phoenix or was it Tucson and just for fun, pull the
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  gun on the clerk.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.760]  Now in that case, the police fired him and criminally charged him.
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:50.560]  That's what you're supposed to do, folks.
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:52.120]  You've got some lunatic.
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:53.120]  You don't protect them.
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:58.000]  You throw the book at them because it's going to bring down the whole system.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  I mean, I'm here to tell you.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:03.280]  The example about police are above the law in many jurisdictions is just an example of
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:04.280]  what's going on at the top.
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:07.640]  So 800-259-9231.
[2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:13.800]  Let's go ahead now and go to a condensed four minutes of police officer's son.
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:14.800]  Remember that cop?
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:17.400]  This is going to happen to your kids.
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:22.280]  I heard the awesome police chief a few months ago in 590 AM, Shay, even if it orders unlawful,
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:24.280]  do what you're told and you won't get hurt.
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:28.680]  One of the cop shows up and says, come on my lawn or tells, they had cops pull women
[2:39:28.680 --> 2:39:30.400]  over at the topless bars and say, service me.
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:33.000]  I mean, you got to follow every, no, I'm not going to follow every order.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:39.120]  The law and common law says that's tyranny and I have a right to defend myself.
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:42.640]  Now let's go ahead and go to this incredible audio and then I'm going to, and then we'll
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:50.720]  go to these police officers and people that are calling in, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:59.200]  And then we're going to go into some of the other special reports we have, into some overdrive
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:01.800]  if we have time to do it today.
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:05.720]  But again, I'm holding back playing this.
[2:40:05.720 --> 2:40:09.600]  Here is it from the beginning of the event.
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:34.280]  Here it is, you've got the cop with a billy club, good pause, good pause.
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:36.920]  So they, and again, we've added to the tape, you can see the full tape, it's been seen
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:37.920]  by everybody.
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:40.920]  He says, harass him, get his info for a while, start putting his hands on him.
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:44.360]  The guy's the normal response, pulling his hand away, saying, I'm sick of playing games.
[2:40:44.360 --> 2:40:48.560]  Well, the cop then grabs around the neck and says, I'm going to hurt you really bad.
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:50.400]  Let's go back to the audio and video.
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:56.640]  All right, let's get on the ground, get on the ground, get on the ground, good pause.
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:40:57.640]  Get on the ground.
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:02.600]  The guy puts his hands up like, settle down, but it's not normal when a predator comes
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:04.960]  up and says, get on the ground, but he starts getting ready to go on the ground.
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  The cop doesn't want that.
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:06.960]  He wants to have some fun.
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:09.320]  He gets him with a billy club across the thighs.
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:10.320]  Now the guy runs.
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:14.960]  There's not a mammal on earth, you either fight or you run and people are going to start
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:15.960]  fighting back.
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:18.240]  See, they want a civil war, folks.
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:22.240]  People keep trying to run because they don't want to die like that woman in DC.
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:23.240]  Let's go back to it.
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:37.520]  They tackle him before the video got released, they lied about what happened.
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:49.640]  He says, okay, I'm sorry, Lordship, I'm sorry you hit me for no reason, I'm sorry you're
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:51.640]  on a power trip.
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:42:08.680]  Now they're breaking his arm, now they're sitting on him, putting their weight on him.
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:10.560]  He's panicking in the pain.
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:21.040]  They do the pain to make you resist.
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:24.680]  Let's relax and let us kill you.
[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:32.440]  This guy jumps on top, yeah, get a kick in, these cops are all going to die of incredibly
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:33.440]  painful cancer.
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:42.680]  Their kids are going to die, everything, Todd's going to cut you all down, goes on and on.
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:44.520]  This is edited down for 21 minutes.
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:50.520]  This isn't really edited at first, this is when they finally get him to be knocked out.
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:43:07.000]  They're tazering him right now, and they call that resistance, involuntarily flopping.
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:20.200]  Tazering some more, being in the head of the flashlight, rolling her stomach while we're
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:21.200]  tazering him.
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:30.720]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:37.320]  These are nothing but social workers with guns and badges and tasers.
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:38.320]  Daddy's not coming.
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:46.320]  They're hitting him in the head with the flashlights, right now there's six police
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:51.160]  laying on top of him, beating him and beating him and beating him and kicking him and stomping
[2:43:51.160 --> 2:43:52.160]  him.
[2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:53.160]  On and on.
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:44:01.160]  Now this cop gets his head, knee on his head, get bones broken all over his body.
[2:44:01.160 --> 2:44:08.840]  You ought to go read all the stuff they did to him.
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:13.680]  Get off me, nobody's getting off you, you're going to go to the board, boy.
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:19.160]  Nobody's getting off America, nobody's getting over the 56 million aborted babies, the federal
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:22.720]  reserve's going to keep printing money, America's going down, and these cops are going down
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:23.720]  with it.
[2:44:23.720 --> 2:44:24.720]  It's all going to go down.
[2:44:24.720 --> 2:44:35.840]  The radiation, the GMO, the curses, they're never going to stop till you're dead, boy.
[2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:51.400]  Call him for daddy, daddy came, God help you, police are gone, nobody's going to help,
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:56.680]  as he begs for daddy, they intensify the attack, they love hearing him beg for daddy, that's
[2:44:56.680 --> 2:45:01.840]  the best part, beg for daddy, beg for daddy, he's never coming.
[2:45:01.840 --> 2:45:11.480]  Help me dad, help me dad, help me dad, he's not coming, okay, help me please, shayton
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:23.360]  has you now, oh god, nobody's going to help, the good guys are here, they're all standing
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:34.200]  on him, now some more beating, and now he's going to jail, huge pool of blood, mission
[2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:45.120]  complete, well good job, alright, there you go, and I'm not trying to be sardonic there,
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:51.360]  I'm illustrating with the dark satire that this is where we are as a culture, and again
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:55.400]  we cut out a lot of the beating, a lot of the cussing, a lot of it, but it went on and
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:46:03.840]  on, and he submitted, they're the boss, they're in control, and they're going to walk, the
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:09.680]  two guys that did the caving into the head, and the throat, and the bones, and they're
[2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:17.320]  heroes actually in a war, on the front lines, and don't worry, when they're all done, believe
[2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:20.880]  me, they're not going to be cops in the future, it's all going to be robots, don't worry,
[2:46:20.880 --> 2:46:24.880]  he's going to get a taste of this, I'll be honest with you, Kelly, Thomas got out of
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:29.360]  it easy, little kids, they shoot up with vaccines with cancer viruses, they can take three years
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:34.440]  to die in excruciating pain, so these low level psychopaths are just on power trips,
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:37.560]  I don't even know what they're doing, but the higher ups, they're going to make sure
[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:43.440]  everybody cries for mommy a long time, because that's the music to the evil people's ears,
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:47.600]  Satan likes that dark energy force of the innocence being destroyed, crushed, shucked
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:53.440]  and dry, so that was like Beethoven right there, to psychopaths and evil people listening,
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:57.280]  daddy, can we cue that back up, I'm going to go with these phone calls, Rob, Justin,
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:02.960]  Woody, Coffer and others, we actually got a police to actually call in, X-COP, military
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:09.280]  X-COP, cop for 16 years, 800-259-9231, but just as we come back next break, let's hear
[2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:13.520]  some of the calling for daddy, because you know, I have a son, and that's a very painful
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:18.920]  sound to hear daddy, daddy, and then please God, please God, and of course God will come
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:26.960]  to our aid if we become righteous again, but the police started grabbing on him and then
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:30.360]  hit him with the billy club, so he ran for his life, he had good instincts, and they
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:38.000]  killed him, alright, who's the trash in that video, let's talk to Woody in Washington,
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:41.840]  I'm sure you've seen that video, you just heard the audio, what do you think of that
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:44.480]  video, was that a good thing to do?
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:51.280]  Well, you know, the police stopped being peace officers back in the 70s with all the federal
[2:47:51.280 --> 2:47:57.320]  money that came into local law enforcement, Richard Nixon was behind that, and it was
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:06.000]  only guys like me that came on were mentored by the older brute of real men into the profession,
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:11.800]  and what you have now is a reflection of society, and it's unfortunate it makes all police
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:12.800]  look bad.
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:17.720]  No, I agree, it is a reflection of the degenerate cowardly society, go ahead.
[2:48:17.720 --> 2:48:27.240]  Well, I trained recruits for over 10 years, and you either had really good or really bad,
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:34.920]  it wasn't much in between, and you know, here's a suggestion, Mr. Jones.
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:46.360]  Yes, sir, you're really going to put some good things on at the police do too, look,
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:51.400]  I know, I know that positive enforcement is better than negative enforcement, this isn't
[2:48:51.400 --> 2:48:56.160]  even about the police, it's about a corrupt system, and it's about people that are in
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:49:01.160]  who are such control freaks, that they kill mentally ill people every day in this country
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:04.200]  because they don't follow orders, you see what I'm talking about?
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:09.960]  Yeah, it's a lot of that, but it's also a lot of group psychology today, you have a
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:15.200]  thug culture that's infected our nation, and this is a reflection, the police reflect that,
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:17.200]  they're a reflection of our society.
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:23.000]  I totally agree, the military's been taken over by actual gangs, I'm sure you know that.
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:28.640]  Yeah, they purged most of us, they got rid of most of us, you know, not long after 9-11.
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.440]  I know, I know, listen, listen, I've got a lot of family that are retired police, and
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:37.360]  they're just really great, cool, fun people to be around, really hard-working, smart,
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:41.720]  good people, but they're all old men now, and I talked to young cops, and some of them
[2:49:41.720 --> 2:49:45.440]  are nice, but a lot of them are crazy, and they're looking for trouble, and as a man,
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:50.640]  I have the same response to them that I have walking down an alley when a couple thugs
[2:49:50.640 --> 2:49:54.480]  say something smart, and you know, we're thinking about jumping me, do you understand what I'm
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:55.480]  saying?
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:50:00.200]  I have the same animal response to a lot of police now that I have to ex-cons, do you
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:01.200]  understand?
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:08.240]  It's unfortunate that we've sunk this well.
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:09.240]  I hear you.
[2:50:09.240 --> 2:50:10.240]  Anything else?
[2:50:10.240 --> 2:50:16.560]  I appreciate your call, folks, try to turn your radio off, or it will distract you because
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:18.720]  there's like a 15-second delay.
[2:50:18.720 --> 2:50:24.280]  Let's talk to Rob in Wyoming, former police officer, what do you think of stuff like that?
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:32.800]  I think it's ridiculous, absolutely insane, but for the times that we're living in, part
[2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:33.800]  of the course.
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:37.760]  Yeah, I mean, so what if a homeless person runs away from me?
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:41.840]  If you're not looking for a bank robber, I mean, you know, just follow him down the street,
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:42.840]  pick him up in an hour.
[2:50:42.840 --> 2:50:47.560]  I mean, I don't understand killing somebody, plus the guy starts putting his hands up and
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:50.000]  the cop hits him with a billy club across the thighs.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:53.800]  I mean, what's he supposed to be, run or fight him?
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:57.040]  Well, I would try to get away personally.
[2:50:57.040 --> 2:51:04.640]  You know, I lost my job for basically standing up for the oath that I took.
[2:51:04.640 --> 2:51:11.840]  And just, you know, I refuse to participate in invasive procedures.
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:17.760]  And unfortunately, there's just not a lot of people that are willing to sacrifice that
[2:51:17.760 --> 2:51:19.320]  for doing the right thing anymore.
[2:51:19.320 --> 2:51:24.280]  You know, the head of the Texas State Police supported them doing without even probable
[2:51:24.280 --> 2:51:28.360]  cause, with the same glove, cavity searches of four cavities, two women repeatedly.
[2:51:28.360 --> 2:51:32.440]  Now finally, there's been lawsuits and they had to back off, but I mean, that's scary
[2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:35.920]  when the state police are going to put you over the hood and put their fingers in you.
[2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:41.920]  Yeah, I have a wife and kids and I don't know that I would tolerate that very well if they
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:44.000]  tried doing that to me or them.
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:47.680]  Well, see, that's what I'm afraid of is that I'm getting to the point where I'm not looking
[2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:51.720]  for trouble, but at an instinctive level, I can't handle it.
[2:51:51.720 --> 2:51:54.760]  And I'm just praying that nobody tries this with me.
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:51:58.000]  No, I hear you there.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:51:59.440]  I absolutely agree.
[2:51:59.440 --> 2:52:02.120]  What kind of stuff did you, I mean, you say invasive procedures, what are you talking
[2:52:02.120 --> 2:52:03.120]  about?
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:09.200]  Well, I, I, I worked for a brief time on the patrol side of the house and fortunately,
[2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:14.960]  where I live, we have a very good local police department, but I thought I was better in
[2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:16.200]  the detention area.
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:18.520]  So I worked in the jail.
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:26.640]  And when we got to getting around to doing the booking procedure, our sheriff had received
[2:52:26.640 --> 2:52:32.240]  a grant to operate an iris scanner.
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:40.120]  And I told my, I told my sheriff, I said, if I got arrested and you asked me to put my
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:45.040]  eyes in there so you could scan my irises, I would tell you to pound sand.
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:49.800]  Well, I can't, I can't rightfully ask anybody else to do that.
[2:52:49.800 --> 2:52:50.800]  And, uh,
[2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:55.440]  And by the way, that's the best way they let you go.
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:56.440]  Oh, okay.
[2:52:56.440 --> 2:52:59.280]  No, no, no, I mean, I'm asking what happened.
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:03.000]  Oh, oh, oh, well, actually I got hurt.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:06.320]  I got hurt, uh, protecting another inmate.
[2:53:06.320 --> 2:53:10.120]  And so yeah, they do, they like, I wasn't able to do the job anymore.
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:11.920]  So they let me go as quickly as they could.
[2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:17.480]  And I'm pretty sure that, that there were, uh, uh, some retribution involved over, over
[2:53:17.480 --> 2:53:23.280]  the letter that I had written regarding the, uh, the eye scanner deal.
[2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:24.280]  Absolutely.
[2:53:24.280 --> 2:53:26.240]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:31.000]  It's just very scary to know that these juries, I mean, that's a reflection of society are,
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:32.800]  are, are doing things like this.
[2:53:32.800 --> 2:53:35.560]  And again, they've got all these excuses of why they're doing this.
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:37.840]  But this system is, it is a thug culture.
[2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:42.040]  You've got so many prisons that are colleges of crime and they put nonviolent offenders
[2:53:42.040 --> 2:53:48.160]  in there where immediately, see, I wouldn't be recruited by gangs and these were wannabe
[2:53:48.160 --> 2:53:51.800]  gangs growing up outside Dallas in a suburb.
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:53.600]  And so they would fight me.
[2:53:53.600 --> 2:53:59.200]  I mean, I went into sixth grade out of private school and I mean, I was immediately had kids
[2:53:59.200 --> 2:54:01.360]  that had slunk three, four grades beating me up.
[2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:04.120]  And I think it's the best thing that ever happened to me quite frankly in my life, maybe
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:05.120]  a different person.
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:08.120]  Uh, and the school wouldn't protect me, my parents said, well, you just better learn
[2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:10.480]  how to fight, which was a normal old fashioned way.
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:11.480]  I'm glad.
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:14.040]  I mean, I, it's the best thing ever happened to me was, you know, I've been in quite a
[2:54:14.040 --> 2:54:19.160]  few fights growing up with thugs, but most people would follow the thugs, adopt their
[2:54:19.160 --> 2:54:21.040]  culture.
[2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:25.280]  And there was kind of a redneck gang, there was a black gang, Hispanic gang, but, but
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:29.200]  it was, you know, join one of these groups, kiss our butts, or we're going to beat you
[2:54:29.200 --> 2:54:30.200]  up every day.
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:33.520]  And we're going to beat you up wherever we see you around town.
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:36.720]  And I just got to where, you know, these people are absolutely scared of me.
[2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:40.240]  And then I started having, by the time I was like 14, 15 to fight their older brothers
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:43.360]  and people that were like 20 years old, 22 were actual ex cons.
[2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:47.760]  I mean, I'd be at a party when I was 16 and the door would kick open at some open house
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:48.760]  party.
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:52.080]  Me, some 25 year old convict going, you put my cousin in the hospital, you know, and
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:56.200]  it's like when I'm 16 and you know, God, later I started kicking his butt and he pulled
[2:54:56.200 --> 2:54:58.240]  out a knife and man, I just flipped the switch.
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:00.960]  I remember saying that same thing with cops, somebody comes up with a knife, take them
[2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:01.960]  out.
[2:55:01.960 --> 2:55:03.680]  I have a killer instinct.
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:04.680]  I said, all right, that's it.
[2:55:04.680 --> 2:55:06.720]  And I know it's in my juvenile files up there.
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:10.560]  That case was in Rawl at Texas and I took that big old 250 pound ex con.
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:15.600]  I probably had 180 pounds and I mean, I broke him up bad and he never even came back from
[2:55:15.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  it.
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:19.360]  Last time I heard he was an invalid and I'm not even proud of that, but I don't feel
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:24.320]  guilty over hurting that guy because he pulled a knife when I started kicking his butt.
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:27.440]  And so it's fine to beat up a really bad person that attacks you.
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:32.160]  I mean, if some thug, you know, who's just stabbed somebody and you're chasing them
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:37.240]  and they pull a weapon on you, you know, they're fighting, you beat the brains out, fine.
[2:55:37.240 --> 2:55:41.440]  Don't beat the brains out of some schizophrenic that didn't even resist you because I'm telling
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:47.520]  you, I look at those cops, they look like the type of guys I used to fight all the time
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:50.080]  in Dallas.
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  And let me tell you something.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:52.080]  They're real tough right up front.
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:55.520]  When you start hurting them, they start crying and trying to get away.
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:00.680]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Cooper in Washington.
[2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:01.680]  Go ahead.
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:02.680]  Go ahead.
[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:03.680]  How are you doing?
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:04.680]  Hey, good.
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:06.440]  You say you're a cop for 16 years.
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:08.720]  What's your take on this?
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:12.520]  You know, I haven't watched the video and it would be, I don't like to play Monday night
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:17.960]  quarterback, but I will tell you this, I'm a detective background investigator.
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:22.840]  I do extensive backgrounds on new hires and I will tell you, there is definitely a culture
[2:56:22.840 --> 2:56:26.160]  change, but it all comes down to this, Mr. Jones.
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:32.800]  What does, what is your department's mission and what does the chief and the commanders
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:36.200]  want with new hires?
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:39.840]  Our department, I just finished the background on a guy I won't tell you where from, but
[2:56:39.840 --> 2:56:46.280]  I did 23 interviews with people because we want to make sure we get the right guy in.
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:51.760]  But I'm, I think I ought to work in a community where we, we work with the citizens.
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:55.200]  They respect us, we respect them and I work in a county that's the same way.
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:56:56.200]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:01.320]  You either have in my experience, good departments of professional good people or you have departments
[2:57:01.320 --> 2:57:02.320]  of thugs.
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:04.720]  Well, I agree and this is a deal.
[2:57:04.720 --> 2:57:08.920]  I had a conversation with two young officers the other day about the tattoo issue.
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:13.680]  I don't agree with these sleeve tattoos and I think if they hire an officer's hired on
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:18.200]  the department, they need to be covered up because I told them we are not thugs and
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:20.800]  I don't care because I don't care if the culture has changed.
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:24.480]  We need to be above reproach and when somebody looks at the police officer need to see us
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:28.680]  the professional man and woman and they didn't agree because they're younger and they think
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:29.680]  the tattoos are cool.
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:30.680]  And I said, you know what?
[2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:33.440]  I don't want to be looked at as a thug or a gangster.
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:34.440]  We're not.
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:36.200]  We're the thin blue line between good and evil.
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:40.880]  I really believe that and, but that's the mentality today with these young officers.
[2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:46.680]  They think it's cool to wear the, the tattoos and the gold badges and play Mr. Tough Guy,
[2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:49.360]  but that, that.
[2:57:49.360 --> 2:57:51.000]  You just lost him.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  His phone disconnected.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  You still there?
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  Cooper?
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  I know he's back.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  He has your call waiting.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  Go ahead.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:02.320]  But anyways, listen, we're servants, we're public servants and that's where departments
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:08.200]  need to get back and they need to understand and listen, we, the public pays our pay.
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:14.040]  And you know, I blame the public too is because it's what they'll tolerate too in my community.
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:18.120]  If you beat the hell out of somebody like that, I guarantee you you're out of a job.
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:22.840]  Now these guys are probably going to be charged by the Department of Justice for civil rights
[2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:23.840]  violation.
[2:58:23.840 --> 2:58:24.840]  This isn't done yet.
[2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:30.000]  I mean, if they did screw up, so, but it's, well, I've watched the video, the guy's not
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:34.400]  even resisting and they're still beating him and, and it's like some mob psychology.
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:35.400]  We're going into overdrive.
[2:58:35.400 --> 2:58:38.520]  We're going to talk to Justin, former LAPD and more.
[2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:40.280]  This is powerful phone calls.
[2:58:40.280 --> 2:58:41.280]  Everybody stay there.
[2:58:41.280 --> 2:58:46.680]  Stephen Costa Rica, Pyro, Tiger, we're going to get the Tigers been holding a while, we're
[2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:50.880]  going to get the Tigers stay with us.
[2:58:50.880 --> 2:58:51.880]  The facts are in.
[2:58:51.880 --> 2:58:57.040]  The studies are legion, sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:59:00.840]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:04.600]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[2:59:04.600 --> 2:59:09.960]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[2:59:09.960 --> 2:59:14.200]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:15.520]  to get it out of our bodies.
[2:59:15.520 --> 2:59:21.360]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation,
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:27.040]  using six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove
[2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:32.120]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[2:59:32.120 --> 2:59:36.400]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:42.000]  I use fluoride shield every day, secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:44.400]  at infowarslife.com today.
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:50.560]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time, that's infowarslife.com.
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:32.000]  What you've got is either good police departments or bad police departments, but the globalists
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:38.240]  are trying to make them all evil, all paramilitary thug groups.
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:43.040]  We're going to 20 after an overdrive talking to police military about Kelly Thomas Verdick,
[3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:51.040]  licensed to kill, and clearly if you watch the 21 minute video, it's like the tack dogs
[3:00:51.040 --> 3:00:56.520]  ripping up a baby or something, and I don't want police just trained to just attack anybody
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:01:02.880]  for any reason because that's what macho people do, and we know police are bad in most countries,
[3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:06.800]  so it can happen here, it is happening here, and I agree there's a lot of good police out
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:11.720]  there, the problem is up above them, the system is so corrupt that it wants them to only selectively
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:14.400]  enforce and get away with murder.
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:16.360]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:17.360]  Is it Justin?
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:21.760]  Then we'll go to Tiger, Steve, and Pyro, and then that'll be it for calls.
[3:01:21.760 --> 3:01:26.880]  Go ahead, Justin in California, former LAPD, works now for military.
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:29.720]  What's your take on the Kelly Thomas Verdick?
[3:01:29.720 --> 3:01:31.920]  It's wrong, Alex.
[3:01:31.920 --> 3:01:33.880]  Right now there's some severe issues going on.
[3:01:33.880 --> 3:01:43.320]  You know, Alex, I listened to your show recently, there's just some really heavy issues going
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:44.320]  on.
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:47.600]  Alex, one of the things that I really need to get out there on the record is people
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:49.320]  need to really understand what's going on.
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:51.800]  This stuff is really heavy, it's really deep.
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:56.080]  Right now we're at a really risky time, for instance, when did the police go to black
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:01:57.080]  uniforms?
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:01:58.080]  They used to wear navy blue uniforms.
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:02.960]  Remember that show, it was called the ill street blues, it wasn't called a black uniform
[3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:06.200]  and it was done on a black uniform.
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:07.200]  There's some problems.
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:11.800]  There's areas, for instance, I'm in California and I'm at my proud zero where the nightmare
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:16.900]  is taking place, not unlike this in some places like that, maybe Florida.
[3:02:16.900 --> 3:02:24.160]  One of the problems, Alex, is this, in places like Salmonadino County, the sheriff's deputies
[3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:29.160]  who contract out the reddicops in the city they work in, they're actually instructed
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:33.840]  at this point in time to go ahead and do whatever you want, to wherever you pull over at any
[3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:34.840]  given time.
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:38.520]  In other words, you have a green light, violate their Fourth Amendment.
[3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:41.360]  Who cares if they say, no, don't search me, don't go through my car?
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:43.680]  Who cares if we find the goods on them?
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:47.120]  Put the onus on them to go in front of, oh, and then this is what they're instructed
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:50.280]  to tell the citizens when they're helpful on their rights.
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:52.240]  I'll talk to the judge.
[3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:55.800]  Really now, like you can just walk into the courtroom and just say, hey, judge, let's
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:56.800]  have a beer.
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:02:57.800]  No, no, no.
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:03.440]  I mean, police are now coming in people's houses without probable cause or an emergency.
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:07.000]  And the courts are saying, yeah, you can come in a house without warrants whenever you want.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:10.920]  See, that's what they're being instructed to do now, Alex.
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:13.240]  And the prosecutors, you know, they're all in on it.
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:17.600]  You know, it's a hardcore law and order type of a, that's not conservatism.
[3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:20.880]  You know, I hear you mention these type of issues.
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:24.320]  People have become confused, propagandized from just the constant brainwashing that's
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:28.440]  taking place, telling the minister that they're telling them it's a war.
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:29.920]  We've got to violate everybody's rights.
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:34.680]  Meanwhile, the police chief in many areas is on the take with the CIA getting drug money.
[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:36.280]  I mean, it's a total joke.
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:40.480]  I mean, the low level drug dealer doesn't even know they work for the big banks.
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:41.480]  That's confirmed.
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:44.480]  And I'm not endorsing the thug culture.
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:46.640]  This has been created artificially.
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:50.960]  And now it's absorbing the police by all means, Alex.
[3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:53.400]  And again, the situation is really, really bad.
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:03:56.000]  You know, I hate to say this, you know, I worked in law enforcement.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:59.720]  I'm going to tell you, I know you get these guys calling in and I feel a little sympathy
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:00.720]  for them.
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:02.880]  But Alex, I've got to be honest with you.
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:03.880]  There are no good police.
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:08.400]  We're a full on police state and if they are good police out there, they're playing you
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:09.400]  right now.
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:13.000]  You've ever heard of a little game called good cop, bad cop?
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.640]  I'm just telling you, let me, let me give you the proof of that.
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:16.640]  Okay.
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:21.000]  The reason why I tell you that they're all bad is because the supposed good guys, why
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.200]  don't they blow the whistle on the bad guys?
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:26.080]  Everybody knows that there's bad police officers.
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:27.080]  Everybody knows this.
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:28.880]  The key is how do you identify them?
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:30.680]  You see what I'm saying?
[3:04:30.680 --> 3:04:34.840]  It's kind of like when we talk about 9-Eleven or issues like that, you ask, well, who benefits
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:35.840]  from this crime?
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:40.160]  You know, but again, going back to law enforcement, these guys can't even solve 9-Eleven.
[3:04:40.160 --> 3:04:43.000]  You think they're going to solve anything that's really, uh, uh, important?
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:45.480]  You know, we're going to stay there, stay there, don't hang up.
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:50.080]  I want to come back to you, Justin, and then Tiger, Steve and Pyro, and that'll be yet.
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:51.360]  But wow, what a powerful call.
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:53.520]  Yeah, because they're not allowed to.
[3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:54.520]  It's on record.
[3:04:54.520 --> 3:04:56.120]  The big banks, launder almost all the drug money.
[3:04:56.120 --> 3:05:01.360]  No one goes after them because they run the country.
[3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:06.560]  If you're a baby boomer or senior, please listen closely to this important message.
[3:05:06.560 --> 3:05:11.680]  Politicians in Washington are quietly plotting to decrease your social security payments drastically,
[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:13.520]  and they want to do it soon.
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:18.840]  In fact, despite rising prices at the gas pump, grocery store, and doctor's office, retirees
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:24.280]  have received a mere 1.3% annual increase to their social security checks.
[3:05:24.280 --> 3:05:29.240]  Meanwhile, food stamp recipients have seen their payouts increase over 30% under the
[3:05:29.240 --> 3:05:31.200]  Obama administration.
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:32.200]  That's shocking.
[3:05:32.200 --> 3:05:36.720]  So when we stumbled upon a weird trick that could add up to $1,000 to your monthly social
[3:05:36.720 --> 3:05:39.760]  security checks, we knew we had to share it with you.

[3:06:06.080 --> 3:06:10.000]  Are you struggling to make your mortgage payments, facing foreclosure, trying to refinance or
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:13.760]  modify your home loan but have been turned down, afraid you'll lose your home?
[3:06:13.760 --> 3:06:14.760]  There is a way out.
[3:06:14.760 --> 3:06:18.720]  The Obama Administration has announced a government relief program called the Home Affordability
[3:06:18.720 --> 3:06:22.560]  and Stability Plan, funded by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act.
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:26.280]  It's designed to save nine million homes from foreclosure, and there's a good chance
[3:06:26.280 --> 3:06:27.280]  you qualify.
[3:06:27.280 --> 3:06:30.120]  We were three months behind on our payments, and the National Mortgage Helpline was able
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:33.440]  to get our mortgage company to take the payments we were behind, put them on the back of our
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:35.400]  loan, and lower our interest rate.
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:37.080]  Now we have a payment we can afford.
[3:06:37.080 --> 3:06:40.080]  Here's your chance to take advantage of this government-funded program that's sweeping
[3:06:40.080 --> 3:06:41.080]  the nation.
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:44.920]  Stop foreclosure proceedings, forgive late payments and penalties, convert your adjustable rate
[3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:47.760]  to fixed, and reduce it to as low as 2 percent.
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:50.080]  Even reduce or eliminate past due payments.

[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:04.920]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying
[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:09.560]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100 percent organic coffee on the planet for
[3:07:09.560 --> 3:07:10.800]  more than a decade.
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:15.320]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers
[3:07:15.320 --> 3:07:17.960]  grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[3:07:17.960 --> 3:07:23.280]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[3:07:23.280 --> 3:07:29.680]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100 percent organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:34.800]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:36.920]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[3:07:36.920 --> 3:07:41.240]  Once down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[3:07:41.240 --> 3:07:43.880]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:48.680]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[3:07:52.880 --> 3:07:58.400]  press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:01.400]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:16.400]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:18.600]  America's got a rude awakening coming.
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:24.360]  I got an article right here, just came out, FBI will not file charges against IRS over
[3:08:24.360 --> 3:08:25.880]  treatment of Tea Party groups.
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:29.920]  Well, yeah, it's run by the guy ordering the persecution.
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:32.880]  A total gangster thug, Eric Holder.
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:36.040]  By the way, was involved in Oklahoma City, look into that.
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:41.080]  We even have the emails, we know the name of the task force who was there, seen by witnesses.
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:42.920]  I mean, it's really bad.
[3:08:42.920 --> 3:08:48.920]  By the way, I feel like I'm my life's in danger when I start saying this stuff, because believe
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:52.280]  me, they're not happy about it.
[3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:54.040]  And so just remember who runs the country.
[3:08:54.040 --> 3:09:00.960]  While there's all this law and order business, it's in the Chicago Tribune, the El Paso
[3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:06.440]  Times, what we told you years ago, send a lower drug cartel run by the CIA, FBI, DEA.
[3:09:06.440 --> 3:09:10.640]  I mean, the whole thing run, just the shipments, the cocaine.
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:14.160]  Every once in a while, the Texas State Police will catch an 18-wheeler full of cocaine.
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:17.280]  FBI shows up, declares national security, it rolls out.
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:19.760]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:24.000]  This is a $500 billion a year industry that they can use in however way that they want.
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:25.440]  So of course they want a thug culture.
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:28.320]  The government is thug run now.
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:30.760]  And folks, we better wake up to this and get past the fear.
[3:09:30.760 --> 3:09:35.440]  I got a race now through Justin, Tiger, Steve, and Pyro.
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:38.520]  Justin, finish up your point about, yeah, no, no, I get it.
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:44.640]  I don't even think all cops are so much corrupt as they're compartmentalized to where, I mean,
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:48.720]  I've talked to high-level folks, how it's like a big joke of the Secret Service, FBI,
[3:09:48.720 --> 3:09:53.680]  federal marshals, state police, they'll be laughing at the quote, good cops, as you said,
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:54.680]  and they're the bad cops.
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:59.360]  And it's like, hey, you know, go get us some coffee, and then the door shuts, and they're
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:03.560]  going, what a moron, what an idiot, and that's how this works.
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:04.560]  Go ahead.
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:05.560]  Alex.
[3:10:05.560 --> 3:10:06.560]  No, it's heavier than that.
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:08.320]  It's more dark than that.
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:11.800]  Listen, Alex, in the capacity that I work in now, I work as an instructor.
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:15.560]  Okay, and I go and I give these classes, and sometimes the classes that we give are like
[3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:20.640]  your local, like little police officers, you know, in some city, in let's say Southern
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:25.920]  California, Northern California, in Arizona, and I listen to these guys talk, Alex, and
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:26.920]  it's not good.
[3:10:26.920 --> 3:10:29.920]  Listen, let me give you another example of something really bad.
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:33.040]  For instance, all the police are walking around with all these high-tech weapons right now.
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:36.120]  You know, they're walking around with the high-capacity magazines right now, you know,
[3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:40.120]  for instance, like the Glock's with the 17 rounds and whatnot, all these magazines all
[3:10:40.120 --> 3:10:41.120]  over their body.
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:42.120]  Who are those weapons for, Alex?
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:43.120]  You know, ask yourself that.
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:44.120]  You know them.
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:45.120]  What was it for us?
[3:10:45.120 --> 3:10:47.120]  You've been saying it now for years.
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:50.800]  But again, a robbery, it's the road, who are those weapons for?
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:55.520]  Oh, I know, small towns are all getting war wagons, they're trying to take on gun owners,
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:59.800]  they're training for a civil war, and they're training to crush the Tea Party, and the Tea
[3:10:59.800 --> 3:11:03.800]  Party's the biggest supporter of the police, and I think the Tea Party should reach out
[3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:08.200]  to the police and point out the federalization, and we should get a national movement of police,
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:11.120]  which we already have with the sheriffs and others, to say they're not going to be part
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:12.120]  of this.
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:16.240]  Great points, I appreciate your call, and let me guess what they say as an instructor.
[3:11:16.240 --> 3:11:21.440]  They can't wait to kill people, they can't wait to feel women up, they can't wait to,
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:24.240]  you know, take drugs off people and keep it.
[3:11:24.240 --> 3:11:26.240]  I mean, is it that type of stuff?
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:32.160]  It's like the guy from Facebook, it's like they call the schools behind our backs.
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:35.160]  I've got to be honest though, I'm there with them, I'm listening to what they're saying,
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:38.240]  I still have blood relatives that remember stuff, and here's another problem, let me
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:39.240]  show you something else.
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:40.240]  I'll leave you with this, Alex.
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:45.240]  The whole idea, the philosophy, they call themselves, hey, I'm on the force, I'm going
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:51.240]  to go work, you know, I'm going to join the force, hey, you know, the word force in and
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:56.240]  of itself can you wait some type of, you know, some type of forcing somebody to do something,
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:12:02.240]  submission, some type of power over another individual, okay, like they're the so-called
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:06.240]  Jedi or something, some type of a schistic force, the bottom line, Alex, it's dangerous,
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:07.240]  okay, it's dangerous.
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:12.200]  No, I know, I know, it's become the government force, and the government is hijacked in evil,
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:17.240]  and so a sword itself is an evil, but the arm wielding it, the government, is evil,
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:21.600]  and it's all coming down, and we could stop this whole thing if people woke up and realized
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:23.240]  it, I appreciate you calling in.
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:28.040]  I mean, you know, used to the police, even in big cities, left families alone, left people
[3:12:28.040 --> 3:12:34.200]  that obviously weren't bad alone, no, it's now about making us know we're bad because
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:39.000]  the system wants us all to feel guilty, and they want us all accustomed to being questioned,
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:44.920]  all to basically be inducted into the prison culture. America is one giant prison. Slavery
[3:12:44.920 --> 3:12:51.000]  has been re-legalized through government, and they've all got a reason of your zoning
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:55.400]  or drugs or you didn't put your pills in the right bottle when you went to work. I see
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:13:00.000]  cases where they arrest old men for heart medication that isn't even a, you know, it's prescription,
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:04.640]  but it's not, something that gets you high, and the old guy's got it in his little pill
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:09.120]  thing he takes, and they go, we're on taking in, this is prescription, and it should be
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:13.960]  in a bottle. What, sonny, ask my heart pill. I mean, you know, old ladies will have $2,000
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:19.040]  in cash, and the cops in Texas all over will take the money. I mean, this is some waxed
[3:13:19.040 --> 3:13:25.440]  out stuff, and they'll have judges and people in these Texas towns on TV going, you shouldn't
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:31.640]  drive around with money. We don't care if Mrs. Appleton is a pillar of the community.
[3:13:31.640 --> 3:13:37.840]  They shouldn't have $2,000. We kested the bills, and five of them had cocaine on them.
[3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:44.880]  All money that's been used has drugs on it. They go, don't matter. We're keeping the money.
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:48.400]  That's a crook. And all these other cops that are compartmentalized are like, hey, now don't
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.680]  be too mean. Talk about the good stuff we do. Look, if we don't talk about the bad stuff
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:14:00.280]  that's going on, it's going to take over. We've got to have this debate. I mean, folks,
[3:14:00.280 --> 3:14:04.280]  I've had family, a bunch of them that work for the army and stuff, and I mean, in special
[3:14:04.280 --> 3:14:08.480]  operations and above that, and I mean, they're just like, come on. That's how I knew when
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:12.600]  I was a kid, the government brought in most of the drugs and killed people and just all
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:18.200]  sorts of other stuff. And a lot of the muscle for the New World Order comes out of Texas.
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:21.680]  That's all I'm going to say. And that's where they recruit heavily. And it's just, it's
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:29.360]  all over the place. I mean, a lot of army officers that I know after 25 years in the
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:35.280]  army, you then graduate to the real army. Let me just put it to you that way. And the
[3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:41.840]  public has no idea how all this really works. And if you get caught shipping drugs in, or
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:45.520]  you get caught killing people, or you get caught doing something like this, why you
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:52.000]  were acting alone. It's the movie Two Guns. If you want to know how this really works,
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:55.840]  I went and saw that new movie Two Guns. I mean, that's like real, except it's silly,
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:14:59.120]  you know, shooting people out of helicopters and stuff. I mean, it's got a cartoon element,
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:03.960]  but the whole way it works. The new Mark Warburg movie. But I was disgusted watching because
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:08.040]  all the people laughing at it. There were all these cops and military guys in there watching
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:13.000]  it with me. And I was just like, man, this is freaking me out. I mean, this is freaking
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:18.480]  me out. Stephen Costa Rica, former law enforcement. What's your take on all this?
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:25.600]  Well, Alex, I have a quite a year span of reflection on this. And yes, this latest thing
[3:15:25.600 --> 3:15:32.840]  in Smele is just horrible. It gives me goosebumps. It makes me want to cry. And I feel your pain.
[3:15:32.840 --> 3:15:38.320]  Alex, I feel your pain, what you're feeling because I got the same sentiments inside.
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:44.200]  The police departments are so different these days. And when I used to see how they pepper
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:49.920]  sprayed the Occupy Wall Street people with their hands behind their back handcuffs and
[3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:55.040]  spraying it right in their face, I just get chills just even watching that because of police
[3:15:55.040 --> 3:15:58.520]  pepper spray is a crowd disbursement and they're using it for policy.
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:16:02.280]  Hey, have you seen the footage in Portland when they had peaceful anti-war demonstrators
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:06.640]  and they sprayed into baby carriages on purpose and said, don't bring a baby?
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:12.160]  Yeah. And what about the private parts in the searching rooms and in the jail? So I can't
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:16.920]  believe they're getting away with this. I can't believe it. This is an assault on the
[3:16:16.920 --> 3:16:21.440]  general public. If you just spit on a cop back in the old days, that was an assault
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:25.680]  on a cop. I used to work in a prison system too. And when the inmates spit on you, you
[3:16:25.680 --> 3:16:29.000]  could arrest them for assaulting a police officer. But it's so different. But also,
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:33.880]  I grew up around the Rodney King beating. My mother worked at that baby beef burgers
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:38.320]  where he got beat up. Alex, this stuff has been going on for decades and decades and
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.360]  decades. They're just getting caught more and they're just being more bold about it
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:46.800]  because nobody said anything about them. Even the riots after those two cops got off in
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:51.840]  L.A. I said they deserve it. L.A. deserved it. L.A. deserved it. People don't know how
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:55.480]  many millions of dollars they pay out. Well, here's the deal. It didn't matter if Rodney
[3:16:55.480 --> 3:17:00.280]  King was a dumb thug. There's no point when he's not resisting to beat him up so you become
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:05.040]  a thug. I appreciate your call. Moving quick, Tiger in Mississippi, law enforcement. Thanks
[3:17:05.040 --> 3:17:10.320]  for holding. Go ahead, Tiger. Thank you. I was going to get into some of the stuff on
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:15.880]  our, I've been out of about 16 years, about two years, but that was in it for about 16.
[3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:19.760]  I was going to get into some of our traffic stop procedures, but hearing about some of
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:24.360]  the unnecessary use of force, I want to elaborate on a shot with an incident I incurred one
[3:17:24.360 --> 3:17:29.560]  night. I had taken a shot with him during the custody and he had put up a resistance
[3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:32.760]  at first, so I left him handcuffed even after I got into the station because he was like
[3:17:32.760 --> 3:17:36.920]  as soon as I got out of his cuffs at home. We put him in the holding cell and I was
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:39.560]  sitting up at the booking counter doing the paperwork, getting him booked in, getting
[3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:44.200]  his picture taken, getting ready to do his picture taken. He was just dropping the F-bomb
[3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:47.080]  every five minutes, not telling him to be quiet. He'd been drinking a little bit too,
[3:17:47.080 --> 3:17:51.600]  so he had a public drunk charge, but every time he'd just drop an F-bomb or something
[3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:54.880]  like that, I'd just say, you need to be quiet. I'm just dropping this oil to the condor
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:17:57.360]  attorney and he'd keep on, so every time he would do something I'd tell him not to
[3:17:57.360 --> 3:17:59.400]  do, I'd just drop another this oil to the condor attorney.
[3:17:59.400 --> 3:18:03.720]  Well, finally, my captain walked in and captain pretty much yelled at him, why don't you
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:09.360]  shut the F-bomb up? The guy told him to F you and at that point my captain said, somebody
[3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:13.720]  spray him and I said, the captain is cuffed and he said, I don't care, somebody spray
[3:18:13.720 --> 3:18:18.240]  him. Well, I also walked over and sprayed my prisoner while he's in the cage handcuffed
[3:18:18.240 --> 3:18:20.960]  and he said, F you, I'm going to get you when I get out of these cuffs. He said, oh, it's
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:26.200]  one tasin. So my prisoner, I had not touched other than a handcuff in the cage while I'm
[3:18:26.200 --> 3:18:29.720]  booking him, gets sprayed and tasered for just cussing.
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:36.440]  Well, see, my issue is, I don't, I would start getting mad and it could be just having
[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:41.320]  somebody do that, so that's bad and I see what you did when you was the right thing.
[3:18:41.320 --> 3:18:47.120]  My issue is this homeless guy didn't do anything and they, they, they attacked him first and
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:51.000]  then killed him and then got away with it. I mean, quite frankly, if somebody was yelling
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:54.640]  at me and yelling at me, I would get sick of it and then maybe move them to the end
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:18:58.880]  of the hall, you know, with a cell that wasn't loud or something. And I get, you want to
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:03.760]  go get in a fight with them. The problem is you can't because they're under your control
[3:19:03.760 --> 3:19:10.400]  and unless you go take your badge off and get in a fist fight with them, then, then,
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:15.480]  I mean, maybe they should have in, in jails, like a octagon and then if somebody signs
[3:19:15.480 --> 3:19:19.040]  a form that they want to fight the cop or the jail guard and the cop wants to get in
[3:19:19.040 --> 3:19:22.680]  the ring with them, put them in the ring with boxing gloves on. That's what they do in the
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:26.760]  old days. In fact, I talked to a family that, that one of them's a jail guard. He talked
[3:19:26.760 --> 3:19:31.760]  to an old jail guard that died like 20 years ago and he said in the old days that if people
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:34.360]  kept shooting their mouths off, I'm going to skip this break and go to the bottom of
[3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:37.840]  the hour. I got to finish with these guys. And then, and this is like 50 years ago at
[3:19:37.840 --> 3:19:41.720]  Huntsville that, that they would actually occasionally have the boxing matches. Now
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:46.040]  you hear about that as gladiatorial events in the jails, but you know, again, men aren't
[3:19:46.040 --> 3:19:50.080]  really men anymore to a great extent. In the old days, you wouldn't say something like
[3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:54.400]  that to somebody unless you thought something was going to end up happening. So I think
[3:19:54.400 --> 3:19:59.920]  it's the thug culture on both sides is turning the police into thugs. I think the trainers
[3:19:59.920 --> 3:20:02.520]  that called in earlier are right. Go ahead and finish your point.
[3:20:02.520 --> 3:20:09.760]  I disagree with what was going on. And as soon as I saw it happen, I've kind of tabbed
[3:20:09.760 --> 3:20:17.000]  out of my software system that we used and immediately went into an inter-office memorandum.
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:20.840]  I was just going to write the incident up and my captain kind of walked behind me instead
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:23.720]  of my shoulder. So at that point, I just went ahead and closed that out and forgot about
[3:20:23.720 --> 3:20:27.440]  turning in a memo on that and just finished my report because at that point I was like,
[3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:33.320]  okay, if I do this, I'm pretty much out of a job. But going back to our traffic stop
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:38.960]  situations, it got to the point where they were demanding that it was not in writing.
[3:20:38.960 --> 3:20:44.080]  It was an unwritten rule because the quota is illegal, but an unwritten writing, an unwritten
[3:20:44.080 --> 3:20:48.120]  rule, we were supposed to make three traffic stops a night and write at least two tickets
[3:20:48.120 --> 3:20:52.200]  a night and they warned you inside at least two of those vehicles. And if you didn't do
[3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:55.720]  it, you would get a write up, maybe not stopping a certain amount of vehicles, but they would
[3:20:55.720 --> 3:20:57.720]  find a reason to get you.
[3:20:57.720 --> 3:21:01.880]  Well, exactly. I mean, it's like almost every time I get pulled over, they want to search
[3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:06.800]  my car. And I mean, I'm just like, no, it's a Fourth Amendment. And they're like, well,
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:10.920]  what do you got to hide and all this stuff? And I'm like, nothing. But you know, quite
[3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:14.560]  frankly, there's a rifle under the seat. It's totally legal, but I don't, it's not their
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:19.760]  business. I mean, I'm not leaving the scene of a crime. There's no probable cause. They
[3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:25.000]  don't need, but again, it's Justice Department standards. They want to make the police do
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:30.480]  illegal things just like these warrantless blood draws and these tissue swabs, which
[3:21:30.480 --> 3:21:35.520]  they now admit are Justice Department funded to get ready for illegal checkpoints. They're
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:41.600]  priming the police, the public, all of us are being prepared for this.
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:45.680]  But yeah, I mean, even on some of the domestic violence incidents where I would split the
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.480]  parties up and one person will be violent, I would manage to calm them down. We had officers
[3:21:49.480 --> 3:21:52.960]  come in hot headed, ready to rock and roll. And when I push them aside and say, let me
[3:21:52.960 --> 3:21:56.160]  get it, I got it. I would get approached by a supervisor and say, you look like you're
[3:21:56.160 --> 3:21:59.920]  a vegetarian and this profession, there's a meat eater and a vegetarian. Are you a vegetarian?
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:03.120]  Of course not. I worked in a meeting in an apartment when I first got in of all enforcement.
[3:22:03.120 --> 3:22:08.240]  I worked a place that this last spot when I was there, wouldn't even want to work. So
[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:12.160]  yeah, I believe you're right. The law enforcement is getting more aggressive. I think a lot
[3:22:12.160 --> 3:22:16.760]  of them are being brainwashed in school and they're just forgetting the way that this
[3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:21.800]  country used to be and they're going along with exactly what the media is, you know,
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:25.800]  I'm watching this to go. So absolutely. I bless you. And the police are going to be
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:30.160]  discredited in this. I mean, look at Chris Christie selling out to Obama and now the
[3:22:30.160 --> 3:22:35.400]  Justice Department is after him. There's no honor among thieves. And yeah, they think
[3:22:35.400 --> 3:22:42.080]  it's tough to beat somebody up for no reason. Or they think it's tough to be a thug and
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:49.600]  use too much force. That's not tough. I mean, it's like when you see a big guy starting
[3:22:49.600 --> 3:22:53.920]  to fight with a little guy and I've seen that many times when I was in college going out
[3:22:53.920 --> 3:22:57.640]  with, you know, girlfriends and stuff. I've seen it many times in life and it's really
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:23:02.080]  makes you mad when some big bouncer for a lot of bouncers are not bad guys, but you
[3:23:02.080 --> 3:23:05.800]  know, the thug bouncers are starting to fight with somebody for some little guy for no reason.
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:11.280]  It's like, wow, they picked a little guy to start a fight. And at an instinctive level,
[3:23:11.280 --> 3:23:15.840]  you want to climb up on top of them and beat the hell out of them. And so I mean, I'll
[3:23:15.840 --> 3:23:19.240]  be honest, I would never want to be a cop because if I came to somebody's house and
[3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:23.320]  there was a dead baby that had gotten into drugs and some scumbag piece of filth cussing
[3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:29.320]  at me and everything, I'd probably break their neck. So I mean, I'm just, I'm just saying
[3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:36.320]  even I in those situations, I've talked to multiple EMS people over the years. I had
[3:23:36.320 --> 3:23:41.160]  one of them work for me for years. He moved and he told the story about how sometimes
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:46.760]  EMS would attack people because I mean, you get there and there's a dead baby and there's
[3:23:46.760 --> 3:23:50.880]  some guy going, I don't care. There's like drugs all over the place and you know, stuff
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:55.480]  like that happens or, or, or some guy shot his family and is there when you get there
[3:23:55.480 --> 3:24:00.000]  still alive. I mean, you know, you want to break their neck. That's justice. 5,000 years
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:04.960]  ago, if the local tribe, somebody broke a baby's neck or something and that there wouldn't
[3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:08.600]  even be a trial that get over there. He broke the baby's neck. The men of the village would
[3:24:08.600 --> 3:24:13.680]  just take you out, take a sword right there. You'd be dead. I mean, that's normal. Ladies
[3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:18.280]  and gentlemen, the problem is our society's so big, you got to have to process and then
[3:24:18.280 --> 3:24:21.920]  the police get away with killing bad guys. Everybody's like, Oh, we fell in at his head
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:26.760]  because they deserve it. Then suddenly all the guy didn't totally exert, deserve it,
[3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:32.640]  but we like to kill people. And so, because, you know, once you get into that mode, folks,
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:35.480]  it's a bad situation. Pretty soon, some homeless guy used to start to go ahead and hit him
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:39.640]  with a billy club for no reason because he just halfway argued with you and then he runs
[3:24:39.640 --> 3:24:44.000]  because he's scared and then you go killing. Well, I mean, you want to live in a culture
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:49.920]  like that? I mean, do you really want to live in? I mean, I've talked to special forces
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:59.280]  people about where they were in Afghanistan. Those were Navy SEALs and this guy put gasoline
[3:24:59.280 --> 3:25:03.680]  on his son and daughter. One was like three, one was five and lit them on fire to put the
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:11.720]  call in. And when the helicopter landed, there was two helicopters. And of course, they'd
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:15.640]  land off the road thinking there could be an IED trying to lure them in. So you always
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:19.680]  land not in the best spot to land. You want to land in the worst spot or have guys repel
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:24.200]  down and they're getting these little burned little girls. But then they caught something
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:28.680]  was going on before he could detonate. They got it open. And I wasn't told what they did
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:33.280]  to him after that, but I'm not endorsing torture, but let's just say he did not die slowly.
[3:25:33.280 --> 3:25:37.120]  And it was because they were looking at these burned little kids, one of them lived, one
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:42.400]  of them died. But, but that's the type of stuff you deal with where you don't want to torture
[3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:48.880]  people and torture isn't good, but somebody has hurt little kids like this. And so you
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:53.480]  start torturing someone. And that's why the globalists want to put our men in war, because
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:57.480]  even if you're a good moral person, it will change you. I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:00.520]  I've been in over 200 fights. Most of them when I was younger, so they weren't that intense
[3:26:00.520 --> 3:26:05.280]  for probably 50, 60 or more really hardcore people going to the hospital fights. That
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:13.760]  has changed me. Just being in, in, in, in fights has, has made me where I'm, you know,
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:17.480]  have a, you know, just not even an appetite. It's like a place in my brain ready to get
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:22.160]  violent, ready to get violent, not afraid to get violent. And that's actually a weakness
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:26.320]  because somebody starts something with me. I got to really be humble and go, okay, okay,
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:30.280]  you're, yes, sir. I don't even smart. I'll go, yeah, you're a tough guy. I just go, listen,
[3:26:30.280 --> 3:26:37.520]  let us just go on our way. All right. Because I don't want to, you know, get in a fight.
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:41.040]  Because the problem is if the person's really a badass, people are going to probably, you
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:45.880]  know, come close to dying. Because then if they really start hurting me, you know, it's,
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:51.120]  it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's rock and roll time, as they say. And that's the problem
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:56.080]  with what this society has turned into, folks, is that real men need to protect innocence
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:26:59.600]  and they need to protect liberty. They don't need to run around acting like thugs, looking
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:03.840]  for a reason to hurt somebody because it's a notch on your belt. Let's talk to Pyro
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:06.120]  in California. Go ahead, Pyro, you're on the air.
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:10.600]  How are you doing, Alex? I'm pretty good. What do you think about all this is happening?
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:15.800]  I'm here from California. I don't live too far from Fullerton. That, that thing is just
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:21.200]  horrendous. And then those cops are nothing but thugs. I was a military police for eight
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:29.520]  years. I never hit anyone. I was never that aggressive. I was practically a people to
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:34.720]  me. I should have been a cop. I said, no way, not in the civilian world because it's, it's
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:39.800]  a different animal. They, they, they make the police departments these days make you
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:45.960]  want to be a thug and they hire thugs these days.
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:51.840]  Is it all the departments or the big ones? Mainly the big ones I've seen because I was
[3:27:51.840 --> 3:27:57.800]  going to try to apply for LAPD. I have a few friends that are in LAPD and they say it's,
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:02.640]  it's nothing like what we did in the, in the Marine Corps. In the Marine Corps when I was
[3:28:02.640 --> 3:28:11.240]  a military police, it was all, yeah, we had some problems, but it wasn't like too serious.
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:18.080]  But my main thing is, is how these cops have a much higher, they have a, they're bill of
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:25.480]  rights. They're so-called bill of rights that it should be all one, one right for everybody.
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:30.040]  And that, oh, because you have a badge, you have some other certain rights that you, you
[3:28:30.040 --> 3:28:36.160]  are above us. We, that was not in the military. That was no matter if you were an MP or a regular
[3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:39.240]  soldier or infantry. It was one right for everybody.
[3:28:39.240 --> 3:28:43.400]  And that's because if you've got a two tiered system, society breaks down.
[3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:44.400]  Exactly.
[3:28:44.400 --> 3:28:47.640]  You can't have a military that works and have a multi-level system.
[3:28:47.640 --> 3:28:54.160]  These cops are, these are cops should not, should never been even cops, especially those
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:28:59.320]  Ramos guys. I've seen guys like him, they, they do look for fights. I hope, I really
[3:28:59.320 --> 3:29:04.960]  hope his kids are proud of what he's done. It's ridiculous. And if these cops, I've,
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:11.680]  I was listening to Larry Elder yesterday, had to, his lawyer, Leo Terrell, who was tracking
[3:29:11.680 --> 3:29:16.920]  the whole case. He's saying, Leo Terrell said somewhere along the lines, these cops might
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:18.920]  even get their jobs back.
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:23.640]  Yeah, guys, call Larry Elder and let's get him on about this. Larry Elder's not supporting
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:24.640]  what happened, is he?
[3:29:24.640 --> 3:29:28.320]  Oh, no, no, no. He's not at all. He's not at all. But he was, he had this guy following
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:33.840]  the case, case by case. I was actually following the case through Larry Elder's broadcast.
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:37.000]  Very interesting. Listen, we'll get Larry Elder back on. That's a good idea. We're out
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:40.360]  of time. Nightly news tonight, seven o'clock with updates from Jakari and others on the
[3:29:40.360 --> 3:29:57.040]  West Coast on the radiation. Great job, the crew. Thanks. Thanks for all the callers.
