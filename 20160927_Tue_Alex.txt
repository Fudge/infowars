[00:00.000 --> 00:24.280]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.280 --> 00:30.280]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.280 --> 00:52.560]  technocracy tanker. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:52.560 --> 00:59.360]  It's only 41 days now until the incredibly historic epic election. I'm your host Alex
[00:59.360 --> 01:06.280]  Jones. We're live on this Tuesday, the 27th day of September 2016. Paul Watson hosts the
[01:06.280 --> 01:12.080]  fourth hour today. We don't have any guest. I might have wanted to pop in, but no guest
[01:12.080 --> 01:15.720]  right now because I want to get to a lot of the clips. Obviously, from the debate last
[01:15.720 --> 01:20.880]  night, I want to take your phone calls. I normally don't have any problem telling people
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.640]  what I think about something. But what happened last night was such a bizarre train wreck on
[01:27.640 --> 01:34.920]  so many levels that I've really had to cogitate on the subject deeply. Overall, Trump won
[01:34.920 --> 01:46.320]  the debate just by sheer moral weight, gravitational weight. The whole thing obviously was rigged.
[01:46.320 --> 01:53.440]  You have Holt, who I thought would be a lot fair. I mean, I was wrong saying I think he'll
[01:53.440 --> 01:59.960]  be more fair than what we saw in earlier debates between the Republicans and the Democrat candidates.
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.240]  And boy, was I wrong. He ran off at the end like he was totally embarrassed. He didn't
[02:04.240 --> 02:11.640]  look like he enjoyed attacking Trump like some of the Fox News people have done during
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.200]  the Republican debates. Of course, Megan Kelly, who just looks like she wants to kill him
[02:15.200 --> 02:19.440]  or something. I mean, she just looks like she, she's scorned or something like she's
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.640]  in love with him, but hates him at the same time. You know, there's just such energy and
[02:24.640 --> 02:33.280]  venom and poison. I didn't see that from Holt. And I don't normally see that when he reports.
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.520]  That's why he doesn't really come off as super arrogant and hateful, just, just confident.
[02:38.520 --> 02:44.520]  And that made it even worse. I can't stand him now. It was horrible. It was so rigged.
[02:44.520 --> 02:51.680]  But in their attempt to rig everything, that's what blew up in their face. And why every
[02:51.680 --> 02:57.240]  poll out there, and we've got like 10 of them here, scientific polls, you name it, on democratic
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.480]  party platforms, you name it, liberal platforms, like, like Time Magazine, MSNBC, you name
[03:02.480 --> 03:12.080]  it, saying Donald Trump won massively. Michael Moore says he won massively except CNN. They
[03:12.080 --> 03:19.080]  have a winning by 60 plus percent. When in every other poll, he was winning by 10 to
[03:19.080 --> 03:24.800]  15 points. And we're talking about polls with samples of over a million voters on Time Magazine,
[03:24.800 --> 03:33.120]  a million, six, uh, drudge, uh, massive numbers. I'll dig them out here in a moment, 87% for
[03:33.120 --> 03:42.480]  Trump. Hillary, if you remember in Democrat debates was way behind Sanders, but it didn't
[03:42.480 --> 03:51.280]  matter because she just stole the election. So we got CNBC has her at 33% Trump at 67
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.320]  with 994,000 votes. Boy, we should have put out a poll last night. We were just so busy
[03:57.320 --> 04:03.480]  to think of it. We should put a poll up ourselves. What do you think? Who do you think won the
[04:03.480 --> 04:10.760]  debate? And then have another poll, um, asking, was it a fair debate? Was it tipped towards
[04:10.760 --> 04:15.680]  Trump or was it tipped towards Hillary? And of course, we'll, we'll, we'll see what the
[04:15.680 --> 04:22.400]  listeners and folks have to say about that. But I would imagine if you pulled Democrats,
[04:22.400 --> 04:25.040]  they would have to admit, in fact, I see a lot of them in the press going yet kind of
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.600]  was stacked against Trump. I mean, there's got to be some level of basic fairness in
[04:29.600 --> 04:35.720]  people when you're watching everything rigged against Trump, everything rigged against
[04:35.720 --> 04:42.880]  populism, everything always stacked against us and we continue to win. And I think that
[04:42.880 --> 04:46.000]  this is really blown up in their face. I mean, I really, really have been thinking about
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.160]  it hard. Last night, I kind of felt like he didn't come out hard enough and was a little
[04:49.160 --> 04:53.800]  bit disappointed. But I got to tell you, I slept on it and I really thought about it.
[04:53.800 --> 04:59.240]  I think this was a big victory because it was so staged against him.
[04:59.240 --> 05:03.280]  Russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in Syria. As long as the Obama administration
[05:03.280 --> 05:07.120]  keeps sending weapons to the ISIS linked out in those front, Russian government said the
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.760]  militants are armed by tanks, APCs, filled our chillerate, multiple rocket launchers
[05:11.760 --> 05:15.480]  and heavy weaponry. And of course, they could have made these weapons themselves, nor could
[05:15.480 --> 05:19.040]  they have stolen all of them from the Syrian army, especially not the American made Tomas
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.280]  hold that jihadis used to destroy a Russian helicopter last year. The Russians also pointed
[05:23.280 --> 05:27.720]  out that the US led airstrike that killed 62 Syrian soldiers has directly led to ISIS
[05:27.720 --> 05:30.720]  gaining ground. In other words, the US just served as ISIS's
[05:30.720 --> 05:35.160]  air force. The US State Department has claimed the attack was an accident. However, facts
[05:35.160 --> 05:38.560]  point to the contrary. The region where the attack occurred has always been under Syrian
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.200]  army control with no prior presence of ISIS. CENTCOM even had the audacity to release a
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.320]  statement claiming they have not bombed the area in the past. But that's completely false.
[05:47.320 --> 05:51.520]  Unless they were targeting the Syrian government. Stay tuned for more reports and download our

[07:53.680 --> 08:19.680]  going on instead of being spoon fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:19.680 --> 08:40.800]  Wow. What a debate last night. What a staged event. I am rarely wrong. But I thought that
[08:40.800 --> 08:47.320]  Lester Holt would be more fair. It was one of the most unfair debates I've ever seen
[08:47.320 --> 08:57.600]  where he became the third debater. It was two against one last night. I'm really ashamed
[08:57.600 --> 09:04.280]  of Lester Holt. I'm really ashamed of NBC. But that's why the establishment is in so
[09:04.280 --> 09:10.280]  much trouble right now. They're in all this trouble because they're rigging the system
[09:10.280 --> 09:15.840]  in front of everyone and the general public is not in the dark like they were decades
[09:15.840 --> 09:21.240]  ago. They're aware of the rigging and they're getting more informed about the rigging every
[09:21.240 --> 09:28.800]  single day. But it's so transparent. We're going to walk through in this hour. The poll
[09:28.800 --> 09:38.680]  numbers across the spectrum trump one by 10 to 15 points in scientific polls in mass polls.
[09:38.680 --> 09:46.240]  You name it, every different type of poll, unscientific, scientific, internet, crowdsourced, you name it.
[09:46.240 --> 09:49.840]  When you had big samples of hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and depending on the
[09:49.840 --> 10:00.400]  poll we're going to go over, he was 10 to 15 to 20 in some cases, 20 points ahead. Except
[10:00.400 --> 10:10.840]  for one poll, CNN took phone calls, 500 and something of them. And then out of that sample,
[10:10.840 --> 10:18.240]  it's very easy to rig a small sample. Why Hillary won by a huge margin. So the rigging
[10:18.240 --> 10:25.800]  of the Clinton News Network just continues. And there's an article that's up on infowars.com
[10:25.800 --> 10:34.360]  that is extremely important, that gets into the fact that that was a rigged debate, rigged
[10:34.360 --> 10:44.120]  CNN poll claiming Hillary won the debate, sampled 41% Democrats compared to 26% Republicans.
[10:44.120 --> 10:50.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the insanity of how dumb they think you are. Reuters does
[10:50.680 --> 10:56.040]  this where they sample 15%, 10% of people on the poll, more Democrats to then give her
[10:56.040 --> 11:01.480]  a 10%, 15% lead. It's just clear, cut and dry fraud, but they put it three or four or
[11:01.480 --> 11:09.560]  five pages down depending on the methodology at the bottom. They tell you, oh well, this
[11:09.560 --> 11:16.740]  person won the race across the English Channel swimming, but this person wasn't wearing
[11:16.740 --> 11:21.160]  lead weights around their ankles like the person they beat. But it says at the bottom,
[11:21.160 --> 11:25.160]  the person they beat who normally would beat this other individual was wearing 50 pounds
[11:25.160 --> 11:33.920]  of lead weights. Or it's like saying, this horse won the Kentucky Derby, but we gave
[11:33.920 --> 11:45.000]  it a head start of 500 yards. But they tell you in fine print that they gave the horse
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.080]  a head start. Now no one would put up with that because you're at the Kentucky Derby,
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.840]  everybody's wearing their silly hats, you know, the Queen of England's there. It's all
[11:52.840 --> 11:56.960]  this big to do and the gates open and outrun the horses. But imagine if they let a horse
[11:56.960 --> 12:02.840]  get, you know, let's say a quarter way around the track running before the other horses
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.360]  were allowed out. Well, you know, if that horse is even half decent, it's going to win. This
[12:07.360 --> 12:18.120]  is the naked brazen, high noon fraud. And I've got stacks of it. And we've got Holt going
[12:18.120 --> 12:30.160]  after Trump 41 times interrupting him and only doing it seven times with Hillary. And
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.640]  then his quote fact checking of her wasn't fact checking. It was basically supporting
[12:35.640 --> 12:46.200]  her. He asked her one tough question. Trump 41 times. So I thought that they'd be smart
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.880]  and try to at least look fair, but they are so arrogant that they obviously told Holt
[12:50.880 --> 12:57.840]  go after him with both barrels and Holt then Lester Holt, discredited, disgraced Holt ran
[12:57.840 --> 13:06.240]  off like a rat out of an aqueduct like a wet rat. He just shot out of there running off
[13:06.240 --> 13:17.280]  after he'd engaged in his Judas Aaron. Wow. I was talking to one of our producers, Zach
[13:17.280 --> 13:21.680]  in there this morning, he really just in like two minutes was showing me all these articles.
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.720]  And I was already aware of most of it was the way he laid it out, just shaking his head
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.880]  and then going over the methodology where it isn't enough that they have all their little
[13:30.880 --> 13:38.400]  sweetheart, you know, Democrats that they call for this poll, they then admit they sampled
[13:38.400 --> 13:49.880]  almost double. I mean, you think Reuters is bad adding 15% more Democrats in their polls.
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.840]  When they got caught doing that, they went, Oh, we'll just do 10% or 5% or oh, but then
[13:53.840 --> 14:00.680]  they got caught like Bloomberg with the quote independence, 20% of our poll are independence.
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.680]  It turns out they're not independence. They're almost all Democrats or Green Party people
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.080]  that go, Oh, well, actually, I don't like Donald Trump. It's shameful. And now there's
[14:09.080 --> 14:15.160]  articles out where hundreds to one big money is giving money to Hillary. Now we already
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.360]  know that, but just let's not sink in. And I say this to Bernie supporters and they almost
[14:19.360 --> 14:23.760]  all go, I don't care. I still can't vote for Trump, but I don't like Hillary. I don't know
[14:23.760 --> 14:28.920]  what to do. And I go, do you understand you say you're against big money and big money
[14:28.920 --> 14:34.760]  worldwide is illegally coming in against Trump and they're just letting them do it at the
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.520]  Justice Department that is so incredibly criminal. And they're running around when Trump talks
[14:40.520 --> 14:45.480]  about, Hey, if Hillary doesn't want you to have bodyguards, then how about she doesn't
[14:45.480 --> 14:49.360]  have bodyguards like, Hey, Hollywood folks have bodyguards, but they don't want you to
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.600]  have bodyguards, your own bodyguard. And then they call that a threat by Trump. And there's
[14:53.600 --> 14:59.320]  articles all the time, you know, that Alex Jones wants violence against Hillary. I was
[14:59.320 --> 15:05.660]  talking to one of our Pentagon friends today and he was saying that there was a Justice
[15:05.660 --> 15:14.240]  Department investigation of yours truly going on because I had a security analyst here just
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.200]  doing security stuff on the building. And we got into my gun safes, just looked at some
[15:18.200 --> 15:23.120]  of them, had some fun, talked about going out shooting, didn't have time. And one of
[15:23.120 --> 15:26.120]  the folks in here is about a third of the tweets are mine. The rest of you are cruising
[15:26.120 --> 15:29.240]  on news alerts and things. I said, Yeah, you know, show us, you know, get these rivals
[15:29.240 --> 15:34.640]  out quote for our security. And if Hillary come out and called me dark heart and all
[15:34.640 --> 15:38.280]  this, so I don't think Hillary would actually come after me, but her minions could some
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.240]  crazy person, one of her followers. So we made the joke. Yeah, after Hillary, you know, basically
[15:43.240 --> 15:49.040]  put out this threat, we've had up our security, a whole investigation. I'm very honored about
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.920]  what we're doing over here. And are we setting up a paramilitary base? And I've already heard
[15:53.920 --> 16:02.000]  this months ago before I put that tweet out before the crew did. This is the woman that
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  invades Libya. She came, she saw he died. They killed hundreds of thousands of Christians
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.080]  in Syria. They're involved in all these crimes. And then they want to project that Donald
[16:10.080 --> 16:13.960]  Trump wants violence or that Rush Limbaugh was behind the Oklahoma city bombing. Remember
[16:13.960 --> 16:17.640]  that within 25 minutes of it happening. Talk radio was the blame. The alt right. We're
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.320]  violent. We want violence. And that's what all Watson keeps predicting. And he's so smart.
[16:22.320 --> 16:25.640]  He believes they're going to stage a false flag against Hillary or her supporters or
[16:25.640 --> 16:31.880]  a mass killing that is in blame and liberty movement. And I think clearly they can even
[16:31.880 --> 16:34.800]  try to set us up. I think they're looking at who they want to set up. They're looking
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.040]  at who they want to connect it to. And we're way out ahead of that. And so let me explain
[16:39.040 --> 16:48.000]  what our weapons are. Our weapons are cameras and keyboards and search engines and research
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.760]  and our guests and our listeners and our will to be free Americans and to try to restore
[16:52.760 --> 16:58.280]  this Republic and make it great again. We're the ones trying to stop George Soros starting
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.640]  a civil war. We're the ones trying to stop foreign funding and Ford Foundation funding
[17:02.640 --> 17:08.400]  and the hundreds of millions every few months. This mainstream news to foment race war and
[17:08.400 --> 17:14.960]  to start a civil war against local governments meant to wipe out the police, basically. That's
[17:14.960 --> 17:22.360]  who runs the Justice Department. The ideological godmother of Black Lives Matter is in Cuba
[17:22.360 --> 17:26.160]  for killing a police officer. This is what Loretta Lynch, these people are all into.
[17:26.160 --> 17:31.040]  They're a bunch of paranoid, crazy leftist that probably actually think we're here building
[17:31.040 --> 17:36.960]  an army. When they're the ones building the armies and have people out saying kill cops
[17:36.960 --> 17:40.760]  and then the cops are getting killed and then the cops are scared to go into the neighborhoods
[17:40.760 --> 17:47.040]  so the crime rates basically doubled in many Black cities in just two years. Chicago is
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.080]  more than double the violent crime. It's hell on earth. You people are killing yourselves.
[17:52.080 --> 17:58.280]  The globalists are killing their own Democrat cities. It's so sad. And then they want to
[17:58.280 --> 18:05.160]  project that we're here, a major media operation with all of Hillary's crazy followers and
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.600]  the Mexican mafia threatening Trump and threatening everybody else for that matter. And we say,
[18:09.600 --> 18:17.200]  oh yeah, we're up on our security. And then they turn that into an entire spin machine.
[18:17.200 --> 18:21.480]  That's just what I'm getting at here is they sit there with a straight face. We played
[18:21.480 --> 18:28.120]  this last week and asked the vice presidential candidate for the Republicans, the nominee,
[18:28.120 --> 18:33.000]  Mr. Pence, Governor Pence, is Donald Trump calling for violence or are you planning violence?
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  He's like, what? We're obviously saying she has taxpayer paid for bodyguards. She shouldn't
[18:38.000 --> 18:48.000]  take the American people's guns. And she said last night, she said last night that she wants
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.800]  extrajudicial, no due process, put you on a no gun buy list, just put you on it whenever
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.880]  they feel like it, outside of law. And you better believe they'd love to put me on that
[18:57.880 --> 19:05.880]  wait list and say I can't protect myself from the armies of criminals that support the Democratic
[19:05.880 --> 19:14.480]  Party. The Chinese Communist, the Saudi Arabians, there's articles about the big Mexican drug
[19:14.480 --> 19:19.960]  cartels are flooding money into Hillary's campaign through big banks because these criminal
[19:19.960 --> 19:24.320]  operations, no Donald Trump means business folks, we're going to skip this network break.
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.160]  They're going to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders and they're going to stage
[19:28.160 --> 19:35.520]  polls and they're going to have Holt interrupt Trump 40 plus times and Hillary seven. Don't
[19:35.520 --> 19:41.400]  you know they're going to go for broke. There was the miracle, as Drudge calls it last night,
[19:41.400 --> 19:48.160]  medical miracle. She stands for 90 minutes. She looked sick. She looked haggard. She looked
[19:48.160 --> 19:53.360]  wounded. I almost felt sorry for her, but she's such a vampire, but she looked better
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.400]  than she did a few weeks ago. Whenever Trump calls her secretary of state tries to be nice
[19:57.400 --> 20:04.440]  to her, he says, is that okay? And then she's sexy smiles at him like, oh, you're my friend.
[20:04.440 --> 20:11.160]  Oh, thank you. And it was the first time I've seen Hillary Clinton ever look genuine. We're
[20:11.160 --> 20:13.920]  going to find that clip. It's early in the debate. We're going to play that a little
[20:13.920 --> 20:19.600]  bit later. Oh, you already have it. Okay, we'll play it in a moment. I'm going to get back
[20:19.600 --> 20:24.720]  into the rigging and actually go over the numbers. And it was the first time I've seen Hillary
[20:24.720 --> 20:31.240]  look genuine. And it actually hurt me for a minute because I don't like hating people.
[20:31.240 --> 20:35.840]  I don't like going after people. I don't like going after dangerous kingpins like her, but
[20:35.840 --> 20:40.520]  I have to. And I know she's got a horrible history, but I and Ailey as a man don't like
[20:40.520 --> 20:47.240]  to be mean to women and they play on that. They played on that with Trump. And so almost
[20:47.240 --> 20:50.240]  they're having guilt saying all these bad things about her when she's acting human for
[20:50.240 --> 20:56.520]  just one moment. And boy, Trump by the end goes, you suckered me in. I came in here and
[20:56.520 --> 21:03.960]  I really hit above the belt and you didn't. And she had these little evil looks in her
[21:03.960 --> 21:09.720]  eyes like absolutely I fooled you. I betrayed you. That's what they're all about people.
[21:09.720 --> 21:18.160]  That's their spirit. Why would Madeline Albright, saved by the Serbs in World War II when she
[21:18.160 --> 21:23.800]  was a teenager, go out of her way repeatedly to bomb Belgrade and attack the Serbs and
[21:23.800 --> 21:27.920]  bring Muslims in and frame them and set them up and have the media demonize them when,
[21:27.920 --> 21:33.800]  when the Serbs folks were clearly the good guys overall, they didn't start the wars.
[21:33.800 --> 21:37.920]  It was their area. Historically, they did some atrocities, but the UN admitted double the
[21:37.920 --> 21:46.120]  atrocities by the Muslims. And her father was a rich Jew that swindled Jews and stole
[21:46.120 --> 21:49.880]  Jews goods, claiming he'd get them out of the country, basically a George Soros. This
[21:49.880 --> 21:53.520]  is on record. There have been 60 minute shows about this where they have like, you know,
[21:53.520 --> 21:58.520]  multi-million dollar stolen art in her house in Georgetown. And the Serbs were on TV saying
[21:58.520 --> 22:03.240]  why you lived here for years during World War II. We saved you. The Germans invaded
[22:03.240 --> 22:09.640]  you. We hid you. Why are you doing? Why do you go out of your way to do this to us?
[22:09.640 --> 22:15.120]  Because she's a demon, people. And that's what they're all about is betrayal. You have
[22:15.120 --> 22:20.360]  to understand them. Betrayal is the name of their game. They want to serve evil. They're
[22:20.360 --> 22:27.080]  evil. I don't say that to demonize them. It's true. They're all about sucking us in. They're
[22:27.080 --> 22:33.320]  all about conning us. And everybody knows in the establishment, Trump's for real, folks.
[22:33.320 --> 22:37.520]  He's not perfect, but he's for real. He wants prosperity and the system can't stand it.
[22:37.520 --> 22:42.480]  So we do have that clip of Hillary. I mean, I couldn't believe it. She turned it on. And
[22:42.480 --> 22:46.320]  I remember thinking for a minute, you know, she's called Trump her husband repeatedly.
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.120]  And I know that she likes powerful men and controlling them. And so obviously he's very
[22:50.120 --> 22:56.040]  attractive to her. You know, she's reportedly bisexual. And so I think maybe it was genuine
[22:56.040 --> 23:02.040]  in that her femininity allowed her to have some shred of human connection that wasn't
[23:02.040 --> 23:06.320]  a evil robot, because the woman is a robot. Even the Democrats can't stand her enter in
[23:06.320 --> 23:10.520]  panic mode. I mean, the woman is becoming more robotic by the day, more reptilian. And
[23:10.520 --> 23:16.880]  I don't mean literally reptilian. So let's go ahead and play that club.
[23:16.880 --> 23:23.200]  Secretary Clinton, I guess, is that okay? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important
[23:23.200 --> 23:29.960]  to me. Now, that clip is from a different mainstream news feed. The one I saw was from
[23:29.960 --> 23:35.160]  the feed we had, and it was straight onto her face. And it was even more genuine. I was
[23:35.160 --> 23:41.160]  actually had like a, that feeling when you drive over a hill and you know, your stomach
[23:41.160 --> 23:45.560]  drops kind of go, is that a good feeling or a bad feeling? Well, I just saw humanity
[23:45.560 --> 23:52.480]  out of Hillary Clinton. Wow, that was amazing. Now that said, I want to get back into fraud.
[23:52.480 --> 24:04.040]  And you just tuned in. The unprecedented rigging, CNN putting out a fake poll admittedly. We're
[24:04.040 --> 24:07.840]  going to show you the methodology from their own website a moment. All the other polls
[24:07.840 --> 24:15.440]  saying the opposite. Lester Holt hitting him 40 plus times with interruptions and attacking
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.080]  him and misrepresenting and then just saying Trump was wrong and that Trump wasn't telling
[24:20.080 --> 24:29.240]  the truth on a whole bunch of subjects that Trump was absolutely right on. I mean, my
[24:29.240 --> 24:33.000]  head was spinning. And when I say spinning, I mean, last night, everything coming out
[24:33.000 --> 24:42.120]  of her mouth was a lie. And the TPP, she says she's not for the TPP. She was the main. We've
[24:42.120 --> 24:47.600]  played the clips. We ought to find those today. We've got a TPP report on her where Hillary
[24:47.600 --> 24:51.240]  Clinton gets up and says, I've been negotiating for years on this and have been spearheading,
[24:51.240 --> 24:55.040]  getting it done. It's the most important thing ever. And I'm the most proud of this in my
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.480]  government service. I mean, she's one of the main lawyers and a secretary of state, one
[25:00.480 --> 25:07.880]  of the main people negotiating that and was who Obama would send to negotiate it. I mean,
[25:07.880 --> 25:14.920]  she is one of the main authors. Remember, she called it the gold standard and called
[25:14.920 --> 25:21.080]  it her work. Now, that's from the LA Times. We can play the clips, but that's what I mean.
[25:21.080 --> 25:25.440]  It was otherworldly. The only time she told the truth was the fact that she wants to take
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.760]  your guns with no due process, which is just the end of the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth
[25:30.760 --> 25:40.320]  Amendment, the end of right to juries, right to habeas corpus. I mean, it's head spinning.
[25:40.320 --> 25:46.080]  First, let's get into the polls. Rigg CNN poll claiming Hillary won the debate, sampled
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.440]  41% Democrats compared to 26% Republicans. This is Paul Joseph Watson. We need to get
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.560]  this article out everywhere, folks. This is so important, but then it gets worse. Let's
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.800]  walk through all of this. Jack, one of the producers, uh, Jack, break it down.
[26:00.800 --> 26:07.800]  All right, Alex. So I was on drugs this morning. I printed out my articles as always, and there
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.640]  was two polls on there from Time Magazine and CNBC showing a clear lead in Trump polling
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.920]  that he won the debate. So then I wanted to see both sides of the equation. I just went
[26:17.920 --> 26:24.640]  on CNN and, of course, you see the post, uh, debate polls saying that Hillary Clinton was
[26:24.640 --> 26:31.840]  the winner. So I was interested in how they gathered the information on the debate polling.
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.200]  So I scroll down and if you go all the way to the bottom of this article, you find out
[26:36.200 --> 26:43.160]  that there is a phone poll that they had. Prescreen callers called 521 people saw asked
[26:43.160 --> 26:49.760]  them if they wanted to, uh, be a part of the poll debate, uh, the debate polling. Sorry.
[26:49.760 --> 26:54.160]  Um, after the fact, so they called them after the debate was done and asked them a handful
[26:54.160 --> 27:01.080]  of questions. And of course, Paul has already unveiled that 41% of those people were Democrats.
[27:01.080 --> 27:07.120]  And in comparison to all the other polls that I've found is a huge difference in numbers.
[27:07.120 --> 27:12.640]  Now if you jump to CNBC, um, you'll see that it's a completely different story. We're
[27:12.640 --> 27:17.440]  going to get to that in a moment, but let's be clear here. They did 41% self-identified
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.400]  Democrats. Then they called them back. Okay. So they call under the debate. They call them
[27:22.400 --> 27:26.760]  back to hand rig this thing with a little Democrat interns and they're literally writing
[27:26.760 --> 27:29.920]  the show, CNN getting their daily talking points from Hillary. That's come out in the
[27:29.920 --> 27:41.200]  emails, 41% were Democrats, 26% Republicans. That is almost double more Democrats than
[27:41.200 --> 27:48.360]  it is Republicans. That is sin, stationally naked. That is in your face. Now let's look
[27:48.360 --> 27:55.760]  at the other polls that didn't have 500, but that had over a million. Let's go to those.
[27:55.760 --> 28:01.280]  Okay. Uh, so first we have the CNBC. If you see here, you scroll down a little bit. You
[28:01.280 --> 28:09.760]  see it's a 33% in favor of Hillary and it's 325,000 votes. And then you see Donald Trump
[28:09.760 --> 28:17.040]  is pushing 67 at 669,000 votes. Uh, remember, Republicans are statistically supposedly
[28:17.040 --> 28:23.360]  older, less tech savvy, but the more tech savvy you are now in big countries that and
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.400]  companies that aggregate numbers are freaking out. Google and others are saying no. And
[28:27.400 --> 28:29.800]  so is Facebook. That's why they're putting everything behind Hillary right now. They
[28:29.800 --> 28:34.640]  know she's really way behind. And another thing that I wanted to point out to, I read
[28:34.640 --> 28:39.920]  a wired article a long time ago, uh, about a, um, they were a, a small time company that's
[28:39.920 --> 28:46.120]  doing analytics called civis and they did a poll on, um, just phone calls in general.
[28:46.120 --> 28:52.560]  And they said that in the fractions of people are responding to these phone polls, which
[28:52.560 --> 28:58.920]  is why it's even more, um, unbelievable to me to see CNN pushing this as this is the
[28:58.920 --> 28:59.920]  narrative.
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.040]  Absolutely handpicked. They absolutely already have these, uh, vetted, uh, pools. They go
[29:04.040 --> 29:07.440]  to, let's show some of the other polls that you mentioned then. Let's, uh, you were getting
[29:07.440 --> 29:08.440]  to another one.
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.640]  Uh, yes. Fox news. Um, they don't show their numbers, but they show the 50% lead, of course,
[29:13.640 --> 29:19.280]  uh, to favor Hill, uh, Trump as well. If you scroll down, you see, you could vote 50%
[29:19.280 --> 29:22.520]  Donald Trump 34 for Hillary. And it's the same thing when you go to basically, you
[29:22.520 --> 29:28.280]  see every other major polling area. And, and time magazine once again was another one.
[29:28.280 --> 29:33.520]  Uh, that's 1.69 million. Yeah. Uh, voting and we'll show those numbers. He again has
[29:33.520 --> 29:39.000]  a huge lead there. Let's scroll down to that, uh, and show the TV viewers 55% Donald Trump,
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.240]  45% Hillary. So all the big polls show the same thing, which is why, you know, it's accurate,
[29:44.240 --> 29:47.440]  but not CNN because they're living in La La Land. Thank you, Zach. We'll be back with
[29:47.440 --> 29:48.440]  more.
[29:48.440 --> 29:59.600]  On March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, Joe banks here
[29:59.600 --> 30:06.440]  with info wars.com. And this is an email from family Gino. I took down my rebel flag,
[30:06.440 --> 30:11.480]  which you can't buy on eBay anymore and peeled the NRA sticker off my rear car window. I
[30:11.480 --> 30:16.360]  disconnected my home alarm system and quit the Kandy ass neighborhood watch. I bought
[30:16.360 --> 30:20.920]  two pack of Sandy flags and put one at each corner of the front yard. Then I purchased
[30:20.920 --> 30:26.160]  a black flag of ISIS, which you can buy on eBay and ran it up the flagpole. Now the local
[30:26.160 --> 30:31.920]  police, sheriff, FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security and other agencies are all watching
[30:31.920 --> 30:38.840]  my house 24 seven. I've never felt safer and I'm saving 69.95 a month that ADT use to
[30:38.840 --> 30:43.440]  charge me. Plus I bought burkas for my wife and I to wear when we shop or travel. Everyone
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.560]  moves out of the way and security can't pat us down. If they say I'm a male wearing a
[30:47.560 --> 30:53.360]  burka, I just say I'm feeling like a woman today. Hot damn safe at last in America. Great.
[30:53.360 --> 30:58.920]  You can find more reports like this info wars.com. This is Joe big.
[30:58.920 --> 31:04.520]  Rain force. It's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob do joins us. You worked,
[31:04.520 --> 31:08.960]  I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force get. I've been working all day. I took
[31:08.960 --> 31:14.640]  a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of run down.
[31:14.640 --> 31:17.400]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good
[31:17.400 --> 31:21.720]  job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. Pop two of them and about
[31:21.720 --> 31:27.240]  20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up. Got four and a half stars.
[31:27.240 --> 31:31.680]  People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party. Nutraceutical sites give
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.840]  it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will
[31:36.840 --> 31:40.680]  blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably
[31:40.680 --> 31:44.840]  could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this morning, took
[31:44.840 --> 31:49.360]  three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find a brain
[31:49.360 --> 31:56.680]  force and other game changing products at info wars life.com or call 8 8 8 2 5 3 3 1

[31:57.680 --> 32:02.200]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[32:02.200 --> 32:06.920]  is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[32:06.920 --> 32:12.280]  scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[32:12.280 --> 32:17.840]  water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[32:17.840 --> 32:22.440]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[32:22.440 --> 32:28.640]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:28.640 --> 32:32.360]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that
[32:32.360 --> 32:36.080]  are in it. You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic worm
[32:36.080 --> 32:40.560]  wood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm
[32:40.560 --> 32:44.320]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[32:44.320 --> 32:48.160]  Living defense info wars life.com and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[32:48.160 --> 32:53.880]  for your body period. And you support the broadcast info wars lives.com. Thank you doctor group
[32:53.880 --> 32:56.960]  from the global healing center. Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great
[32:56.960 --> 33:21.280]  product in Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. All right, I want to get
[33:21.280 --> 33:27.280]  some of the debate clips themselves here in a moment. Also want to open the phones up.
[33:27.280 --> 33:32.080]  You can call in with your take on this and I want to be specific. If you disagree with
[33:32.080 --> 33:39.160]  me about the debate, you will go to the head of the line. That's a rule I have that if
[33:39.160 --> 33:47.040]  you disagree, I will do my best to get to you first. Now I kind of have an old rule that
[33:47.040 --> 33:52.440]  he's calling from really far away in the world. I'll try to go to that caller, uh, even ahead
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.520]  of somebody that disagrees. But I'd like to really hear from Bernie Sanders supporters
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.040]  that have been calling in. I want them called in yesterday. She was a nice lady and she
[34:00.040 --> 34:03.480]  said, well, you know, we were Bernie Sanders supporters, but we can't support Trump or
[34:03.480 --> 34:08.040]  Hillary where we're really concerned. And I was like, lady, all the big money is against
[34:08.040 --> 34:13.520]  Trump, all the big globalist. You understand that? And she just didn't even listen to me
[34:13.520 --> 34:20.560]  and everybody I talked to that says that they basically try to talk to the Sanders supporters.
[34:20.560 --> 34:28.360]  They get the same brick wall where you're talking common sense to them, but they just
[34:28.360 --> 34:33.560]  can't hear it because they're stuck on Donald Trump's a racist and I can't vote for a racist
[34:33.560 --> 34:38.120]  because their whole identity is about their good and they're not racist. That's their
[34:38.120 --> 34:46.360]  possession is being obsessed with race, which is the essence of being a racist. What's taught
[34:46.360 --> 34:50.240]  in this culture is the opposite of what Martin Luther King said. And a lot of right wingers
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.840]  didn't like Martin Luther King. So I get criticism. I was a communist and all this other stuff.
[34:54.840 --> 34:59.240]  Yeah. He did speak at events that were communist affiliated. He was also a registered Republican.
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.680]  I mean, give me a break. It's like saying I've been on Russian TV. I work for the Russians.
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.320]  But then you've got the left now that's totally abandoned Martin Luther King, which Martin
[35:09.320 --> 35:15.640]  Luther King I've read his writings. I've watched his speeches, not just I have a dream stuff.
[35:15.640 --> 35:25.840]  He was a really focused, well spoken, common sense, smart person that was promoting unity,
[35:25.840 --> 35:29.360]  which is the opposite of what the Democratic Party promotes. And she basically said in
[35:29.360 --> 35:37.000]  one of her clips, we've got that everyone is implicitly racist. And I've got to say
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.040]  that a whole new generation of people were not being brought up like that. But that's
[35:42.040 --> 35:47.440]  all been hijacked now by the multicultural Marxist and they are using race to control
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.640]  people just like the KKK did in the South. And it is shameful. I mean, I am really ashamed
[35:52.640 --> 35:56.720]  of Democrats and how far they've sunk. I've been a big critic of Republicans. Everybody
[35:56.720 --> 36:04.120]  knows that. This is a repudiation of the Republican establishment. They're freaking out. The foreign
[36:04.120 --> 36:08.680]  banks are freaking out. The big Democrat machine is freaking out. This is so obviously
[36:08.680 --> 36:14.800]  nationalism, sovereignty coming back and they have conditioned people that having sovereignty
[36:14.800 --> 36:23.440]  and having fair trade deals is racist. And that Donald Trump wants to screw brown people
[36:23.440 --> 36:29.000]  over because he wants to get more jobs in America. It is the death of logic, the death
[36:29.000 --> 36:37.880]  of common sense. So I've got a cornucopia of clips that I'm going to be getting to here
[36:37.880 --> 36:42.000]  trying to find my video list. It's got notes all over it. Well, somebody run me another
[36:42.000 --> 36:50.360]  video list in here. So I find it. Thank you. Yeah, we're going to get to the Clinton implicitly
[36:50.360 --> 36:55.880]  racist clip. Then we're going to play a bunch of other clips dealing with Trump saying, you
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.960]  know, why he's glad that he didn't basically go below the belt that Hillary did. And I
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.840]  want to give you my take on what really happened at the debate, but also take your phone calls.

[38:57.240 --> 39:06.600]  times a day I take my new probiotic biome defense. I pause because I'm looking for my
[39:06.600 --> 39:11.400]  bottle of it. I had one. I guess we did have a bunch of folks here last night. No, I know
[39:11.400 --> 39:14.480]  it's down to our floor. I had two bottles of it. Here's one that was open. People move
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.240]  this around. Sorry. Teleprompter free folks, because I was going to take some time out
[39:18.240 --> 39:24.080]  to take this. This is seven years of the making, five years that we've been reaching out, but
[39:24.080 --> 39:30.440]  group was already developing it seven years ago. It's 23 unique high quality strains that
[39:30.440 --> 39:34.720]  are seen in the industry as the very best out there. These strains are very, very expensive
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.640]  just to get each one of the strains. And this is sent to you via a little refrigeration
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.080]  pack, a little cold pack. Now, if it gets heated up, it doesn't kill all of it, but
[39:45.080 --> 39:52.720]  it's obviously good to keep it at 65 degrees or lower, like in your refrigerator. And it's
[39:52.720 --> 39:59.440]  amazing. High powered infowars probiotics have arrived, 50 billion live active cultures,
[39:59.440 --> 40:07.560]  23 probiotic strains. And it is produced obviously in a refrigerated top lab here in the US and
[40:07.560 --> 40:11.760]  then it is shipped to us in a refrigeration truck. And we have a big refrigeration room
[40:11.760 --> 40:19.320]  that we have put in that now houses this biome defense probiotic. We're very, very proud
[40:19.320 --> 40:24.120]  of it. We could have easily just come out and private labeled one of hundreds of other
[40:24.120 --> 40:33.200]  probiotics that are out there. But they're just not as good. This is the very best over
[40:33.200 --> 40:38.080]  the top product. If you go to Whole Foods, they have some similar strains and similar
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.880]  Rolls Royce quality that are 100, 110, $120. You have some of you get from medical facilities
[40:43.880 --> 40:50.600]  that are 200, 300, $400. This is $68. And believe me, all the cost of refrigeration
[40:50.600 --> 40:56.680]  and the development, that is very inexpensive. This should be $100, $120. This is the very
[40:56.680 --> 41:01.960]  best for my research probiotic you're going to find anywhere. Now, obviously, consult
[41:01.960 --> 41:05.520]  your health care provider before you take it. This is all seen as completely safe. But
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.280]  I say consult your doctor before you breathe oxygen, before you drink water. And before
[41:11.280 --> 41:17.040]  you even look at the stars at night, you should consult with the Food and Drug Administration
[41:17.040 --> 41:23.920]  before you walk, before you talk, before you brush your teeth. They are God. But so be
[41:23.920 --> 41:30.360]  sure and consult your health care professional. So that's probiotic, biome, defense, infowars,

[41:38.360 --> 41:41.080]  the operation. I want to thank you all for your support. And let me say something about
[41:41.080 --> 41:46.040]  that about the debate before I go any further. I was up here on air for three and a half
[41:46.040 --> 41:51.360]  hours yesterday. I hosted half of the fourth hour. And then I got prepared for the debate.
[41:51.360 --> 41:55.880]  And then I came up here and I hosted basically five hours. Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[41:55.880 --> 41:59.600]  And some of my points were excellent. Some of my other points were okay because I get
[41:59.600 --> 42:06.640]  pretty tired by midnight when I've been up since 6am. But the crew, I was watching Fox,
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.280]  watching CNN in their pre and post debate when I was taking breaks. They were having
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.640]  audio problems. Couldn't go to half their guests. Stuff was cutting out. Their host
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.880]  sounded completely wooden and boring. And you could tell they were all following talking
[42:21.880 --> 42:27.920]  points. And then I was sitting here watching my crew, going to different studios, going
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.760]  to our reporters in New York, going to our reporters on the ground in Austin, and all
[42:31.760 --> 42:39.080]  the things that were happening and how real it was. I was so proud of the crew. I am so
[42:39.080 --> 42:48.520]  proud of the producers, the researchers, the camera people. Everyone here is truly amazing.
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.920]  And it brought me to tears last night. I mean, not like sobbing, but like tears when you
[42:53.920 --> 43:00.480]  see a beautiful sunset or tears when your wife has a new baby. I mean, just the fact
[43:00.480 --> 43:07.040]  that info wars really is special. And that's why I can't stand it when people call in and
[43:07.040 --> 43:13.720]  thank me for what I've done because I'm kind of the crazy 800 pound gorilla here, popping
[43:13.720 --> 43:18.720]  up and down to get people out of their mind numb stupor. But it's the rest of the researchers,
[43:18.720 --> 43:24.640]  the crew and the entire family of guests and reporters and people we have on that is info
[43:24.640 --> 43:34.240]  wars. You are the info war. We are the info war. And quite frankly, I am extremely humble.
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.240]  Why your support by your prayers and instead of getting on a power trip over all this,
[43:39.240 --> 43:48.640]  I am I want to say weighed down by conscience, by responsibility and by humility. I want
[43:48.640 --> 43:52.960]  to be clear because it's embarrassing. Sometimes I come off like a very aggressive, angry, arrogant
[43:52.960 --> 43:57.600]  person. And that's not because I'm arrogant. I'm the opposite, but it's because this is
[43:57.600 --> 44:02.680]  so serious. And I have to get hyped up to do this. I'm normally a pretty calm person
[44:02.680 --> 44:06.680]  at home and in my general life, I'm a pretty private person. I don't want to say solitary,
[44:06.680 --> 44:13.800]  but I'm a very private person. And I do this because I understand we're facing evil. And
[44:13.800 --> 44:21.400]  I understand it's dangerous too. So this is necessity, what we're doing, this is survival.
[44:21.400 --> 44:28.360]  This isn't something you thank me for. Okay, I'm trying to save myself by saving you understand
[44:28.360 --> 44:32.580]  that I'm not saying it's even selfishness, but, but people who think it's heroic to fight
[44:32.580 --> 44:39.160]  tyranny, you have to get outside that paradigm understand it's not heroic to pull air into
[44:39.160 --> 44:46.400]  your lungs. It's not work. It's, it's life. It's not heroic to do the right thing. It's,
[44:46.400 --> 44:55.080]  it's what we've got to do. This is history happening. And Donald Trump, I've gone from
[44:55.080 --> 45:00.760]  seeing them attack him and seeing him promote populism and standing up and not being weak
[45:00.760 --> 45:05.960]  and having courage to, to liking him more than the rest of the Republican field than
[45:05.960 --> 45:10.200]  the Republican establishment attack team. And so I had more support for him. And then
[45:10.200 --> 45:13.560]  I saw his policies get better and better. But now I can tell you, I'm really proud of Donald
[45:13.560 --> 45:20.840]  Trump and I'm really satisfied and, and feel good in my gut and my spirit that I have supported
[45:20.840 --> 45:27.160]  him because you could see him up there like a lion who's been attacked, all these wolves,
[45:27.160 --> 45:32.880]  all these hyenas, all these, you know, all these other, you know, creatures of the night
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.200]  with all the attacks, all the demonization, all the rigging, everything stacked against
[45:37.200 --> 45:46.280]  him, just the archetypal hero. But it isn't even being a hero. It's survival and understanding
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.800]  he has to do this and everything they do blowing up in his face. I didn't know what I thought
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.240]  about the debate last night. I said that. I said, I think he won, but narrowly, Hillary
[45:56.240 --> 46:02.560]  kind of got a lot of points because she could stand there. So that was a victory for Hillary.
[46:02.560 --> 46:07.320]  It was rigged all the attacks. There was a third debater basically the name Lester Holt.
[46:07.320 --> 46:10.360]  I was very saddened by the fact that I've never seen him behave this way. But you can
[46:10.360 --> 46:19.560]  tell the orders ran. He ran off in an embarrassed way like Judas. But I tell you, by the fact
[46:19.560 --> 46:25.960]  that he did take the high road, I think he did overall have the victory and the polls
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.440]  across the country show that if this gets so sophisticated, and it's how I started the
[46:31.440 --> 46:42.080]  debate last night, you know, 45 minutes before eight o'clock at about 715, 720, I came on
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.880]  after the news package and I said, listen, please listen to me carefully. I'm going to
[46:46.880 --> 46:58.760]  eclipse your calls. I said Donald Trump, the system will say Donald Trump won if he goes
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.680]  in there and acts establishment because really what he's showing them is he's going to play
[47:03.680 --> 47:12.240]  ball and go along. And it's the beginning of the sellout. If he goes in there and is
[47:12.240 --> 47:17.840]  not hateful, but aggressive and really nails her to the wall, that will be the big victory
[47:17.840 --> 47:24.960]  against the media trying to bully Trump into submitting and doing what they want.
[47:24.960 --> 47:31.960]  And then they're going to say he won if he goes in and plays along with it. But Donald
[47:31.960 --> 47:39.000]  Trump did something really, really special last night. He transcended all of that. They
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.920]  bullied him. They rigged it. They attacked. They twisted. And he still hit her with some
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.200]  hard points, but did it in a very measured way. And so it blew up in their face and so
[47:51.200 --> 47:55.320]  many Democrats I know and so many people that were on the fence and the polls show it are
[47:55.320 --> 48:00.800]  now going to Trump because they saw how rigged it was. And at their base humanity, seeing
[48:00.800 --> 48:06.760]  someone in the arena surrounded 100 to one with the foreign governments and the big banks
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.480]  and the billionaires and the media and all those vampires hating him because he's alive.
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.760]  He has a soul. All the sellouts wanting to bring him down, wanting to destroy him because
[48:17.760 --> 48:22.080]  they know they failed because he represents the human spirit that refuses to submit to
[48:22.080 --> 48:31.400]  tyranny. And so Donald Trump is our champion now. And he's inexorably tied to the fate
[48:31.400 --> 48:38.240]  of this Republic, just as all of us are, but to a greater extent. And so he won the debate
[48:38.240 --> 48:45.120]  big time last night. I've really pulled back. I've looked at it. I've thought about it.
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.240]  But he has to go into the next one and just say, look, I'm just here to tell the truth.
[48:49.240 --> 48:55.760]  I'm not going to play games. They rigged the last debate. I got interrupted 40 times. This
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.800]  better not be rigged. Just get that out up front. Not being a short loser. He's pointing
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.000]  out that he won. Even though it was rigged, don't try it. The American people saw it.
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.800]  Reach out to American people. People of the world say we all saw what happened. Don't
[49:07.800 --> 49:13.560]  try it now at Fox at the next debate and just roll over these people. That's what's got
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.520]  to be done.
[49:16.520 --> 49:25.480]  But Trump won the debate. He won it big time. Now let's, let's, let's go to a clip of Hillary
[49:25.480 --> 49:31.160]  invoking race. And then I want to go to a clip of Trump saying he's glad that he took
[49:31.160 --> 49:33.680]  the high road. But, but here's Hillary invoking race.
[49:33.680 --> 49:36.680]  Do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.
[49:36.680 --> 49:40.640]  Secretary, in the last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing
[49:40.640 --> 49:45.920]  to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against
[49:45.920 --> 49:46.920]  black people?
[49:46.920 --> 49:53.160]  Listen, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately,
[49:53.160 --> 50:00.560]  too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore,
[50:00.560 --> 50:07.840]  I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling
[50:07.840 --> 50:14.560]  this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences,
[50:14.560 --> 50:21.240]  I have said in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with
[50:21.240 --> 50:23.240]  implicit bias.
[50:23.240 --> 50:28.120]  Yeah, but what about implicit bias in people that have other skin colors as well? I mean,
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.000]  we're all humans. We have brains that are basically the same, the person to person they
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.600]  vary that I mean, you can have totally racist black people or Hispanics or whatever. Again,
[50:37.600 --> 50:42.520]  it's this idea that white people and cops are inherently after black folks. And in some
[50:42.520 --> 50:47.720]  cases that's true, but not across the board. And then statistically, we know that it's
[50:47.720 --> 50:51.840]  very rare for black people to be killed by the police. Statistically, the media takes
[50:51.840 --> 50:57.720]  every case and hypes it up like a great white shark attack. Okay, but it's not reality based.

[54:07.480 --> 54:13.920]  or is he live? No, that looks good. Paul Watson is hosting the fourth hour of Nightly
[54:13.920 --> 54:17.960]  News tonight at 7 o'clock Central. All right, John disagrees in California. I'm going to
[54:17.960 --> 54:21.680]  go to him first. Then Scott in the Netherlands because he's calling from overseas. And then
[54:21.680 --> 54:28.000]  James Garrett, Steve, and many others. But again, we're going to be taking your calls
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.040]  right through to the end of the third hour. And then Paul Watson obviously will always
[54:33.040 --> 54:40.440]  have a lot of devastating analysis and information. A lot more is breaking Lester Holt, the third
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.880]  debater. I'm looking at drudgereport.com. Ask Trump six follow-up questions and not
[54:44.880 --> 54:52.120]  ask any of Clinton. Interrupted Trump 40 plus times. Interrupted Hillary seven. We've got
[54:52.120 --> 54:56.880]  some of these clips boiled down where it really shows how nasty Holt got towards the end.
[54:56.880 --> 55:01.320]  And you could tell Holt ran off. Obviously he had an earpiece. I believe he was being
[55:01.320 --> 55:05.760]  told go after Trump, go after Trump. Your job's on the line. This is high stakes, folks. This
[55:05.760 --> 55:11.480]  is 21st century information war. We know it's all rigged. He showed that. And I believe
[55:11.480 --> 55:15.560]  Holt was very embarrassed because I don't think Holt's a bad guy. I don't get a bad
[55:15.560 --> 55:20.400]  feeling about him. I like a lot of his reporting. I'm rarely wrong. I thought he'd be a lot
[55:20.400 --> 55:26.680]  fair like Matt Lauer was. And then he still leaned towards Clinton too. Man, you know
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.480]  the country's in trouble when they just lean a little bit for Clinton, you're happy. But
[55:30.480 --> 55:40.080]  he was just, this is a boxing match. You know, Hillary had horseshoes loaded into her gloves.
[55:40.080 --> 55:44.200]  I'm going to go to your calls right now. John, in California, you disagree. Go to the headline.
[55:44.200 --> 55:45.200]  Go ahead, John.
[55:45.200 --> 55:52.720]  I just want to preface this. I've been a listener for 20 years, listening to the bait last night.
[55:52.720 --> 56:00.360]  The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I can't not, I cannot get past Trump's stopping
[56:00.360 --> 56:07.040]  frisk policy, clear violation of our great point. We have to hold his feet to the fire
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.720]  on this. Alex, he has to come out and say he will defend and support the Constitution.
[56:12.720 --> 56:18.080]  I do not hear that out of him and well, and it's cause for concern. Let me just say this.
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.880]  You're absolutely on target and I should spend an hour on this or do a special report. Just
[56:22.880 --> 56:29.000]  explain my view on it. Trump is an old school tough guy and he's in New York. He saw the
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.640]  incredible crime and what they do is they target people that look like they're dressed
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.200]  like gang members or whatever and it can be racial profiling and it's terrible. But you
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.160]  know what? It made the crime go way down because the gang culture is so out of control. I don't
[56:41.160 --> 56:44.400]  care if you're white kids with your drawers hanging down or black kids, the cops would
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.840]  do it and it is a police state. But then when the globalists come in and destabilize the
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.100]  country and things are falling apart, what do you do? Just let people run around killing
[56:52.100 --> 56:56.560]  everybody like in Chicago. So when you're in a martial law situation, they've brought
[56:56.560 --> 57:01.200]  Chicago into a collapse. So then at some point it's going to go under martial law. I'm not
[57:01.200 --> 57:07.160]  for that. Just like they bring the radical Muslims in and it causes Europe to be stabilized.
[57:07.160 --> 57:10.420]  Then they bring in a civil emergency. I said it would happen. I don't want the martial
[57:10.420 --> 57:16.720]  law but what are they supposed to do? So again, it's a very complex issue. It's like Trump
[57:16.720 --> 57:20.320]  on torture. He goes, we're doing it. It's already going on. Yeah, we're going to torture
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.960]  ISIS. They're bad guys. There's a disconnect. But Trump sees himself as good. So he thinks
[57:24.960 --> 57:30.280]  I'm only going to torture ISIS that murder Christians. Well, you can't do that. But see,
[57:30.280 --> 57:35.800]  he believes it from the place he's coming. I get the logic. So he's being honest. It's
[57:35.800 --> 57:41.240]  almost a plus even though I don't support it. But do you see the nuance of what I'm saying?
[57:41.240 --> 57:48.280]  Alex, I do, but it's a slippery slope. I agree. Listen, I agree. What outweighs it 50 to 1
[57:48.280 --> 57:53.200]  is the true evil elite that put cancer viruses and vaccines that are changing the human genetic
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.280]  code, that are mutilating the planet, that are spraying aluminum dioxide in the sky.
[57:57.280 --> 58:04.800]  They hate this guy because despite his little problems, we all got them. They are pure evil
[58:04.800 --> 58:12.240]  and they hate him. But the truth is his honesty about it almost makes it. Okay, but it's not.
[58:12.240 --> 58:17.040]  I agree with you. It's something we got to work on. But we're going to get a lot better
[58:17.040 --> 58:22.560]  stuff out of Trump being close to him. Then we're going to be fighting him. But you want
[58:22.560 --> 58:27.560]  to give you a come back to that. It's too heavy. With only 41 days left in the countdown
[58:27.560 --> 58:32.720]  for the election, it's now more critical than ever to spread the word. This is the Info

[59:50.880 --> 1:00:14.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex
[1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:17.800]  Jones. All right, if you just tuned in, we're taking
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:21.880]  your phone calls. We're going to be playing a lot of clips this hour of debate highlights.
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:27.800]  I think Trump won. Not in the way I thought he would. He didn't really roll over, but
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.720]  he just let them rig the whole thing so the whole world could see that it was like watching
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:36.160]  a bunch of hyenas attack a lion. But I think in the next debate, he's got to come in and
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:41.760]  savage her on her lies. And, you know, now he's been chivalrous. You know, he's let
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:48.040]  her play the lady card. We're taking your phone calls right now on this. John disagreed,
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:53.360]  you know, saying that he thought the debate was bad for Trump because he got into stop
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:58.280]  and frisk. And this is Hillary with overthrowing countries, murdering Christians in mass, you
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:03.840]  know, NSA spying, all this bill of rights trampling. And then he's there saying, Hey,
[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:08.640]  stop and frisk lowered crime by unbelievable amounts. And we're talking like 90 something
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:16.120]  percent, but hundreds of thousands of people, more than half of them being black. You're
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:19.720]  walking down the street and the cops just pull over and frisk you sometimes on a weekly
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.520]  basis. I would get pissed off. I'd say the cops, do I look like an all points bulletin?
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:29.440]  Do I do I hold on officer? Do I look like somebody? Because if you're saying you're
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:33.880]  looking for somebody looks like me, here's my ID. But if you're just randomly, Hey, we're
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:40.160]  just going to search everybody on the street. That is not America. But then the community
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:47.720]  jump up and down and say we had, you know, five kids shot this week in this one neighborhood.
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:54.120]  And that's because of the gangbanger culture. But the caller is right. It's a slippery slope.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:57.760]  And then I'm going to go to Scott, the Netherlands and others. But John, you want to respond to
[1:01:57.760 --> 1:01:58.760]  what I said earlier?
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:05.280]  I, I do. And I, I partially agree, but we cannot afford to give up any more liberty
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:06.280]  for security.
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:11.560]  I totally agree with you given us the Patriot Act, the NBA. We've got to draw the line and
[1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:17.640]  we've got to get Trump to come out and state this, that he will support and defend our
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.840]  constitutional rights.
[1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:26.000]  You're right. All right. Thank you. Good point. By the way, there's a story up on info wars.com.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:36.200]  We pointed this out in 2004 at the debates, something we've gone over that Bush was wearing
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:41.240]  some type of earpiece, wireless earpiece that had the transmitter booster on his back. And
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:49.360]  it appears that Hillary had something snaked up her suit as well. Just saying. And she
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:52.760]  does need help now when people tell us stuff in her ear routinely, we have video of it.
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:58.640]  So she definitely becomes incognizant at certain points. It goes in and out of consciousness.
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:03.480]  Scott in the Netherlands. Thank you for calling. What did you think about the debate?
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:08.840]  Good morning or good afternoon, Alex. We, my girlfriend and I, we got up two o'clock
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:16.840]  in the morning to watch your show and watch the debates. And my girlfriend, I mean, she's,
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:21.000]  she's Dutch and she's not really into the politics, but she thought it was pretty balanced
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.280]  as far as them playing off each other. I think both of us were in the same scenario as many
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:30.360]  or the other listeners are. We were all kind of half bedding to see if she was going to
[1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:37.120]  be able to stand up for the entire hour, hour and a half debate. So I mean, I think a lot
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:40.440]  of us had, you know, a side that's going, is she going to pass out? Yes or no. And I
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.360]  think that was one of the reasons maybe that he was going easy on or just in case something
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:47.400]  like that was going to happen.
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:53.320]  I was just disappointed that there were so many that just the easy points that he could
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:59.280]  fire back at her rhetoric. And what I'm really hoping, because you, you say that sometimes
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:04.520]  you have like the inside baseball that maybe between Roger Stone and even if it's David
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:10.680]  Knight or yourself, that you could actually take the time to, to, to help coach him because
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:11.680]  I know I've
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:15.080]  Listen, I've hardly, I don't, I haven't talked about, I've talked to him from one time on
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.360]  air and talked to him some other times and I'm just going to leave it at that. But I
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:26.960]  mean, it's, it's, look, I mean, I think Donald Trump's as smart as I am or smarter. I certainly,
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:31.320]  when you're the man in the arena, it's, it's really hard. I mean, look, he does read people's
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:35.560]  tweets. He does pick up what's on the show. His sons, you know, I know, tune in and retweet
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:38.760]  a lot of our stuff. I mean, what would you like to say to Donald Trump? When we come
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:44.080]  back, Scott and another one, stay there. What, your message to Donald Trump, what you think?
[1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:47.280]  And again, I'm taking calls that disagree up front, so it's not just a cheering section
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:52.840]  here. We'll go to James and Garrett and Ken and Steve and Ken and everybody else straight
[1:04:52.840 --> 1:04:58.960]  ahead, 800-25-99-231. Stay there, Scott.
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:03.160]  Russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in Syria as long as the Obama administration
[1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:06.920]  keeps sending weapons to the ISIS linked out in those front. The Russian government said
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:12.080]  the militants are armed by tanks, APCs, field artillery, multiple rocket launchers in heavy
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:15.440]  weaponry. And of course, they could have made these weapons themselves, nor could they
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:19.080]  have stolen all of them from the Syrian army, especially not the American made Tomas hold
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.480]  that Jihadis used to destroy a Russian helicopter last year. The Russians also pointed out that
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:27.920]  the U.S. led airstrike that killed 62 Syrian soldiers has directly led to ISIS gaining
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:32.480]  ground. In other words, the U.S. just served as ISIS's air force. The U.S. State Department
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:36.520]  has claimed the attack was an accident. However, facts point to the contrary. The region where
[1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:40.160]  the attack occurred has always been under Syrian army control with no prior presence
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:44.280]  of ISIS. CENTCOM even had the audacity to release a statement claiming they have not
[1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:48.600]  bombed the area in the past, but that's completely false. Unless they were targeting the Syrian
[1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:53.960]  government. Stay tuned for more reports and download our new free smartphone app at infowars.com

[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:07.160]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates,
[1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:12.840]  the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right

[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:33.200]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:39.080]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure

[1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:46.520]  studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine

[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:49.280]  We are 41 days out from the November historic election. September 2016 is long in its tooth.
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:57.880]  Hard to believe we're about to go into 2017. When the British Ministry of Defense in 2007
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:02.760]  and the Defense Department in 2007 is well predicting that by the end of 2016 we would
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:13.240]  enter a global financial meltdown peaking in 2024. And we are in an engineered economy.
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:17.920]  They're bringing in global government. Obama last week at the UN called for us to waive
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:30.360]  sovereignty and enter a, quote, liberal new world order. Liberal world order. Order. The
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:41.600]  term world order or new world order was first introduced in 1937 on the world stage by Adolf
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:51.640]  Hitler. But the term actually came from the Fabian Socialists in 1901 and the leader of
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:10:02.040]  the Fabian Socialist and the World Futurist Society, H. G. Wells, who in 1899 wrote about
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:08.520]  atomic bombs and the equations. Why do I mention that? Because whatever plan you're
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:14.120]  hearing about today is a very old and the technocrats have theoretical understanding
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:21.600]  of technology. They say 30 years ahead, but if they've already jumped with Lord knows
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:27.280]  what's been discovered, that's why they're so arrogant now. They have Promethean fire
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:30.520]  that they could be a thousand years ahead of us. I mean, theoretically they're acting
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:38.560]  really weird. Okay. Like, like we're just a problem spilt blood or something on the ground.
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:43.080]  It's got to be cleaned up. And the Google people run around saying, you're like bugs
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:48.480]  if you don't assimilate in the new corp. We might step on you. We might not, you know.
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:55.520]  So there's this backdrop going on and Trump had to basically come in and according to
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:00.080]  I guess the view he went with and look presidential and not look like a bully, but you're on the
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:13.360]  stage with an evil bully. So the facts trump all of that standard societal popery. I mean,
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:18.640]  I think that you just got to transcend it, but it blow up in their face. Not because
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:24.560]  he was so nice, but because it was so staged with Lester attacking more and more towards
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:28.680]  the end as he realized that Trump had won and Hillary, you know, going from the little
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:36.040]  old lady to getting a little bit nastier and flashing her little demon eyes. Wasn't fair.
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:40.520]  Donald Trump was up against two people. So he won because it was clearly staged. They
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:49.480]  forfeit and it blew up in their face. And then just the icing of him laying back while
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:12:04.440]  they destroyed themselves, I guess shows some mental judo mental jujitsu that you have to
[1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:11.240]  admire the depth of the great orange toad. Now that said, I want to go back to Scott
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:15.000]  and other ones who was saying that, you know, he was disappointed that we're going to hurry
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:20.640]  through a bunch of calls here. Again, we're taking calls of disagree up front. I think
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:25.720]  Trump won the debate on the way. I thought he would, but I really thought about it. What
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:31.760]  is your message to Donald Trump, Scott? Well, I would have my personal message to Donald
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:37.800]  Trump is that we need, we need a real constitutionalist. We need to have service to follow the United
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:45.080]  States Constitution. And then hammer Hillary. It's not, it's not that hard. I mean, she
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:53.120]  has so many faults. We got Benghazi. We've got, we've got the Clinton Foundation. I mean,
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:59.720]  these were so easy slam dunks that he could have just creamed her with when he, when he
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:03.560]  I understand, but listen, listen, listen, here's the problem. You're educated, you're
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:10.880]  informed. And so from your perspective, and I think you're probably right, you have to
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:15.680]  let the, you know, message rise to the occasion to actually inform the public and not just
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:20.000]  dumb it down, saying the public's dumb. That's why they're dumb, because the message has
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.800]  been dumbed down. It's not the other way around. I agree. You put out the complex info and
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:29.680]  you actually address people like they've got a brain. They will pick it up fairly quickly.
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:34.080]  And so I think it was the wrong move. I said before the debate, if he comes out and does
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:39.000]  softballs and acts too nice because she's a woman, just because that's what the establishment
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.920]  says will be a win, it will not be as big a win as is he really runs over her and calls
[1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:50.840]  her out. But the polls show all over the country and they're scientific that he won over a
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:56.200]  bunch of Democrats last night who, who are like children. So, so, so see, I argue on one
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:00.200]  side that I argue on the other. I mean, I, I think the proof will be in the pudding in
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:01.200]  November. What do you think?
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:07.320]  I had my fingers crossed. I mean, it's still, you still have a voter fraud and everything
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:10.680]  else is going on with it. And that's, that's a nightmare for anybody.
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:15.240]  Well, the goblin king, and of course that's Michael Moore, the man that has six bodyguards
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:19.320]  that says you shouldn't be able to have a gun. He says Trump won the debate hands down.
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:24.800]  And he said, he said Hillary was too classy to go for the jugular. Hillary is anything
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:31.360]  but, but classy. She is a grasping white trash monster. I appreciate your call, Scott. Let's
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:38.560]  go now to, let me see, he's been holding the longest here. Let's go ahead and talk to Steve
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:41.240]  in Colorado. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:47.840]  Oh, yes, Alex. This is the first time Colorado long time listener. I was watching the debates
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:52.120]  last night. I was watching, it was on the end of the debate when Trump was walking off
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:57.320]  the stage. He didn't look like he was happy. Like he looked like he was kind of sort of
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:02.840]  distract a little bit. Like he was talking to the media. Absolutely. He looked like he
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:07.080]  wasn't being himself. He looked like he had to pull his horns in. And I don't think he
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:08.080]  enjoyed it.
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:16.360]  Well, no, not all. I think he really did want to go after Hillary really big time, but
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:23.640]  advisors must have told him not to, but he should have just went out there. So now it
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:29.480]  sort of looks like Hillary has the stronger lead. He was just a liar, but it's kind of
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:30.480]  look like Hillary was stronger.
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:34.640]  No, I agree. I agree. I mean, he's been surging in all the polls. He's continued to surge
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:39.240]  after this time will tell. And again, we have to look at each poll and see if we're scientific,
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.760]  but overall it appears it was a victory, but, but, but not a stunning victory, not, not
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:49.960]  a devastating, you know, the powder keg in the magazine of the ship blows up and it goes,
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:54.480]  you know, a thousand yards in the air, not spectacular, but more of a ship listing on
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:16:00.200]  its side, slowly going beneath the waves. But we've got fires on our own ship, Steve.
[1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:01.200]  Anything else?
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:05.360]  Well, you know, I just want Donald Trump to go ahead and make America great again. I
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:09.440]  think he really can do this, but the support of the American people and community to get
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:13.320]  that out there, that Hillary Clinton, nothing but a fraud. So we need to get that out there.
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:17.600]  All right, my friends, thank you so much. Let's go ahead now and take another call. Let's
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:20.840]  talk to Garrett in Texas. You're on the air.
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:29.560]  Hey, Alex. I've been listening for several years. I'm 16. And you know what? I think
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:36.840]  that that Trump won the debate. I think that he, he was definitely a whole lot stronger
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:41.320]  than Hillary was. But at the same time, I agree with them on the fact that they, he
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:46.800]  threw out his entire campaign. I noticed that he never really seemed as constitutional
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:57.440]  as like, for example, someone like Rand Paul, who I supported before, but he, he definitely,
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.600]  he's definitely a supporter of the first and second amendment, but
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:04.560]  Well, here's why the elites are going after him. He wants to get the foreign bank that
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:08.560]  runs our country, the fellow reserve out of here. He wants to reform that and change that.
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.960]  He wants to end the bad trade deals. We've been captured by foreign globalists. He does
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:16.080]  support private property. He does support the second amendment. And then he's saying,
[1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:20.880]  if you're a globalist or an outsider, you're not an American, you don't get those rights.
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:24.640]  That's really what Trump's saying. Or he's saying, and it's one of the only elitist things
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:27.720]  he does. If you're in a bad neighborhood and there's a bunch of crime, we're just going
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:32.520]  to knock some heads and clean things up. And again, the honesty is good, but the way it's
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:37.960]  being done will be twisted and used against us. So in the negative column, he's got some
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:42.480]  problems. The positive column is 10 times better. So that's where I stand.
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:48.760]  Of course. Yes. He, you know what? He, if he's in there and you want, if this election
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:54.600]  is fair, he will be because these people are saying that Hillary's ahead. Trump has more
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:58.720]  has more votes than any Republican in history. That's right. Well, I have all the polls here.
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:03.520]  I mean, look at the interest, you know, they're saying as big as a Super Bowl last night as
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:06.640]  the early numbers come in. Looks like it's going to be the biggest thing ever. People
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:10.560]  are super interested. They're upset. He's populist. He's outside the normal political
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:16.240]  ring. The power structure is panicking for a reason. He is coming after him. He wants
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:22.400]  to act like a president. The perfect constitutionalist. No, but an American for America who isn't
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:27.640]  out to get us and who also doesn't want to start random evil wars. You know, I mean,
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:32.760]  he's really good on a lot of fronts and he's, he's, he's bad on a couple. Look, look at
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:36.800]  Hillary. We know what we've got over there is much worse. And it's not a lesser of two
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:41.280]  evils. She's a globalist. She is a hijacker. When I say they're collaborators, when I say
[1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:46.120]  we've been taken over by foreign power, that's what the new world order is, is a global corporate
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:52.320]  takeover of nation states, the family and everything else. I appreciate your call, Garrett.
[1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:56.600]  We've got Kent in Oregon just popped up. He disagrees. I'll go to him first and then
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:01.800]  I will go to a Sean who's a Democrat since he's voting for Trump. I want to talk about
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:06.080]  Lester Holt. We've got James in South Carolina. We'll talk about the debates. John in Wyoming
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:11.880]  says no mention of Benghazi. That's a big problem. And we better hear about Benghazi
[1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:19.400]  in the next debate. We better hear about that when she's bringing up, you know, all the,
[1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:23.840]  you know, terrible things and, and, and, and how Trump didn't want to take over our military
[1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:28.880]  and how he's greedy and, you know, how he's mean to a guy in the audience who was an architect
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:36.320]  who didn't get paid what he originally wanted to and all this other bull. I would have said,
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:40.560]  you're telling me about some architect and a fight over the bill when you're the lady
[1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.720]  that ordered the stand down at Benghazi and said, what difference does it make? You got
[1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:48.320]  a lot of nerve, lady. He just sat there in letters stabbing him and stabbing him and
[1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:52.040]  stabbing him and stabbing him. But I guess it blew up in their face because everybody
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:20:00.680]  saw how rigged it was. I don't know. It's very complex. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Investment

[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:37.480]  I read it, and then I kind of put it in the back of my mind because I wanted to try to
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:47.960]  reach out to Michael Savage, and I've got his cell phone number in my phone right here.
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:52.000]  So I'm just so bad about it, I don't even know if I saved it under his name, or it's
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.720]  in my computer. I used to talk to him a lot more on the phone. He's busy, I'm busy. We
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.880]  just don't talk as much as a few years ago. We talk quite a bit. I'm bragging about it.
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:07.120]  I'm just saying I need to call Michael Savage. That's why I'm not talked about it yet, because
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:12.560]  I don't know how much I can say, because the last few times I talked to him a few weeks
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:18.120]  ago before he came on air twice to promote his new book, he specifically told me about
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:25.640]  censorship going on and that he was getting really pissed off. And obviously, he didn't
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:29.360]  say that's off record, but any conversation I have with Savage, I mean I've had like hour-long
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:37.000]  conversations with him before, he is off record. And so this just hit me, they were
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  asking me, hey, why aren't you covering this? And I'm like, covering what? Oh yeah, the
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:46.360]  Michael Savage thing. It just becomes so surreal. Like, oh, you're under investigation by the
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:51.800]  Justice Department to see if you're going to come out for Hillary. It's surreal. I would
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:56.200]  never hurt Hillary Clinton. And I don't say that because I'm afraid they're coming to
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:59.680]  get me. I don't say that because, you know, if I thought going after Hillary would be
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:04.880]  a good idea, I would say it, but I'm afraid they're going to get me. No, I think it's
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:10.200]  a bad idea. She's a horrible person, would turn her into a martyr. But at the same time,
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:15.200]  I get sick of the stinking criminals in this government, the ones running around committing
[1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:21.920]  all these crimes, constantly getting in my life, going after my friends, screwing everyone
[1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:26.240]  over and trying to take our liberties. I'm tired of it. I have a right to not be your
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:33.800]  slave. And I can tell you part of the censorship is talking about info wars.com and playing
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:41.480]  clips of our reporters on air. I can tell you that I'm just going to say it. But get
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:45.840]  Savage's phone number dialed up on here for me, guys, I'll call him during the break.
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:48.880]  But that's the kind of stuff I'm dealing with. And I got all these clips to play and I've
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:53.880]  got all these guests to get on. And I'm not complaining. It's just this is so real, people.
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:58.080]  This is not a game. This is not the average talk show host that takes it easy and doesn't
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:02.680]  push the envelope. There's only one other talk show host that does it to the level we
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:11.000]  do it. And it's Michael Savage and hundreds of affiliates down the tube. I mean, I hope
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:17.240]  this doesn't happen because we need Michael Savage on the air. And if you just tuned in,
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:23.200]  I'll tell you what's going on. Popular radio host Michael Savage broadcast shut down nationwide
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:29.320]  as he discusses Clinton's health. And that's the big censorship is you do not discuss Hillary's
[1:27:29.320 --> 1:27:38.000]  health on mainstream outlets. That is the big no, no. And obviously, he's getting censored.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:47.060]  I mean, if if he told me without me even asking to come on, that he wants to play club
[1:27:47.060 --> 1:27:50.760]  semi show and then he wants to, you know, have Paul Watson on, he wants to play our
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:55.160]  reports. It'd be every day, by the way, if he could, they're like, no, you're not going
[1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:59.960]  to. And by the way, I've told Savage, cut my name out, cut Paul's out. We don't care.
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:04.640]  He goes, no, I'm going to give you credit. So the point is I raised this because I guarantee
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:11.160]  you in fours is in the middle of this. I was talking to Savage about it last week. Michael
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:16.280]  Savage is a very well known radio talk show personnel. This is Breitbart. This is the
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:20.680]  last refuge. We guys give me the Breitbart article. And then it goes on. The Savage Nation
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:25.160]  is a nationally syndicated talk shows, the second most listened to radio talk show in
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:30.080]  the country with over 20 million listeners, 400 stations. Or today he was discussing
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:34.120]  his perspectives on a presidential debate, giving examples of current and anticipated
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:37.600]  debate bias. In addition, the broadcaster began discussing Hillary Clinton's mysterious
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:41.640]  health condition that Savage believes might be Parkinson's almost immediately without
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:47.160]  any notification. New York tri-state radio station, W ABC radio, TV cut, Savage off the
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:54.320]  air and placed him with a lesser rated Curtis and Kubi show. He tweeted, I've been sabotaged
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:29:01.360]  on air to destroy support for Trump more later. And then now reportedly, uh, shortly thereafter
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:07.520]  Savage disavowed, discovered the issue and began discussing what was going on in and
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:11.600]  around the New York broadcast area. All Savage affiliates nationwide cut off the broadcast
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:16.120]  and replaced the live transmission with a recording of the previous show. I mean, how
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:20.680]  real is that? We told you they're coming at retalk radio. We told you they're going
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:27.160]  to shut us down. I told you, canaries in the coal mine, Drudge, Savage, info wars, yours
[1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:32.240]  truly and not that limbaugh is perfect, but they want to get him big time. And I'm telling
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:38.640]  you, man, this is bad news. And then I don't even say I'm exhausted about this. It's just
[1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:42.920]  like as a journalist, I'm not even happy that I can call Savage up and find out the scoop.
[1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:46.120]  You know, it's like hearing about a death of the family to know how much trouble this
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:53.520]  country's in folks. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:30:02.760]  radio network. Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones, but recent
[1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:07.480]  studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer. Experts say
[1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:12.720]  parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful. Doctors say the infant brain, even
[1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:17.240]  while in the womb, is especially vulnerable. So keep the phone away from your abdomen,
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:21.440]  especially toward the end of pregnancy. And for men, using a cell phone for as little
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:26.880]  as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm. Lowering sperm count levels so much
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:30.800]  that conceiving a child could be difficult. This is one of those times you want to keep
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:34.800]  it out of your pants. And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that
[1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:39.280]  the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms. This causes insomnia and slow
[1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:43.840]  the metabolism. Hello, weight gain. Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're
[1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:48.360]  constantly emitting radio frequency radiation. So keep your phone in air playing mode when
[1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:52.720]  you can. Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body. Use headphones. And when
[1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:56.520]  you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible. Leigh-Anne McAdoo with

[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:08.400]  produce. Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:11.840]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:17.440]  it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:23.000]  lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:28.200]  And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:33.160]  clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an
[1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:36.920]  antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:41.080]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.

[1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:34.120]  Michael Savage, I can't believe how calm the media is about this. Pulled off the airwaves
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:40.560]  live on WABC, biggest station in the country, hands down. Top rated show. Number two show
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:47.400]  in the country. Probably bigger than Limbaugh. But it doesn't matter. He's pulled live in
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:54.440]  New York and replaced with another show because he's talking about Hillary's health saying
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:34:00.840]  he believes she has Parkinson's. Her emails that DC leaks got as her talking about Parkinson's
[1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:07.960]  medication. That's in WikiLeaks as well. And then he's pulled off the air.
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:14.640]  So the real headline here is national talk show host pulled during live show for talking
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:19.640]  about Hillary's health. This isn't like Dr. Drew fired a week later from CNN. This is
[1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:25.760]  in live time. So they pull him off WABC. He starts ranting about it and tweeting, I've
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:35.480]  been sabotaged and they cut him live from the 400 other affiliates across the country.
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:45.040]  Top rated talk show host Michael Savage pulled off air after discussing Hillary's health.
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:47.640]  And a week ago, I mean, he was on Skype during the break. The whole crew was there. He was
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:51.960]  talking about, Hey, could you guys get me this interview on air today? But I'm not sure
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:54.800]  I can air it. They've been trying to keep me from airing your stuff. Now I've got to
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:04.480]  go through CBS. And there you go. Boom. A week later, Michael Savage is off the air.
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:12.320]  He said pure sabotage. And Matt Drudge was here a year ago and said it's coming 2016.
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:16.080]  I was told by the Supreme Court Justice, the other conservative one, you know, the other
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:21.200]  one died. And the Washington Post came out a month later and said he was part of a secret
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:27.320]  society connected to Bohemian Grove. This is a throw it all in our face. In case there's
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:33.920]  a contested election, you'll have a locked four, four Supreme Court. Well, you can really
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:40.760]  see them pulling out the stops. And they, let me just explain something. I know I am
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:47.200]  in real palpable crosshairs in the new order. I'm not even afraid, but it is definitely
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:53.360]  you can feel it. And this country is, and make no mistake, keeping your head down is
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:58.920]  how we're going to lose the whole enchilada. We have Larry Nicholson. He's just popping
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:03.840]  in for a few minutes and I promise I'm going to run through James and Lisa and Matt and
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:07.960]  Terry and Sean, your response to the debate, Lester Holt running off like a rat after very,
[1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:14.120]  very shameful. I think Trump overall won by not looking like the bully, but we had Larry
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:22.240]  on with us just a month ago saying what he thought, you know, he should do. I thought
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:26.600]  he barely won last night, but I slept on it and I came out and I saw the polls saying
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:30.200]  he's getting a lot of Democrats to swing over just by looking like a nice guy in the fact
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:34.760]  that he let them gang up on him and took it very coolly. And then Holt got madder and
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:38.760]  madder and lost his cool. And the last third really showed his colors interrupting Trump
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:46.000]  40 plus times, never, never asking counter questions and not once to Hillary 40 plus
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:56.120]  times. And then only quote fact checked her seven. Amazing. Amazing. So you total that
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:01.880]  up together. That's almost 50 times he went after Trump for seven on Hillary and only
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:11.840]  one of those six, only one of those six times was it a real question. My head again was
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:17.400]  swimming more than spinning. I mean, last night when I was covering it live, trying to only
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:24.880]  give brief analysis. It was just all lies. It was incredible. So we're going to be breaking
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:28.240]  all that down. I haven't even gotten all the clips yet. It's going to be a jam packed third
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:31.640]  hour obviously with the clips are up on info wars.com. Hillary will one time he told the
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:36.520]  truth said I'm coming out your guns. No more due process. Extra judicial will just put
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:42.120]  you on a list and take your guns. This is we feel like you're a threat. The Justice Department
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:46.240]  just says so kind of like Michael Savage and thousands of others now are banned from flying
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:51.200]  to England because they were just put on a list. And now the new mayor says he wants
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:57.160]  to establish Sharia law wants to censor free speech and a set up a speech czar this week
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:03.360]  in London who will arrest people that criticize Islam. Boy, isn't that great in the birthplace
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:05.920]  of Magna Carta and codified free speech?
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:11.480]  Before we go any further, we have free shipping that is going to end tomorrow. I mean, it's
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:15.080]  going to end tonight. I don't know. I might extend that because I'm going to cut off the
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:21.320]  supermodality officially ended yesterday, but it's still in the shopping cart. 20% off 20%
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:25.120]  off the mythical bottom and super high quality vitamin B12 secret 12. That's 20% off free
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:32.160]  shipping store wide as part of the Americanism, not globalism special. And we've got a lot
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:36.280]  of other specials as well. We now have a probiotic seven years in the making. This is being produced
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:39.600]  being developed and tested two years before I even got into surgicals. This particular
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:45.160]  formula that the experts we've talked to and the scientists that developed this with Dr.
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:53.680]  group say is the ultimate probiotic for a price half of what leading competitors are.
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:39:03.760]  I mean, this is a really Rolls Royce Bentley level Ferrari level 50 billion 50 billion
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:10.880]  live and active cultures, 23 probiotic strains. It's amazing. And it is way, way, way less
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:14.960]  expensive than the other super high quality versions that are out there. And believe me
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:20.680]  with, with probiotics, you get what you pay for. Ladies and gentlemen, info wars, life
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:24.520]  dot com. We could have private labeled hundreds and hundreds of pretty good probiotics, but
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:29.240]  we wanted to make something ridiculously good. That's why we don't have that many products
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:32.520]  on our wine because I can go out and private label a hundred different, you know, high
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:37.080]  quality products that are pretty darn good. But we've only private labeled them are close
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:42.960]  to 30 products. Now, maybe 10 of those are private labeled, which are known high quality.
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:49.000]  Take Childies. That is another best selling 30 plus year brand. It's basically a syrup
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:56.920]  of all these herbs and in Echinacea and everything else that calms your child. And it's just
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:01.000]  a private label of the top selling brand in the country. So there's stuff that's already
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.480]  game changer, amazing stuff out there. We just go private label that and then try to
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:12.080]  discount it. But most of our products we have now developed in house with top developers,
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:16.600]  not just in concert with the group, but he also advises us. And I mean, Childies is something
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:19.760]  kids should take every day. It doesn't have anything in them to actually calm them. It
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:23.760]  just gives them all the vitamins and minerals and key herbs that are associated with kids
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:27.000]  being healthy. And then they just get calm. This stuff is incredible. I give it to my
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:35.680]  children in the morning and it's essential. You know, your kid gets red dye, they bounce
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:39.600]  off the walls, they drink corn syrup, they bounce off the walls. But imagine what the
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:44.920]  opposite of that does. That's Childies. So you can check out the 4.7 star reviews at
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:51.160]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or something called toll free 888-253-3139. There's a lot
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:56.720]  of products I never talk about that are really excellent at infowarslife.com. But regardless,
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:01.240]  we need the funds to continue. I don't want to risk my life, my treasure, my name and
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:07.360]  everything to lose. I know we can win. But the stakes are so high, you can feel the energy.
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  It's gone from intense to over the top to crazy to unprecedented to now. The energy level
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:20.200]  so high, it's almost like things are dead silent. It's just, I mean, it is incredible
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:25.080]  because Trump is just a manifestation of nationalism and humanity awakening and the globalists
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:28.920]  are panicking. And it is just an incredible time to be alive. So thank you for your prayers,
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:34.200]  your support, watching our six, our human element of patriots out there that always
[1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:39.920]  give us good information. I can't believe how good the information has been, not to
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:44.320]  kiss the military and police's butts, who I've been big critics of when they do bad things,
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:49.800]  obviously. But just comparing the military and police and people even in high government
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:54.480]  areas, they're patriots, compared to the general public that is pretty much brain dead in many
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:58.920]  cases is amazing. It is patriots in the government that have been trying to stop this takeover
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:03.040]  forever. That's why the globalists want a civil war where we have a war with the federal
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:07.160]  government. The federal government's been captured, folks. We need to identify the globalist
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:10.960]  and not have the civil war. That's why they're trying to sell a narrative that I want a civil
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.080]  war and I want violence. They sell it in the media. They sell the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:20.280]  the ADL. They sell it behind the scenes. They try to set us up because they cannot stand
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.920]  the fact that we are effectively kicking their butt. And listen, I'm on GCN, a small network.
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:27.600]  It's basically a satellite provider. So I went and chose a satellite provider so it's
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:30.080]  not, you know, they have a little bit of flirt relations, stuff like that. But it's very mom
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:34.440]  and bop. It's actually the third biggest network out there. 2000 plus affiliate agreements,
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:40.960]  1400 affiliates. I don't have that, but that's how many affiliates GCN has and it's literally
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:44.840]  run, you know, out of a small facility in Minnesota. And that's because this is my show.
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:49.920]  I say what I want. I do what I want. I'm not controllable. And that's why they don't know
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:57.560]  what to do. I mean, because I'm just an American and I didn't realize that most generals didn't
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:03.560]  actually read 500 history books like I have. I didn't realize most people hadn't read 15
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:07.600]  books just on the Nazi secret police. And I don't mean little ones. I mean the big, big
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:11.960]  giant jumbos. Okay. I mean, I didn't realize growing up that I just found that interesting.
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:18.520]  I was drawn to it. I was drawn to those things and that I as a layperson and trained it basically
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:24.120]  in all this stuff, but I don't use the deception I've researched against people. I use it to
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:27.280]  understand the enemy and see where they're going. And they're just completely freaked
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:31.200]  out. I mean, I know their methods. I know their operations. Like I was born to it. I'd
[1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:35.360]  up one side and down the other. I've forgotten more than the average person high level in
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:39.480]  the CIA even knows. And I'm not bragging. It's just a fact. I'm a natural and they don't
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:45.080]  know what to do. I'm not bragging. I mean, you know, the fact that I'm a goofball too,
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:49.920]  but it just, it just adds the whole final touch to it. I'm real. And they don't know
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:54.880]  what to do, folks, because I'm an American. I'm a Texan. I'm a Christian. I'm a father.
[1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:59.320]  I'm not going to roll over. I'm not a hero. I can't get on my knees and roll over dad.
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:04.640]  I just can't do it. You need to stop yourselves. You need to back off. You need to stop all
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:08.560]  the wars you're starting. You need to stop funding radical Islamists to kill Christians
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:13.160]  all over Africa and the Middle East. And then you smirk about it. You people are evil. And
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:16.560]  look, a lot of them are totally divorced from God. So I can't get through to them. I'm
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:18.880]  going to Larry Nichols right now, a little bit of the next hour. I always got to go
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:26.000]  though, but there are people serving this evil system who aren't completely up over
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:30.600]  to evil. Man, get right with God now. Speaking of somebody that got right with God 25 years
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:35.320]  ago and turned against the Clintons or 23 years ago, Larry Nichols, Larry, you're on
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:38.400]  the phone. I know you're battling for your life. Just like this republic's battling
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:43.360]  for its life. We pray for you. Folks can support you at Nichols live at AOL dot com at your
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:51.080]  PayPal there as you obviously are working hard against the new world order. Just briefly
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:54.240]  here. I wanted to get you to pop in. We'll get you back on later in the week or next
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:57.080]  week for a full hour. What do you think about the debate last night?
[1:44:57.080 --> 1:45:06.960]  Oh, Alex, it was kind of a nothing for what I had hoped we were going to have. But the
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:13.640]  good news is that Trump was on his game certainly in the first 20, 30 minutes. And the way
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:18.840]  that debate is going to break out is just going to break out the 40% that love Hillary.
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:25.840]  They think she won the 40% that hate Hillary or love Trump. They'll think he won the 20%
[1:45:25.840 --> 1:45:31.200]  that very important 20% that don't care. They probably watched if they watched it all. Alex
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:36.400]  maybe 20 minutes of it till the ball game started. So then they pulled out and that's
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:43.240]  exactly what they're saying is that 20% started to come over to Trump. You think that's accurate?
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:49.880]  You know, let me tell you, after 30 years of Hillary Clinton, this is the battle they're
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:55.160]  fighting. After 30 years, if people are not committed to Hillary, they're not going to
[1:45:55.160 --> 1:46:00.600]  get there. They're not going to get there. If Trump just don't step on his foot. If he
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:05.760]  just plays straight and play smart. Now, I was disappointed last night, Alex, you know,
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:10.520]  they had asked me, I had sent them stuff that they, you know, Trump could have used to draw
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:16.840]  Hillary into one of her fits of rage, but they didn't. He should have. He should have.
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:20.440]  And by the way, he paused and said, I had a lot of stuff that I was going to bring out.
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:28.600]  That's right. Yeah. That's right. Now, the thing that was significant, Alex, was what
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:33.120]  you and I have been trying to say to everybody since day one, didn't be one thing if Donald
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:37.800]  Trump was running against Hillary, Rodham Clinton, that'd be one thing, but he's running
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:44.480]  against Hillary. He's running against the mainstream media. He was running against the moderator.
[1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:48.400]  I mean, you talk about David and Goliath, he was up, you know, he was.
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:53.040]  So isn't that why he probably really won? Is they overdid it and showed their hand?
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:56.840]  You know, if they're, let me tell you, one of the TV networks did a thing where they
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:47:03.760]  pulled in 20 quote, unquote, uh, non-committed people. And then at the end of the debate,
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:09.760]  they asked them now, after this debate, who would y'all vote for in 18 of them said Hillary?
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:13.520]  Now, Alex, you and I have been around long enough, maybe the audience hadn't.
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:18.320]  Let's say the chances of, yeah, the chances of that network pulling in 20 people that
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:23.680]  were really middle of the road, didn't care is none. The Clintons chummed that audience.
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:28.320]  I'm surprised they even let two people say that they were for Trump. But that was all
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:32.920]  Rick. Everything you see today, folks, please, I beg you.
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:38.760]  Oh, see it in admits, they sampled almost double more Democrats in their 500 person
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:42.720]  poll than they did Republicans. I mean, that's totally skewed right there.
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:47.400]  It's skewed for, he gets that folks, everything you see on the mainstream is a lie. You know,
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:51.920]  when they talk about facts, fact checking Trump, you notice they didn't fact check Hillary
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:55.480]  that much. Check Trump 40 plus times and her six times.
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.880]  Well, let me tell you, you want to fact check Hillary start with the first time she opened
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:04.720]  her mouth till the last time she closes it. The truth was saying, I'm going to come out
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:11.320]  of your guns extra judicially. Yep. And listen, Alex, I heard you talking about
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:16.280]  what his name getting pulled off the Michael Savage live on Michael Savage. You know,
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:20.120]  Alex, you and I have been talking about this day coming for years and years. And I know
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:23.680]  sometimes people say, well, y'all talk about it, but it never happened. Yes, it does happen,
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:28.360]  but it takes time to materialize. It's happening right now. I've got them circling around us
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.480]  right now. Oh, you bet. And let me tell you, come October 1st, folks, it's going to be
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:39.040]  hard to get news on the internet. And let's talk about that. But let's just remember,
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:44.080]  they're bold enough to spend 600 million in the last year alone to try to get cop killing
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:48.640]  operations going. We're dealing with hard core criminals. Everybody better decide which
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.480]  side they're on. You know, I got tickled last night here and Hilary talked fondly of her
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:59.800]  dad's little business making draperies. Did I miss something? And I got this from Bill
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:04.320]  Clinton. One of the reasons Bill told me he married Hilary was because of her dad. He
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:09.320]  wrote him. And I said, why Bill? And he said, well, don't you know? And I said, no, I really
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:17.640]  don't. He said, well, after Al Capone, he wrote him and Dan Rostinkowski took over the
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:22.800]  Chicago mob. They were running the Chicago mob. And she says he was just a little great
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:27.720]  premaker. And that's why Hilary always has such a penchant for getting her enemies killed
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:32.440]  is because she's Chicago mafia. That's why, yeah, that way, I don't know. Folks don't
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:37.960]  even know that the top families in Texas were all the former Al Capone heads. They don't
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:42.200]  understand it. Coen ran the whole country. And people just don't know that. They don't
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:46.920]  know it. And that's what's killing us, Alex. There is a huge group of people. What you
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.040]  guess, I guess you call them the millennials. I'm trying to live long enough to tell them.
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.840]  But there's a large group of people, Alex, that don't know the Clintons and the media
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:03.280]  is doing extra, extra, extra overtime to make sure people don't know the truth about Bill
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:07.680]  Clinton and his time in office that don't know the truth about Hillary. You know, Trump
[1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:11.040]  said he felt, you know, he didn't do it because he didn't want to do it in front of Chelsea.
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:16.080]  And I got what about the women Clinton rape that I covered up for him over? What do you
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:20.760]  think about those women in their lives? Oh, I love when he was talking about how he's
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:23.960]  mean to women. I mean, he could have just come right back with, you're going to tell
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:27.160]  me about being mean to women with all the stuff you've done, how you've covered for
[1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:31.400]  Bill. I don't know why he didn't go after her. Well, and I certainly don't know why
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:36.400]  didn't at least bring up the point that when guys like Larry Nichols and these women were
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:42.120]  coming out back during your husband's administration, if you care so much about women and women's
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:47.520]  why did you personally lead the bimbo eruption? All right, let's talk about what you expect
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:51.360]  to happen next. What are you doing the next debate? We got 41 days of the election. Larry

[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:23.200]  today than ever before, explains Frank Pates, a spokesman for the company. Natural disasters,
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:28.600]  Paris attacks and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:34.640]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage.
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:39.560]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping and has been rated four and a half
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:44.440]  out of five stars by customers who paid full price. But listeners who act quickly can get
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:51.040]  it free, just cover $9.95 shipping. Go to freefood2.com right now. Supplies are limited

[1:53:56.040 --> 1:54:08.480]  I don't normally waffle and I'm not waffling because time will tell. We've got to look
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:14.000]  at the demographics, but I always just go with what I think is right because I'm not
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:17.560]  here to play along with the political system. I'm here to change it and educate people.
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:20.280]  But if Trump's going for the 20% that are on the side that Larry Nichols always talks
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:25.160]  about and they admit that's what they're doing, those are mainly folks that really
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:29.040]  aren't politically informed and they just want to see somebody act nice and act friendly
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:34.480]  and not look so threatening and look more presidential. So I think that's what Trump
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:40.920]  was trying to do and I think they would have won the debate because he was too nice if
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:45.440]  they didn't gang up so bad and Lester Holt attacking him 40 plus times, Hillary only
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:51.560]  six times and those weren't even attacks. I think the fact that it was so unlevel, Trump
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:57.560]  wins because of that and maybe he's a genius because of that. I just think he got to dance
[1:54:57.560 --> 1:55:02.880]  with Ubrunga and he should have probably been more aggressive, but time will tell. Larry
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:06.200]  Nichols with them taking Michael Savage off the air and we're going to contact him. I've
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:10.200]  been busy during the breaks, but I'm going to try to get ahold of him and all the other
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:14.320]  censorship going on. I mean, clearly we're entering an end game. What else are you watching
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.200]  for, Larry? Well, the main thing I'm watching for is what I've told you before. We're at
[1:55:19.200 --> 1:55:23.440]  the actual beginning of the beginning of the end and they're closing the loop. They're
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:30.240]  closing it in tight and what they're going to do to Trump is going to be terrible. I
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:34.640]  mean, they're just going to load up on him like you've never seen. Now, if Trump were
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:39.280]  smart, what he would do if they're going to do, this is your life going back to Trump's
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:46.440]  past. He has somehow, Alex, got it shifted on. Hey, you want a real screwed up past?
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:52.560]  Look at Bill. Look at Hillary. I mean, you've got, you've got every kind of crime committed
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:57.240]  during his administration as governor, every kind of crime committed during his administration
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:01.680]  with Hillary right there beside him during his presidential administration. So much so
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:08.240]  that he was impeached. It's amazing. Nobody even brought up the word Hillary. Do you realize
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:14.040]  your husband was impeached? But they don't bring it up. They don't bring it up. So Trump's
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:20.440]  got to get himself gathered up and he's got to try to win that 20% by trying to get that
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:26.800]  20% to know the real truth about the Clintons. If you, you know, let me just tell you something
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:33.480]  that hurt really bad. When they had the riots and the shooting in North Carolina, the world
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:38.320]  ended for Hillary. The world ended because as of that moment, all of the stuff about
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:45.400]  emails, all of the stuff about her health just went away. It just went away. And now
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:49.520]  she's starting out clinging all over again. That's right. And he's got to bring it back.
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:53.560]  I would have said over and over again. Listen, Hillary, you've been part of the power structure.
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:59.320]  You set up this mess. You're the one that sold the country out. I represent change. Very
[1:56:59.320 --> 1:57:03.880]  simple. Over and over again, she gets all the big money from a special interest. I get
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:08.480]  none of it. I'm a populist. You have nothing to lose. Vote Trump.
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:15.520]  Well, that, and I'm going to give you all something to really believe in. This is true.
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:20.720]  Something that you can believe in, I guess the best way to say it. Hillary has spent
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:28.680]  hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising. Trump has spent virtually nothing in comparison.
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:35.560]  They are technically tied. Now, what you're going to see, Alex, coming up in the next
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:41.480]  46 days or how many days are you going to say 41, you're going to see massive polling
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:45.880]  manipulation, just like you were talking about. They're going to put all these fake polls
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:50.880]  to make it look like he's slipping. Yep. I mean, and it's, it's all going to come
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:56.480]  together just like it always does with the Clinton plan, the one that I helped put together
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:01.680]  for the broken coalition strategy. You bet. There it is. Look, Larry, stay there. Larry,
[1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:04.960]  let me do five more minutes with you. Then I promised all the callers. I'm going to write
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:10.360]  to you then all the clips and Paul Watson history is happening. We'll be right back
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:15.960]  on the other side. Understand, though, even if Trump loses, I believe he's going to win.
[1:58:15.960 --> 1:58:21.720]  We win by injecting real issues and nationalism and exposing the globalist. Stay with us.
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:28.800]  Our number three trade with only 41 days left in the countdown for the election. It's now
[1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:40.040]  more critical than ever to spread the word. This is the info war. Thank you for listening
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:50.880]  to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today. Hey, everyone. Farms is Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright

[1:58:55.440 --> 1:58:59.440]  all heard the shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care,
[1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:04.960]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart
[1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:09.200]  disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing
[1:59:09.200 --> 1:59:13.240]  with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative
[1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:16.520]  disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to

[2:00:04.360 --> 2:00:11.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? You want answers? Well, so
[2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:19.640]  does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:22.480]  Alex Jones. All right, Larry Nichols is going to write
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:25.440]  a shot down for us to take calls in the next segment. I'm going to write to your calls
[2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:30.600]  and start the next segment. Leslie and Matt and Terry and Sean and everybody else. And
[2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:35.120]  I've got a bunch of clubs. I'm going to start getting into them in the next segment as well.
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:41.920]  But Larry, I mean, this thing we're seeing in, I covered in the last hour, the stories
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:51.160]  on infowarsteam.com, sampled 40-something percent Democrat and then 26% Republican. Here's
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:55.600]  the actual numbers. 41% of the people they sampled were Democrats, 26% Republicans.
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:01.240]  Then they've also been caught calling independence, independents that are really Democrats. So
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:05.160]  the sample's even bigger. They did that to give her a 60-something percent win. Every
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:10.600]  other poll showed her way behind. So explain this to me, because you've been on the inside
[2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:14.920]  of this. They had more accurate polls up to the RNC. He gets 10, 15 points ahead. Then
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:20.280]  they put out a bunch of fake polls. You can go to the methodology and see that it's fake
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:25.580]  and they're panicking. And then all of a sudden, he surges back even against fake polls. That
[2:01:25.580 --> 2:01:30.200]  would mean he's probably 10, 15 points ahead, or correct me if I'm wrong. So why ever ease
[2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:36.000]  off the fake polls if they were working? Because they did narrow the gap and create some perception.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:41.080]  Why not keep the polls going all the time? Or is he really just way ahead of her?
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:44.680]  Well, Alex, what happens? Well, first, let me finish what I was saying. The thing to
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:49.560]  believe in is exactly that she spent hundreds of millions. She spent virtually nothing in
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:56.360]  their technically dead heat if he's not even ahead. So that ought to tell you, Alex, you
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:01.720]  and programs like yours have just done an incredible job to absorb the people out there
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:08.360]  that know something's wrong. Now, remember, the 20 percent, here's what the Clintons know.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:16.560]  They know that that 20 percent in about 10 days is going to start making its mind up.
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:20.480]  Most of them, believe it or not, will make it up about a week before the campaign and
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:26.720]  for the election. And what they always do, what you can count on is they're going to
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:34.000]  go the undecided or don't care people, they're going to vote with the last poll they see
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:37.600]  and because they don't like to think, Alex, that they're wasting their vote. They want
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:42.880]  to bet on a winner. You got it. There it is. And then Hillary's problem, you mentioned
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:48.120]  the broken coalition, folks. Broken coalition is something we set up years ago, realizing
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:52.880]  that the blacks didn't have enough votes to win, the queers didn't have enough to win,
[2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:58.120]  the hippies, hippies. But when you put them all together, you got enough to win. Well,
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:03.600]  Hillary was soft with the blacks. They don't like her. They're not turned on by Hillary.
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:09.720]  And that was what was scaring them. Well, out of the blue comes Charlotte, North Carolina,
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:14.400]  and they're going to use it to galvanize the blacks, you see. Now, I'm not saying they
[2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:19.320]  calls it, I'm just saying. Sure. Absolutely. That's what Soros admits in his emails. That's
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:26.480]  the plan. I mean, look, Soros is paying these agitators to come into these places when these
[2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:30.800]  things occur. Oh, they admit we have video. It's buses come in. Yeah, that's what it's
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:36.320]  about. That's what it's about. If they can fire up the black community over this white
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:41.120]  lives matter or whatever, if they can fire them up, they're hoping they can motivate
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:46.080]  them, Alex, to come out and vote. Can't the American people break through the mind control
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:50.800]  and see the rigging? I mean, I think that happened. Polls show that he's actually boosted
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:55.640]  by this debate. The thing that's the thing that's happening, Alex, that I've been waiting
[2:03:55.640 --> 2:04:01.720]  for for years in America, we've got a problem. We don't seem to get energized or get involved
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:07.080]  until something hits us in the pocketbook. Personally, when it's hitting people now,
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:11.480]  people are seeing it. It's real. It's in their bank account where it's or it's not in their
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:16.600]  bank account. So more and more people are waking up and saying something's not right.
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:20.560]  They haven't been attended. So they don't know what it is exactly, but they know something's
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:26.560]  not right and info wars and drudge and savage and you and others are there. So we're getting
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:30.540]  big. The old media is dying and they're panicking and they want to shut us down. So they just
[2:04:30.540 --> 2:04:37.760]  shut savage off. I guess I'm next, huh? You will be. You will be at it. I'm worried about
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:42.200]  October 1st for you. That's what I worry about. Let's talk about that and go to phone calls
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:45.480]  and come back. They're handing us over to the Internet and they say that the censorship
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:48.240]  is already massively increasing. I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight. They're going
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:51.720]  to misrepresent that next week. So we said, Oh, the Internet's still here. They said it
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:56.400]  wouldn't be that. You watch. You will hear that next week. Watch. That's how they change
[2:04:56.400 --> 2:05:04.760]  that. All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects
[2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:09.560]  in their constitutional confederation, not from want of honor or virtue. So much is from
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:14.520]  the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation. Those are the words
[2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:19.360]  of John Adams, the second president of the United States. Are you ignorant of the private
[2:05:19.360 --> 2:05:24.160]  Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency? Do you understand how
[2:05:24.160 --> 2:05:30.040]  a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[2:05:30.040 --> 2:05:33.960]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American
[2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:39.240]  people or for that matter? What kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money? Will you
[2:05:39.240 --> 2:05:44.600]  be a slave or will you be free? Adams also said Liberty cannot be preserved without general
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:50.040]  knowledge among the people. Join the info wars, spread the information, educate yourself
[2:05:50.040 --> 2:05:59.360]  and others. The truth shall set you free. Renfowars.com I'm David Knight. Over the years, there

[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:06.680]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[2:07:06.680 --> 2:07:12.040]  scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[2:07:12.040 --> 2:07:17.600]  water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:22.160]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:28.400]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:31.320]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things
[2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:35.480]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:40.320]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:44.040]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[2:07:44.040 --> 2:07:47.880]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:53.400]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr.
[2:07:53.400 --> 2:07:56.520]  Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this
[2:07:56.520 --> 2:08:06.760]  great product.
[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:16.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones. I'm going to be honest with
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:25.560]  you. Studying history, living a lot, seeing a lot of things. And then looking at our current
[2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:29.840]  strates, we have a very dangerous elite that are out of touch, that are mismanaging things,
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:33.880]  that are using old systems of control that are basically built into the population, but
[2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:38.640]  then the elite can't control themselves. And they are escalating the world towards financial
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:45.640]  and cultural and military ruin. And that's pretty much agreed to now across the board
[2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:52.840]  by top analysts. What we talk about now is quite frankly, passe. But I'll tell you, in
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:09:00.440]  this climate, I'm just getting right with God. And I'm just giving it all to God because
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:05.720]  when you actually deal with these people, when you live in the trenches fighting them,
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:13.720]  you just ask yourself, man, how did this universe produce trash like this? And these people
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:23.000]  are out to get us, folks. They are BAD people. They are loathsome. And I was thinking about
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:28.040]  this morning, I'm so sick of looking at Hillary Clinton. I'm sick of these criminals invading
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:31.160]  my life. You know, if I got bad neighbors, I could move or if somebody turns out to be
[2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:36.280]  a bad person, I stop associating with them. They're not in my life. You know, you got
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:40.960]  some horrible husband or wife and you divorce them. Hey, that means I've never talked to
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:48.920]  you again. Bye-bye. But that's not the case with politicians. And these elites and these
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:57.880]  people, Mark Cuban, hopping around looking like a demon, Hillary, they're animated by
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:05.640]  just these crazy power trips. And they're dangerous. And they want to run our lives.
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:08.360]  We're on your calls right now with Larry Nichols, season of Rock Shotgun was for much
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:12.280]  of the hour, popping in, giving his take on things. Really expert take. The guy's really
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:18.120]  smart obviously. So we're going to talk about stuff with callers, Michael Savage.
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:23.000]  It's like a punch in the stomach this morning. I got up and learned he was taking off WABC
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.800]  and then he complained about it. He was criticizing Hillary's health and saying, I think she's
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:31.960]  got Parkinson's. There's emails that say she's got, getting Parkinson's medication in
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:36.000]  her own email. They took him off WABC and then he got, he complained about it on there.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:40.480]  They took him off 400 plus other stations. And you know, this is personal to me because
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:44.520]  he was just on air with us last week on Skype. I mean, right here in the studio on that TV,
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:51.440]  I was talking to him during the breaks and he was really, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:55.160]  even before he got on during a three minute break, but I was talking in front of us, you
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:11:00.360]  know, about what was going on to his assistant. And then he brought it up to me and I'm just
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:04.160]  sitting there hearing this.
[2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:09.080]  And so it's not, it's not like even cool. You know, it's like upsetting. This is military
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:15.520]  stuff. This is, this is real. This is, this is our country in trouble with controlled media.
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:20.640]  And Dr. Drew being fired for daring say Hillary needs help in a loving way. This is dangerous.
[2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:24.760]  This is dangerous when the press goes along with this. And it's like, yay, Michael Savage
[2:11:24.760 --> 2:11:30.160]  is off the air. Yay. Yippee. Woo. We're all in lockstep, screwing over everyone. Oh, we're
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.600]  so, they're getting ready to take your bank accounts to ditch the dollar. They're gearing
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:42.160]  up for martial law admittedly. They're bringing in the most hardcore dangerous jihadis. Definitely
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:47.400]  a sleeper cell invasion. And I'm just sitting back now going, I think stuff's worse than
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:51.880]  I even thought. They're just announcing you're not going to have cars within five years.
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:55.840]  We're going to take all these big roads and make them driverless car only and ha ha ha
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:06.680]  I mean, I've got an article here. I'm going to pull it out. Hillary has 99 plus percent
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:14.040]  of big corporate giving. It's never before happening. The billionaires and the elite
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:21.720]  are giving nothing to Trump. I mean, that is the certification of he's our man. You
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:27.520]  don't like this ruling class. These people are throwing the kitchen sink at Donald Trump
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:32.120]  right now. I don't know. They're both bad. And exactly what Larry Nichols just said.
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:40.400]  I'm on your calls. 20% don't care who gets in. They want to feel like they're a winner.
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:42.960]  Like when you know your team's going to the Super Bowl and they've got better odds to
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:47.560]  win until you go out and buy a jersey. In fact, they were never your team. You just, you just
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:53.760]  want to feel like you're a winner. These people are horrible. And there's a sick side of me
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:13:00.720]  that sits back and goes, I'm not stupid. I'm going to be pretty much okay in this situation
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:05.200]  no matter what happens because I know what's going on. The only danger I'm in is trying
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:12.200]  to save all these idiots. I can go off and just run a moral business somewhere and make
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:17.840]  more money than I make now. I mean, I can do it. I've proven it. I've been paid $800
[2:13:17.840 --> 2:13:23.480]  plus thousand dollars for one voiceover. I mean, I can do cartoons, movies, you name
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:30.400]  it. I can do, I'm not bragging, but I can walk away right now. And I can do national
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:37.240]  voiceovers and have no employees and, but I don't do it because it's totally empty.
[2:13:37.240 --> 2:13:42.280]  But then I sit, look at snot-nosed, arrogant people that don't care, attacking me and our
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:46.520]  guests and people that are valiantly fighting and just sitting there like everything's a
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:51.400]  big joke and it makes me want to throw up. We're going to James and Leslie and Matt
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:53.840]  and Terry and Sean right now. I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time
[2:13:53.840 --> 2:13:57.360]  to get to everybody in this segment because soon I was going to be a show soon. I mean,
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:03.040]  I'm being honest with you folks. This country's in a lot of trouble right now. And it's so
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:07.080]  real now. It's almost like a joke. It's like I'm up there at the gallows with a rope around
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:10.520]  my neck and the public's, you know, picking their nose out there. I think it's all funny
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:16.120]  when they're going to be marched up here next. And a certain point is just like, wow,
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:22.520]  this really sucks. But the good news is we've pushed them so hard they're having to pull
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:31.520]  people off the radio because they know Trump's really way ahead of Hillary. And we forced
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:34.960]  them to talk about election fraud. They said it didn't exist. And a month later said it's
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:38.400]  the worst thing in the world. The Russians are taking over. We've got to federalize everything.
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:41.880]  I mean, we've got these crooks panicking, but they are crooks that are used to doing
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:50.560]  whatever they want. I mean, you look at Hillary and you look at Obama, they are Chicago mafia.
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:57.120]  And let me tell you, the Chicago mafia is the worst there is. The sex slavery, the
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:06.560]  little kids, the stuff they do. And that's who runs us is people that just hate you.
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:10.640]  I'm sorry, Larry, just briefly, I promise to go calls, but just, I mean, I'm all over
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:14.320]  the map here. It's just like we're here. It's happening. People say it's never gonna happen.
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:21.320]  It's happening all over the U.N. taking over the Internet in four days, brother. We bring
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:27.840]  Larry Nichols back up, please. Are we losing? He's open. He must have stepped away. Yeah,
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:31.400]  I'm here. I mean, they're taking over Larry. I want to go to these calls, but I mean, other
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:37.840]  points you want to add the U.N. takeover, you know, Alex, we're in trouble deep. And the
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:44.120]  only thing that I would tell everybody listening to our voices right now, they can't take
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:50.200]  this country from us. They're going to steal it. And every one of you listening to me,
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:54.240]  you know, I'm, I'm fighting, you know, that Alex, I'm fighting to be here long enough
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:59.400]  on this planet to be able to fight in this thing. They're going to take it from us, but
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:04.160]  we've got to fight in the first thing that everybody's got to learn is don't let them
[2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:09.920]  shut your mouth. Don't let them shut your mouth. By that, I mean, don't let them keep
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:14.560]  using political correctness on you so that when you're talking to others, you're afraid
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:20.440]  to tell the truth. Get out of the comfort zone or die. That's right. Now, you know,
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:25.120]  guys, I'm telling you, I've been telling you, but if you can't see it now, you're just
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:30.920]  not looking. They're coming after us. They're coming after us. Now that sounds scary and
[2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:38.680]  all crazy, right wing nut stuff. Look, open your eyes. Look, Michael Savage, they like
[2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:43.920]  you're saying they just yanked him off there. They have the power to yank any of us off
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:48.560]  of anything. They have the power to come to your house and rest you for any cause they
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:54.080]  want to come up with. And by the way, Savage is a big test right now. And to see if there's
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:58.480]  going to be any retaliation. Sure enough, sure enough, they're going to see what the
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:03.080]  people do and what scares me because I'm afraid a lot of people are just going to switch channels
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:07.320]  and go to some other problem. That's right. They don't appreciate the fact that this is
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:15.000]  an absolute war. That's right. And dear God, I don't know what else to say. I don't know
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:20.920]  what else to do, Alex. I hear you, man. I hear you. I just, I just, it's the nastiness.
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:25.720]  You know, Hillary, I mean, why are they so evil? Why do they hate everybody? Let me tell
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:29.640]  you one thing. Why do they do the worst stuff to the black communities and then sit there
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:34.720]  saying they love them? I mean, it's so sick. Well, let me tell you, it goes back to a Christmas
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:39.600]  gift I got. The first election I worked with Bill Clinton, getting him elected governor.
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:44.200]  When it was over, I thought he'd give me a Cadillac because there was no way he called
[2:17:44.200 --> 2:17:48.280]  me. He said, he wanted me to come over. They had a special present for me. And I thought
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:52.600]  the man was going to give me a Cadillac because it was quite a deal to get him elected. I
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:59.200]  got there. And what I had told Bill all during the campaign is to read the book Moncombe.
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:05.440]  And in that book, it proves that if you tell the same lie over and over and over and long
[2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:09.640]  enough, and that's the only thing that gets out, it becomes true.
[2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:12.320]  So you gave him my struggle by Adolph and Lewis Hitler.
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:16.480]  Yeah. Well, actually, he gave me for my big Christmas gift for getting him elected the
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:20.520]  first time. He gave me an autographed copy of that book and I needed it like a whole
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:22.520]  year. I'd rather have had the Cadillac, but
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:25.440]  Wow. He gave you a sign one by Adolph Hitler.
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:27.160]  No, one no sign by him.
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:29.160]  Oh, that's worse. Yeah, I guess.
[2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:33.760]  But anyway, that's what they're doing to us now, Alex. That's what's happening. That's
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:39.440]  why the black community is so, so susceptible to all of this. They just keep hearing it.
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:41.800]  They've been programmed from birth.
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:45.520]  That's right. And think about it, guys. If you think I'm not telling you the truth about
[2:18:45.520 --> 2:18:50.560]  this, look at Black Lives Matter, the whole premise in Ferguson for the Black Lives Matter,
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:56.440]  you know, don't shoot hands up, don't shoot, all of that turned out to prove to be a lie.
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:58.760]  But you can't convince the blacks on the street today.
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:03.480]  Just like it's a black guy shooting the black guy with the black police chief in a Democrat
[2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:08.680]  run city. Why didn't they pick to riot over the innocent black guy shot in Tulsa because
[2:19:08.680 --> 2:19:13.600]  that lady got indicted. They want bad cases so they can keep it going forever while they
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:16.760]  discredit the black people on top of it.
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:24.880]  And then you look at the guy that was in Seattle, got it killed five people. They said he was
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:28.920]  in Kentucky. Well, yeah, you're a muzzle. You know, you're looking at a mausoleum and
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:32.240]  guys, I'm telling you, the minute I saw his picture, I told several people.
[2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:34.360]  And that's how they're going to get the guys. They're going to have, they're going to have
[2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:37.360]  hundreds of sleepers that'll start killing people at the malls and they'll say none
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:40.240]  of them are Muslims. Just like they wouldn't say the bombings in New York were, you know,
[2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:43.320]  a bombing. And then they're going to end up taking our guns.
[2:19:43.320 --> 2:19:49.720]  That's exactly right. And that's why it's incumbent on every one of us, not just you,
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:55.560]  Alex, not just me. It's incumbent on every person here in my voice. You're the only
[2:19:55.560 --> 2:20:01.520]  way we're going to spread the truth. They're going to keep choking down any alternative
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:06.400]  information sources. Let's pray that Alex stays around a little longer. They're going
[2:20:06.400 --> 2:20:10.800]  to keep choking them down. You've seen it now with Mike Savage. That's for real. They
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:17.600]  did it. They yanked him off. So the only way we're going to spread it is from us, person
[2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:18.600]  to person.
[2:20:18.600 --> 2:20:24.880]  And I want to say this, and then we've got to go to the calls. They've been real troopers.
[2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:28.760]  This broadcast, the films we've made, the videos we put out, what you've done and other
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:32.240]  great patriots they're evergreen. We don't just cover some story of the day and then
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:36.320]  move on. It's about understanding the larger system. If people save this on computers,
[2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:39.840]  save it on hard drives, save it on desk, they admit the new system, they're going to be
[2:20:39.840 --> 2:20:43.600]  able to erase all our stuff off the web. But let me tell you, in the future, you have friends
[2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:47.920]  over when this country's really deep in it and you show them what we said years before
[2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:52.960]  and it comes true, it'll be like gold. Okay, and I don't want to get to that point, but
[2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:56.840]  that's quite frankly how I've studied history. That's why we just get stronger, the stronger
[2:20:56.840 --> 2:21:01.000]  the enemy gets, even if I'm long gone or in a gulag.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:07.240]  Long after Larry's gone, folks, if the enemy gets its program in, this will be absolute
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:11.000]  kryptonite to them. That's why you've got to save this data and spread it, Larry.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:16.560]  Yeah. Remember, Alex, what did Hitler do? He burned all the books. What did Paul Popp
[2:21:16.560 --> 2:21:21.600]  do in Cambodia? I was there, I know. What he did is anybody that could read, anybody
[2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:26.760]  that could have any knowledge, he killed them. That's what they're going to do here, Alex.
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:30.120]  They're going to do everything. When they get control of the internet, they're not just
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:35.440]  going to take people off. They're going to erase history. And that's what you've got
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:36.440]  to preserve.
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:39.920]  And that's what the cloud can do. That's what they all want you on it. They can hit one
[2:21:39.920 --> 2:21:45.600]  button and release a program that will erase my voice or Larry's voice off of entire giant
[2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:46.600]  books.
[2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:52.440]  That's right. And you'll have hell proven that we ever existed, ever. Remember, Alex,
[2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:57.560]  this millennial generation that we're talking about nowadays, do you realize that's the
[2:21:57.560 --> 2:22:03.000]  first complete generation? The first, what they call the complete generation. It has
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:06.400]  not touched the way America used to be.
[2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:10.000]  It's not they've not climbed trees. They've not been in a fist fight. They've not kissed
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.640]  a girl under the apple tree. They just sit there plugged into TVs.
[2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:19.400]  That's it. You and I, our parents were connected to the way things used to be in America. They
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:24.320]  were connected to their parents. Our grandparents lived the American life that we thought we
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:30.200]  would all have. The millennials have never seen one word of it. And plus they're being
[2:22:30.200 --> 2:22:33.720]  socially engineered throughout all of the schooling.
[2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:40.200]  To where now when they come out of college, Alex, they know nothing about education.
[2:22:40.200 --> 2:22:44.080]  Their identity is the hate Western civilization.
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:48.480]  You betcha. They don't know what communism. Look, the majority of the votes cast in the
[2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:53.880]  Republican and Democratic primaries, the majority of the votes cast in that election were for
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:22:59.640]  an announced socialist and Hillary progressive, which is a simple word for communists and
[2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:03.480]  more people voted for it. Because you know what? They don't know what communism is. I
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:06.440]  had a young guy tell me, but that's just an old car.
[2:23:06.440 --> 2:23:13.240]  Oh, let me tell you, I always see rich college kids and Mercedes, you name it, with all the
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:18.240]  trappings of capitalism and they'll be wearing, you know, mouse shirts or hammers and sickles
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:22.680]  or they got tattoos of it on them. And they're just like it because they know it's evil
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:25.400]  and they think it's got power.
[2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:39.640]  Alex, it is confusing, but stay the course. Buddy, when you and I met in the nineties,
[2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:43.920]  I bet you never dreamed you would have the impact and the audience size that you have
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:44.920]  today.
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:48.040]  Yeah, and I'll tell you, it's not fun. That's what's so ridiculous. These people don't think
[2:23:48.040 --> 2:23:49.040]  they...
[2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:51.760]  If you'll remember, remember what I told you, be careful because you might get what you
[2:23:51.760 --> 2:23:58.160]  want. You get to be at a Larry Nichols and it is not fun to be a target and you are one.
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:23:59.160]  You are one.
[2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:05.200]  Well, it's not even being a target I'm tired of. I'm tired of the public being so weak,
[2:24:05.200 --> 2:24:09.640]  you know, and just letting themselves be run over because they think they can be delusional
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:14.200]  and decide they're not getting raped, but they are getting raped and it's just mind
[2:24:14.200 --> 2:24:17.960]  control and it's sick. Let's go to calls. You guys have been real trippers. In fact,
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:22.000]  I'm going to send every person on here, if they want it, a free Hillary from prison shirt.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.320]  Can you send me one of those?
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:29.760]  I will. And free bumper stickers deal with all of them. We're about to phase this out
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:32.720]  and I guess just go to Hillary the dictator shirts, but I guess we'll be shut down by
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:36.360]  them. So that's just the way America is now, I guess.
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:40.680]  Let's... Everybody on here, give us your info. We will send you a free Hillary from prison
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:44.800]  shirt or a bottle of colloidal silver from infowarslives.com. Whatever your choice is.
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:49.040]  Please, I know that's a lot of work for you, John, but if you'll get their addresses or
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:56.280]  give them... I don't want to... We should have some kind of free stuff email so people
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:24:58.720]  can send their email and who they were, but there's no way to confirm that. Just get their
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:02.840]  address and I appreciate it. Everybody's been holding more than an hour, which is everybody
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.600]  on here. James in South Carolina, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:12.760]  Alex, I'm going to start with... I want to plug your living defense. I am a disabled
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:20.560]  father of seven. I suffered from heartburn, excessive gas, just constant pressure. I bought
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:27.360]  your living defense. I live on a disability pension, so I have to make every penny count.
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:34.560]  I bought your living defense while I was on sale. Oh my gosh, I love it. Three days taking
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:40.720]  it like it says on the bottle, it goes away for months. When it starts to come back, I'll
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:45.600]  just take it again for three days, so this bottle could actually last me a couple years.
[2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:50.440]  Well, James, let me say something. I don't sell something unless I believe in it. Mother
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:56.720]  Nature that God gave us is light years better than any man can give us. It is such a game
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:03.960]  changer. Living defense is amazing. It is parasite removal. Most people have them. They
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:09.560]  won't tell you that because they just want to keep treating the symptoms. Joe Biggs started
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:14.520]  having gas in his stomach. He was going to go to the hospital and he thought, well, I'll
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:18.520]  take oxy powder. His stomach was blowing up. That condition, whatever it is, where you
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:24.360]  just have air in you. The oxy powder boomed and a few hours reversed it. I'm not saying
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:27.920]  this is to treat anything. You need to get doctor approval before you breathe air or
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:32.880]  drink water. I agree with the FDA. Mother Nature is not good. Vitamin C is evil. It makes
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:38.960]  her cast a point. It's consult your health practitioner. These are real products. I will
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:46.360]  not do something that I would not do to myself. I'm in the Texas hospitality. I thought everybody
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:50.640]  was like that growing up. I guess people aren't. If I love you, I love you. If I hate you,
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:53.960]  I'll tell you. Let me tell you something. I won't sell stuff for people to put their
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:58.720]  bodies that I don't absolutely bust my butt to make sure it's the best. Thank you for
[2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:03.440]  the plug, sir. What's your view on the debates, James?
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:08.800]  Now, the first couple of callers, I agree with them about the Fourth Amendment. I'd kind
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:15.880]  of like to hear Trump walk that back. Now, that being said, listen to what Clinton said.
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:22.120]  She has a plan to fight ISIS on the Internet. ISIS doesn't scare me on the Internet. She
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:27.520]  has no plan to fight ISIS on the Internet. She has a plan to bind the tongues of people
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:32.640]  like you, people like Matt Drudge, people like me, people like Larry Nichols. They want
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:39.160]  to bind our thoughts. They want to quarantine our thoughts. That's the most dangerous, sickening
[2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:42.640]  thing, and people want to nitpick Trump.
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:47.920]  That's right. He should have brought up the alt-right. I mean, she said in the fundraising
[2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:54.360]  letter, Larry, a month ago, that we have no right to exist. That is literal Nazi terminology.
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:28:01.120]  That is. And that's what she believes, Alec. She has believed that since the day I met her.
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:06.720]  I've told you the story about meeting Hillary the first time. That's who she is. And she
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:11.200]  can dress up. They can put makeup on her. They can try to make her look like better
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:12.200]  than she does.
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:13.200]  Mary Poppins.
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:19.120]  Yeah, but it is not. The real Hillary Clinton is the one that stood there in that hearing
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:23.200]  sentence or the hearing-owned Bengali and said, what, they're dead. What difference does
[2:28:23.200 --> 2:28:29.120]  it make? And I've seen her be that way about many people close to her that have died. She
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:31.880]  don't care. They don't care about nothing.
[2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:37.080]  Well, here's the, I'm not a hateful person, but let me tell you, there is a God, there
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:40.000]  is a devil, and Hillary Clinton's going straight to hell. I don't normally talk about that
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.600]  with people, but I think it's fair to say she is a demonically controlled person.
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:48.840]  Well, you know, Alex, I've told you before, and I never really put anything into it until
[2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:55.200]  more recent, you know, I used to have to cover for her to go out to LA with Linda Bloodworth
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:03.360]  Thomas to go to a witches church. Now, I don't know what a witches church does, but she told
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:08.120]  me she would just cover in both bases, but I believe she's made her mind up which one
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:10.600]  she wants to go with, and that sounds horrible.
[2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:15.320]  No, no, you think you're the only one that knows that, and I'm not stealing your thunder.
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:21.960]  Actually, I've seen it in a LA newspaper, but it was positive that she was at a coven
[2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:25.880]  church, and that she would travel out there and spend weeks with witches.
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:32.800]  Right? You would have been me having to cover up for that. In Arkansas, in the 70s and 80s.
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:35.120]  I mean, that was tough. We're in the 80s.
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:39.440]  Imagine, you're right in the middle of the Bible Belt, and meanwhile, you've got a black
[2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:44.800]  witch right there, just drunk on blood. Thank you, James. God bless you for the support in
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:48.200]  your family. We'll be right back with Sean, Terry, Matt, Leslie, straight ahead.
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:49.200]  Welcome to March.
[2:29:49.200 --> 2:29:52.600]  He'll give him a shirt. He'll send him some living defense. He gives everything.
[2:29:52.600 --> 2:29:58.920]  He'll send the GCN radio network. Make sure. Thank you. Living defense, everything.
[2:29:58.920 --> 2:30:02.960]  Russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in Syria, as long as the Obama administration
[2:30:02.960 --> 2:30:07.360]  keeps sending weapons to the ISIS-linked outnosed front. The Russian government said the militants
[2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:12.400]  are armed by tanks, APCs, field artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and heavy weaponry.
[2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:15.720]  And of course, they could have made these weapons themselves, nor could they have stolen
[2:30:15.720 --> 2:30:19.640]  all of them from the Syrian army, especially not the American-made tow missile that Jihadis
[2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:22.040]  used to destroy a Russian helicopter last year.
[2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:26.240]  The Russians also pointed out that the U.S.-led airstrike that killed 62 Syrian soldiers has
[2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:30.480]  directly led to ISIS gaining ground. In other words, the U.S. just served as ISIS's
[2:30:30.480 --> 2:30:34.880]  air force. The U.S. State Department has claimed the attack was an accident. However, facts
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:35.880]  point to the contrary.
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:39.520]  The region where the attack occurred has always been under Syrian army control, with no prior
[2:30:39.520 --> 2:30:40.840]  presence of ISIS.
[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:44.520]  CENTCOM even had the audacity to release a statement claiming they have not bombed the
[2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:48.400]  area in the past, but that's completely false. And let's say we're targeting the Syrian
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:49.400]  government.

[2:32:31.120 --> 2:32:35.120]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you. In short,
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:39.120]  the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying
[2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:43.120]  to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[2:32:43.120 --> 2:32:49.120]  But infowars live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[2:33:19.120 --> 2:33:27.120]  All right, Larry's having a problem with his phone. We're going to get him back on here in a minute.
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:33.120]  I think it's Cordell Scott or something. He's fighting really serious lung cancer.
[2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:41.120]  And he's a tough guy. We're going to bring him back on here in just a moment until he did get him back on the line.
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:55.120]  Speaking of products, living defense is so good that I should just get up here and say, you really need this product.
[2:33:55.120 --> 2:34:10.120]  I mean, we set about to produce with the top experts the most ridiculously, quite frankly, strong classic herbal system to flush parasites.
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:19.120]  And it's strong. But it's non-toxic. It's mother nature.
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:33.120]  And all I know is you take this, you take oxy powder, you take X2, you take some real vitality. It changes your life.
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:44.120]  I mean, in a way, it's almost bad because I was exercising twice as hard, three times as hard sometimes, five years ago, trying to lose weight.
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:54.120]  Because I hadn't worked out really hard. In like 10 years, I gained 90 plus pounds from 180 to almost 280, like 278, 279.
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:35:07.120]  And I'm already a husky guy. But I mean, it just, I don't know. All I know is the more of the stuff I take, the better.
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:12.120]  I mean, I sometimes want to work out twice a week now and I'm losing weight.
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:16.120]  Slowly, surely my muscles are getting bigger. It's ridiculous.
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:20.120]  I mean, I didn't have the bio-pQQ my body needed this DNA force.
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:30.120]  I didn't have the right amount of iodine. I mean, when I started, when I went on iodine four years ago, our first product, it's proprietary deep earth.
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:36.120]  Now it's a huge market in it. Nobody goes out and gets the deep earth type. It's actually real iodine. I don't get it.
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  Now there's iodine on all of the shells everywhere. People figured it out, but the medical information was always there.
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:51.120]  But people just didn't do their historical research. And groups said in about two, three weeks, you'll probably have detox.
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:56.120]  You're ready for your skin to get better. But first of all, it's going to come out, you know, your hair will grow faster.
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:01.120]  And I'm like, okay, yeah, right. Whatever, you know, I know supplements are important and you need them.
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:07.120]  And, you know, if I can have my own supplements, then I'm going to make enough money to actually fund the operation.
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:14.120]  You just can't do it with sponsorship. And there's some other good, you know, people out there and we still promote them to enforce health and enforce team.
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:20.120]  It is the most updated site for folks with the great longevity products. But I still wasn't always following it as a regimen.
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:27.120]  And then that iodine within a month, it was everything he said started happening. I mean, because I never had really oily skin.
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:35.120]  There was just stuff coming out of me. It was incredible. I suddenly had all this extra energy, stamina, libido.
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:39.120]  And it was because I didn't have the good halogen. I was bombarded with the bad halogen.
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  So I'm done talking about it. That's how we fund the operation. Speaking of Larry Nichols, he's battling cancer.
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:50.120]  He doesn't want me to talk about it, but it's an it's known. And that's how he funds himself and he gets the medical treatments he needs.
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:58.120]  And it's important for folks to support his work. He's out there working tirelessly. Make a donation at PayPal.

[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:13.120]  And a lot of folks are noticing and I want to write back to your calls that I'm a lot calmer than I normally am lately.
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:24.120]  I mean, I blew up some last week and it's because confirming we were right about the New World Order and then now seeing it all come out in the open
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:34.120]  and then watching things you'd never think would happen in America happen and watching the technocracy rise up and watching people basically lose their souls to TV
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:41.120]  and comic books and, you know, entertainment and just false reality is mind blowing.
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:51.120]  And so fear kind of leaves the equation and it's more of just what and you're more interested just in how people have been locked into this.
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  Let's go to your calls. Everybody that's been holding for an hour. I'm going to give you a free order for present chart or bottle of little silver just tell us.
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:02.120]  Give us your address. We'll shoot it out to you. And I appreciate. I'm sure the folks have been holding. So four more callers.
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:08.120]  Let's talk to Leslie in Florida and Sean and others. Go ahead, Leslie. Thanks for holding.
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:20.120]  Thank you, Alex. I just want to say one thing. I was very, very disappointed when I first turned on the and I saw Trump walked out with a blue tie.
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:29.120]  I'm like, this is he sending a message. Yes, he's sending a message that he's with the Democrats and then she was wearing red.
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:38.120]  Yeah, it's really confusing. And then I continue through in a debate. I'm like, why is he baby in this debate?
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:46.120]  Why is he just baby in this debate? Why he just don't hit her? And when she talked about ISIS, I was expecting him to hit her real hard.
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:54.120]  I expected her to shiver, shake and fall. Well, here's how I know Trump's for real. I've watched him on people have known him for years, 40 years.
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:39:03.120]  And I know about the family. I'm going to stop right there. I know for a fact. Okay, that his sons listen to the show, especially Donald Jr.
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  I know what's going on. Trump's for real. They always were red or blue ties. A lot of Republicans wear them.
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:20.120]  I think they probably did say to psychologically get Democrats to vote for you wear the blue. I don't think it was. Hey, I'm really on your team. But go ahead.
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:29.120]  But it's well, okay. I listened to him. But on the end, I don't know if I heard right when he said I will support you.
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:32.120]  When did he really said it? Or am I hearing wrong?
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  I missed that. We've got a whole crew that was here. I was covering it live. But half the time I had was spending literally. He did say he said I'll support you if you went.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:45.120]  Did he say that?
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  Yeah, that's right. Because that was actually in the news. And I think it's all for him to look conciliatory.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  And so you don't play with vipers in your pits. Alex, you don't play with vipers in your pits.
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:10.120]  No, I hear you. I think that he was basically showing people that he could be nice and friendly for her supporters that think he's a demon.
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:19.120]  And they say he's surging in the polls because of it. Time will tell. But she, look, her expiration date is over. She looked like an insane person.
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:25.120]  I mean, look at the image on screen. She walks around with this fake smile like this. In fact, let me try to get it right on TV. Here it is.
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:30.120]  I mean, they'll pause it and make fun of me, but I don't care. Here it is.
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:34.120]  I mean, she looks like a great white shark cresting out of the water, but I hear you, Leslie.
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  I mean, what else do you think about the situation now? I mean, he didn't bring up Benghazi. That's bad.
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:47.120]  Oh, he should. You see, I think if he hit Hillary, the truth, you will see Hillary start shivering, shaking, and pop.
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:51.120]  I agree. I don't think she could have taken it for 90 minutes of me to taking it to her.
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:56.120]  You know, she looked at him at first like begging that he wouldn't go after. I appreciate your call. I want to get Larry's take on what you just said.
[2:40:56.120 --> 2:40:59.120]  But first, I'm going to start getting to some of these clips and ma'am, stay on hold.
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:04.120]  I'm a city of a freehealer for presentation or colloidal silver, whichever you wish for holding over an hour.
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  Let's go to the clip of him during the debate saying that he's glad, you know, that he didn't go after her with some of the stuff he had, even though she was being nasty.
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:20.120]  So I think I think he was trying to be the big guy there. It was very clear. That's what he was telling us. Here it is.
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:33.120]  You want to know the truth? I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it. I just can't do it.
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:43.120]  It's inappropriate. It's not nice. But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:46.120]  They're untrue and they're misrepresentations.
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:55.120]  And then he went on further to describe it on Fox and Friends. We also described it after the debate in a little bit more detail.
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  Let's play that clip after the debate with Donald Trump on the floor.
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:03.120]  Anything that you wish you did differently?
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:17.120]  No, I'm very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn't want to say what I was going to say.
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:18.120]  Which is?
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:21.120]  Which is, I'll tell you, maybe at the next debate.
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:28.120]  Yeah, so I think he's setting it up now where people are going to demand he come out of the gates and now he'll have covered a really savagery. He's very sophisticated.
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:33.120]  Larry Nichols, I don't want to doubt Donald Trump here. Again, we have 41 days. We're going to discover this.
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  But what is your gut as an old hand and the guy that used to pretty much run the Clintons when they first got into office?
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:40.120]  What do you think?
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:46.120]  Well, I think they set him up to do just what he did by the way they went after that birther stuff.
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  I think he was put in a situation. I mean, I wish he would have hit her on it.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:43:00.120]  However, he got to realize how structured that event was where the moderator and Hillary were together.
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:10.120]  They had already set him up for that birther thing. So if he had come out against Bill, then they were going, yeah, see, here he goes again.
[2:43:10.120 --> 2:43:18.120]  And by the way, and by the way, a lot of people are thinking Lester Holt and her had actually been on the phone or scripted this. It looked very scripted.
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:28.120]  I mean, look, guys, I've done enough of these things to know a true debate where you have an independent moderator. That was not all they say is you have three minutes.
[2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:30.120]  You have one minute. They don't say anything.
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  Right. Well, you've got to understand up until Obama with what or what that lady's name was. I remember the big lady.
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:46.120]  But up until that point, moderators did not interject and do fact checking. That's absurd.
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:50.120]  That's right. No, no, they had Candy Crowley come in with a BS fact checking.
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:58.120]  Right. Right. So that's what you've got to watch now. This is how this whole thing has changed. Alex, I mean, it's all changed now.
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:04.120]  Now you've got as the end of the media sits there and you've got to fight the moderator.
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:15.120]  Exactly. It doesn't. In fact, they've ended debates in America because we don't have real debates anymore because you have a moderator that gets in the ring 40 plus times against Trump and then leaves Hillary completely alone.
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:19.120]  That's right. I mean, be just like a boxing match, right?
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  He should have gone after Holt then. He should have gone after Holt. He was the other guy.
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:27.120]  He should have gone after Holt. Halfway instead of Holt. Am I debating Hillary or you? Or is it both of you? You want to come up here?
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:34.120]  Well, it's not the job in a debate. In the school of debating, you can check it out for yourself.
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:44.120]  It's not the job of a moderator to intercede in the debate at all doing any fact checking or any checking. That's not his job.
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:51.120]  It's his opponent's job. But this is how they've changed the whole thing, Alex. That's why it's so hard to beat the Clintons.
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:56.120]  They have literally changed the whole.
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:44:58.120]  That's right. Let's go to Sean. A political system.
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:02.120]  Let's go to Sean in Florida. You're on the air. Go ahead, Sean.
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:04.120]  Hey, Jay.
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:06.120]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:15.120]  Listen, I'm really pissed off. I mean, I'm a Democrat for 28 years. I've got to commend you and I've got to commend Larry Nichols who played Chronicles.
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:22.120]  I believe he sued the Clintons. He got out of that mess because he knew what was wrong and I give him kudos for that.
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:27.120]  You brother, you're like in the crosshairs, but you are a tip of the spear for sure.
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:34.120]  Listen, let me get this off my chest real quick. On CBS News, you go right now on YouTube. It's got like 6 million views.
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:41.120]  It shows Lester Holt checking his mic because he couldn't hear and he kept, you know, it's on there. You can see it.
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:48.120]  And I looked on Drudge Report days before and they said no ear pieces at all for the moderator.
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:54.120]  It was against the commission and they went through it and ruled it out that he wasn't allowed to have an earpiece.
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:45:59.120]  It's totally ridiculous. We're in Cuckoo Land big time. This is absolutely absurd.
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:06.120]  He was being forced stuff, you know, to ask Donald Trump questions and try to fast.
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.120]  Well, did you notice he looked mad at the end and ran off?
[2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:18.120]  See that part, but I was watching what you guys were talking about your live stream and C-span, you know, while this whole thing was going on.
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:24.120]  And it's absolutely absurd when they say, you know, when they get away with this, that the moderator is not supposed to have an earpiece.
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  No ear communication whatsoever. Go back and look it up under Drudge. It's totally pathetic.
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:33.120]  Sir, we'll look into that, but Larry, I think that is the boomerang here.
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:39.120]  The total rigging, Hillary being given passes, Trump being nice, Holt still ganging up.
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  I think it is the rigging, the clear unfair playing field.
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:48.120]  I think that is the dark horse and all this that just blew up in their face.
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:59.120]  Well, absolutely. But I'll say this about Trump. Trump has got to understand this is going to happen to it and use it, use it, and he didn't.
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:10.120]  You know, he's got to say things to Hillary that are dammy as hell, but they're true and they cannot be disputed by even a friendly moderator.
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:21.120]  The color is right. He was getting cues from a researcher that was covering that thing as it was going on.
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:29.120]  Let me say it all just came together. I remember the article. It said that the commission said no earpieces confirmed last week.
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  That was final for the moderator so that they quote wouldn't be getting cues because it's famous that the media will jump on.
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:40.120]  It's come out and told people who are reporters to attack Trump on CNN, MSNBC.
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:49.120]  But let's put the article up on screen. We just found it. That is confirmed that they said that there would not be any earpieces for the moderators.
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:55.120]  But then they asked what about the candidates and the commission refused to answer that question and said we'll only do that.
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:59.120]  Basically, if we're sued, we're not going to release that information. Very bizarre.
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:07.120]  And then I remember, I'm getting ready, Holt's about three, four minutes late getting on and I'm saying they're working on his earpiece.
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:14.120]  I could see them. He took his jacket off just like I'm wearing one. They took his jacket off and then they put the earpiece on.
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:20.120]  I watched it on that TV set, eight feet from me. We've got to go back to last night.
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  Guys, it'll be like, let me think, it'll be about 803 or 802 into the tape. Try to find it right now, folks.
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  You will see where I go. Look, he's getting an earpiece put on. Look, his earpiece isn't working.
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  And they come in in front of everybody, take his jacket off, put the earpiece, clip it to the back of his collar just like mine is.
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:49.120]  And mine goes into the control room. Well, I wish somebody told me what to say, but they're going to tell me when the guest is ready, the guest's phone doesn't work, whatever.
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  But in this case, Holt wasn't supposed to have it, but he did. This is a major scandal.
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  So great point, Sean. I'm glad you point that out. This is Cloud Cuckoo Land. Larry Nichols, go ahead.
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:12.120]  Well, that's what I'm talking about, Alex. It's virtually impossible to go into these debates. That's what I'm trying to tell Trump's people.
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:22.120]  You can't go into these debates straight up. It's rigged. It's rigged. And it's rigged at every... You know, Trump should have seen that with the headteach.
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:33.120]  He should have stopped the debate right then. Now, you want to win president? Do stuff like that. Prove to the people where you stand that he obviously didn't see it or didn't care.
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:38.120]  Well, I'm telling you, they did it in front of everybody. Look, it's eight o'clock. Holt goes up. He's doing this. He's messing with it.
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:48.120]  He calls over technicians. He takes his jacket off. They replace it. He tests it. He sits down. They call him out. The thing's on. I mean, it's on video.
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:59.120]  Well, now it's on video, but let me tell you this. You can bring it out. You can bring the video out showing it. You can put the article up right beside it where it says it's not supposed to have one.
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:06.120]  And what do you bet? This is how it's rigged, folks. The mainstream media will not touch it with a 10-foot pole. You'll never see it on the mainstream.
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  That's how I can tell, and I've really put out something powerful. Total radio silence. No one will cover it.
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  Well, that's what we're up against, Alex. That's why I say it's up to us. We can no longer rely.
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  I hear you. Let's come back and talk about that with more callers. Sean in Florida, final comment, 20 seconds.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen, if you go on CBS News on YouTube, it has it. It's two minutes and 21 seconds. At 19 minutes in, it shows him chewing.
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:38.120]  He couldn't hear. He couldn't hear. He's popping in.
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  What's the name of the video? What's the name of the video?

[2:54:20.120 --> 2:54:24.120]  Everybody knows the good guy's loss.
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:33.120]  The poor stay poor. The rich get rich.
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:36.120]  Everybody knows how it goes.
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:38.120]  Everybody knows.
[2:54:38.120 --> 2:54:40.120]  Everybody knows.
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:43.120]  Oh, everybody knows.
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:52.120]  But why do the poor people stay poor? Because they want to believe people lying to them.
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  Like Hillary actually cares about it.
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  Broken feeling.
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  I mean, you can say, oh, I don't trust Trump.
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:04.120]  Hillary, you know what you've got. I mean, that is the establishment monster.
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:09.120]  By the way, we went to where the guy said this. I covered it last night about 802, 803.
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:12.120]  I go, what is Westerholt doing? Something's wrong with his earpiece.
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:14.120]  I wasn't thinking, hey, they're not supposed to have an earpiece.
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:17.120]  And then you see them, and then they come over, they're messing with his ear.
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:20.120]  They pull it off. They take his jacket off.
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:24.120]  So you say it again?
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  So what we're going to do right now for TV viewers and radio listeners,
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:31.120]  but I'll describe this for radio listeners, there's Westerholt saying, say it again, say it again.
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  You can hear him testing. Go ahead and play this audio from NBC.
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  Okay.
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:39.120]  Okay.
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  Oh my God.
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:43.120]  Yeah, hit pause. Hit pause.
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:45.120]  Back this up 30 seconds.
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:49.120]  He's saying, say that again, say that again. It is an earpiece, not a loth.
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  Say it again, repeat.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:56.120]  Now, the domain commission said no earpieces.
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:55:58.120]  He's clearly getting orders when he attacks Trump later.
[2:55:58.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  Okay.
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:04.120]  Say it again, repeat.
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  Okay, okay.
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:10.120]  Now he unhooks it. It's not working right.
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:16.640]  Just like mine, you know hooks it from the back here. He takes the jacket off the technician comes puts a new battery pack on and transmitter and
[2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:22.120]  Then replaces his earpiece. He sticks it back in his ear here. That's right. It's
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:26.520]  And again, I
[2:56:27.240 --> 2:56:32.440]  Guess they cut the audio because I don't want folks to hear this they figure oh my gosh Lester's live right now because this is a
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:36.240]  This was at eight o'clock. I mean it's supposed to be on everybody's watching
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:44.560]  And this is the pool feed that came from the Associated Press not from NBC NBC had its reporters on big NBC
[2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:47.360]  This is the feed. We were watching too. There were several of these feats
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:51.680]  That you could dial into and I was sitting here going. Oh, he's having a problem with your piece
[2:56:51.680 --> 2:56:55.720]  I can hear him going test test. No, it's having a problem again. Here. Yeah. All right. They take his jacket off
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:56:58.640]  Is there still no audio?
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:00.640]  Go ahead and pop the audio up
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:03.160]  No, it's open they cut his mic
[2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:07.040]  That's right because they cut the mic. Okay. That's what I thought and then he takes it off and
[2:57:08.040 --> 2:57:11.480]  Then they put the earpiece back in they clip it back on his collar and put it back on
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:19.240]  These people think we're such morons and again, I'm busy. You're busy. I was watching it last night. It didn't click
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:26.400]  He's that now listen, let's triple check this because maybe the debate commission changed its mind sometime late last week and said the
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:28.160]  moderator can have an earpiece
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:34.880]  But they wouldn't respond to lawyers that sent them letters saying hey, we covered this few days ago. Are you going to?
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:37.520]  have a
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:44.880]  Prohibition against earpieces for the candidates after that whole controversy that we started I simply asked the question. So that's Tuesday September 27th
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:49.880]  Today debate commission moderators cannot use their pieces
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:54.040]  Get off camera coaching
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:58:00.240]  Now are they saying that about the new debate coming up or are they saying that about the last ones?
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:02.240]  I remember last week when they said no
[2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:04.240]  No, that's Matt Lauer and
[2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:06.960]  Lester Holt
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:10.080]  Won't be permitted
[2:58:10.080 --> 2:58:18.040]  Wow a huge controversy and Paul Watson's about to come into the bullpen here out of the bullpen and this would be an article for him
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:21.760]  Well, this is this is incredible. I guess we get a Don Salazar somebody to write this
[2:58:21.760 --> 2:58:26.040]  But my gosh thanks to the caller he called in reminding Larry stay there
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:29.760]  I want to come back at your take on this how you got to go, but and then I'm gonna handle the time to Paul Watson
[2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:31.760]  But this is big. He's wearing an earpiece
[2:58:32.040 --> 2:58:39.280]  Prohibited Lester Holt NBC cheated. Well, who would have thought that this thing just got more rigged
[2:58:39.720 --> 2:58:47.040]  Wow, he was being flogged to attack Trump. Oh my gosh. They are desperate Wow Wow Wow
[2:58:47.040 --> 2:58:53.920]  Brain Force it's completely different try a bottle of it Rob do joins us you worked
[2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:58.320]  I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain for shit. I've been working all day
[2:58:58.320 --> 2:59:03.760]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 830. I was kind of run down
[2:59:03.800 --> 2:59:07.960]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[2:59:07.960 --> 2:59:12.160]  I got my bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later
[2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:18.480]  It's like being everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars people really love it read about it
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:20.280]  Find out why third-party?
[2:59:20.280 --> 2:59:27.600]  Neuphaceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off
[2:59:27.600 --> 2:59:31.680]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force
[2:59:31.680 --> 2:59:38.680]  I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find a
[2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:46.680]  Brain force and other game-changing products at info wars life.com or call 888-253-3139
[2:59:50.680 --> 2:59:53.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:59:53.520 --> 3:00:09.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:00:09.280 --> 3:00:13.200]  Okay, either way you cut it. We have the Associated Press. We have
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:19.320]  World Tribune. We have Newsmax and others last week saying the Commission states there will be no earpieces for moderators
[3:00:19.320 --> 3:00:22.800]  But then we dug deeper and Raquel Thalen found this
[3:00:23.480 --> 3:00:25.480]  From page 6 of New York Post
[3:00:25.640 --> 3:00:33.160]  The Commission or presidential debates will allow moderators wear pieces if they choose but the executive producer of the Commission with the only person
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:38.000]  In their ear so there's definitely a push that oh since we brought up earpieces with Hillary
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:43.440]  Oh, there won't be any earpieces the media says no earpieces then they say oh actually there will be earpieces
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:45.800]  So why are they obsessing over earpieces so much?
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:49.600]  We're gonna get to the bottom of this but Larry Nichols other points my friend
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:53.760]  Well, that's just an example Sean. That's incredible of you
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:00:57.240]  Thank you for seeing this and bringing it out because I sat there and watched the whole thing
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:00:59.640]  Just like you did Alex and I didn't put two and two together
[3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:01.400]  but
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:07.120]  If you believe that the earpiece was simply to whoever they said it was to you're crazy
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:11.600]  Lester Holt has no computer in front of him
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:16.640]  He had no way Alex to go with some of the facts checks questions that he
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:21.720]  Came that's what they want to make him look like the authority when they've got a panel of six people in every area
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:27.640]  Military economic you name it to give him the question to give him the answer and that's why he would listen and then look up and go
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:30.520]  No, you didn't that's probably go. Yeah, exactly. Yeah now
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:35.600]  They're gonna tell you one other thing if you want to verify to yourselves that this thing was totally rigged
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:44.920]  There is no way Alex an honest debate moderator could have gotten through that entire debate without bringing up the emails
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:48.160]  In Bengali, that's right. No, no way
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:54.520]  That's proof of the rigging right there that is I mean you don't need to see anything else
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:02:00.400]  You don't need to hear anything else when they block those subjects you have proof that somebody
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:07.040]  Was blocking information that needed to be talked about those are the key issues with Hillary Clinton
[3:02:07.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  her truth about the email and
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:18.040]  Then even when Donald Trump brought it up Alex. He didn't pursue it. He didn't say well miss Clinton. What about those emails?
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:24.920]  So bottom line it was totally rigged what do you expect the next debate then I guess Fox it'll be rigged
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:29.320]  It'll be rigged. The only thing that I would hope to be different
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:32.520]  Yes, in the next debate Alex as I hope
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:35.800]  Trump will listen to people that know the Clintons
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:42.360]  You got to know how they are going to fight you and they're gonna hit you with everything from every angle there is
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:45.000]  You've got to be able to fight it
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:50.160]  And it Trump's got to do what Ronald Reagan did back in the 80s
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:56.680]  All right, the media is blocking him the media is shutting down everything the debate is the one chance
[3:02:56.680 --> 3:03:01.000]  Donald Trump has in front of a good size audience in the audience size will drop
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:06.440]  He's got to cut through with his real message and say the media has never let me talk. They distorted what I've said
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:10.000]  Oh, whatever you lady you're a liar. I was nice to you last time. That's right
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:12.120]  You just you know, you're done sit over there
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.080]  You know commit more crimes and just ignore them ignore them on a bit of moderate
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:23.240]  Just like I did with Pierce Morgan. He needs to steamroll him correct correct and remember he sat back and he was
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:27.560]  Nice to Hillary. I'm gonna call it that nice to Hillary this debate
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:34.360]  Every word out of that woman's mouth was cutting him and she was saying statements that were 100%
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:40.120]  Not true. She was quoting things that people had said that nobody's ever even heard of several of the people
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:45.080]  They've heard doing recaps of it the things she said Trump had said about certain
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:50.400]  Genders and everything else. They'd never and the media is not gonna fact-check her on that. Nope
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:56.160]  No, so he's got to go in and he's got to realize hey, I meant I'm surrounded by the enemy
[3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:01.520]  And when you're surrounded by the enemy a situation to which I haven't been in many times my mini
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:07.640]  But a few times too many when you're completely surrounded by the in the enemy. Here's what you do
[3:04:08.640 --> 3:04:10.440]  Start shooting
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:17.200]  Just start going just let them have it let them have it and then if people think he's not presidential
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:20.760]  Then you know what Alex? I don't want a president
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:27.400]  That's gonna take this kind of cheating and this kind of rigging. I don't want somebody that live. No, I hear you. Absolutely
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:34.000]  But the media is so hated he still won it because it was so staged they but but but it could have been a bigger victory
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:36.400]  I agree with you Larry. We'll talk to you soon. God bless you. Thank you, sir
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:38.280]  Thank you. Bye. Bye guys
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:44.400]  I'm gonna come back and briefly talk to Paul Watson about the incredible removal of Michael Savage second biggest talk show in the world

[3:04:51.080 --> 3:04:53.840]  The doomsday clock towards total tyranny just move closer to midnight

[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:24.160]  41 days left until the cliffhanger election
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:28.720]  I haven't talked to Paul today. I don't know his view on the debate last night
[3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:31.520]  I know he went out broke multiple articles exposing
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:37.800]  The fact that CNN admittedly rigged the poll. I mean they say oh in our methodology we
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:43.440]  Had people call in to us that are Democrat viewers 90%
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:47.360]  And then we asked them are you a Democrat and we sampled 41%
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:52.960]  Democrat 26% Republicans to then give Hillary a 15-point lead
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:08:59.520]  Which is less than the amount of points of Democrats they added to begin with they
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:04.000]  They add almost double the Democrats in the sample
[3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:09.200]  And then they wonder why Hillary wins by 15 points and
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:14.480]  Every other poll shows Trump winning and I think only because they ganged up on him. I think it's a mistake
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:16.480]  I'm just gonna I've really been thinking about it
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:23.560]  That he did not go after her on Benghazi or just any of and let her sit there and talk about how he's mean to women when
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:29.960]  These people are our total psychopaths. I mean the Clintons are scary people folks
[3:09:31.760 --> 3:09:36.880]  That's why I go up against them because they're bad people there's somebody's got it somebody's got to be a man around here I
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:43.160]  Don't say that you know to act macho folks. I'm in the arena with these creatures
[3:09:43.160 --> 3:09:47.680]  They hate my guts. They hated me 18 years ago
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:56.080]  Paul's got a lot to cover there's a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to in fours calm
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:00.080]  Is the front lines of this fight and I want to thank everybody that
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:06.240]  Praise for his support system spreads the links the articles but do not take for granted in fours. I keep telling you this
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:13.000]  They took Michael Savage off yesterday. He's on 400 radio stations. Probably the biggest show in the country probably better than limbaugh
[3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:17.560]  Second biggest admittedly. I mean you could argue late night coast-to-coast the second biggest
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:20.440]  But I mean they're all right there at that at that level, but he was hardcore
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:24.280]  CBS owns the syndicator
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  Savage called me a week ago
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:34.080]  That he was being censored and I didn't even ask to come on a show. I didn't and I didn't ask to have him air Paul Watson's piece
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:39.560]  He said he wanted to air our interview. Could he I said, well, of course you can anything you want
[3:10:39.960 --> 3:10:41.960]  Me cause the su-cost and he said well
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:46.000]  Now this is public. I'll tell you I'm gonna call him at the show. I'm gonna hold on
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:54.320]  That he's really getting jacked with my CBS he said up there at the top and
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:10:59.720]  That you know, he'd like to carry more what we do
[3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:05.920]  And then we had other chitchat I have Matt dredge just talked to him. He's listening right now driving blah blah
[3:11:05.920 --> 3:11:07.920]  We'll say out of Matt dredge. You know you say out of Matt dredge
[3:11:09.200 --> 3:11:15.960]  And then he went back to some other stuff and I'm not gonna even get into it because it's surreal though to be in the same
[3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  League as Michael Savage
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:22.200]  He was calling me. Well, you're the leader Alex. You're the Field Marshal
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:25.760]  We've kind of gotten this point where you're like actually Alex you go ahead and lead it
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:30.080]  I mean, and they've already taken him off the year and of course, he's not actually saying Alex you go lead it
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:32.280]  It's more like yeah, yeah, you're a Field Marshal, but
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:37.560]  It's got the point where actually you be the leader because this is not safe. I'm like, no, no, you're the leader
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:41.200]  No, no, no Matt dredge. You're the leader. I hear you. You'll be the leader
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:50.480]  It's this is big boy time. This is not pretend land. This isn't all the normal BS and media. Okay, I
[3:11:51.480 --> 3:11:53.480]  mean Paul Joseph Watson
[3:11:53.480 --> 3:11:57.160]  It does videos every day or so that on average get about a million views
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:11:59.680]  Now imagine you do a shoot a video in your house
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:06.760]  And you post it it gets a million views your big ones get 5 million your really big ones get what's your latest 18 million?
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:08.760]  It was 16 million yesterday
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:15.440]  They're censoring Paul all I'm telling people is we're making the Death Star trench run here. Just just and I'm not
[3:12:16.320 --> 3:12:21.560]  I'm not asking for you to go. Oh, thank you Alex. I'm saying we are on a Death Star trench run here
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:25.760]  And as you fund us and support us and pray for us you're putting
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  You're putting
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:35.080]  Power in our guns you're putting gas in our tank you are spiritually reinforcing us
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:39.880]  Yeah, I was estimating saying 18 million from 60 million it's 17
[3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:44.680]  Million four hundred and nine thousand and again, that's just one video
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:47.760]  We've got videos with 50 million views
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:52.440]  CNN doesn't have 17 million viewers in an entire day
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:12:58.800]  They don't get viral videos hardly ever anymore or that is it's a dog
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:03.480]  You know eating a cat or something or an alligator being eaten by a walk, you know by a snake
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:09.320]  It's not their propaganda. It's not their information. No one wants to look at them. They know they've already collapsed
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:11.320]  They're a facade that hasn't
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:17.280]  Completely blown over yet, but there's nothing behind you walk up like it's a house. You open the door and you're in a field
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:19.520]  It's a facade
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:25.880]  And we should Google the image of a house facade and put some images up for TV viewers in fours.com forward slash show
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:30.280]  But I'm putting everything I can on the line with a new free app and people say you say this costs
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:36.240]  $100,000. This is just some video feeds and text articles and blah blah blah. That's I'm saying when it's done
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:41.240]  we're gonna be adding more features to it in the next few months like live events and
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:49.000]  Updates and citizen activism and where people could actually be contributors and have their own subsections. I mean, this is
[3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:51.920]  Gonna be very big and very very important
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:57.800]  Point is info wars.com forward slash app get everybody know to download it because I'm not gonna make an attack run on the Death Star
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:14:02.280]  To play tiddling winks now a better analogy is the Death Stars
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:08.720]  Orbiting the planet to attack the moon on the far side, but when the Death Star comes around the planet, there's another
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:13.920]  Equivalent system waiting for it. So it's more like Death Stars are clearing the fire
[3:14:14.560 --> 3:14:21.040]  You understand, but you have to realize there is this battle happening right now between good and evil and for every action
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:24.080]  There's an opposite equal reaction. You are that opposite and equal reaction
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:27.520]  Paul Joseph Watson, I'm gonna punch out of here because it's hard to get you to do the show
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:32.000]  You're a busy man, and I just really want to say it's good to know you
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:35.480]  I'm really proud of the work you've done with us in 15 years. I'm proud of the rest of crew
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:39.760]  But I just want to say I'm proud that we don't serve evil. I'm proud. We're hard-working
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:44.600]  I'm proud we we work hard to tell the truth and I'm just proud to know you in this foxhole, brother
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:52.120]  Well feelings mutual Alex and you were talking about the media before we were talking about it yesterday
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:58.440]  They started to become self-aware as they crumble as they collapse and that Daily Show piece was very telling
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:02.400]  I only mentioned it briefly yesterday, but it's Trevor Noah of the Daily Show
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:09.400]  Cracking jokes about this conservative commentator, but then he stops and he gets all serious and he's like but wait a second wait a second
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:14.840]  This one video on Facebook by this conservative commentator got
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:19.560]  65 million views. That's more than network news. That's more than cable news
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:24.200]  That's more than readers of the New York Times and all the major newspapers put together
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:30.840]  They're freaking out. They're finally starting to realize that they're being crushed in the real
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:34.280]  They're coming around the side of the planet and another death star is aiming right at them
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:43.120]  Exactly and now, you know, the Washington Post is saying don't call as the media because 94% of Americans distrust the mainstream media
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:50.760]  And they're finally becoming self-aware and you know people like Lester Hall are part of the reason why 94% of Americans
[3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:56.720]  Distrust the media because I came on your show yesterday and said listen, he's being pressured by
[3:15:57.480 --> 3:16:03.640]  NBC internal operatives by the Clinton campaign. He wasn't the way we have your clip. I meant to give it to the crew
[3:16:03.640 --> 3:16:08.440]  Yeah, let's let's pull up the clip. I think we do have it of Paul Watson yesterday
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:13.360]  Predicting you talk for like 30 minutes on it, but you predicted Holt would do just this and I was wrong
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:16.320]  I was like no, he's a pretty good guy. I think he has integrity
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:21.080]  He was clearly being flogged by the earpiece to do what he was saying. You could see it in real time
[3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:28.520]  Exactly and the point is it wasn't pressure by the commission on presidential debates
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:35.760]  The actual authority that runs the debate because their executive director came out before and said that it's not a good idea
[3:16:35.760 --> 3:16:41.520]  For the moderator to serve as the encyclopedia Britannica. She came out and said that it was Robbie MOOC
[3:16:41.520 --> 3:16:48.040]  Clinton's campaign manager. It was internal NBC operatives that were putting pressure on him
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:52.520]  And this was in CNN before the debate to be a quote fact checker
[3:16:52.520 --> 3:16:58.160]  And that's why he ran off. He didn't like being put in the in the in the candy Crowley position
[3:16:58.160 --> 3:16:59.800]  So I'm sure he said if you want me to do this
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:05.000]  You're gonna have to give me fed information and it sounded like it turned into bullying by the end because as they got
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:07.520]  Closer to the end of the debate. They were attacking more and more
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:12.520]  Yeah, and facts checker is just a euphemism for activist moderator
[3:17:12.520 --> 3:17:19.480]  He challenged Trump six times on his answers. He didn't challenge Hillary once he interrupted Trump
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:24.640]  41 times compared to just seven interruptions for Hillary
[3:17:24.840 --> 3:17:28.600]  He's not supposed to allow the audience to make any noise whatsoever
[3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:35.120]  Yeah, he yet he let them laugh four times during Clinton's lame jokes Trump cracks one joke
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:42.840]  He immediately silences them and Alex the media came out a week ago and attacked Trump for saying that he was a democratic operative
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:47.640]  So another Trump conspiracy theory the Leicester Hall is a democratic operative
[3:17:48.040 --> 3:17:55.120]  Trump was proven completely right once again. He's a rhino. He was pressured into doing this. This was a rigged debate
[3:17:55.280 --> 3:17:57.280]  The fact prove it
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:03.400]  A lesser hold did not look like a happy camper though. So at least he's not excited about being evil like Megan Kelly
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:10.320]  Well, she seems to get off on it. Yeah, but you know, what what have we got coming up in ten days or so Anderson Cooper?
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:18.400]  Yeah, I just see it's next than it's Fox known admitted CIA officer aired one of the largest fortunes in the world
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:24.600]  Yeah, direct ties to the Clinton Foundation. So later on when I get on on the show
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:28.320]  I'm gonna go through a list of things that Leicester Hall didn't raise
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:33.920]  Didn't raise it's a list longer than a massive grocery list. So that's gonna be interesting
[3:18:33.920 --> 3:18:40.960]  But the bottom line Alex is, you know, Hillary helped launch ISIS and the migrant crisis as Secretary of State
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:47.400]  Trump on the defensive for saying Rosie had on old Donald's fat. I mean, how does that make any sense?
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:55.720]  Be honest with me. I know you will be I think he nearly won because they overplayed it overcooked it overstaged it
[3:18:55.720 --> 3:19:01.480]  It was it was so skewed that that's the only reason he's gone ahead in some swing-shake polls
[3:19:01.480 --> 3:19:08.680]  I still think that his advisors and this is not letting Trump be Trump. I think them saying, you know, don't be mean be presidential
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:12.520]  Another target of that 20% is undecided, but I just I
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:18.440]  Just really think this is this is not good. I mean, I think he won and maybe I'm wrong. What do you think Paul?
[3:19:19.600 --> 3:19:22.680]  Well, I think it gives him a lot of space to go in the next debate
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:26.360]  Whereas Hillary's just gonna keep reading off her talking points. That's his big tell
[3:19:26.360 --> 3:19:30.760]  He kept saying just wait till the next debate. He played it nice up front. Now the gloves are off
[3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:35.840]  That he's always said I'm a counterpuncher. So he let her go in there feel all powerful
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:41.800]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be guns a blazing before they say we're threatening Hillary. That's a that's a colloquialism
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:47.320]  That's a saying it's a figure of speech. I think I think he comes in with a 360 attack next time
[3:19:47.320 --> 3:19:53.320]  Exactly and at least he got up there. He wasn't scary. He wasn't literally Hitler of that as they've tried to define him
[3:19:53.320 --> 3:19:55.320]  So in that way he made progress
[3:19:55.320 --> 3:19:59.320]  All right, well, I'm gonna punch you out of here. I'm skipping this break. So you have more time Paul
[3:20:00.320 --> 3:20:03.320]  What else is on the radar screen? What else are you concerned about right now?
[3:20:04.320 --> 3:20:10.320]  Well, I'm gonna be talking about that rigged poll obviously Alex with CNN we had immediately
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:13.320]  Trump won trending as a hashtag on Twitter
[3:20:13.320 --> 3:20:20.320]  Which is key despite whoever hijacked it in the end that is key for people to see that in the very hours after the debates and of course
[3:20:21.320 --> 3:20:29.320]  When you clicked on the actual hashtag it was leftist posting gifts of people laughing next to the hashtag Trump won versus
[3:20:30.320 --> 3:20:36.320]  Conservatives Libertarians Trump supporters posting actual polls that say Trump won
[3:20:36.320 --> 3:20:42.320]  So that was the difference of course you had one CNN poll they oversampled Democrats
[3:20:42.320 --> 3:20:48.320]  They do this in a lot of the election and they admitted it almost double that is 41 to 26
[3:20:48.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  I mean
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:57.320]  That'd be like if I was playing football and I said I get 21 players on the fields of 11 and you get 46 you would laugh at them
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:05.320]  I mean, I mean, I mean, this is insane. I mean, oh, we're sampling almost double Democrats and oh look Hillary won
[3:21:05.320 --> 3:21:09.320]  And it's nobody's even reporting on it apart from us
[3:21:09.320 --> 3:21:13.320]  They didn't put the methodology on their website in the article
[3:21:13.320 --> 3:21:21.320]  They linked to it and it was a PDF file on CNN's image server where it actually admitted 41% Democrats were asked
[3:21:21.320 --> 3:21:26.320]  Just 26% report I want to go back to something just because I'm so interested in it
[3:21:27.320 --> 3:21:33.320]  Again, we I don't have time to sit there. I've tried to do it. So the reason I say it's a fraction of it is it's very small
[3:21:33.320 --> 3:21:40.320]  I mean, look, we've had before 3.8 million people tune in during the 2012 election coverage of just internet streams
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  And I don't know what happened. I don't know why it was so big. We've never anything else like that
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:48.320]  The nightly news is on some UHF VHF stages. I never really promoted it. So it's less than 20
[3:21:49.320 --> 3:21:54.320]  But we're a lot of radio stations. I mean more than six or 70 that I know of they call point to an affiliate agreement
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:58.320]  I just say carry the nightly news wherever you want. Okay, just I don't care. It's just fight the new world order
[3:21:58.320 --> 3:22:01.320]  Put ads over everything. I don't care do take a little bit take it all
[3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:06.320]  So I always build new stuff never knowing how it's actually going to succeed. It usually just does something else
[3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:08.320]  I didn't expect but the nightly news
[3:22:09.320 --> 3:22:14.320]  It hasn't ever really gone big on TV, but it's gone big on radio strangely enough
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:17.320]  So that's very exciting. But but but just Internet alone
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:24.320]  We had about 600,000 people on different platforms on our different streams. We can look at tune in
[3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:28.320]  Okay, but then you if you go to YouTube that's hundreds of thousands more there
[3:22:28.320 --> 3:22:31.320]  But we also have videos every day
[3:22:31.320 --> 3:22:35.320]  That have millions of views and then hundreds of other videos sometimes hundreds of videos a day
[3:22:35.320 --> 3:22:38.320]  That are about 40,000 60,000 100,000 views
[3:22:38.320 --> 3:22:41.320]  But if you look at it all just our platforms
[3:22:41.320 --> 3:22:47.320]  Tens of millions of views a week very conservative like I should be conservative 15 20 million views a week
[3:22:48.320 --> 3:22:50.320]  Terrestrial radio
[3:22:50.320 --> 3:22:53.320]  7 8 million people a week to an end 2 or 3 million a day
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:55.320]  That's just on rated stations
[3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:58.320]  You add it all together worldwide
[3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:02.320]  Other big sites a number of videos. It's around 32 million people a week to the show
[3:23:03.320 --> 3:23:07.320]  That's not even counting big super viral videos that we put out routinely
[3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:08.320]  So
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:11.320]  As they become self-aware Paul and realize
[3:23:11.320 --> 3:23:13.320]  That Paul Watson
[3:23:15.320 --> 3:23:17.320]  On average is bigger than the Daily Show
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:19.320]  Just you by yourself
[3:23:19.320 --> 3:23:23.320]  What does that do to these narcissists brains because listen I go to school
[3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:25.320]  Events
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:28.320]  Like it used to be homeschooled. It was great. Now they're older. They want to be on sports and friends
[3:23:28.320 --> 3:23:29.320]  So they're in private school
[3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:35.320]  I go and guess what I hear about when I go to birthday parties or I go to parks or I go to other towns
[3:23:35.320 --> 3:23:41.320]  Guess what the teenagers girls boys you name it young men young women and even like 10 year olds
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:44.320]  Who do they want to talk about Paul Joseph Watson?
[3:23:44.320 --> 3:23:47.320]  They want to talk about Ian McGinnis
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:49.320]  They want to talk about Alex Jones
[3:23:49.320 --> 3:23:53.320]  How is the establishment gonna counter that when
[3:23:53.320 --> 3:23:58.320]  All over central Texas Paul Watson is a rock star with 15 year old girls
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:07.320]  They're gonna cancer it with censorship Alex. I mean you can compare just my channel on YouTube alone to the young Turks
[3:24:07.320 --> 3:24:10.320]  Now they've built up a massive audience on YouTube no doubt
[3:24:10.320 --> 3:24:17.320]  But my channel with just me sitting here on my own making what two three videos a week
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:25.320]  Is growing twice as fast as the young Turks an organization that has what 20 30 people working on that
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:31.320]  And I made you start that YouTube just a few years ago as like a hobby and it's got hundreds of millions of views
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:35.320]  Not counting how your stuff gets duplicated everywhere hundreds of millions more
[3:24:35.320 --> 3:24:40.320]  Yeah, I mean I've only been doing it seriously for about what two and a half years
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:44.320]  They've been on YouTube since the beginning. They've got a huge team a huge staff
[3:24:44.320 --> 3:24:47.320]  They're partnered with it. They were funded by Qatar
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:57.320]  They're pumping out videos, you know 10 15 times a day and yet my little channel just me is growing twice as fast
[3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:03.320]  I get twice as many subscribers per day as the young Turks. I put it up on Twitter. You can check it out for yourself
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:05.320]  By the way, I didn't see this daily show club
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:09.320]  You should send us the guys and the girls we should play that and kind of piggyback on that
[3:25:09.320 --> 3:25:14.320]  Because just to show there's so many great libertarians conservatives patriots that are huge
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:17.320]  I'm busy fighting new order. I don't really pay attention to what they're doing
[3:25:17.320 --> 3:25:21.320]  Who is this conservative lady that gets 65 million views on her video?
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:28.320]  Well, it's pretty odd because she's on the blaze network and yet she's pro-trump so it's kind of Glenn Beck's offshoot
[3:25:28.320 --> 3:25:33.320]  It's funny. Glenn Beck can't get 10,000 views but somebody that got on his network, which is great
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:36.320]  It's how good things come out of evil. She's now huge
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:40.320]  Yeah, it's because she's resonating with other people in what she's saying
[3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:45.320]  So she gets up on Facebook. She gets, you know, five million views per video on average or whatever
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:51.320]  But one video in particular gets 65 million views and the daily show does a massive hit piece on her
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:56.320]  The Washington Post, The Guardian did a massive hit piece on her and they're totally freaking out
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:26:01.320]  They're saying, look, this video got even more views than the turtle humping a shoe
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:06.320]  This is crazy. This is out of control. This is not funny anymore. What are we going to do to stop this?
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:10.320]  And it's a very telling clip because he was very serious when he was talking about it
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:16.320]  Well, citizen, I want to play it because we should say, you know, elite panics over something bigger than turtle humping shoe
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:20.320]  Hidesack all the trendies and reprogram them. I mean, we've got to do this
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:26.320]  No, exactly. I mean, and the frustration is that, you know, we're pumping out content so often
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:32.320]  We don't even have time to, like, manage our own Facebook pages. If we actually got them in order
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:36.320]  We could have two, three times the amount of views. Just don't have time to do it
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:45.320]  So, I mean, the growth is exponential. It's going parabolic. You know, I'm disappointed if I get 300,000 views on a video
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:50.320]  That's disappointing for me now. I mean, that's the level and it's only going to get more and more
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:56.320]  Well, I'm not kidding. I mean, by the way, it's not just young people who like Paul
[3:26:56.320 --> 3:27:01.320]  It's just that when you learn, you know, like the tennis coach tells you
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:07.320]  Hey, you know, like everybody at the school and other schools watches you and Paul Watson
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:12.320]  And I asked him, oh, who's more popular? Oh, Paul Watson. So it's kind of like, I'm the old old guy now, which is great
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:16.320]  I've been doing since I was 21 and he got Paul been with 15 years. He's only 30 something now
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:20.320]  And it's just good to know they're never going to win this war
[3:27:20.320 --> 3:27:25.320]  I mean, if Hillary thinks she can shut me down or have me killed or whatever, you know, good luck lady
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:28.320]  I wish no harm physically on you. I want you to just leave me and my family alone
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:34.320]  And so, I mean, if I'm a dinosaur and all this, can you imagine what a dinosaur Hillary is?
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:38.320]  I mean, I think that's one of our biggest victories here is, Paul, is the globalists are disconnected
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:42.320]  They don't realize how defunct they are
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:50.320]  Oh, no, totally. You see that with Hillary Trump after the debates, even though supposedly Hillary won because of one rigged CNN poll, whatever
[3:27:50.320 --> 3:27:56.320]  Okay, she won 79% of people talking about this debate on Facebook are talking about Trump
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:00.320]  He's got far more social media exposure than Hillary Clinton
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:06.320]  You could watch the graph for the independence favorability interest whenever Clinton started speaking, it went down
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:14.320]  Whenever Trump started speaking, it went up. He's got the momentum. He's got the massive exposure. It could be a Brexit-style scenario where they're completely shocked
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:22.320]  This wave comes in and, you know, people like Scott Adams, respectable people, are saying it's going to be a Trump landslide because of these factors
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:29.320]  Well, in general polls, these 10-15 points ahead when they lied for a while a few months ago, it shrunk to six, seven points
[3:28:29.320 --> 3:28:33.320]  But it's right back there and if he doesn't win, they've stolen the election
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:42.320]  Unless there's a false flag and I've confirmed what you've been just in the ether predicting from multiple military and police sources
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:49.320]  They're trying to develop a case that we are preparing a paramilitary operation against the government
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:55.320]  I mean, literally, I barely got my laundry done. I mean, I'm just here like a martyr if I have to just cover this
[3:28:55.320 --> 3:29:02.320]  And if you guys want to burn me at the stake, go ahead. It's like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader chopping him and have to use another cheesy analogy
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:13.320]  I mean, we're not giving up, Paul, but clearly they are really trying to organize some type of federal operation that we're like, you know, some type of cult or something
[3:29:13.320 --> 3:29:17.320]  Oh, completely. You go on Twitter, you search for Assassin 8 Trump every single day
[3:29:17.320 --> 3:29:22.320]  It's, why hasn't somebody assassinated Trump yet from all these idiot violent leftists?
[3:29:22.320 --> 3:29:31.320]  Well, people have tried to assassinate Trump. You had Michael Sanford, a British citizen, a couple of months ago, tried to grab an officer's gun and shoot Trump while he was on stage
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:33.320]  You got absolutely no mainstream media coverage
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:39.320]  And then meanwhile, we're trying to stop murder, police being killed, civil war
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:44.320]  We're trying to get non-GMO food. We're just good people. We're being demonized. I'm going to come back and say bye to Paul
[3:29:44.320 --> 3:29:47.320]  I just love hanging out with Paul. We'll be right back, stay with us
[3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:54.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:29:54.320 --> 3:30:05.320]  Russia is pointing out there won't be any peace in Syria, as long as the Obama administration keeps sending weapons to the ISIS-linked al-Nusra Front
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:12.320]  The Russian government said that militants are armed by tanks, APCs, field artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and heavy weaponry
[3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:14.320]  And of course, they could have made these weapons themselves
[3:30:14.320 --> 3:30:16.320]  Nor could they have stolen all of them from the Syrian Army
[3:30:16.320 --> 3:30:21.320]  Especially not the American-made Tomas hold that Jihadis used to destroy a Russian helicopter last year
[3:30:21.320 --> 3:30:27.320]  The Russians also pointed out that the US-led airstrike that killed 62 Syrian soldiers has directly led to ISIS gaining ground
[3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:30.320]  In other words, the US just served as ISIS's air force
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:35.320]  The US State Department has claimed the attack was an accident, however facts point to the contrary
[3:30:35.320 --> 3:30:40.320]  The region where the attack occurred has always been under Syrian Army control, with no prior presence of ISIS
[3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:46.320]  CENTCOM even had the audacity to release a statement claiming they have not bombed the area in the past, but that's completely false
[3:30:46.320 --> 3:30:48.320]  Unless they were targeting the Syrian government
[3:30:48.320 --> 3:30:54.320]  Stay tuned for more reports and download our new free smartphone app at infowars.com forward slash app

[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:13.320]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country
[3:32:13.320 --> 3:32:18.320]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant
[3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:24.320]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease
[3:32:24.320 --> 3:32:34.320]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:25.320]  We're just split with the crew in there. You've got a special guest coming on. I'm going to punch out here, Paul. I just love talking to you.
[3:33:25.320 --> 3:33:29.320]  Thanks for doing a great job over at Infowars.com and PresidentPlanet.com
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:35.320]  And congratulations on having 5 million views every week on average, just on YouTube alone, one platform.
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:42.320]  I mean, it's great to have, you know, 7, 8, 9 million listeners a week on threshold radio, but just to be doing that on the Internet, we're doing it on so many platforms
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:47.320]  So just adding your views to what we're doing, it's more than 15 million a week, really.
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:52.320]  I just keep not believing how big our numbers are. It's so exciting. It's a bellwether of the establishment collapsing
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:59.320]  But I'm going to go ahead and do my Emperor Palpatine invitation because, you know, how about Emperor Palpatine, you know, for, uh, for, for President?
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:04.320]  You have done well, Lord Vader. Do what must be done.
[3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:09.320]  I'm kind of getting a little bit of stage fright here. I'm not doing it as good as I normally could.
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:12.320]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[3:34:12.320 --> 3:34:15.320]  Now, you go ahead and do yours. We'll see who can do it better.
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:17.320]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:19.320]  I don't know. I think Paul's better.
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:21.320]  You've had a lot more practice than me.
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:25.320]  We've been doing it for about 50 years.
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:27.320]  I've been waiting for this a long time.
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:34.320]  All right, Paul. Hey, we got free shipping on the products. It's ending the day and we've got 20% off on Supermail.
[3:34:34.320 --> 3:34:45.320]  This is the last day, absolutely the last, uh, bottom of B12, infowarslife.com, sign up for auto ship and additional 10% off. You sign up for a month from now, six months a year, whatever, and then get 10% off.
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:47.320]  Just sign up for auto ship infowarslife.com.
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:51.320]  I kind of get a little bit jovial by the fourth hour because we covered some really hardcore news.
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:35:02.320]  Lastly, on the go to your guest, how bold is it? We're just sitting here and Michael Savage talks about her illness and says, you know, as an expert, he's got a degree in medicine.
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:08.320]  Uh, I mean, an actual medical degree in herbs.
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:15.320]  He's got the botanical actual medical degree, MD degree in herbs, and he says, Hillary looks like she has Parkinson's.
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:20.320]  We have the email that she wanted Parkinson's medication from WikiLeaks and he goes and says that he's taken off WBC.
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:25.320]  He says, I'm being shut down. I'm being taken off. I'm being quote, total sabotage. We'll put it on screen.
[3:35:25.320 --> 3:35:28.320]  Was it total sabotage or absolute sabotage?
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:33.320]  Point is, sounds like a great pure sabotage. Sounds like a great album cover name.
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:38.320]  Uh, but then he, I'm going to call him as soon as I get off with you, pure sabotage.
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:40.320]  He's then taken off everywhere and is now off the air.
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:49.320]  I mean, this is, they've coup d'etat and Fox News taking it over. They now are taking over the rest of the media. It's happening, Paul.
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:56.320]  The coup is on. I mean, I don't want people talking about it. Dr. Drew really set that issue off, you know, back of about six weeks ago.
[3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:59.320]  He lost his show almost immediately and now Savage has got problems.
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:05.320]  It's no coincidence that it's when he started talking about Hillary's health, they don't want people hearing about it.
[3:36:05.320 --> 3:36:09.320]  All right, Paul, thank you, my friend. Go ahead and take over.
[3:36:09.320 --> 3:36:14.320]  Okay, we're going to carry on the show here with our guest who is waiting in the wings.
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:19.320]  He is Derek Pylot, a up and coming YouTuber.
[3:36:19.320 --> 3:36:25.320]  Goes by the moniker, some black guy on YouTube. His Twitter handle is some underscore black guy.
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:28.320]  Derek, welcome to the show.
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:30.320]  Hey, Paul, thanks for having me.
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:33.320]  Now I was going to ask you about the debate, but we don't have much time left here.
[3:36:33.320 --> 3:36:36.320]  So let's skip straight to Black Lives Matter.
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:39.320]  Of course, we had the riots in Charlotte recently.
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:47.320]  We had the media and Rachel Maddow and MSNBC saying that, you know, they were peaceful protests, even as reporters were being attacked,
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:52.320]  set on fire, stores looted, you know, drivers attacked, people being beat up on the streets.
[3:36:52.320 --> 3:37:02.320]  BLM comes out as they always do and say, you know, how dare you lump us in with this fringe violent element where a peaceful group were not affiliated with them.
[3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:09.320]  Yeah, then they come out with this list of demands which insists that the rioters and the looters be released from prison,
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:15.320]  which doesn't really sound like a great, you know, way to differentiate yourselves from the violent element.
[3:37:15.320 --> 3:37:24.320]  I mean, Derek, from everything you've seen, is it accurate as they claim to describe Black Lives Matter as a peaceful organization?
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:26.320]  Absolutely not.
[3:37:26.320 --> 3:37:29.320]  At this point, you know, they're always trying to say that.
[3:37:29.320 --> 3:37:35.320]  They're always trying to cover and say that, yeah, we're peaceful, you know, but when you just say that doesn't mean anything.
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:37.320]  Your actions are what's really important.
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:45.320]  And the thing is, every time there's some type of incident that happens with, you know, a police officer killing a black male or something like that,
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:53.320]  then you have people that come on a riot and they say, oh, it's not Black Lives Matter, but then you have footage of people chanting, you know, black power, wearing Black Lives Matter shirts.
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:38:00.320]  And then also, you know, before Black Lives Matter really became a thing, you know, there was always police brutality and things happening like this before.
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:03.320]  And there wasn't this constant, consistent riot.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:10.320]  So I don't like, you know, it's not really, it's not fair for them to say or it's not accurate for them to say that, oh, we're just peaceful.
[3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:12.320]  I know some of them are trying to be peaceful.
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:14.320]  I know some of them are trying to just be there.
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:25.320]  And there's been instances where everything was nice, but then all of a sudden you have things like Charlotte, you know, you have things like Milwaukee and, you know, that is absolutely connected to Black Lives Matter.
[3:38:25.320 --> 3:38:30.320]  And I mean, Derek, I make the point over and over again, which people don't seem to pick up on.
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:38.320]  You look at their ideological guru, and I know you've talked about this in your videos, the foundational inspiration behind Black Lives Matter.
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:41.320]  Her name is chanted at every demonstration.
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:48.320]  It's cited by the founders of BLM in their original essays, Outlining the Scope, The Motivation Behind BLM.
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:50.320]  It's a sartre Shakur.
[3:38:50.320 --> 3:38:51.320]  Who is she?
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:56.320]  She's a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:38:58.320]  This isn't Martin Luther King.
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:07.320]  This is a violent radical who, you know, left some of the leftist groups back in the 60s, 70s because they weren't violent enough for her.
[3:39:07.320 --> 3:39:09.320]  She's now in exile in Cuba.
[3:39:09.320 --> 3:39:11.320]  That's their inspiration.
[3:39:11.320 --> 3:39:13.320]  So then they claim that they're a peaceful group.
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:18.320]  You know, it's like white supremacists saying that Timothy McVeigh is their inspiration.
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:20.320]  And then the media calling them a peaceful group.
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:22.320]  It just wouldn't happen.
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:23.320]  I mean, talk about violence.
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:28.320]  Obviously, there are there are peaceful people within this group that are all violent people.
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:39.320]  But whenever I make a video criticizing Black Lives Matter, the fact is I get a torrent of death threats even more death threats than I get from radical Islamists.
[3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:43.320]  So, you know, as a black guy, you criticize Black Lives Matter on a routine basis.
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:48.320]  What kind of heat do you get when you make those same critiques?
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:58.320]  Well, the thing is, it's actually kind of funny because most of the criticism or heat that I get are, I would say, in the 90th percentile from black people.
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:01.320]  And they just, you know, call me things like, you know, they say, I'm an Uncle Tom.
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:03.320]  I'm a traitor or whatever.
[3:40:03.320 --> 3:40:05.320]  And, you know, I've heard it all before.
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:09.320]  I've even made videos like saying that it doesn't even bother me.
[3:40:09.320 --> 3:40:13.320]  Just calling me names does not do anything to me, does not hurt my feelings.
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:19.320]  And it doesn't, it doesn't make any of the facts less true or anything like that.
[3:40:19.320 --> 3:40:24.320]  And, yeah, so from like, like from other people, sometimes they're kind of confused.
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:26.320]  Some black people, sometimes they do hear me out.
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:28.320]  Sometimes they're like, oh, I never thought of this before.
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:34.320]  But largely, just my criticism comes from the black community, unfortunately, and they just want me to be like, like them.
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:40.320]  They're mad that I'm not like them, that I'm not victimizing myself, that I don't think everybody's against me.
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:45.320]  And, you know, there's systemic racism because, you know, I don't think, I don't know how there could be systemic racism
[3:40:45.320 --> 3:40:50.320]  when there just, there are black people in every type of field, you know, all the way from being like a garbage person,
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:55.320]  all the way from being an astronaut, you know, you can be whatever you want to be in this country.
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:00.320]  You know, you just got to, you know, you got to work for it, you know, and it's not about, you know, your skin color.
[3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:01.320]  It's not doing anything.
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:02.320]  It's not holding you back.
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:04.320]  Like it's only you, you victimizing yourself.
[3:41:04.320 --> 3:41:10.320]  Already saying that you're a victim from the very beginning and saying that you're disadvantaged, you already put yourself at a disadvantage,
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:16.320]  you know, and like, I'm trying to tell people, especially in the black community, not to think that way because it's poisonous, you know,
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:20.320]  and that's what's happening, like, all over the United States.
[3:41:20.320 --> 3:41:22.320]  Well, I mean, it reminds me of Colin Kaepernick.
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:30.320]  I mean, he came out and said black people in America were oppressed in his own words, yet, you know, 68% of NFL players are black.
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:35.320]  They're not exactly oppressed if they're getting, you know, high paid, high paid careers.
[3:41:35.320 --> 3:41:37.320]  Obviously, there's problems with police brutality.
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:48.320]  But if you look at the underlying narrative, that impacts both black and white, you know, five people, five white people were killed by police on the same day that Keith Scott was killed.
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:51.320]  Yet they didn't get any media attention.
[3:41:51.320 --> 3:41:59.320]  You know, the left criticizes the right when they bring up these kind of arguments, when they blip, when they bring up, you know, black crime statistics,
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:03.320]  they say black people are overrepresented, you know, commit 50% of homicides.
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:10.320]  That's why they have more violent confrontations with police because they're getting into these situations in the first place.
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:15.320]  But, you know, the left comes back and says, well, you don't understand walking while black.
[3:42:15.320 --> 3:42:18.320]  African Americans are targeted simply for their skin color.
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:28.320]  As a black American yourself, you know, is that, do you feel in your day to day life when you're walking down the street, this genuine state, this constant fear of cops?
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:33.320]  Is that a real authentic thing or is it overblown in your experience?
[3:42:33.320 --> 3:42:41.320]  Well, in my experience for me personally, it's not a thing I've learned from an early age when I first started driving and going down the street.
[3:42:41.320 --> 3:42:50.320]  That if I'm, you know, minding my own business, not looking sinister in any way, and I'm not talking about my skin color, I'm talking about like certain like posture things, certain clothes that you wear.
[3:42:50.320 --> 3:42:55.320]  You know, those are red flags for, you know, for the police and also, you know, even being in my car.
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:43:03.320]  Yeah, there has been a couple of times I've been pulled over, I think, because, you know, just because the neighborhood I lived in, there wasn't very many black people.
[3:43:03.320 --> 3:43:07.320]  But the thing is, nothing happened. You know, I wasn't talking back.
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:17.320]  I wasn't being like a really angry like person and just I wasn't giving the police officers any reason to have me step out of the car and tase me or whatever and have it escalate.
[3:43:17.320 --> 3:43:24.320]  But the thing is, I've also noticed though, just with people in general, because, you know, I would ride with so many different friends and they would just get nervous.
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:33.320]  With the police just, you know, if they're tailing them or just even by like people just naturally get nervous and I don't think it's necessarily just like a black thing.
[3:43:33.320 --> 3:43:44.320]  I think people kind of around the cops, they are they act a certain way, they act a different way and then sometimes it gets them, it gets the police, it kind of raises a red flag where they're like, huh, this person's acting strange.
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:51.320]  Let me invest, let me check them out or something. But me, yeah, I don't, I haven't like, I do not like live in fear of the police.
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:57.320]  I don't think that when I'm going to go drive out my car, I'm going to go drive, I'm going to get shot. I don't think that when I see them, I usually nod.
[3:43:57.320 --> 3:44:10.320]  I'm like, hey, how's it going? As a matter of fact, a lot of people don't know that I was actually considering becoming a police officer because, you know, I've always liked the idea of that where I was living in Arizona and back here again.
[3:44:10.320 --> 3:44:21.320]  But I was going to sign up for one of the police academies and largely I kind of just didn't do it. But my whole point is that I don't have just this automatic disdain for the police.
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:28.320]  I don't think all cops are terrible. I think that's a stupid generalization to say that about anyone that all this is this.
[3:44:28.320 --> 3:44:40.320]  And so yeah, in short now, yeah, I have no problem. I live in no fear like from the police. They're fine as long as they, you know, leave me alone and everything's cool.
[3:44:40.320 --> 3:44:50.320]  Well, I mean, it's strange that Lil Wayne made similar comments where they were trying to get him to get on board with BLM and, you know, obviously he's no stranger to scrapes with the law.
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:55.320]  But even he said he's not really experienced any racism against him. Obviously, that's not the same for everyone.
[3:44:55.320 --> 3:45:05.320]  But another thing I wanted to touch on is there's often this argument about, as you mentioned there, that the kind of demeanor, the behavior of these individuals who get into violent confrontations with police.
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:23.320]  It's influenced by the things they're wearing, their attitude, the way they're behaving. How much do you put that down to, you know, ghettos, socioeconomics and how much do you put it down to the glorification of this gangster culture that we see coming out of hip hop and rap?
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:38.320]  Do you think that that's, you know, a significant quantifiable influence on how black people behave is that we have this kind of glorification of this gangster culture in popular culture and music?
[3:45:38.320 --> 3:45:42.320]  Yeah, I actually think that there's a major influence in that.
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:55.320]  And I remember even being young, like I was kind of neutral with a lot of stuff, like I liked metal and just like EDM and all these different things in hip hop. And then I started to gravitate a little bit more towards that because I'm like, oh, there's so many black people in it.
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:46:10.320]  This is cool. But, and I remember I started writing lyrics and the lyrics I was writing were so ridiculous because I was like mimicking the stuff that, you know, most hip hop artists would talk about, you know, most mainstream hip hop artists would talk about this, this horrible, just trash, you know.
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:20.320]  And yeah, I started to realize quickly, I'm like, this is not, you know, who I am. This is not who I want to be. And there's so many people that are still just, you know, they're completely in it. And they think that is cool.
[3:46:20.320 --> 3:46:34.320]  Like, I mean, yeah, you go, I actually lived in South Central Los Angeles for a couple of years at a time. And just being there, just seeing like how people live on average, and especially when it's almost just is like, it's not, I don't see any benefits of living there.
[3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:44.320]  They can move out like my mom did. And it's just horrible. Like everybody wants to have a gun. Everybody wants to hang out on the corners and just, you know, drink some some forties or whatever.
[3:46:44.320 --> 3:46:59.320]  And they're not really trying to do anything but that. And then they try to figure out, oh, I got to make some money. I got I got to I got to make all this money and stuff. And, you know, okay, I'll just sell some drugs because that's all these dudes were doing, you know, in the, they're talking about in the, you know, all the hip hop songs and stuff.
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:12.320]  And I that's what I see. And it makes sense to me. I mean, like I said, I was almost kind of hooked into it at a certain at a certain extent, like it somewhat influenced me until I started to just, you know, have a little bit of common sense.
[3:47:12.320 --> 3:47:29.320]  I'm like, this is stupid. And I don't want also my mom. She would kill me. So there was that too. Like I can thank my mom for, you know, kind of raising me to not, you know, get me into those that type of hip hop culture because she hated that stuff.
[3:47:29.320 --> 3:47:39.320]  And I mean, there is a lot of, you know, hip hop music that goes the opposite that encourages people not to get into that kind of lifestyle. But again, it's not picked up by the mainstream. It doesn't get picked up now.
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:54.320]  So moving on, we've had, you know, polls recently that show the majority of Americans and even more millennials still support Black Lives Matter, even after all the riots, even after all the police shootings, you know, the Dallas massacre of eight cops.
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:48:09.320]  Amongst the African American community, do you sense a deep well of support for Black Lives Matter? Or do you think that, you know, people are just more disinterested? Or do you find that more, you know, Black Americans are starting to be turned off by Black Lives Matter?
[3:48:09.320 --> 3:48:11.320]  What's your impression of that?
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:26.320]  Well, there definitely are. And thanks to like channels like yours and mine and other people, there are a lot of Black Americans that are starting to see because otherwise they weren't really seeing anything. They weren't seeing the, you know, because they're just getting their news from the mainstream media.
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:35.320]  And all they were seeing was just little clips of peaceful protesting and seeing that like, yeah, there's just this big problem with just cops killing Black people. I'm like, it's not just that.
[3:48:35.320 --> 3:48:47.320]  And then when they see the rioting, when they see the videos that I put out, and then they actually get to see, like, you know, a balanced objective, like, just look at things that are going on.
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:54.320]  And then they're like, oh, I didn't know, like, yeah, I'm getting kind of tired of this and I'm getting tired of the mainstream media's race pating.
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:49:05.320]  And so, unfortunately, there's still an overwhelming amount of support for Black Lives Matter from the Black community. I think that's just from, you know, them just being Black and there's this thing.
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:14.320]  There's always been this thing, this hive mind mentality of that we're all brothers and sisters and we're all in it together, you know, more than any other race that I really know.
[3:49:14.320 --> 3:49:27.320]  So I think that just because they kind of have to do it, you know, they have to do it. They just don't even really think about it too much. And, you know, obviously, unfortunately, if you put something out to the contrary, it's like, there's people saying that if you're against Black Lives Matter,
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:36.320]  you're against Black Lives, you know, and just that they're like, oh, I don't want to be against Black Lives. I have to, I'm Black myself, I have to be, you know, that kind of stuff.
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:49.320]  And this is just another, you know, poisonous ideology, unfortunately. And like I said, I know there's good pockets sometimes every once in a while, they do talk about some issues, you know, that I can be like, all right, this is a problem.
[3:49:49.320 --> 3:50:02.320]  But I just overall, I don't like what's happening, like say riots and stuff, I'm like that. If there's any riots coming from any type of group or something like that, I don't care what type of group it is, I'm not down for it.
[3:50:02.320 --> 3:50:14.320]  It's not a good thing. And I know that as we keep moving forward, hopefully, you know, less and less people will be on on this bandwagon of just blindly supporting Black Lives Matter.
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:22.320]  And the funny aspect of this from a UK perspective, they had a huge Black Lives Matter process recently which shut down an airport.
[3:50:22.320 --> 3:50:34.320]  People, the people went to court and literally every one of them was a privileged, white, upper class person who's, you know, parents had bought them a two million pound swank pad in London.
[3:50:34.320 --> 3:50:42.320]  They all had triple barrel or quadruple barrel names. So again, as he said, there's this narrative. Well, if you oppose Black Lives Matter, you must hate Black people.
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:58.320]  Well, now actually it's an ideology. It's not a race. Just like feminism is an ideology. It's not a gender. We'll be back with Derek Piler after the break. This is the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news at info wars.com. Stay tuned.
[3:50:58.320 --> 3:51:14.320]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic. Most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut and metals in the liver. And we all have a bit of both. The garlic in Extendivite has a yeast killing effect in the gut while also helping the sulfur enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals.
[3:51:14.320 --> 3:51:30.320]  Extendivite just may improve your overall health. Products like Extendivite are the only way we're going to get our society healthy.

[3:54:07.320 --> 3:54:16.320]  We're back. It's the Alex Jones Show Live final segment. We're talking to Derek Pilot, who is an up-and-coming YouTuber. Go and check out his great videos.
[3:54:16.320 --> 3:54:24.320]  Now, Derek, we've got a few minutes left here. I want to give you a chance to plug your channel at the end. But just for the next couple of minutes, YouTube censorship.
[3:54:24.320 --> 3:54:35.320]  We had the demonetization scandal a few weeks back. You know, that got a ton of media attention. This has got significantly less. It's called YouTube Heroes.
[3:54:35.320 --> 3:54:41.320]  Tell us why this is such a concern for free speech and for content creators on YouTube.
[3:54:41.320 --> 3:54:50.320]  Well, the thing that really concerns everybody is because it basically made you get a lot of points for doing certain things.
[3:54:50.320 --> 3:54:56.320]  And one thing, a couple of things you get points for is like flagging content, so you can flag some videos and it'll get rewarded for doing so.
[3:54:56.320 --> 3:55:05.320]  And the reason why a lot of people are concerned, including myself, is the flagging system is already flawed. They already have very flawed things like say even copyright claims.
[3:55:05.320 --> 3:55:12.320]  Pretty much anybody, even if you use fair use, you can just copyright claim and then they'll monetize, they'll claim your money.
[3:55:12.320 --> 3:55:18.320]  There's so many things that are kind of wrong that need to be fixed and now they're kind of like encouraging to flag more videos.
[3:55:18.320 --> 3:55:23.320]  And there's going to be a lot of people that didn't do that. And then when you get to a certain tier, you can mass flag videos.
[3:55:23.320 --> 3:55:35.320]  And the thing is, I'm like, there's people with vendettas that will want to take your channel down, especially people that are exercising free speech and that are against censorship.
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:41.320]  There's a lot of people on the left or the social justice where people call them that are just trying to censor everybody.
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:47.320]  They don't want you to say anything. They want you to think a certain way. And they're going to be the people that are going to try to police you.
[3:55:47.320 --> 3:56:01.320]  Now, you know, it's very early and since they try to do some damage control look like they actually try to even switch up the video and kind of reward some things here and there without anybody trying to make sure nobody would notice.
[3:56:01.320 --> 3:56:06.320]  So you can already see that they are trying to like, oh, you know, this was a really bad idea.
[3:56:06.320 --> 3:56:15.320]  So I'm actually with the backlash that they're getting from a lot of the content creators. I think maybe something, I don't know if they'll really take it.
[3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:19.320]  They're going to really push forward with like the things because it's not all bad.
[3:56:19.320 --> 3:56:24.320]  The YouTube heroes thing isn't just completely across the board. There's some things that are good.
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:28.320]  For example, like you can get rewarded for putting subtitles on people's on videos.
[3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:38.320]  But the thing is, to the contrary, I guess some people are saying that, oh, they're doing that because they want you to they want to be able to find out what's being said in your video.
[3:56:38.320 --> 3:56:47.320]  So maybe it would make it easier to identify what content is inappropriate, you know, and not advertiser friendly. Like say mine, for example, I use a lot of profanity because it's just how I talk.
[3:56:47.320 --> 3:56:50.320]  I mean, you know, I'm just being all good and respectful now.
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:57:05.320]  But like that's what some people are saying. It is very trouble. It is very worrisome because it seems like they keep doing some stuff that is just making it really hard for you to just be just be yourself and to really like get the truth out there or just speak your mind.
[3:57:05.320 --> 3:57:12.320]  And it's very like I'm very concerned because I mean, this is right right now. This is my livelihood, you know, exactly.
[3:57:12.320 --> 3:57:19.320]  I mean, I've already got messages from SJW salivating over how they're going to send some of my videos just in the final minute here.
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:23.320]  Tell people how they can find you on Twitter, how they can find you on YouTube.
[3:57:23.320 --> 3:57:32.320]  OK, so if you just go to YouTube and type in some black guy, my videos will pop up or, you know, YouTube.com slash some black guy, whatever it'll pop up.
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:36.320]  And on Twitter, you can find me at some underscore black guy. Those are the two things.
[3:57:36.320 --> 3:57:43.320]  I'm on Twitter daily, so you can keep up with me. I do a lot of interesting stuff and talk and say a lot of interesting things on there.
[3:57:43.320 --> 3:57:52.320]  So yeah, that's pretty much it. I have other social media, but those two things right there are like, you know, keep up with my videos and keep up with my Twitter.
[3:57:52.320 --> 3:57:56.320]  OK, we're always very keen to have new independent voices on the show.
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:58:02.320]  So there goes another. This interview will be up on my YouTube channel tomorrow. So that's all well and good.
[3:58:02.320 --> 3:58:06.320]  Go and check out Derek's videos. Derek Pilot, thanks for joining us.
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:08.320]  No problem. Thank you for having me.
[3:58:08.320 --> 3:58:13.320]  There goes Derek Pilot. Go and check out his video. That's going to wrap it up for today's show.
[3:58:13.320 --> 3:58:17.320]  That's all we've got time for. But again, go to infowars.com.
[3:58:17.320 --> 3:58:24.320]  Get the story out about CNN rigging their own poll to make it look as if Hillary won. Absolutely crucial story.
