[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.440]  I do not have words to describe how serious the situation is things are
[00:29.440 --> 00:35.960]  deteriorating very very quickly this is probably one of the most important
[00:35.960 --> 00:42.680]  broadcast I will ever do today I'm gonna try to measure my words and focus my
[00:42.680 --> 00:47.000]  mind to a high level of awareness because I have a tendency to do so much
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  radio that I began to almost lazily sit around like I'm having a bar room
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.680]  discussion with friends and I live so close to the New Orleans criminal
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.120]  activity I constantly study their evil I'm fully aware of their capacity for
[01:02.120 --> 01:06.840]  death and destruction that I tend to get acclimated to it and don't express
[01:06.840 --> 01:14.200]  properly just how serious the situation is things aren't extremely dire ladies
[01:14.200 --> 01:23.200]  and gentlemen extremely serious on every front there is no doubt the government
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.080]  is trying to create panic and fear while moving to implement full-bore martial
[01:28.080 --> 01:36.840]  law the only question is is this flu truly deadly on a mass scale or is it
[01:36.840 --> 01:43.960]  just killed a few people or are they just using this for pure hype I have no
[01:43.960 --> 01:48.160]  doubt this was a bio weapon there are scientists all over the world in mainstream
[01:48.160 --> 01:51.920]  news saying it clearly has the markers of a bio weapon the question is who
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.440]  produced it Dr. Horowitz thinks he knows who I can't see as proof of that total
[01:58.440 --> 02:05.560]  proof of that but he has a right to what he's saying we respect him but
[02:05.560 --> 02:08.600]  regardless we have globalists that have been caught launching controlled
[02:08.600 --> 02:12.820]  bio weapon attacks many times in the past around the world ongoing and
[02:12.820 --> 02:20.160]  declassified documents in Africa Asia and Latin America now the news I've got
[02:20.160 --> 02:26.840]  is so big so important that I almost don't want to just come right out and
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.800]  say it I we do need what you call a drumroll to get people's attention so
[02:32.800 --> 02:36.960]  we don't just say this and then it goes off into the ether and people don't
[02:36.960 --> 02:41.680]  realize what's happened or developed when we come back in the next segment I
[02:41.680 --> 02:45.800]  need the audio and then later in the show and I repeat this and have the
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.040]  latest info and the hours to come the video at prison planet TV to go and the
[02:51.040 --> 02:59.520]  pun is intended absolutely supernova viral this is the highest level alert
[02:59.520 --> 03:05.680]  for info warriors our sites are being savagely hacked with sophisticated
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.480]  denial of service we have that from our big IT facilities my two IT guys here
[03:10.480 --> 03:19.360]  there is no doubt we are getting threats you name it coming in here it is off the
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.600]  charts and they are very upset about the information we've been putting out in
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.480]  the last few days info wars dot com for all intents and purposes is down we have
[03:28.480 --> 03:35.600]  to jump it around on different systems and change ports and block and move
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.120]  IPs we're being attacked classic DoD attacks out of Japan where they have a
[03:42.120 --> 03:47.960]  super high speed connections and that basic CIA DoD command base they've got
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.760]  over there and it is definitely governmental when they're done blasting
[03:52.760 --> 03:58.720]  the ports when we move them they go ahead and blast the entire facilities all
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.880]  the servers all the other systems and an attempt to get us kicked off or shut
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.960]  down but we have layers and layers of backup servers and other facilities but
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.000]  we're trying to deal with it at this facility right now so we don't have to
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.360]  migrate over and they continue to move but we are under attack right now
[04:16.360 --> 04:22.200]  ladies and gentlemen the good news is we're backed up on multiple CDNs
[04:22.200 --> 04:26.880]  multiple networks and other systems with the audio of the video we also piggy
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.120]  back on giant grids like YouTube and Google that's why we're on those is
[04:32.120 --> 04:37.320]  because well you can't stop the signal as they say and frankly every weapon they
[04:37.320 --> 04:40.740]  form against us only blows up in their face because people then realize
[04:40.740 --> 04:44.360]  we're under governmental attack no doubt we've seen the signature of the
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.240]  attack profile not only make people realize that's a seal of approval an
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.640]  underlining of our work a highlighting of what we covered the most important

[07:04.360 --> 07:09.000]  Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.400]  reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our
[07:12.400 --> 07:16.520]  nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.960]  finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages
[07:20.960 --> 07:25.720]  across the country putting us all in the dark. Are you prepared for the next round
[07:25.720 --> 07:29.640]  of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts have you ever
[07:29.640 --> 07:33.920]  thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.120]  supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important information
[07:38.120 --> 07:42.400]  you have ever heard solar powered generators are finally available they
[07:42.400 --> 07:46.800]  have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas
[07:46.800 --> 07:52.240]  whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com

[07:58.960 --> 08:08.400]  your power he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:20.680 --> 08:28.320]  I listen to me very very carefully folks the establishment cannot have the
[08:28.320 --> 08:31.560]  federal government take over Chrysler and force into bankruptcy to be handed
[08:31.560 --> 08:36.360]  over to Fiat owned by a member of the Bilderberg group they cannot loot your
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.800]  pension funds destroy the stock market leverage tens of trillions of dollars
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.000]  now twelve point eight trillion and six months on to not your children's backs
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.200]  but on to your backs now it's well over a hundred thousand dollars per person in
[08:50.200 --> 08:55.000]  the nation on top of all the other debt all being used by offshore banks have
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.280]  gotten the money to buy up and the infrastructure and so in the last month
[09:01.280 --> 09:04.040]  and a half I've been saying that I believe they're gonna stage a large
[09:04.040 --> 09:08.640]  terror attack or a massive bio weapon or lease to have a big scare that they
[09:08.640 --> 09:13.840]  could say that a foreign enemy launched the attack but then people would demand
[09:13.840 --> 09:17.200]  they find the enemy in the caves and then that becomes embarrassing so they
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.840]  just say it's naturally occurring and I have said on record over and over and
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.440]  over again that I believe that they would play a bio weapon release card or
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.000]  they would claim that it was a natural occurrence that is what I saw in the tea
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.320]  leaves as they say because I saw them engage in the preparatory phase of
[09:41.320 --> 09:46.440]  fear mongering reintroducing the old anthrax story tying up loose ends grabbing
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.200]  that doctor and killing him in a medical facility and then claiming he
[09:50.200 --> 09:54.360]  committed suicide blaming the anthrax on him saying it was cooked up in a bathtub
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.520]  and they've admitted that it was weaponized and they made it the
[09:57.520 --> 10:07.680]  government all of this is important and they introduced to the public all the
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.400]  flu is about to get you give up your rights when the flu comes it could kill
[10:11.400 --> 10:17.040]  millions it could kill billions you need to take the vaccines get ready all of
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.440]  these femur drills getting ready for the flu and then jen apolitano comes out
[10:22.440 --> 10:28.080]  sunday and says oh well this flu may run its course and not be too deadly but
[10:28.080 --> 10:36.000]  another giant pandemic is coming soon you see they need to have a unifying
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.800]  effect they need to make you rally around the government fear they need to
[10:38.800 --> 10:42.520]  make you forget about all the things politically they're doing how they're
[10:42.520 --> 10:46.240]  expanding the wars and protecting president bush when the memos come out
[10:46.240 --> 10:49.960]  they ordered the torture how do they burn their underlings that followed
[10:49.960 --> 10:55.560]  orders but they don't get in trouble all of that is now off the screen the six
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.160]  point one percent drop in the last quarter in the economy six point one
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.360]  percent plunge six point three in the quarter before that I mean the economy
[11:04.360 --> 11:13.320]  is in massive contraction implosion with an overlay of inflation I mean we are
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.520]  dead on arrival as an economy the economic numbers coming in are worse
[11:18.520 --> 11:24.800]  than I even thought they would be and coming on faster and in the middle of
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.400]  this we discover now here's the latest news we discover that March 18th the
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.320]  Mexican government had identified this flu and knew that it was very fast
[11:36.320 --> 11:40.200]  spreading that it had a much higher infection rate most people to come in
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.640]  contact with flu it's 10 to 15 percent that contract it and a smaller
[11:43.640 --> 11:47.800]  percentage of those actually get ill that is you're carrying it it's dividing
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.240]  in your body but your body beats it before it divides to a level to cause
[11:52.240 --> 11:59.480]  you to become ill and show symptoms this thing is designer that's what scientists
[11:59.480 --> 12:02.280]  all over the world are saying I've got a bunch of news on that we're going to be
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.120]  covering it later in the show Wayne Madsen formerly with the National
[12:07.120 --> 12:17.280]  Security Agency security consultant and reporter on black ops reporting from
[12:17.280 --> 12:21.240]  Capitol Hill Wayne Madsen will be joining us in the last hour today powerful
[12:21.240 --> 12:24.640]  report he did on Russia today that is coming up in about 20 minutes I'm gonna
[12:24.640 --> 12:31.880]  play I was on Russia today myself but about Obama's first hundred days we're
[12:31.880 --> 12:35.120]  gonna get that up on info wars.com for you by the way as soon as Kirk can get
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.200]  into the server the site's been up and down via the hacks confirmed hacks no
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.720]  doubt we've got the IT center in there saying it's the worst hack they've ever
[12:44.720 --> 12:53.720]  seen just unbelievable Dr. Sherry Tin penny judges in 25 minutes she was in
[12:53.720 --> 12:57.560]  Mexico she's now back in the US give us a report on that she's gone from thinking
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.600]  it was no big deal Monday to the last time we had her on saying it looks like
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.640]  this is absolutely horrible what's happening you and I haven't gotten to the
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.880]  big news yet just building up to it and Lindsay Williams is going to join us on
[13:09.880 --> 13:13.840]  the economy and the bird flu coming up in two hours I am going to be doing a
[13:13.840 --> 13:20.720]  simulcast on international press TV all over the Arab world in Africa they
[13:20.720 --> 13:23.600]  wanted me to go downtown to be on satellite feed and I told them I just
[13:23.600 --> 13:27.560]  wouldn't do it so they're gonna do a phone interview tied in with a simulcast
[13:27.560 --> 13:32.360]  with the radio but I'm gonna let them for the 25 minutes I'm on run the show
[13:32.360 --> 13:35.160]  because it gets too confusing to do it I don't like when I was on with Tom
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.160]  Hartman with Air America a week or two ago I just let him be in control of it
[13:39.160 --> 13:44.760]  because you can't have two chiefs you know over one group of Indians you can't
[13:44.760 --> 13:54.160]  have two chefs cooking the same bowl of porridge so that's coming up the start
[13:54.160 --> 14:02.400]  of the next hour Genesis will run its brakes over me for stations out there
[14:02.400 --> 14:11.320]  and then you will just come back in in stream in Segway so that's what's coming
[14:11.320 --> 14:15.320]  up today Wayne Manson Lindsay Williams Dr. Sheridan Penning and a simulcast with
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.520]  international Iranian television I was on again Russian yesterday now Russian
[14:20.520 --> 14:27.600]  English transmissions Russian TV Indonesian TV Chinese TV television
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.800]  everywhere scientists everywhere are reporting scientists here in this
[14:31.800 --> 14:37.760]  country are reporting this is absolutely designer no doubt it's got
[14:38.680 --> 14:44.480]  well is it two fouls I have the article here in the stack but Google makeup of
[14:44.480 --> 14:47.880]  the virus I need the latest info and I was up so late I'm a bit dingy but it's
[14:47.880 --> 14:54.000]  two fouls one pig and one human just Google makeup of the virus I need to have
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.440]  that it's somewhere in the stack of literally a hundred to the article
[14:56.440 --> 15:07.240]  suggests that I okay here is the giant massive news ladies and gentlemen here
[15:07.240 --> 15:21.440]  it is and remember I did an emergency broadcast Saturday for two hours and 40
[15:21.440 --> 15:28.240]  minutes from 8 p.m. to 10 40 p.m. Central Standard Time and I said I hope this
[15:28.240 --> 15:38.320]  isn't a real crisis the media is engaged in a Psyop in a very sophisticated
[15:38.320 --> 15:44.840]  fashion being implemented with precision their actions show that they
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.000]  believe this is the worst thing since the 1918 Spanish flu the caliber 40
[15:49.000 --> 16:00.960]  million people their actions say one thing but their words are another their
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.320]  words are oh it's no big deal but Mexico is completely shutting down its
[16:05.320 --> 16:10.480]  government its restaurants its schools but we're gonna leave the borders wide
[16:10.480 --> 16:15.960]  open it's no big deal but if some American has TV and flies back from
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.400]  Greece everybody's got a panic but stuff far worse every day comes across the
[16:20.400 --> 16:23.760]  border meanwhile the lawyer that did that dad's one of the head TV people at
[16:23.760 --> 16:28.720]  the CDC that was all Psyop but but I digress that's just more the intel that
[16:28.720 --> 16:36.000]  adds into the mix to be very simple and to put it very simply and I got huge
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.160]  news in a moment but it's got to be explained in a congruent connected
[16:43.160 --> 16:54.560]  wholeness to be clear and I don't like what I'm seeing folks I'm actually not
[16:54.560 --> 17:04.080]  shaken as I'm steeled against all of this but more like thunder struck dumb
[17:04.080 --> 17:15.960]  found it just we're gonna find out in the next few days ladies and gentlemen
[17:15.960 --> 17:21.080]  exactly what's going on but it doesn't look good it looks like this is the
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.480]  move for the complete takeover now it remains to be seen is the virus hyper
[17:26.480 --> 17:34.120]  deadly and if it isn't this is the biggest hoax in history and is an
[17:34.120 --> 17:43.640]  absolutely diabolical crime of unbelievable proportions I mean if
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.160]  they are gearing up for martial law and shutting everything down and panicking
[17:49.160 --> 17:54.680]  the entire planet over seven deaths in Mexico the Mexicans are saying it's not
[17:54.680 --> 18:00.720]  150 some it's not 200 something it's seven deaths confirmed and tested one
[18:00.720 --> 18:04.440]  death in the United States there's other deaths around the United States but
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.840]  they keep saying oh we don't know if it was this fluid on it was an influenza
[18:08.840 --> 18:15.240]  but we don't know you've got these vaccine makers now saying they've already
[18:15.240 --> 18:21.880]  done a vaccine trial and have a vaccine Novavax the group fingered by Horowitz
[18:21.880 --> 18:27.520]  is now out today saying they've got the vaccine ladies and gentlemen they've
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.960]  got the vaccine a weekend of this when it normally takes six months come on how
[18:31.960 --> 18:41.600]  much more ridiculous is it have to get I don't know and then I have an internal

[36:17.800 --> 36:21.800]  but this we need to really point out how dire things are you know the media is
[36:21.800 --> 36:24.680]  fear mongering and then saying everything's fine as a psych warfare op
[36:24.680 --> 36:27.960]  we need to show what's really going on here and explain to people Texas doctor
[36:27.960 --> 36:32.640]  claims swine flu cases far worse than reported we need to add says that feds
[36:32.640 --> 36:37.800]  have stated they're at level six level six the country is under level six I'm
[36:37.800 --> 36:41.120]  telling you we're under level six that's what's being announced that's what's
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.200]  being done in their actions the things they're announcing is a level six
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.480]  response Joe Biden comes out and says don't get on planes don't get on trains
[36:50.480 --> 36:58.440]  Mexico is completely shutting everything down including the government they're
[36:58.440 --> 37:03.680]  starting to shut down roads and transport this means they believe it is
[37:03.680 --> 37:09.640]  mega deadly and in and is in mega I mean millions of dead and the UN and others
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.040]  are saying millions and millions could die they're out fear mongering I have
[37:13.040 --> 37:16.360]  those reports in fact I was looking at my stack I printed it this morning well
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.960]  you guys print millions dead but millions dead flu and it'll pull up the UN and
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.480]  other saying millions could die I'm not saying that they're saying that and I
[37:25.480 --> 37:32.640]  can't even keep track of how insane this is now this is the actual document
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.400]  earlier we just took excise parts out and put it in Paul's article we're gonna
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.960]  post the document itself but blacked out the area so you don't find out who sent
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.720]  it to us this message including all attachments is for the sole use of

[38:03.520 --> 38:06.880]  please call and send her immediately reply well we were given this by an
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.760]  administrator so that's their issue now I'm sorry we're gonna tell people what
[38:10.760 --> 38:16.960]  the feds are telling the state this is from an administrator in health that's
[38:16.960 --> 38:19.320]  all I can say and I'm gonna leave it there I'm not gonna say whether it's a
[38:19.320 --> 38:25.600]  middle school an elementary high school this is from Austin Texas I know this
[38:25.600 --> 38:41.920]  person period this is first hand you understand flu update from Dr. General
[38:41.920 --> 38:52.560]  GITERLE and we have his full name up on prisonplanet.com Marcus General out of
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.480]  New Braunfels, Texas and Paul put in here to his patients I told Paul to
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.400]  correct that and they're not bashing anybody it's crazy up here this was an
[39:01.400 --> 39:04.680]  internal thing to school administrators okay he's working with the school that's
[39:04.680 --> 39:07.160]  the school district where they shut down the schools where they have the first
[39:07.160 --> 39:14.400]  cases in Texas okay reported Saturday after I return from the public health
[39:14.400 --> 39:17.240]  meeting yesterday with community leaders and school officials in Comal
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.520]  County Heather suggested I send an update to everyone because what we are
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.240]  hearing privately from the CDC and Health Department is so different from what
[39:25.240 --> 39:32.760]  you're hearing in the media some of you know so some of you or maybe all of you
[39:32.760 --> 39:37.920]  but I will just list the facts that I know the virus is infectious for about
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.640]  two days prior to symptoms onset the virus sheds more than seven days after
[39:42.640 --> 39:49.280]  symptom onset possibly as long as nine days that's a total of 11 days since it
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.120]  is such a novel new virus there is no herd immunity so the attack rate is very
[39:54.120 --> 40:00.520]  high this is the percentage of people come down with a virus of exposed almost
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.280]  everyone who has exposed the virus will become infected though not all will be
[40:04.280 --> 40:09.160]  symptomatic this is much higher than seasonal flu which averages 10 to 15
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.120]  percent the clinical attack rate may be around this is a quote from the feds he
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.800]  says maybe around 40 to 50 percent this is that is the number of people who show
[40:20.800 --> 40:27.040]  symptoms this is a huge number it is hard to convey the seriousness of this the
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.840]  virulence or deadliness of the virus is as bad here as in Mexico now that's the
[40:32.840 --> 40:35.600]  question we've been always meaning the answer is it race specific is it
[40:35.600 --> 40:38.920]  chemical specific as of the toxic waste and the people being run down in Mexico
[40:38.920 --> 40:43.280]  the poor one of the biggest and poorest cities in the world reportedly the
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.720]  biggest and poorest okay now and I'm getting this from other doctors and other
[40:47.720 --> 40:51.560]  people okay you understand this is being confirmed right now the virulence
[40:51.560 --> 40:58.040]  deadliness of the virus is bad is as bad as here in Mexico the virulence and
[40:58.040 --> 41:01.800]  deadliness of the virus is as bad here as in Mexico and there are folks on
[41:01.800 --> 41:06.560]  ventilators here in the US right now this has not been in the media but a 23
[41:06.560 --> 41:11.040]  month old see this was this was Tuesday night and then he died the next morning
[41:11.040 --> 41:15.880]  so this went out Tuesday night I got this yesterday see this is confirmed
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.400]  time-stamped he knew about this from the feds before he's a new Braun full
[41:21.400 --> 41:27.680]  south of Austin he knows about the baby beforehand but a 23 month old near here
[41:27.680 --> 41:31.560]  is fighting for his life and a pregnant woman just south of San Antonio is
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.840]  fighting for her life in Mexico these folks might have died already but here
[41:35.840 --> 41:41.320]  in the US folks are getting Tamiflu and wrestling quickly and have ready access
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.200]  to ventilators we just got a secret Pentagon document confirmed that says
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.280]  the Tamiflu the military is admitting that in all the troops by the way what
[41:49.280 --> 41:53.440]  this means is that within a couple of weeks regional hospitals will likely
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.080]  become overwhelmed did you hear that some of the kids with positive cases in
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.760]  Comal County had more than 70 contacts before diagnosis that means they're
[42:01.760 --> 42:07.960]  saying 35 of them will get it there are 10 to 25 times more actual cases not
[42:07.960 --> 42:13.440]  possible cases actual you hear that then what is being reported in the media this
[42:13.440 --> 42:19.400]  is two days ago the way the judge the way they fudge on reporting this is that
[42:19.400 --> 42:24.920]  it takes three days to get the confirmatory nod from the CDC to give
[42:24.920 --> 42:30.000]  viral culture but based on epidemiological grounds we know that
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.680]  there are more than 10 cases for each confirmed case right now and here's the
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.120]  key during the night we cross the threshold this is 30s plus hours ago
[42:39.120 --> 42:48.720]  I don't know how many hours ago is 10 o'clock Tuesday night how many hours is
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.760]  that more than 36 during the night we cross the threshold for the definition
[42:53.760 --> 42:57.480]  of the World Health Organization phase 6 global pandemic this has not happened in
[42:57.480 --> 43:01.400]  any of our lifetime so far we are in uncharted territory they've now announced
[43:01.400 --> 43:05.120]  it's a global pandemic by the way I expect President Obama will declare
[43:05.120 --> 43:09.400]  emergency sometime the next 72 to 96 hours this may not happen but if it
[43:09.400 --> 43:13.760]  does I will be surprised if it doesn't when this happens all public gatherings
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.520]  will be canceled for 10 days I suggest all of us avoid public gatherings
[43:17.520 --> 43:22.680]  outdoor activities are not as likely to lead to infection it is contained areas
[43:22.680 --> 43:26.600]  and close contact that are the biggest risk and it goes on I gotta go to 10
[43:26.600 --> 43:29.640]  penny because I'm going to come up on TV in a minute and I apologize her for
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.320]  talking the last eight nine minutes but I had to put this out then Biden we have
[43:33.320 --> 43:37.240]  this last night and we're so conditioned around here that you know for
[43:37.240 --> 43:41.040]  incredible news we don't even really do a story on there's no sleeping anymore
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.280]  for my crew this is what everything we've been working towards to fight it's
[43:45.280 --> 43:48.040]  now coming to a head everywhere the whole world's listening to us literally
[43:48.040 --> 43:52.120]  tens of millions right now we are exploding right now we are fighting the
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.880]  enemy we are engaging the enemy we are in the X wings in the trenches on the
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.920]  death stars but right now we are on their tail and and this is life and death we
[44:00.920 --> 44:04.920]  have got to get the maximum effort and everybody has got a mirror all the
[44:04.920 --> 44:07.760]  stories and info wars dot com and present planet dot com because we are
[44:07.760 --> 44:13.440]  under unbelievable attacks confirmed right now to shut us down and I want to
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.000]  come in the team out there let's go to Dr. Sherry 10 penny who's done practice
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.560]  in Mexico and the US been covering the bird flu extensively on international
[44:20.560 --> 44:25.600]  TV and radio and Dr. 10 penny you just heard that briefing I did Biden
[44:25.600 --> 44:31.280]  confirms this and just says look don't get on trains don't get in airplanes and
[44:31.280 --> 44:34.840]  they've known this now turns out for weeks they're using this as a total
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.280]  takeover whether it's deadly or not this may be disinfo Pentagon stuff they put
[44:39.280 --> 44:43.400]  out to scare the locals to create covert height for the federalization as a
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.520]  as a cover during economic collapse or and I hope that you know that's a lesser
[44:47.520 --> 44:52.320]  of two evils lesser of two weevils as they say and master and commander but
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.400]  this could be real it's clearly engineered dr. 10 penny go ahead Wow
[44:57.400 --> 45:06.800]  Alex that time it's like what do I say after that you know it's um it's it's
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.560]  overwhelming and it and you know it's hard for me to stand over here and feel
[45:11.560 --> 45:16.680]  kind of like the the Lone Ranger and say gosh I can't imagine that that that
[45:16.680 --> 45:20.600]  all is real of the way that they're saying it I mean the the pandemic
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.520]  potential I mean there's if this was really super the way that it is I mean
[45:24.520 --> 45:27.960]  why are we seeing little spotty things here and there why aren't there tens of
[45:27.960 --> 45:32.160]  thousands of people already sick why is it that if the CDC says that we have
[45:32.160 --> 45:36.680]  36,000 deaths per year of influenza why is it that one child who had underlying
[45:36.680 --> 45:40.120]  health health problems who died in south Texas why does that make front page
[45:40.120 --> 45:47.240]  news why is it that coincidentally that you know the government bought two
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.160]  billion dollars worth of Tamiflu three years ago and I've been told that the
[45:51.160 --> 45:54.720]  Tamiflu has a three-year shelf life and isn't it just interesting that that was
[45:54.720 --> 45:58.000]  three years ago when they bought that is this a way for Merck to unload their
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.760]  their inventory of their old stuff Merck is also giving 80,000 doses of
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.040]  pneumonia shots of adult pneumonia shots to Mexico even though it's been proven in
[46:07.040 --> 46:10.000]  the medical literature it does nothing to ward off the flu well everything
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.040]  globalist do is doctor is multifaceted and they wouldn't just do this for Merck
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.320]  to get the Tamiflu but they that's a fringe benefit or a little extra
[46:18.320 --> 46:24.960]  goodie you know a perk it's clearly being used as a smokescreen for Chrysler
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.400]  going under declaring bankruptcy today everything and plotting the economic
[46:29.400 --> 46:34.680]  numbers are just we are descending into horrible depression right now and so
[46:34.680 --> 46:37.640]  clearly they're hyping at the smokescreen that and then Obama you know
[46:37.640 --> 46:41.560]  gives a speech last night hardly mentions it and acts all calm as our daddy
[46:41.560 --> 46:47.200]  figure but please continue well it's just it's just you know kind of coming in
[46:47.200 --> 46:51.480]  from all directions and it's not we're not going to know the end game until the
[46:51.480 --> 46:55.400]  end games here you know because what you just teed up on the on your intro there
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.680]  is true I mean is this just a smokescreen or is this the real thing it's
[47:00.680 --> 47:04.440]  hard for me to imagine that this is just absolutely the real thing with this few
[47:04.440 --> 47:09.240]  reported cases and as few reported deaths as we've had that those number of
[47:09.240 --> 47:12.240]  deaths are smaller than the number of people killed in a car accident in a
[47:12.240 --> 47:17.720]  month I mean where where is aware the hype and hysteria and the panic that's
[47:17.720 --> 47:22.320]  being kind of put out there is is just beyond all rational ability no it is an
[47:22.320 --> 47:28.680]  active psychological terrorism it is an act of screaming fire in the theater in
[47:28.680 --> 47:32.720]  a public place but meanwhile their grandstanding is the saver just like they
[47:32.720 --> 47:36.080]  terrorizes and said give us the banker take over powers or we'll have a
[47:36.080 --> 47:39.160]  depression and that triggered the depression even though they got their
[47:39.160 --> 47:43.000]  powers and things only got worse and as they set up the bank of the world and
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.880]  the world government publicly no one's talking about that is the g20 sets it up
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.440]  and they pass carbon taxes I agree with you but what if what the feds are
[47:51.440 --> 47:56.800]  telling these doctors and now Biden's confirmed it that it's so mega deadly and
[47:56.800 --> 48:01.120]  that there's all these people on ventilators I mean but Alex they said
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.680]  that three years ago about bird flu to remember yes the exact same thing 50%
[48:06.680 --> 48:11.080]  death rate this is the setting it up for the next pandemic is being spread by
[48:11.080 --> 48:14.840]  wild geese flying around the country they had people on the borders into in
[48:14.840 --> 48:18.800]  Germany shooting down geese I mean they said the same thing three years ago
[48:18.800 --> 48:22.880]  that's a good point we need to do a story on that and and then I guess none of
[48:22.880 --> 48:25.440]  them will get in trouble when it turns out it wasn't real they'll just pat
[48:25.440 --> 48:29.160]  themselves in the backs and make absolutely we were better prepared this
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.000]  time because of what we did before and thank God for Tama flu and thank God
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.240]  that's bio shield to allow us to ramp up on all of these vaccines so that we
[48:37.240 --> 48:41.320]  could have them already in handy it's the same it's the same playbook man the
[48:41.320 --> 48:46.080]  same playbook as they did in 1976 with the swine flu with SARS with bird flu
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.320]  it's the same playbook now the circumstances may be a little bit
[48:50.320 --> 48:53.840]  different economically globally but in terms of what they're doing they would
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.040]  stand 50% death rate from each five in one the bird flu three years ago so this
[48:58.040 --> 49:02.080]  is no different maybe it's even the same well the only way it's different is the
[49:02.080 --> 49:07.160]  scare is 50 times better I mean I don't know I remember the same thing because I
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.480]  was writing my book foul at that time and I felt like I was writing it in real
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.520]  time with all of the news reports they were coming out daily this and that and
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.080]  this and that and do the Tama flu and ramping up with Roche it was the same
[49:18.080 --> 49:25.000]  thing it's the same thing well I know they're certainly training us so when
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.360]  they do release a real bio weapon we all do what we're told this is certainly a
[49:28.360 --> 49:33.280]  drill for martial law well absolutely I don't I don't disagree with that at all
[49:33.280 --> 49:37.720]  but that that the hysteria and hype and I remember it so well because I was in
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.320]  the middle of writing a book in real time at the end while that was all going
[49:41.320 --> 49:45.560]  on that it was the same sort of thing they were they were tracking they were
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.200]  setting up panels all over everywhere I went to two or three I went to the first
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.880]  two National Bird Flu Summit in Washington DC on my own I funded myself to
[49:53.880 --> 49:57.920]  go to those to listen to the hype that was happening then that was and then they
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.760]  had people from the World Health Organization saying this isn't maybe
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.720]  it's going to happen it will happen and they said it repeatedly and that was
[50:05.720 --> 50:10.080]  three years ago and then they put forth all of those documents and so yes they
[50:10.080 --> 50:13.520]  ramped it up maybe this is a trial another trial run to see that all the
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.480]  systems are in place but it's really the hype is not that much different than it
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.200]  was three years ago well I don't remember all of this I don't remember them
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.440]  shutting down schools all around me and then the president down schools but the
[50:27.440 --> 50:31.240]  whole historic stereo about not no I understand but the vice president has
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.280]  come out dr. Moon come back and ask you about this the vice president in fact
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.800]  John you have that clip at the network right now the jet they know it's the
[50:40.800 --> 50:45.440]  Joe Biden clip it's everywhere yeah it's drudge it's everywhere I want to I want
[50:45.440 --> 50:51.200]  to play Joe Biden when we get back it's only 20 seconds long on national TV
[50:51.200 --> 50:56.240]  saying don't get on planes don't get on trains don't get on subways I mean this
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.800]  is incredible if this if this will kill our economy before you throw away your

[54:13.320 --> 54:22.280]  front porch sitting in an old rocking chair the sun is hot in the Texas
[54:22.280 --> 54:31.880]  sky garden growing clothes well I hope Dr. Sherry 10 pennies right I hope these
[54:31.880 --> 54:35.600]  criminals are just typing all of this fear as a political smoke screen and to
[54:35.600 --> 54:39.760]  sell tens of billions of dollars worth of vaccines and drugs that's bad enough I
[54:39.760 --> 54:47.240]  hope it isn't real I hope that it doesn't spread with 40 50% infections and
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.880]  but I know they compartmentalized doctors in Fairmonger and I've caught the feds
[54:50.880 --> 54:55.920]  doing this many times in the past but Dr. Sherry 10 penny I wanted to ask you
[54:55.920 --> 55:03.240]  about the Royal Society Academy of Medical Sciences document April 27 2006
[55:03.240 --> 55:07.760]  tied in with the the very vaccine makers that claim they've already got a
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.640]  vaccine for this by the way a nova vaccine others it says use of live
[55:12.640 --> 55:16.680]  vaccines Dr. Wood and Robertson were asked their opinion of priming the
[55:16.680 --> 55:21.480]  population for a pandemic using live vaccines and if they consider it to be
[55:21.480 --> 55:28.320]  a good idea however the timing is critical live H5N1 vaccines are used
[55:28.320 --> 55:31.840]  now it would be considered too dangerous but if a pandemic is imminent the
[55:31.840 --> 55:36.320]  risk may be justified a stockpile of live vaccine with the cleavage site
[55:36.320 --> 55:39.960]  removed can be used to prime the population in advance of the pandemic
[55:39.960 --> 55:46.520]  reaching the UK what does that mean well it's the lot the live virus backs the flu
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.720]  that flu shots that are out there are manufactured by flu mist that's the
[55:50.720 --> 55:55.280]  intranasal injection of the flu of the flu vaccine as opposed to an
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.720]  injection with the other shots there were several reports that came out over
[55:59.720 --> 56:04.120]  the last year or so about that they were going to try using the H5N1 in
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.600]  flu mist an attenuated form of it or a weakened form of it to try to get it
[56:09.600 --> 56:14.760]  out into the population more so they've been trying to do that all along what is
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.560]  the time I mean Alex is of them being able to come up with a flu vaccine a
[56:18.560 --> 56:23.720]  lot quicker the cell line technologies are are able to harvest within six to
[56:23.720 --> 56:28.320]  eight weeks so I don't know if any of those factories are up in production yet
[56:28.320 --> 56:32.840]  in the US they might be in Germany no no the facts I have their press release
[56:32.840 --> 56:36.440]  they say they now have a vaccine for this very flu they help them they're
[56:36.440 --> 56:40.160]  using cell line technology which means that they're using cells of aborted
[56:40.160 --> 56:46.080]  fetal tissues rep of cells of rip of aborted fetal tissue dog kidney cells
[56:46.080 --> 56:49.640]  or insect cells to grow the flu virus those are the three cell line
[56:49.640 --> 56:52.920]  technologies that are out there yeah I've got their press release we'll cover
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.360]  it later where are you now I know you're back in the United States doctor yeah I'm
[56:57.360 --> 57:01.960]  in San Antonio we were we were heading out today we're going down to Houston
[57:01.960 --> 57:05.640]  and then we're going home and then I'm going to California my and my husband's
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.800]  going to Ohio but you know what you said at the close of that last segment
[57:09.800 --> 57:13.560]  Alex I think it's really important when you said that if Biden is saying don't
[57:13.560 --> 57:17.600]  get on trains don't get on airplanes don't get on buses you know part of
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.960]  this may be the last final implosion of the American economy because I said that
[57:21.960 --> 57:25.920]  as I was leaving Mexico they showed the scenes of these big mega hotels on the
[57:25.920 --> 57:29.920]  beaches that were empty and empty be no that I mean economies on the verge of
[57:29.920 --> 57:33.680]  dying this will kill everything this will be what pushes us under let's play
[57:33.680 --> 57:38.240]  that clip right now get your final comment here we go I would tell members of
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.680]  my family and I have I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now it's not
[57:42.680 --> 57:46.320]  that it's going to Mexico it's your inner confined aircraft when one person
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.960]  sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft that's me I would not be at
[57:50.960 --> 57:55.040]  this point if I if they had another way of transportation suggesting they ride
[57:55.040 --> 58:00.840]  the subway so from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation if you're
[58:00.840 --> 58:04.320]  out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes that's one thing if you're in a
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.480]  closed aircraft or closed container a closed car closed classroom it's a
[58:08.480 --> 58:12.040]  different thing let me turn to the economy dr. Sherry Tim penny so that
[58:12.040 --> 58:15.560]  will be the final nail on our coffin and I guess the bankers get to come in with
[58:15.560 --> 58:20.440]  all the trillions of L out money they're hoarding and buy up what's left sounds
[58:20.440 --> 58:24.520]  like that sounds like the plan Alex oh but they're elites in power they're not
[58:24.520 --> 58:28.000]  ruthless they're not into getting more power you know we can trust them they
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.360]  actually care about us dr. Sherry Tim penny we get your website linked up an

[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:06.720]  assumed pandemic proportions according to the World Health Organization WHO the
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:11.480]  first cases were reported in Mexico earlier in April when a new strain of
[1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:16.360]  swine-based influenza virus was reported and raking out taking at the
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:21.680]  initial few lives the actual outbreak of the killer disease however is believed
[1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:27.960]  to have started in March 2009 whatever the case on April 29th and an
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:34.280]  emergency meeting of the WHO a pandemic alert status of 5 was announced for the
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:40.720]  spread calling it an imminent threat to everyone in the world by April 28th the
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:46.040]  mutated flu virus was confirmed to have spread to the United States the United
[1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:51.920]  Kingdom Continental Europe and as far away as New Zealand as of April 30th the
[1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:58.040]  number of countries with suspected cases stands at 41 while there is no vaccine
[1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:02.320]  available at the moment for the disease and measures to come up with one
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:05.120]  we are summer casting with international television listeners
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:09.160]  we're throwing over to them the situation is far too great to be
[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:15.320]  contained and immediate steps should be taken to confront the epidemic so for
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:19.960]  corners asked if the threat is as serious as it is portrayed in the media
[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:25.840]  what are the socioeconomic costs involved and whether the global media are
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:46.200]  doing justice to the issue by inducing a controlled panic
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:19.920]  hello and welcome to tonight's edition of four corners here on press TV with me
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:26.120]  jubens are one where the topic of our discussion is flying flu how big and real
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:31.840]  is the threat joining me is an interesting panel of guests from London we
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:37.640]  have a doctor Mike Skinner he's a senior lecturer in virology from the
[1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:43.880]  Imperial College of London from Austin Texas though on the phone we're joined
[1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:49.560]  by Alex Jones he's a documentary filmmaker and investigative journalist and
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:56.400]  a syndicated radio talk show host coming from info wars.com it's good to have you
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.880]  both gentlemen now let me come to you first doctor Skinner in London now
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:06.640]  tell me about the severity the magnitude of this medical problem how deadly is of
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:15.880]  this virus and how real was the threat we don't yet know how deadly it is we
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:22.400]  really have so few cases outside of Mexico at the moment which have been
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:28.720]  documented and well documented whereas the situation in Mexico is unclear
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:34.960]  simply because it's being the point of outbreak of course it's likely that many
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:41.080]  cases occurred and were maybe relatively mild before we realized that we were
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:46.600]  dealing with a potential pandemic situation so because of that it's not
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:53.000]  clear how severe this disease is going to be in terms of its mortality its
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:59.040]  ability to spread seems fairly self-evident although even there we
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:03.960]  need to know more information and that will become apparent in coming days and
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:11.760]  then weeks as we see how much is spreading to countries where it has been introduced I'm
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:15.520]  obviously not a medical expert nor a scientist but then what happened in the
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:21.240]  matter of few days that the WHO raised the alert status bar a couple of degrees
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:26.600]  higher from level or phase two to phase five there must be some clear and
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:33.240]  evident reason for that there are big criteria for each of the stages what
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.040]  one you have to remember that is that here when we're talking about pandemic
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:43.120]  that the main definition is its ability to spread it's not definitely tied in
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:53.760]  with its disease as it causes and and in this case it was shown to move up to
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:12:01.080]  five which occurred last night required evidence of sustained transmission in
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:09.560]  two countries in one region and Mexico and US the situation there qualified to
[1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:16.400]  raise it up to five and Alex show now tell me about the immediate dimensions to
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:24.320]  this issue now have in your sense the issue of the threat that been blown out
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:30.360]  of proportion exaggerated in some sort well we're not sure at this time
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:34.120]  and I agree with much of what the doctor just said I've interviewed six
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:38.840]  different doctors several virologists myself since last Friday when we began
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.440]  covering this in earnest and here's what we know 35,000 of Americans on die on
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:49.600]  average a year that as many Mexicans die of just the normal seasonal flues that
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.440]  come from the east and and then we have the flu season that just ended a month
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:59.520]  ago so it's very rare to have a new flu this time of year coming out of the
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:06.920]  western hemisphere then we even have the fact that it's a multiple bird RNA human
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:13.240]  RNA pig RNA they're saying some other RNA in there a lot of bio weapons experts
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.320]  and others are in the international media saying this looks like a designer
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:19.840]  virus Wayne Madsen who worked with the National Security Agency been the press
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:25.720]  interviewing members of who have degrees in virology
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:29.920]  a doctorate saying it looks like it's engineered so so later I would like to
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:33.800]  ask the doctor that but let me get this out to people I'm in Texas and just south
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:38.560]  of me is where they had the first Texas outbreaks and I know high-level school
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:44.680]  administrators known to me personally who yesterday gave me secret documents
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:49.640]  reporting that they're really at a level six now that they told me a day and a
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:53.840]  half ago we were really at level five before they announced it level six is
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:59.720]  complete and total martial law so this I mean I hope this isn't a deadly virus I
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:06.560]  hope it doesn't have 40 to 50 percent infection rate of people that come in
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:11.200]  contact with it in fact they have the terms here in the document the clinical
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:15.680]  attack rate is 40 to 50 percent they're saying people are really on ventilators
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:21.680]  all over Texas and that it's far worse so Biden's saying don't get on planes
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:26.120]  don't get on subways the vice president is basically saying what this secret
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:31.480]  document is saying what's now up on prison planet calm so the government in
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.400]  its actions is in the Mexican government is shut down the government
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:38.520]  they're acting like it's the end of the world but they did that with SARS they
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:41.720]  did that with other things so this may just be hyped to sell vaccines and
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:46.720]  Tamiflu go ahead all right now back to you in London the doctors care now the
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:53.360]  other guest was purporting that there is an engineered crisis on in the offing
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:58.680]  you that this virus just might happen to be a syncretic and the
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:04.600]  synthetically made virus and the outbreak as well now do you have any
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:11.280]  scientific argument to repud that or defund that I don't think you need a
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:18.360]  particular scientific argument it's well known that flu changes mutates from
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:25.400]  year to year for season to season you can begin to track down even at this stage
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:32.840]  with relatively having had relatively little time to study the virus the
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:38.200]  sequence of events which has probably taken place over almost a decade to get
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:43.880]  to the stage that we're at now and what I have to say and then let's face it the
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:49.560]  same argument was made many years ago about the origins of HIV that it was
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:54.240]  genetically engineered virus and in both cases you have to say that given the
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:16:00.120]  week we don't really understand the pathogenicity of this present virus how
[1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:10.120]  pathogenic it will be and what might contribute to his particular nature
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.760]  I think the differed doctor Dr. Skinner and this is still keeping with you now
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:22.360]  now it is not true that in the past the 30 odd years ago there was a hope of the
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:28.160]  flu scare in the states I suppose it was in 1976 and this then all until a tool
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:32.400]  rigor brings in the question that some people put to you guys as scientists
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:38.480]  that how trustable are these procedures I'd like to comment logically speaking in
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:46.040]  terms of identifying determining an epidemic sorry scientific procedures
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:50.560]  that you are familiar with I mean well I mean we know governments have
[1:16:50.560 --> 1:17:00.560]  engineered bioweapons we know that this is dr. Skinner yes go after dr. I'm sorry
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:05.440]  can you please show us the question was in the past in 1976 the American
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:10.160]  Authority it clearly bundled up a crisis of sorts in terms of saying to the
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:15.000]  people that there is a pandemic of flu and then it turned out to be mistaken
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:21.240]  it was a hoax I did scientifically that it won't be the case at this time round
[1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:28.440]  it would be pleased if it were there was what happened I think you remember and
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:33.880]  it was many years ago even in my scientific career was that in 76 that
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:40.160]  they discovered a gain of swine flu in the US and they said that seems to be
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:45.520]  causing problems they would came out of an army camp but I don't think there is
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:52.440]  always does I'd like to comment on this it was an out of camp and let me
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:57.000]  have the whole java doctor I'm gonna get back to you but Alex Jones you have
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:02.040]  something to say go ahead jump in yes yeah we are up on the swine flu epidemic
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:06.080]  we have the government fear mongering ads they ran on TV posted up on
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:10.640]  prison planet calm and info wars calm they said it was gonna kill millions they
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.880]  said they had to vaccinate the entire American people Gerald Ford did and then
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:17.160]  the vaccine started killing so many people giving them autoimmune disease
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:22.280]  and killing them they had to stop it just like bird flu trials they just had
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.680]  this year and last year in Europe had to get suspended because it killed so many
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:30.880]  people on IntelliGraph BBC French news agency have all reported that we had
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:35.080]  black men given syphilis and allowed to die over over 45 years in Alabama we
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:39.640]  had 4,000 plus US foster children taken from their parents and radiated to death
[1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:45.280]  in secret test the first in 1918 broke out at a US military base as part of
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:51.640]  vaccination program I have that from the Boston Globe Cicera 1918 I have all of
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:59.480]  these documents the last you'll swine flu in 1918 I meant to say and then the
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:06.040]  last swine flu in 1976 broke out there at a military base so it's
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:10.640]  the same thing over and over and over again I'm saying we have to look at the
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:16.040]  companies for a second I'd like to I'd like you to elaborate for viewership the
[1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:21.120]  evidence is the proof that you have so gathered to pack up your argument where
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:25.760]  are they from let me be clear I'm not saying this is a government attack I'm
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:30.200]  not saying that we know that right now it could be a real a mutated flu like he
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:33.160]  just said but it's the fact that it came out of nowhere and they weren't
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:36.320]  tracking anything similar to it as he said it would take years for it to
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:40.280]  mutate like this this just came screaming out of nowhere the only place we see
[1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:44.960]  something similar to this is in the hundreds of big biotech labs where
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:49.800]  they're basically coming back to you in a little while look doctor again to you
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:54.480]  now it's the vaccine labs it's where it probably came from to help me out with
[1:19:54.480 --> 1:20:00.000]  the political and social economic dimensions to this crisis how big is
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:10.320]  that no I really I can't say that's in my my area of expertise you're seeing I
[1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:17.680]  think quite a generally a reasonable approach around the world from that
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:21.720]  have been caused to clamp down completely on the air travel I think the
[1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:26.360]  responsive generally responsible they recognize we recognize that that would
[1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:31.680]  be counterproductive and I think most countries are taking quite a rational
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:37.920]  approach to try and control the vocal instructions of the virus into their
[1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:45.040]  country to try and stop it spreading to building into a large epidemic at the
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:49.360]  moment we have the benefit of the time of the year at least in the northern
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:55.080]  hemisphere where it's not the time of year we would expect seasonal flu to
[1:20:55.080 --> 1:21:00.600]  normally to spread well and then we can hope that with careful control of the
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:05.880]  introduction that in the northern hemisphere we'll be able to stop the
[1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:13.600]  spread of the virus to a large extent you think your predictions that we can
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:18.560]  contain it that's not confronted predictions I don't think one can be
[1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:23.080]  into that kind of a game we don't know enough about it and a lot of what's
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:27.600]  going to happen is stochastic it's down to chance that it's worldwide already I
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:32.080]  mean it's already spreading everywhere I mean it's I think we have a good
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:38.000]  chance to limit it it's not rushing out of control in some of the European
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:43.680]  countries and to which it's been introduced but it can go wrong and we
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:48.800]  have to we have to be on top of it this is why people do need to know what's
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:53.400]  happening I think a lot of reporting has been pretty responsible people need to
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:59.280]  know that there is this threat if they have been to areas of where they might
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:03.080]  be an expert of the virus and they need to know that if they come up with
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:08.560]  appropriate things they need to alert the authorities well I mean if this is a
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:15.920]  bit about the political ones and specifically the impact that this
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:21.880]  crisis will have on the global feed on the back of the swamp in world economy
[1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:26.480]  okay our governments are not stupid the Mexican government knows quote shutting
[1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:31.040]  down it's all its resorts telling Americans the Europeans to leave shutting
[1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:35.840]  down their government you know their actions say that they think this is
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:39.120]  really bad but then they say everything's fine everything's wonderful
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:42.040]  we're just shutting our whole country down you know that they normally have
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:44.480]  20 plus thousand or more diet flu
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:58.920]  okay but I mean this will destroy our economy the government is destroying our
[1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:02.800]  economy can you hear me because you asked a question and now you're you're
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:10.840]  choppy dr. Jones yes okay you are not in here right now because there is another
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:16.680]  maybe full line or we can hear other sounds maybe for another show whatever
[1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:21.880]  yeah well that's not us so yeah I mean you there's also feedback from your
[1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:27.560]  line oh oh maybe you have got a TV out there yes no no we're not sending any
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:33.600]  audio out or down you guys you guys have got a feedback loop that you're
[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:49.680]  feeding me too much of your audio so so yes okay just I want to fix it this is
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:52.880]  real radio folks doesn't get any more real than this man we're about to go back
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:57.840]  live on our main transmission here ladies and gentlemen that info wars.com and
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:05.400]  on the M&M stations here we go okay if you have got the TV out there and if you
[1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:10.480]  somehow the sound is really off no ma'am no ma'am no ma'am we have nothing
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:16.600]  being fed you have a phone line to your studios in England correct and we are
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:20.840]  not sending anything down your your guys are sending too much audio into your
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:27.280]  board to to myself yes you're here I turn it down I turn it down alright okay
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:32.720]  I'm ready to roll or there was the interview done yeah great
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:40.640]  we'll be for all of us we don't yet know so it you know what happened it we can
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:55.120]  get started with people's lives spectacle people will be fine
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:56.320]  of them
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:56.960]  i
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:24:58.040]  it would like
[1:24:58.040 --> 1:24:58.920]  bird
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:00.320]  eighty-and-twice
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:02.040]  and uh... i'd like to
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:05.240]  how do you think that the response of the
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:06.280]  box
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:09.280]  connect
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:13.240]  all right again i'm hooked up with iranian television internationally that
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:15.120]  got the british scientist on there
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.760]  and that uh... i love just to let the iranian tv now
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:21.280]  i am getting the british audio

[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:52.880]  yeah what was happening was they were either feeding something down the line
[1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:57.720]  there you hear that echo that you know that was a feedback sound the whole time
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:00.080]  and then the line was going down i wonder why
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.560]  uh... but uh... yeah that goes into africa all over uh...
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:08.400]  all over the middle east all over central asia that is a big channel
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:10.700]  i've been on there probably twelve thirteen times
[1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:14.040]  fourteen times on it's it's quite a few they want to be down there in studio
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:16.080]  with me today but i just couldn't do it i didn't want to leave
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:18.560]  the radio audience we are somehow casting now
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:19.760]  at prison planet
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:21.920]  dot tv
[1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:24.160]  and uh...
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:28.840]  i believe that's the iranians calling back
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:30.840]  interesting radio there ladies and gentlemen
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.040]  you know there's that uh... british uh... scientists saying
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.600]  all know it's you know no big deal uh... who
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:39.640]  this virus probably developed in the last ten years yes and they track the
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:41.240]  thousands of different viruses
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:42.440]  that's what they do
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:44.720]  and nothing ever looked anything like this
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:47.880]  this is the kind of stuff they admit though they've been testing in labs and
[1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:48.760]  creating
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:51.240]  splicing all these things together
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:52.160]  and
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:56.000]  they they fear mongered with the swine flu in seventy six
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.920]  that came out of a military base they fear mongered with the nineteen eighteen
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:01.200]  that did kill over forty million people that came out of a military base in the
[1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:01.920]  u.s
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:04.200]  it always does inside job
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:08.280]  and uh... meanwhile mexico shutting down all their trade
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:12.000]  many of their cities their whole government shutting down
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.480]  and they say oh but it's no big deal seven people died
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:16.640]  they're doing this for seven people they say oh
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:19.600]  hundreds haven't died like the u.s. media saying
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:20.880]  only a few have
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:24.160]  and then joe biden everybody say oh it's no big deal one kid died from mexico
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:27.000]  in the u.s. notebook deal but don't fly on planes
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.480]  don't uh... get on trains don't get on subways
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:33.920]  so it's these mixed signals they fear monger and then say everything's okay
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:35.080]  everything's all right
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:38.720]  and then i just read to you the bombshell documents
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:41.440]  and maybe that my audio was even getting good to him as he kept interrupting me
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:43.480]  when i would just start talking for a few seconds
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:46.600]  we'll see that on the press tv video letters may need to grab that
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:48.240]  throw it up on the youtube
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:52.080]  but what a three-ring circus uh... will uh... get that going again
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.440]  okay i've got a bunch of guest uh... coming up
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:59.080]  and i do have some time in this hour
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:02.640]  before lindsay williams joins us when talking about flu the economy
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:05.440]  what is this going to do the economy he was asking me what is this going to do
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:06.280]  the economy
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.760]  iranian presenter was saying what is it going to be coming
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:09.800]  well i mean g
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:13.400]  the pace has fallen massively in the last couple days in mexico
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:16.200]  the chinese and other governments are openly dumping dollars and buying real
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:19.400]  assets and then buying uh... commodities like gold, silver, copper, and other raw
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:20.760]  material
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:22.240]  uh...
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:25.080]  if they say don't get on planes and don't get on trains and
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:28.120]  freeze all of your basic commuting
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:31.200]  that we're in a confined space and they're shutting down schools all over the
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:33.280]  united states and all the schools in mexico
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:36.680]  gee what is that going to do to tourism what is that going to do
[1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:40.560]  everything they're doing is to destroy the economy as i've been saying for years
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:43.920]  and that's to consolidate it they want to butcher this sucker out
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:46.960]  so then you're dependent on them they are using this
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:50.360]  as a crisis now it's bad enough what it's doing to the economy
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:52.200]  it's bad enough what it's doing
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:54.480]  to our name around the world it's bad enough that
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.040]  the vaccines people are going to take that are going to mess them up big time
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:59.480]  they'll just sweep that out of the rug like the swine flu desk
[1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:01.760]  in seventy six
[1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:03.560]  but if this sucker's real
[1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.280]  if what we're confirming with doctors and others
[1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:09.320]  i mean by confirming we're getting this from sources in mexico the u.s. everywhere
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:12.120]  i have internal documents now upon prisonplanet.com
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:15.440]  in the story paul watson wrote
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:19.560]  texas doctor claims swine flu cases far worse than reported
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:21.640]  country now at level six
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:25.400]  and uh... we'll recap this when we get back and take some phone calls one

[1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:39.360]  two five nine nine two three one
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:42.840]  if you're stone all you know i call it a man
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:44.800]  i don't want that this is serious business
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:46.360]  this is big boy pants time
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:48.640]  we'll be right back but big boy pants on
[1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:51.160]  stop smoking the pie
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:52.600]  we're on the march
[1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:55.040]  the empires on the run
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:30:01.040]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:04.680]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:08.600]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that
[1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:12.200]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:12.880]  gold
[1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:16.440]  it's true seeds about performing gold and silver before in this country and it's
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:18.440]  possible that could even happen again
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:22.200]  so our friends at solutions from science put together the perfect mix of
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:23.760]  non-hybrid seeds
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:28.320]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of

[1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:04.640]  in the new world order's war against humanity
[1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:07.280]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:10.280]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:11.840]  that's just as powerful
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:13.360]  just as strong
[1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:14.840]  just as well funded
[1:31:14.840 --> 1:31:19.360]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:21.400]  best interest of the American people
[1:31:21.400 --> 1:31:23.400]  while Obama's already fudging

[1:31:25.880 --> 1:31:30.200]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:31:30.200 --> 1:31:32.120]  who is imposing the program
[1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:36.120]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:37.480]  that's fascism
[1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:39.160]  it's not about left or right
[1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:41.040]  it's about a one-world government
[1:31:41.040 --> 1:31:44.160]  this film documents who Obama works for
[1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.000]  the lies he is told

[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  uh...
[1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:27.680]  we do have to remember that the feds have run around before
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:33.680]  with swine flu in seventy six with the stars of years ago with bird flu
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:37.680]  saying it'll kill half the people it'll kill ninety percent it's all over
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:40.680]  but they usually just shut down a few hospitals and
[1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:44.680]  fear monger this is military running around police state checkpoints
[1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:48.680]  saying we're under U.N. control and mainstream news articles
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:51.680]  the vice president coming out and saying don't fly don't move
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:53.680]  and mexico's totally shut down
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:58.680]  see they'll hyperventilate and scare people but never really shut anything down
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:02.680]  maybe one hospital room or something and go around hyperventilating and saying
[1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:06.680]  don't worry we've got shots and you know we've got medicine for you by the way
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:09.680]  coming up next is you know half the sponsor ads of the group they're
[1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:11.680]  pushing during the news
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:14.680]  and there's just hundreds of billions of dollars in this fear mongering
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:17.680]  every time they do it so that's a motive and uh...
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:21.680]  reportedly not many people have died regular flu kills a lot more than this
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:23.680]  what is the issue
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.680]  but why this incredible overblown response and then i have
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:29.680]  this document out of texas
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:31.680]  from thirty six hours ago
[1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:35.680]  and then it and then this thing came through then we just hadn't seen it until then
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:41.680]  and it's talking about we're not a level five or a level six
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:43.680]  and uh...
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:47.680]  saying they're gonna go to a level five and uh... this is before they even said
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:49.680]  we were at a level five
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:51.680]  we're at a level six
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:53.680]  and then we went to level five yesterday
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:55.680]  and then biden's out saying
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:34:59.680]  go ahead and play the clip here he is
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:01.680]  you got that job
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:03.680]  I would tell members of my family and I have
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:05.680]  I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:07.680]  it's not that it's going to Mexico
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:10.680]  you're in a confined aircraft when one person sneezes
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:12.680]  it goes all the way through the aircraft
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:13.680]  that's me
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:15.680]  I would not be at this point if I
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:17.680]  if they had another way of transportation
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:19.680]  suggesting they ride the subway
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:23.680]  so from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:26.680]  and if you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:29.680]  that's one thing if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:34.680]  or closed car or closed classroom it's a different thing
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:36.680]  so uh... there you have
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:42.680]  um... joe biden or biden as paul wasen likes to call him mr beady eyes
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:44.680]  now listen to this turns out
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:46.680]  this is a perfect hoax for them because it doesn't turn out to be as deadly as they're hyping
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:49.680]  they just say well we were trying to keep you safe
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:52.680]  and then they'll give you the vaccine people drop dead from that
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:55.680]  always happens in the past like the imaginary
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:59.680]  cervical cancer that only kills 3,000 people a year
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:01.680]  sounds like a lot but that's tiny
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:05.680]  I mean it's way down the list of cancers
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:07.680]  and
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:10.680]  it's usually people that are run down, have HIV
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:13.680]  that get this opportunistic cancer virus
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:16.680]  that it infects them
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:18.680]  and then they tell girls they need to take it, boys need to take it
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:21.680]  and they take it and they drop dead and they have autoimmune responses
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:24.680]  I mean this is bad stuff folks
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:26.680]  and they're setting the precedent for this
[1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:30.680]  I want to go over some of this really big UN news, okay
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  this is
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.680]  out of the British news
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:42.680]  out of tgdaily.com
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:45.680]  and it says a pandemic scares
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:48.680]  fail to match up to reality
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:52.680]  and then it goes on
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:55.680]  from there and it says a draft report
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:57.680]  of the federal government's emergency plan predicts
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:00.680]  that as many as 200 million Americans could be infected
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:02.680]  and 200 million could die within a few months
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:07.680]  if the bird flew came to the United States he said
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:11.680]  and it says once again things weren't so bad at the end
[1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:13.680]  after all in 2006
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:16.680]  when the outbreak appeared to have died down the manner
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:19.680]  the number of cases reported by the World Health Organization
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:23.680]  had reached 228 of whom 130 died
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:27.680]  I left my phone in here and it's ringing up against the wall
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:30.680]  will you get it for me right there thank you
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:33.680]  it's a three ring circus in here
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.680]  so that's the type of fear monger they did in the past
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:39.680]  we need to expose a big article about how they fear mongered in the past
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:41.680]  over and over again
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:43.680]  you want to give that to Watson and Curtin M.O. with those
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:46.680]  in fact queue up that we've got a bunch of these
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:49.680]  queue up at 1977
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:51.680]  and when they were still hyping with swine flu
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:53.680]  with the vaccine killing people
[1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:55.680]  that fear mongering video do you have that
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:57.680]  I want to play that fear mongering video in a minute thank you
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:37:59.680]  now
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:02.680]  Jason Bermas read this last night
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:05.680]  this is the United Nations directive
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  to the governments and we have the Reuters article
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:11.680]  Mr. Moon the head of the U.N. Secretary General is saying
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:14.680]  that they're now controlling and running the operation
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:17.680]  telling the United States and Homeland Security what to do
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:20.680]  Supreme Court comes out in the U.S. today and says they follow the orders
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:23.680]  of the Hague and the Netherlands that's now their Supreme Court
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:26.680]  not too supreme then are you
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:29.680]  it says ensure that mechanisms exist for information sharing
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:32.680]  between national authorities who and United Nations
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:35.680]  agencies coordinate with their use
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:38.680]  of the vaccine mechanism set up with implementation of the
[1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:41.680]  international health regulators 1.5 legal ethical issues
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:44.680]  compulsory vaccination
[1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:47.680]  or implementation of emergency shifts and essential services
[1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:50.680]  travel or movement restrictions
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:53.680]  leaving and entering areas where infections established
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:56.680]  closure of educational institutions for prohibition of mass gatherings
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.680]  isolation of quarantine and infected persons or persons suspected
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:02.680]  of being infected or persons from areas where pandemic strains
[1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:05.680]  are established that's section 1.5.2
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:08.680]  ethical issues they are part of the non
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:11.680]  normative framework that is needed to
[1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:14.680]  assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:17.680]  quarantine or selected vaccination
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:20.680]  predefined risk groups and it gets into compulsory
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:23.680]  inoculation
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:26.680]  questions to be addressed what type of surveillance is considered to be needed
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:29.680]  and feasible in the country concerned who should be responsible for data
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:32.680]  collection and analysis
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:35.680]  who use the information for policy development how will national surveillance
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:38.680]  systems coordinate with regional super national
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:41.680]  systems with the World Health Organization
[1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:44.680]  trying to find the I read this last
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:47.680]  night on there we've got a compulsory vaccination
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:50.680]  segment
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:53.680]  in here command and control
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:56.680]  to have uniform policy that is endorsed by all officials it is essential to know who is in charge
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:59.680]  of different activities with communicable disease control
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:02.680]  and how that might change a limited outbreak becomes
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:05.680]  a major emergency
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:08.680]  who is making decisions for the influence of pandemic the prime minister of the president
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:11.680]  the ministry of health the departments a command and control structure should be in place
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:14.680]  outlining the management decision making process of all organizations
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:17.680]  involved in the health emergency including and now they've announced it's the UN
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:20.680]  in control of this you can go read all about
[1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:23.680]  that from the UN
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:26.680]  it's been told that daily by Jerome Corsi
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:29.680]  back in August 28, 2007
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:32.680]  headline US under UN law and health emergency
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:35.680]  Bush's SPP power grab set stage for military
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:38.680]  to manage flu threats remember they sued and got the documents
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:41.680]  and it said the UN would run it well now they've done that they just
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:44.680]  announced it like it's no big deal in Reuters and AP
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:47.680]  it's in my stack
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:50.680]  here from two days ago World Trade Organization it says the secretary
[1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:53.680]  the security and prosperity partnership in North American summit in Canada
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:56.680]  released a plan to establish UN law along with regulations
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:40:59.680]  for the World Trade Organization World Health Organization Supreme
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:02.680]  over US law during a pandemic that sets the
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:05.680]  state for militarizing the management of continental health emergencies
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:08.680]  the North American plan for avian and pandemic influenza
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:11.680]  was finalized at the SPP summit last week in Montabelle
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:14.680]  local back at the time the US
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:17.680]  order command North com has created a web page dedicated to the avian flu
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:20.680]  has been running exercises in preparation for the possible use of US military forces
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:23.680]  and a continental domestic emergency involving avian flu
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:26.680]  and pandemic influenza but virtually no media attention in 2005
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:29.680]  President Bush shifted US policy on avian flu and pandemic
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  influenza placing the country under international
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.680]  guidelines not specifically determined domestic
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:37.680]  agencies the policy shift was
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:40.680]  formalized September 14, 2005 when President Bush announced
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:43.680]  a new international partnership with the avian and pandemic influenza
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:46.680]  to a high level meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:49.680]  that links to all that at the UN
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:52.680]  and it goes on to say that they'll use foreign assets
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:55.680]  that's in the UN's own document I was just covering
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:41:58.680]  they cover food and agriculture
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:01.680]  on the United States roads
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:04.680]  executive orders for forced labor
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:07.680]  it's just homeland security reporting to the United Nations
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:10.680]  North com participated in nationwide joint chief
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:13.680]  staff exercise with the UN involved a scenario
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:16.680]  with the plague originating in Mexico
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:19.680]  guys pull this article up and print me that document
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:22.680]  if you go to the article on page 2 says a pandemic
[1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:25.680]  influenza crisis is one of the four scenarios gained in exercise
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:28.680]  ardent century 06 where they practice really doing the real thing
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:31.680]  involving a scenario of plague in Mexico reaching across
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:34.680]  the border in Arizona and in Mexico
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:37.680]  so go to this article in fact let's on screen that if you can
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:40.680]  let's put up a UN under
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:43.680]  US under UN law and health emergency
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:46.680]  and then let's go here to paragraph
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:49.680]  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:52.680]  9 10 11 12
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:58.680]  where was that
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:01.680]  it's further in now it's a paragraph 30
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:04.680]  or something it's on the third page
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:07.680]  just control F Mexico it'll bring it up for you
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:10.680]  this is absolutely amazing they previously reported
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:13.680]  north com has been established with a command center
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:16.680]  and press an air force base task with using the US military
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:19.680]  and continental domestic emergency situations they signed a deal
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:22.680]  last year to use Canadian and Mexican troops inside the US
[1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:25.680]  we need to pull that up
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:28.680]  they suddenly announced troops to patrol the streets of Canada
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:31.680]  two months ago to quote stop routiness same thing here in the US has been happening
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:34.680]  I mean this has all been set up now is this another big beta test
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:37.680]  where they gear up more and more and acclimate each time I don't know
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:40.680]  but when they start coming out and saying don't travel don't get on buses
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:43.680]  trains airplanes subways you know when they start
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:46.680]  coming out and we get internal documents from the states and we're really
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:49.680]  a level six people are on ventilators this is killing
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:52.680]  as many people as it is Mexicans this is this affects
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:55.680]  if you come in contact with it you get 40% of
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:58.680]  the people get it normally 10% to 15% you know
[1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:01.680]  saying oh this is we never seen this in our lifetimes oh my god the feds tell us it's
[1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:04.680]  really sick of the world
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:07.680]  man I'm really sick of the new world order aren't you
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:10.680]  here's another one press release put out by
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:13.680]  Adventist the big
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:16.680]  vaccine maker health infrastructure
[1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:19.680]  is and is eager to support Mexico's exemplary
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:22.680]  commitment to public health through
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:25.680]  influenza immunization and pandemic readiness
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:29.680]  and it says a
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:32.680]  local approach to global health
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:35.680]  at the CNN
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:38.680]  attacking us saying we're conspiracy theorist website
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:41.680]  pointing towards government involvement let's play Wayne
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:44.680]  Madsen it's coming up in an hour and 15 minutes let's play that
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:47.680]  russia today clip you know you guys
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:50.680]  have that right let's look you know
[1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:52.680]  we're going to roll the video on our side so prison
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:54.680]  planet dot tv viewers can see this as well
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:57.680]  here's Wayne Madsen with the formerly with the NSA
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:00.680]  reporting from Washington an investigative
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:03.680]  journalist from Washington Wayne Madsen
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:06.680]  says the outbreak of the virus is raising suspicion
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:09.680]  I spoke to two journalists one from
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:12.680]  Mexico City and the other one from Jakarta Indonesia
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:15.680]  and of course Indonesia had a problem not long ago
[1:45:15.680 --> 1:45:18.680]  with bird flu both these journalists have been in touch
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:21.680]  with the UN and World Health Organization officials including
[1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:24.680]  a scientist who's dealt with Ebola virus
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:27.680]  and HIV AIDS in Africa and it's their
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:30.680]  conclusion these scientists who they've spoken to
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:33.680]  that this is a very unusual form of
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:36.680]  flu because it looks like it is a product of some gene splicing
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:39.680]  the flu contains elements of bird flu
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:42.680]  two forms of human flu and
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:45.680]  and various forms of swine flu
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:48.680]  to them it doesn't look like this is naturally occurring
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:51.680]  the other thing is the target for this flu
[1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:54.680]  as opposed to other flues it's not the very young
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:57.680]  and the very old it's people between the ages of
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:00.680]  20 and 45 and the other thing is
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:03.680]  people are not contracting this from pigs
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:06.680]  the National Port Council here in America says pigs are not being affected
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:09.680]  this is human to human contact so people who
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:12.680]  either eat pork or are exposed to pigs are not
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:15.680]  getting this flu very unusual and
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:18.680]  of course the scientists are very alarmed by
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:21.680]  the way it's being spread and the speed at which it's being spread
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:29.680]  he was absolutely on target there I mean this thing
[1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:32.680]  is spreading quickly according to internal documents we have
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:35.680]  it has nothing to do with pigs it's got some pig genetics in it
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:38.680]  it's got double that in bird
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:41.680]  it's two fourths
[1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:45.680]  a bird one fourth pig
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:48.680]  one fourth human
[1:46:48.680 --> 1:46:51.680]  and Horowitz is saying and I've never seen him be wrong yet
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:54.680]  hope he's wrong it's got some kind of insect thing hanging off the end of it
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:57.680]  so it can spread even better so it can latch on to things for this RNA
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:00.680]  and get into their DNA in the animals you know I don't know
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:03.680]  this is just getting more and more out of control
[1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:06.680]  and then I've got this document and by the way is this up in the article
[1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:09.680]  now on prismplina.com
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:12.680]  I mean I want to post the document itself ask the guys
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:15.680]  if they were able to get that scanned and get it up on infowars.com
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:18.680]  let's just call Rob doing here
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:21.680]  I want to get this document up just like my act and everything else
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:24.680]  people are living in denial this is from
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:27.680]  a doctor where it broke out in south
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:30.680]  central Texas in the Braunfels
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.680]  and he's in here and he was at the meeting with the feds
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:36.680]  and they're saying the clinical attack rate may be
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:39.680]  40 to 50% when it's normally only 10 to 15%
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:42.680]  this is
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:45.680]  has Watson gotten this up yet
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:48.680]  they're having slight database issues on prism planet now
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:51.680]  working on it right now to try to get it up
[1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:54.680]  so prism planet is basically crippled now too
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:57.680]  I mean I can still get on the site but it's
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:00.680]  well let's go around that problem
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:03.680]  let's go immediately to truthnews.us
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:06.680]  it isn't a vacation for the web guys because the sites are down
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:09.680]  I need them to immediately go to the auxiliaries
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:12.680]  that's what we have jonesreport.com for
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:15.680]  this is serious crap going on thank you so much Rob
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:18.680]  I appreciate your hard work get them that
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:21.680]  get a clone of Watson's article with the point that they're saying it's level 6
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:24.680]  and let's get it up let's do it come on
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:27.680]  if we run into a problem two hours ago let's go around it
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:30.680]  let's think about ways to go around it
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:33.680]  I'm just this crap needs to go up right now
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.680]  raise your news right here
[1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:39.680]  truthnews.us jonesreport.com
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:42.680]  aren't being hacked go to those
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:45.680]  we gotta get ready to launch a news site if they take those down
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:48.680]  initiate that right now
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:51.680]  do whatever we have to to get the information out
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:54.680]  I'm not mad at my crew I'm just really getting irritated here ladies and gentlemen
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:57.680]  let's take calls
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  let's take calls but
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:03.680]  Tim go ahead you're on the air from Ohio go ahead
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:06.680]  hello Alex
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  I'm not going to review all of the great info that's already been discussed
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:12.680]  as far about origins and composition and where it's going but
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:15.680]  a couple of things that haven't been introduced into the conversation
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:18.680]  number one we still have our guns
[1:49:18.680 --> 1:49:21.680]  number two you said
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:24.680]  that you first reported this last Friday didn't you
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:27.680]  we've been talking about it since last week
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:30.680]  Michael said on Monday this was going to be yet and he had the intel
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:33.680]  they were going to do something the next couple weeks and
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:36.680]  Thursday April 23rd was the beginning of the big
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:39.680]  May ratings sweeps period for all the TV news stations
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:42.680]  and I think it's
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:45.680]  yeah and they're making money off the flu medicine and the vaccines
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:48.680]  and it's a distraction for the government they always do this crap concerted
[1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.680]  just like 9-11 I mean Sean Hannity
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:54.680]  started his show right before 9-11 I mean it's ridiculous his radio show
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:57.680]  was part of it I'm not saying he's part of it it's just they
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:00.680]  they know when to launch just like they knew the put options right
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:03.680]  that is American and United at record rates
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:06.680]  watch for the attack on the food supplies to just like they had to met
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:09.680]  I think they said already over in Egypt they're going to slaughter hundreds of thousands of pigs
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:12.680]  ridiculous has nothing
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:15.680]  I think I think this is just a drill though this
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:18.680]  maybe just to see how we react to it how many times
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:21.680]  have I said they would do bigger and bigger beta test
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:24.680]  hundreds dead, thousands dead, millions dead and then they're just
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:27.680]  after they trained us all to lock down and do what we're told
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:30.680]  oh the government's our friend and they're just going to hit you with a Zikronian 12
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:33.680]  it just kills everybody
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:36.680]  and all you foreign troops that are big whacked around our country

[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:49.680]  info wars
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:51.680]  we got threats here at the office
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:53.680]  a bunch of stuff went on yesterday
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:55.680]  phone calls
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.680]  emails faxes
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:01.680]  and
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:02.680]  an hour later
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:04.680]  the biggest sonata service attack
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:06.680]  the big internet company never seen
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:07.680]  we never seen
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:10.680]  not at our CDNs but over those at ports
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:12.680]  we moved the ports, they tried to find those
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:14.680]  every time they found them
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:15.680]  we put some of the graphs up
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:17.680]  they would slam right back in
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:19.680]  but it's not just that
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.680]  we've got CNN everybody else
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  Wall Street Journal talking about us
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:25.680]  so that's all hitting us
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:28.680]  jonesreport.com is basically down
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:30.680]  truthnews.com is down
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:32.680]  infowars.com is up and down
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:34.680]  prisonplanet.com
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:36.680]  soldiers on
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:38.680]  so prisonplanet.com is the site
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:40.680]  and it's having problems
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:44.680]  we may have to convert the Obama deception.net over
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:46.680]  I've got ArnoldExpose.com
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  those are on different servers
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:50.680]  the problem is that I talk about
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:52.680]  I mean the enemies are basically hitting them all
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:55.680]  and then people are also traveling to the sites
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:55:57.680]  so we will continue to try
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:55:59.680]  to keep things up and operate here
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:01.680]  then there's GCN live and it's servers
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:02.680]  and it's audio streams
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:04.680]  we're screaming out audio
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:06.680]  that's all staying up on the CDNs
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:08.680]  the guys don't like to attack our CDNs
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:10.680]  because those are thousands of servers

[2:01:41.040 --> 2:01:42.120]  For a couple deaths
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:48.120]  I mean what is going on here and then I've got this internal stuff out of Texas from with the health department
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:50.080]  Saying we're really at level six
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:55.640]  There's people on ventilators and half the people to come in contact with this get it and it's so incredibly deadly and oh my god
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:57.640]  We've never had something like this in our lifetime
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:05.400]  Let's take a call before Lindsay Williams gets on with us. Let's talk to Tim and Kansas and Kathy Mark Robert and others go ahead Tim

[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:15.880]  Hi, Alex
[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:16.760]  Hello
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:19.240]  Hi, um, I was just wondering if
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:26.840]  If everything goes down where you're talking, how would we be able to communicate with everybody there by phone?
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:34.320]  Like if everything went down or if everything gets down to go down it's every person for themselves
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:39.800]  structure my infrastructure is fully maxed my small infrastructure to
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:42.760]  Maximize attacking the New World Order
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:48.920]  And to expose them and we've not spent our time and resources building up except for backups to stay online
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:54.320]  But if it's catastrophic and a total implosion, we'll be out of contact. They can shut the web down anyways
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:57.080]  and
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:04.280]  They can shut us down individually that's already happening and so my books my videos my materials are out there in your hands
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:07.080]  You've got that. I mean, you know, you can see a tape
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:09.600]  I did 12 years ago and it's the same things happening now
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:14.080]  You can hear us predicting what happened watch a show five years ago where I'm predicting what now it's happening
[2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:18.760]  You know, people are discovering those old TV shows and videos and look watching them online or blown away
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:22.680]  And it's not because I'm smart. I have just found out the globalist handbook
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:26.760]  It's the other a lot of famous cases where a bank robber will leave his plan to rob a bank in the diner
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:31.760]  And they find it and then bust them, you know, I mean we just found their plan and they plan to
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.040]  Stage attacks till they get us in a police state grid and then launch the real attacks to exterminate the majority of us and
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:41.120]  You know that bankers plan to implode the economy by design to bring in tyranny
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:45.880]  All of this is going on. So I don't know what to say and do I don't know
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:51.560]  How to reach out to people to get them to realize this new order means business. I mean this stuff is real
[2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:56.840]  This stuff is not a joke or a game. This is for all the marbles and
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:03.200]  The same big banks that funded linen and Stalin and Hitler and Mao and Pol Pot
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:08.960]  On record are running things and mean to break the back of the world and bring in world government
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:12.440]  This is military conquests through economics and bio warfare and
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:15.520]  You know any way you slice it
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:19.920]  Whether this is a real bio attack. They've launched or a really weak virus
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:24.720]  They're just hyping it, you know endlessly a sigh of it's a sigh of either way you cut it
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:30.040]  It's designer all the evidence shows and Wayne Madsen's coming up in the next hour Lindsey Williams is straight ahead

[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:55.120]  And the internet numbers here are just off the charts, but that's not what's knocking our sights out

[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:55.400]  allowing no access. Squad cars every 100 yards around the perimeter. What is North Loop and Lamar? Let's dispatch somebody out there. I got to hire more people or something. I don't have the money to do it.
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:09:05.400]  A lot of stuff coming in. All right. Make a call. Do what? We got something new?
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:17.400]  You made a call. Go ahead. I made a call and I'm waiting to hear back. We also got a call from a DPS officer. He works for DPS. He was in some high level meetings.
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:31.400]  The governor is trying to safeguard 600,000 doses of the Tamiflu which is stored, which we talked about earlier in the show, which is being stored over I think at that location. I'm going to confirm that today.
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:37.400]  You have a buddy who works there so we already knew this. We knew this on Tuesday.
[2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:57.400]  They delivered it at 7 a.m. and two 18-wheelers. It's possible that there's been an infection in the county that has Brian in College Station in it as well. That DPS is going to be deployed to pharmacies to protect the valuable serum.
[2:09:57.400 --> 2:10:11.400]  There's a cabbage patch doll thing where they would hire toy companies around Christmas to stage PR events with a fake fight in front of cameras. I got to have the doll and then women would see that on TV and run out and actually fight over it.
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:25.400]  That's how they do these PR operations. They've been doing drills. Remember in Indiana when the Illinois came and said with the county official and I talked to them and confirmed it was a real interview?
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:35.400]  They had mass graves in your county. Then they also had drills where they would have the police practice guarding the mocked Tamiflu or drug or vaccines being brought in.
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:45.400]  Your buddy works at the facility. Here they come with two 18-wheelers. Tuesday morning, 7 a.m. with cops all guarding it like, meanwhile, I have the Army's own report.
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:54.400]  In fact, you gave that to me. I don't know if the guys got it up. Where they're saying it doesn't even protect people in their studies and actually makes it mutate. I think it's Microsoft.
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:56.400]  Go ahead.
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:11:04.400]  Yeah, that happened. Yeah, I gave you that report and then we've got, there's one other, there's so much stuff.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:10.400]  Well, Rob, you're doing a great job. You were up here until midnight last night. I really appreciate you and the whole crew. This is wild.
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:16.400]  We'll keep watching and I'm going to get a confirmation on the guards guarding that outside area.
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:25.400]  Well, let's just say, I mean, I haven't seen any police. I've been driving all over town the last three days. They're nowhere. I mean, they're not outright in tickets. Boy, they'll be back out to get their quota lit.
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:32.400]  Yeah, but this is ridiculous. All right. Thank you so much, Rob. Continue to analyze. Great job, Rob. Do the producer.
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:46.400]  Go into Lindsay Williams. Lindsay, you said, well, was it nine, 10 months ago now? I forget. And months before that privately that you had inside sources, you worked with some of the biggest oil companies up there as their chaplain for years.
[2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:56.400]  When they discovered larger oil deposits they have in Saudi Arabia. You wrote about that back in the 80s. Now it's been admitted to in the press that they have that all locked up.
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:05.400]  But then you got threatened to stop. Your video was number one on YouTube and Google for months, literally tens of millions of views exposing how there was plenty of fuel.
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:10.400]  And so they called you up and said, look, we're going to drop the price to bankrupt the Russians, the Arabs, everybody else in the Venezuelans.
[2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:21.400]  Since you said that it was at $150 a barrel, $149 a barrel, actually it won 50 one day. It's now dropped to 32 the low. It's been below 50 now for months and months.
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:32.400]  And it just continues on. And now George Soros goes at the economic forum on TV and says they're staging it to bankrupt Russia, Venezuela, and the Arabs, just like you said, seven, eight months before him.
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:44.400]  But I wanted to get you on about the flu. That stage of thing is this person also told you shut up and we're going to kill you about how we're doing this, but you're allowed to tell the slaves this and that you should get out of the United States.
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:57.400]  So Lindsay Williams, I appreciate you coming on and holding the last few minutes while I gave that update. If everything else isn't going to kill our economy, the vice president coming out and saying, don't get on airplanes or trains or subways,
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:09.400]  and the Mexican government saying close the government and close everything. A lot of Mexicans are ignoring it and we've only had a few deaths. This is wild, sir.
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  Alex, I've never had so much fun being right in all my life. Now, Alex, I want to say before we go any further, I want to say congratulations and tell you about the greatest thing you have ever accomplished.
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:35.400]  I received an email from Mike. I won't give his last name. He listened to your show. He wrote, I took your advice, got my spiritual house in order.
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:45.400]  He tells how he came to know Christ as his savior. He had listened to your show. He received my CD, was saved, got things right with the Lord.
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:57.400]  And Alex, when you get to heaven, you, Alex Jones, when you get to heaven, there will be a person there because of you. You are touching millions of lives.
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:09.400]  You're Obama deception. Alex, I've seen it from end to end. I have never seen anything like it. You know, for a number of months there, my DVDs were number one on YouTube.
[2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:18.400]  I am so glad now that I'm taking a backseat to you. That's right. Your Obama deception, I understand, is number one.
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:30.400]  And I will gladly take a backseat to you in a day in the world because you are doing such an amazing job and you are going to have any eternal value in what you're doing, Alex.
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:38.400]  Well, it is eternal. You know, the enemy doesn't care about money and even power. They want to control people's minds and their souls.
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:52.400]  And I never understood, as a child reading revelations about, they trafficked in the souls of men, but this new world order is obsessed with your mind and they want to bathe us in evil and train us that torture is good and they want to make us like them.
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:54.400]  They want our soul.
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:15:09.400]  Yes, you're exactly right. And it was you out of 28 that I had the privilege for the first time of appearing on your show and breaking the news of what I had been told by one of them, the elite, as to what their plans were.
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:24.400]  And I consider it such an honor and a privilege that God, by His grace, would allow Lindsay Williams, a little insignificant nobody, that puts on it for Jesus like every other man ever wanted, to have lived with the elite of the world for three years time and to stay in touch with some of them
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:31.400]  and know exactly what their plans are. And it's only because of this that I could appear on your show and say what was going to happen.
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:45.400]  I'm sitting back now, watching this unfold minute by minute, exactly like they said. I sit back utterly amazed every day when I turn on the news and hear crude oil, $50, crude oil, $45.
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:56.400]  Even the prognosticators on Wall Street are saying it's going up, it's going up, it's going up, and people come around and say, well, Lindsay, I guess it's about time for crude oil to go back up again.
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:05.400]  And I say, no, it's not. I was told it's going to stay this way for another nine to 12 months, exactly like George Soros said. You said it a moment ago, George Soros said it.
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:12.400]  This individual told me, who called me, he said it's going to stay down there, $50 a barrel.
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  George Soros said it eight months after you said it. He said it when it was $40 a barrel. You said it when it was $149.
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:28.400]  Well, I had a call from one of them. I mean, you can't get any closer than an 82-year-old man who's been in the elite for years and years and years.
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:35.400]  He knows exactly what's happening. Once you ever become a part of that order of the elite, you never get out of it.
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:44.400]  And please, believe everything that you have heard on Alex Jones' show. I beg of you out there in the listening audience, you've got to believe it.
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:51.400]  Even though it sounds phenomenal way out in the left field, it sounds like some wacko. I'm that way, too.
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:59.400]  But all I do is tell the truth. Alex tells the truth exactly like it is. And everything you've heard him saying over these years, you finally see him come to pass now.
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:08.400]  Listen to this one. The tax receipts. And see, this is what these people told me was going to happen, that America will see a financial collapse.
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:18.400]  And I'm sitting back here just watching it unfold. The tax receipts in the United States of America are down $54 billion in one month.
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:24.400]  And I was told this back in June that we were going to see this complete collapse.
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:38.400]  And the greatest drop in exports in 40 years plunged this month. And 40 years plunged 30% this January.
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:43.400]  Chrysler's declaring bankruptcy at the orders of Obama. Obama removed the head of GM because he wouldn't declare bankruptcy. They're getting ready for that.
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:51.400]  And nobody's even paying attention as we go into open depths of depression because they're busy worried about the flu.
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:18:02.400]  Yeah, Chrysler declared bankruptcy two hours ago. I heard it this morning. As soon as they happened, two hours ago Chrysler declared bankruptcy so that Obama could give him $8 billion from the Treasury.
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:05.400]  He couldn't do it until they declared bankruptcy.
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:12.400]  But he could give the bankers $12.8 trillion with no strings attached. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:21.400]  Yeah, and the Federal Reserve. When I first appeared on your show, I was talking about the fact that the Federal Reserve was going to begin to buy T-bills.
[2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:29.400]  Well, listen to this one. The Federal Reserve has purchased $70 billion in T-bills since they began about four weeks ago.
[2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:39.400]  Folks, I don't know how you can even comprehend that the Federal Reserve, which is not even the HSC of the federal government any more than Federal Express is,
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:45.400]  has purchased $70 billion in T-bills in order to keep the dollar afloat so it wouldn't crash until they get ready for a complaint.
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:55.400]  They're purchasing their own fiat currency. So we give them the bailout money. They loan it back to us at interest and begin purchasing government debt themselves.
[2:18:55.400 --> 2:19:01.400]  I mean, this is now complete law. This is like eating yourself. It'd be like if I stuck my foot in my mouth and started eating it.
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:04.400]  And I said, well, for dinner tonight, I'll have my thigh.
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:11.400]  You know, La La Land, there's no other way to describe it. These people are so out of touch with reality.
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:20.400]  On the other hand, they know exactly what they're doing. And if I could ever stress it, I've said it so many times in the past, this positively is not a conspiracy.
[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:32.400]  It is an agenda. I was told about it back in June of 2008. Alex allowed me to tell it on his show for the first time, the 28th of July of 2008.
[2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:36.400]  Everybody thought, well, what in the world is this guy saying it can't possibly happen?
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:42.400]  But I've been told by them, one of them, it would. And here now, we're seeing an unfolding of every bit.
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:45.400]  Now, here is where the big one dropped right now.
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:53.400]  Stay there. And I'm going to get your take on the flu because, I mean, the economies, notice we're rolling over like a dead whale with its belly up in the sun.
[2:19:53.400 --> 2:20:00.400]  And birds are landing and pecking and having a meal right as the flu hits. I mean, come on.
[2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:07.400]  You worry, if you don't, you don't understand the situation. Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[2:20:07.400 --> 2:20:14.400]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve. Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[2:20:14.400 --> 2:20:17.400]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:19.400]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:22.400]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[2:20:22.400 --> 2:20:26.400]  The DVD gives you a three hour overview of her world directly from her.
[2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:30.400]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:34.400]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[2:20:34.400 --> 2:20:40.400]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:45.400]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal. She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:52.400]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE. Start now. Knowledge is power.
[2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:56.400]  Better take action. I think a storm's coming.
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:07.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:14.400]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:21.400]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:25.400]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:37.400]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:40.400]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:47.400]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:59.400]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:04.400]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:10.400]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:16.400]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:30.400]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:36.400]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:42.400]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:36.400]  In their fear mongering over some flu, we've got a world government run by a bunch of bankers, and right up the street you've got a buddy that works there a week reported here at first. They were hoarding camouflage at this facility.
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:47.400]  Now you're telling us that they've got state police, a bunch of cars there. We've got an email from a state police person and you just called your buddy that works at the facility. Tell us what we know and then we'll go back to Lindsey Williams.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:56.400]  A big recap of the top news that we're really at level six. The government claims more people are dying than what the media is saying. I have that from internal government documents.
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:08.400]  Then we're being hack attacked. All the sites are being totally attacked, confirmed. Infowars.com, PrismPontet.com, JonesReport.com, FruitNews.us, Lindsey Williams online with his take on all this.
[2:25:08.400 --> 2:25:15.400]  I'm going to get his take on the flu in a moment. And then the big issue is about to bring up in a short segment. But Rob Do, my producer, you just confirmed with your friend.
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:21.400]  Yes. And what is going on with them guarding it? I guess they think we're going to be like day of the dead.
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:23.400]  Get me the Tamiflu.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:25.400]  Tamiflu.
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:50.400]  This is at 1100 West 49th Street. It's the state lab laboratory and then behind it is a pharmacy warehouse. And that is what is under lock and key right now. All entrances into there are being blocked off by state troopers. And that goes, it covers from 49th Street if you go back all the way to 52nd, which does turn into North Loop, which co-operates the email that we received.
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:52.400]  And they're over there guarding it from the evil Americans.
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:26:06.400]  That's right. I mean, what would it take to have Americans rioting for the drugs when they admit the Japanese government admits it's got some weird hallucinogenic, makes people have all sorts of psychotic breaks. It's on the drug insert. It doesn't even really help you.
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:07.400]  Yeah.
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:08.400]  I mean, what is going on?
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:19.400]  I mean, it's showboating. My buddy heard as he was walking through the hall somebody saying, well, it's an election year, so it's a photo op time. So, you know, it's time for politicians to get out and go, we're going to save you, you know.
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:21.400]  So even the cops know what's going on.
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:22.400]  Pretty much, yes.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:25.400]  This is disgusting criminals. All right. Thank you so much, Rob.
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  All right.
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:34.400]  Oh, quick update on some on the level six thing I heard. I just got an email and I'm going to confirm it that CNN said we're going to go to level six officially in two days.
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:37.400]  So that pretty much goes with what we've been saying.
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:40.400]  Which is exactly what the document says. So that would confirm all the other stuff. Thank you.
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:41.400]  All right.
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:56.400]  I'm going to interrupt you, Lindsay Williams, but this is happening because the same document that's 30, about 38 hours old that we've had since yesterday. And this is confirmed from the source in administration in the school district here from the state meeting with the feds.
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:01.400]  They're saying this is killing a lot more people than what they're saying. I hope that's not true.
[2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:07.400]  But if the feds are secretly hyping something, and it turns out to be a lie, they need to get in trouble. Lindsay Williams.
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:20.400]  Well, let me get on the subject of this line flu. This is one of my pet peeves. There was a doctor in Mexico City who had the vaccination. He died with the flu. You see, it's not doing any good.
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:26.400]  I was hoping I didn't have to say this, but you brought the subject up. And I know this is number one issue right now.
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:39.400]  Califluid, I do an ounce of good. Califluid was made for another type of strain altogether, has nothing to do, will not have any effect whatsoever on the swine flu. It is a placebo.
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:46.400]  The people are taking this thinking that it's going to help them and that they're going to be okay. And it is not even prepared for the swine flu.
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:28:01.400]  Vaccination will not do you any good. They do not and have had, have not had time to prepare a vaccination for the swine flu. And there is positively nothing that Homeland Security can do for it.
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:09.400]  And I like to call this Obama flu. He won't close the borders. He won't protect the American people. Mexico is closing down everything.
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:19.400]  And our president hasn't got enough to close down our borders. I like to call it the Obama flu, really, because he's perpetrating this thing.
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:29.400]  Knowing good and well that the Tamil flu vaccine is not going to do anything but make some government officials who were in the business, millions of dollars while the American people sit back and die.
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:31.400]  You've got to get it. Please.
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:44.400]  Yeah, the Tamil flu drug has been proven to, I mean, pull it up, pull up the insert for the Tamil flu drug and then the vaccine. They're already claiming they've got a vaccine when they said it took six to eight weeks to make it.
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:52.400]  How could they just instantly have the vaccine, Lindsay, and the experts are saying that we've listed here that it looks like it's genetically engineered.
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:29:05.400]  Yeah, there's no way in the world they can have a vaccine for this because it's something completely different. It's a whole different strain. And the Tamil flu, no single vaccine anywhere right now will handle this wine flu.
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:16.400]  They know that they're totally helpless because they want it to happen exactly the way they've got it. Now, please, I beg of you, I prepared a one hour presentation on vaccinations.
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:25.400]  I beg of you, I'll give you my 800 number later on a one hour presentation on vaccinations. I am so disturbed with what's happening here this week.
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  I know I've written two books on alternative health. My main thing is crude oil and I know from what the gentleman told me back in the middle of June what's going to happen to the finances and the crude oil and the banking and all the rest of this.
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:51.400]  All right, Lindsay, stay there. We'll come back, take phone calls, talk about that. What do you see happening next in the economy in hindsight of that hour long conversation with the former head of major oil company?
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:30:01.400]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:09.400]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more.
[2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:15.400]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:26.400]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.
[2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:37.400]  Now compare cow bin, pure soap, all natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:07.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:31:07.400 --> 2:31:13.400]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[2:31:13.400 --> 2:31:19.400]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:24.400]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:37.400]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:40.400]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:52.400]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com

[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:06.400]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[2:32:06.400 --> 2:32:16.400]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health. If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit shentrition.com.

[2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:26.400]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing, but they got a hole in me.
[2:33:26.400 --> 2:33:34.400]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing, so they got a hole in me.
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:46.400]  I opened doors for little old ladies, I held the blind to see. I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:49.400]  They can't be seen.
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:34:00.400]  With me, and I'm getting real shot down, and I'm feeling me. No more, Mr. Night Sky.
[2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:06.400]  We are back live. It's got to be. No more, Mr. Night Sky.
[2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:11.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is coming down on us.
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:17.400]  We need to start being aggressive about our liberties and our freedoms, and not putting up with their tyranny.
[2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:22.400]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.

[2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:49.400]  Also, we're being hacked on all sides. They're trying to shut us down with a concerted effort.
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:53.400]  We built our architecture to have a lot of fleet ships.
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:57.400]  You could use the parable or the parallel out there.
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:00.400]  They're trying to attack them all. They got a lot of targets to hit.
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:03.400]  We'll just launch more ships. That's how we do it around here.
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:07.400]  We have a rule. When we get attacked, we launch another ship. We're going to launch a big one.
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:11.400]  This is the biggest attack ever. We're going to launch a dreadnought in the info war.
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:17.400]  This dreadnought will be text only so that it will be an aggregator of all the sites.
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:24.400]  The SS tyranny crusher. The USS tyranny crusher.
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:34.400]  Now, I got a lot of really serious news here. It's so incredible having trouble even covering it.
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:39.400]  I'm going to recap that in a moment, but Lindsay Williams, I want to go to Robert, Mark, Kathy, Mary,
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  Pastor James and others that are patiently holding from all around the country with their comments about the flu.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:49.400]  But dealing with the economy, the government knows when they have Biden come out and say,
[2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:56.400]  don't get on planes, don't get on trains or subways, that this is going to cause the economy in confidence to be lost.
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:01.400]  They know what, so they'll say, everything's over. We're all in trouble, but we'll protect you. Everything's fine.
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:07.400]  They scare you and then play the part of protector. You can see the psychology.
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:11.400]  Clearly, they want to destroy the economy. That's what they said to you about the oil.
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:18.400]  It's meant to destroy all the economies. When did he tell you that they were going to stop the destruction?
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:23.400]  I guess when we're all just begging and licking the boots of the stormtroopers.
[2:36:23.400 --> 2:36:29.400]  Do we have to worship world government? What does it take for them to stop the raping?
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  His remark word for word was, chaplain, America will see a financial collapse that will be so great,
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:40.400]  and here's your time frame right here. He said it will take years for us to come out of it.
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:47.400]  Now, since you have so many new listeners, Alex, let me just very quickly say, back in June, the middle of June of 2008,
[2:36:47.400 --> 2:36:54.400]  I had a phone call from one of these elite that I lived with for three years time on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:59.400]  When I was a chaplain on that pipeline, had executive status, sat in that board meetings for three years time,
[2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:03.400]  my life was completely changed when I lived with the elite.
[2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:11.400]  I am so thankful that by the providence of God, he allowed me to have the privilege of doing what very few people on the face of the earth have ever had,
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.400]  and that is literally living with the elite for three years time.
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:19.400]  And this gentleman told me back in the middle of June, he said, all of these things are going to happen.
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:25.400]  Now, let me recap how they're fulfilling right now, and then I'm going to give you what can you expect.
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:31.400]  I'm going to give it to you right down the line, each of the steps, in light of what that man told me is what you can expect from this point on.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:39.400]  Okay, right now, number one, Dow Jones, I mean Dow Chemicals profits with down 97% in the first quarter.
[2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:42.400]  All of this is a part of that total structure breakdown.
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:56.400]  I am quite sure that this swine flu thing is likewise just one more part and step to fit into the total potential of bringing the financial system to a total breakdown and halt.
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:03.400]  Again, Starbucks, many of you drink their coffee, profits dropped 77% in the first quarter of this year.
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  They're closing 900 stores and 6,000...
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:10.400]  The economy's contracting at over 6% a quarter.
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:11.400]  Yeah.
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:13.400]  I mean, this is an implosion level.
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:15.400]  This is just absolute...
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:19.400]  If it continues, it took two years to get deep into the depression.
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:23.400]  If we continue, this will be worse in another year than they had in the depression.
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:29.400]  I mean, that's the real crisis that we know is coming down on us right now.
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:31.400]  That is the issue.
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:41.400]  But nobody's, again, worried about all the laws and treaties and world government being set up right now because they're busy wringing their hands over the flu as the government terrorizes everybody.
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:42.400]  Go ahead.
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:50.400]  Now, if you work for a city, a city government, or you work for the state, any state in America, tax receipts, it better scare you to death.
[2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:57.400]  Tax receipts are down $54 billion in one month, and it takes about three months for these to show up.
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:38:59.400]  You wait until 30 to 60 days from now.
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:00.400]  You've never seen the light.
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:06.400]  Every time you say that I have these fools email me going, Lindsey, they have a set tax on the gas.
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:07.400]  It's not going down.
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:11.400]  And then they admit all the tax revenues on gas are down, federal, state.
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:18.400]  They admit that the revenues on property values, on tax receipts, state, sales tax...
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:23.400]  It's all over the news every day that tax receipts are plunging, and they just say you're lying, Lindsey.
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:24.400]  It isn't true.
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:27.400]  Well, again, Alex, I've never had so much trouble being...
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:32.400]  I've never had so much fun being right in all my life, but I'm not right.
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:39.400]  It's the fact that the person told me this, who is one of them back in the middle of June, and I'm early Boston, and I'm sitting here watching it happen.
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:43.400]  Now, the greatest drop in exports in the United States of America.
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:48.400]  That means how much we're shipping to other countries and other parts of the world.
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:54.400]  In 40 years, the greatest drop in 40 years have plunged 30% since January 1 of this year.
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:40:01.400]  272 major metropolitan areas reported unemployment soaring.
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:07.400]  Real estate in the Phoenix, Arizona area is down 50% since the height of the boom.
[2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:13.400]  Whirlpool Corporation, one of the big ones of America, profits down 28% this quarter.
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:21.400]  CNN News just reported that 253 police officers were laid off in New York State.
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:22.400]  Why?
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:23.400]  They don't have the money to pay them.
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:25.400]  This is an open door for criminals.
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  Yeah, they're now announcing it's connectivity in other areas.
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:30.400]  The Army will now be their police.
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:31.400]  You can't make this up.
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:34.400]  In fact, Google Marshall Law is connectivity.
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  And the mayor is going, yeah, we're going to have troops here now because we're not going to have any.
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:42.400]  I mean, it's cuckoo land and it's all designed.
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  The globalists will wreck whole nations to get power.
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:45.400]  They've done it.
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:51.400]  They'll kill a million, 300,000 Iraqis, folks, so they can have a black hole for no-bid weapons contracts and oil.
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:53.400]  They'll do it to us.
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:54.400]  That's the thing.
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:57.400]  The New World Order is cold-blooded.
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:40:59.400]  Let's take a few calls, Lindsey.
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:00.400]  Let's talk to Robert in California.
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:01.400]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:03.400]  Go ahead, Robert.
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:04.400]  Good day, gentlemen.
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:09.400]  I sent it to Rob doing Aaron as well on a couple other agencies.
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:16.400]  We got a proclamation out here in Los Angeles County that our Los Angeles County is under emergency.
[2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:17.400]  Let me see.
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:20.400]  It's further that the copy was propped before the state.
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:21.400]  Okay.
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:24.400]  Now for this, we're proclaimed and ordered by Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:27.400]  that a local emergency exists throughout Los Angeles County
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:33.400]  and shall be deemed to continue to exist until extermination is proclaimed by this board.
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:38.400]  And also, I don't know if you guys watched too much television,
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:42.400]  but last Tuesday as well on the 28th,
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:49.400]  Law and Order had a television show where this lady was brought up on charges
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.400]  for not vaccinating her son that killed another child with the measles.
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:55.400]  Yeah, notice how that's perfectly timed.
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:41:59.400]  I have literally been sent YouTube clips of scores and scores of TV shows.
[2:41:59.400 --> 2:42:03.400]  My wife sees them where if you don't take the vaccine, you're a murderer.
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:06.400]  And they never point out, wait a minute, this other kid's been vaccinated.
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:09.400]  How did you give it to him if he was vaccinated?
[2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:11.400]  And they're getting everybody ready for forced inoculation.
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:14.400]  Time, Newsweek are saying we need to do it.
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  They're setting the precedent with this because they tried to, in fact,
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.400]  did you get the swine flu fear mongering YouTube video that I asked for earlier?
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  Do you guys have that?
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:24.400]  Let's play that right now.
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:25.400]  I appreciate your call.
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  Mark and Oregon.
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:30.400]  I mean, Robert in California, then Mark and Oregon in a moment.
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:32.400]  This is the type of fear mongering.
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:34.400]  This is the audio for radio from prison.
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:35.400]  They're watching it right now.
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:36.400]  Prison.TV members.
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:38.400]  This, but see people wouldn't do it.
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:40.400]  So then they said, okay, it's a regulation.
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  You got to take it.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:43.400]  And then they said, oh, it's a law, but it's not really a law.
[2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:44.400]  And they go, we'll arrest you.
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:45.400]  We'll arrest you.
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:46.400]  But there's no law.
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:48.400]  Then they run TV shows where you get arrested.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:52.400]  If you don't selling everybody that it's a foregone conclusion, it's the law
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:56.400]  showing you the media corporate whore liars for the hardcore crooks.
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:42:57.400]  They are.
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:42:59.400]  And if you just wake up with their illusion, it'll all stop.
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:00.400]  But they know you're waking up.
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:02.400]  So they're going to stage these events.
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:04.400]  Go ahead and play that clip.
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.400]  This is the fear mongering from YouTube of the swine flu.
[2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:12.400]  After they stage that release, then tried to forcibly inject people.
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:13.400]  A bunch of people died.
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:15.400]  So they had to suspend it.
[2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:16.400]  Now they're trying again.
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:17.400]  Here we go.
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:19.400]  I don't need another flu shot.
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:21.400]  I had a flu shot last year.
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:23.400]  A swine flu epidemic may be coming.
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  A swine flu shot?
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:26.400]  Well, I don't know.
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:27.400]  I've been thinking about it.
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:30.400]  It could make you very sick.
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:31.400]  A swine flu.
[2:43:31.400 --> 2:43:34.400]  Man, I'm too glad today to catch me.
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:36.400]  You'll want to be protected.
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:39.400]  I'm the healthiest 55-year-old you've ever seen.
[2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:41.400]  Hey, I play golf every weekend.
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:43.400]  Get a shot of protection.
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  The swine flu shot.
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:51.400]  Joe brought it home from the office.
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:55.400]  He gave it to Betty and one of his kids.
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:57.400]  And to Betty's mother.
[2:43:57.400 --> 2:44:00.400]  But Betty's mother went back to California the next day.
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:04.400]  On her way to the airport, she gave it to a cab driver,
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:08.400]  a ticket agent, and one of the charming stewardesses.
[2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:12.400]  At school, Joe's kid gave it to some other kids.
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:16.400]  And Mrs. Merrill got it and gave it to her husband.
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:20.400]  In California, Betty's mother gave it to her best friend, Dottie.
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:23.400]  But Dottie had a heart condition and she died.
[2:44:23.400 --> 2:44:27.400]  But before she died, Dottie gave it to her girlfriend,
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:30.400]  the male man, the keeper boy,
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:35.400]  and the vet when she went to pick up her child.
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:39.400]  If a swine flu epidemic comes, this is how it could spread.
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:41.400]  You'll want to be protected,
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:43.400]  especially if you're elderly or chronically ill.
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:45.400]  Get a shot of protection.
[2:44:45.400 --> 2:44:48.400]  The swine flu shot.
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:50.400]  So there's the propaganda.
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:52.400]  So the government can try to make you take something
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:54.400]  that's a made-up vaccine every year
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:56.400]  that never matches the supposed flu.
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:44:58.400]  And they're often injecting people in Mexico with a
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:01.400]  just separate flu shot.
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:02.400]  Has nothing to do with it.
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:04.400]  Doctors admit it'll actually make you sicker
[2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  to have something else to weigh down your immune system.
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:07.400]  They just don't care.
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:09.400]  They go, you will take it.
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:11.400]  Swat team, stand by.
[2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:13.400]  We have the weapons.
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:14.400]  We're the government.
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:15.400]  We just run all these tests,
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:17.400]  killing foster children with tests
[2:45:17.400 --> 2:45:19.400]  and biologicals before and radiating them.
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:21.400]  Trust us, we're only murdering eugenicists
[2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:23.400]  who love the New World Order.
[2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:25.400]  And somebody will take that clip
[2:45:25.400 --> 2:45:27.400]  for like a white zombie or something,
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:29.400]  you know, music, because they always use
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:31.400]  like weird, scary, creepy stuff in the intro,
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  like, and Betty didn't survive,
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:36.400]  and then she gave it to Billy,
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:38.400]  and then she didn't make it.
[2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:40.400]  She's dead.
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  I mean, just so sick, these demonic freaks.
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:45.400]  Lindsey Williams, I mean, the fear-mongering
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:47.400]  is just out of control.
[2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:48.400]  Yeah, positively.
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:50.400]  The swine flu shot, there is no such creature.
[2:45:50.400 --> 2:45:51.400]  It doesn't exist.
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:54.400]  They haven't had time to produce anything
[2:45:54.400 --> 2:45:56.400]  for this new strain.
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:45:58.400]  And when they say that they're going to use
[2:45:58.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  the towel flu shot,
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:02.400]  well, that was for something that existed a year or two ago.
[2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  It's a total misnomer.
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:07.400]  MMR, DPT, all these shots they give to the children.
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:09.400]  All it does is weakens the immune system,
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:11.400]  so later in life, they can't overcome
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:13.400]  what comes their way.
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:15.400]  Vaccinations, oh my goodness, I beg of you.
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:17.400]  Well, let me give it to you, please.
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:19.400]  Just one time or so here.
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:21.400]  My 800 number.
[2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:23.400]  I have an 8-cent DVD.
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:25.400]  One of them, DVDs and CDs,
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:27.400]  one of them is on vaccinations.
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:29.400]  You've got to hear about this.
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:31.400]  I give it in a one hour.
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:32.400]  You watch it on your television,
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  what's happening in relation to vaccinations.
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:36.400]  You'll tell you what to expect
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:38.400]  about all this swine flu thing,
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  and all this happening financially.
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:42.400]  And this week, this week,
[2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:44.400]  I prepared a new presentation.
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:46.400]  You've never gotten it before.
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  I beg of you, I'm trying to do this up to date this week.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:53.400]  Please call 800-321-2900.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  You can get my 8-DVD CD set
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:57.400]  or my 4-DVD CD set.
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:46:59.400]  I beg of you, get the one on vaccinations,
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:03.400]  800-321-2900.
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:05.400]  Now, let me tell you what's happening next.
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:07.400]  Alex, I'll break it down to the best
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:09.400]  that I can see it in relation to
[2:47:09.400 --> 2:47:11.400]  what the man told me back in the middle of June.
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  You can expect the following.
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:16.400]  First of all, the very next shoe that's going to be,
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:18.400]  you're going to have to put on,
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:20.400]  is the commercial real estate bubble.
[2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:22.400]  It will burst.
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:25.400]  General growth profit is ink just a few days ago.
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:27.400]  Biggest real estate failure
[2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:29.400]  in the history of the United States of America.
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:31.400]  Can you hear me say?
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:33.400]  The history of the United States of America,
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:35.400]  the biggest real estate bubble,
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:37.400]  you thought the housing was big.
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:39.400]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:41.400]  Secondly, you can expect insurance companies
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:43.400]  to begin failing.
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:45.400]  Travelers' insurance posted a 32% loss
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:47.400]  in the first quarter of this year.
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:49.400]  Hospitalization insurance?
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:51.400]  How about your life insurance you've been paying
[2:47:51.400 --> 2:47:53.400]  on all of your life?
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:55.400]  How about all of these other insurance policies you've got?
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:57.400]  Do you know what they're going to be worth
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:47:59.400]  in just a short period of time?
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:01.400]  They're not insured.
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:03.400]  Annuities aren't insured either.
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:05.400]  Go ahead.
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:07.400]  Pay out your FDIC bank accounts
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:09.400]  with inflated fiat money.
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:11.400]  Well, sure, there's no way in the world.
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:13.400]  Well, anyway,
[2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:15.400]  I've talked about that before.
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:17.400]  The dollar positively
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:19.400]  will collapse.
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:21.400]  It is inevitable.
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:23.400]  For a while there, I thought,
[2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:25.400]  well, maybe you're wrong, Lindsey.
[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:27.400]  No, not anymore.
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:29.400]  The dollar positively will collapse.
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:31.400]  The loss of tax base
[2:48:31.400 --> 2:48:33.400]  is going to paralyze
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:35.400]  the states and the cities.
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:37.400]  Do you notice what I said there a few moments ago?
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:39.400]  You've had billions of dollars
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:41.400]  of tax loss, revenues,
[2:48:41.400 --> 2:48:43.400]  54 billion
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:45.400]  in one month's time.
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:47.400]  If you work for the school,
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:49.400]  the government, employee,
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:51.400]  highway department, infrastructure of America,
[2:48:51.400 --> 2:48:53.400]  everybody, this depends on taxes.
[2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:55.400]  And the tax loss now is so great
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:48:57.400]  because of the corporate profits being down
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:48:59.400]  and being lost at the gas pump.
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:01.400]  Folks, if you work for a state,
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:04.060]  you got to take this as your productive
[2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:05.400]  preparation immediately
[2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:07.400]  because that's going to be major cuts.
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:09.400]  The interest
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:11.400]  on the national debt will not be paid.
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:13.400]  This is the next thing you're going to see
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:15.400]  because the Federal Reserve now
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:17.400]  is buying the T-bills
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:19.400]  so the interest can only go on this way
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:21.400]  for a short period of time until the world
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:23.400]  gets the message
[2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:25.400]  that they're going to have to cash in
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:27.400]  the T-bills that hold
[2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:29.400]  their reserved currency
[2:49:29.400 --> 2:49:33.360]  paid and you will see a collapse of the american dollar overnight but let's see
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:37.560]  we're safe because obama cares about us
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:41.120]  i mean he's got a nice suit and reads off a teleprompter man are you
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:45.080]  you know come on you're not racist are you i mean i mean uh...
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:47.640]  have you noticed how they inject that in everything all your protest in the
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:49.280]  foreign banks of the and the
[2:49:49.280 --> 2:49:51.400]  and the twelve point eight trillion to him
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:54.480]  and the national lucid cuz you don't like black people they said about all
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:55.720]  the tea party people

[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:22.880]  protein nitrates or saline solutions because our colloidal silver is made up
[2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:27.080]  of nano sized particles it can be better utilized at the cellular level

[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:01.320]  i believe bastard williams has i believe i have
[2:55:01.320 --> 2:55:04.120]  i believe all of god's children have run their races
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:07.080]  have lived their lives well and we're getting to the point now
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:12.120]  where and all probability we're basically at the end of our physical life here
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:16.600]  and i face that and i think it's important for all of us to face that
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:21.080]  but at the same time to keep our eyes on our eternal future
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:25.160]  as it's promised us and the word of god and it's written in our hearts we know it
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:29.640]  that we're going to be an eternity and it's going to be never-ending bliss
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:34.760]  and we're living in the opposite of that at this time but this time is going to be very
[2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:39.720]  short and especially for us because especially in this country and really throughout the whole
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:44.840]  world but first here there's going to be mass death and we're right on top of it alex this is
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:50.520]  not a beta test this is actually a beta test if you'd want to call it that this co-joined
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:53.560]  to the main move and that's what steve quail has said
[2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:59.640]  i think in your heart of hearts you realize that and i think it's time to classify this as that
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:05.080]  without a doubt that that is where we are and to move accordingly for our own physical
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:12.040]  self-preservation if i was in your tremendous shoes being who i am what i would do and i'm not
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:16.200]  saying it's what you should do alex if my heart just tells me that anyone should do it including
[2:56:16.200 --> 2:56:22.680]  you i would get on an airplane with your family and i would leave this country because you have
[2:56:22.680 --> 2:56:27.560]  been the captain who's tried to save the titanic here we've all been on the on the ship with you
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:33.240]  alex as true seekers and info warriors but there comes a time when you have to realize
[2:56:33.240 --> 2:56:39.640]  where things are and where they are just dictates to save your innocent family that you put them
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:43.720]  in a place of safety and i think you deserve to go with them i don't believe you deserve to go down
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:49.080]  with the ship and i'd like to get past the williams depending on what i just said and god bless you
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:53.640]  but let me just say this okay well i need to hold williams over and then get the next guest on the
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:57:00.120]  day after let me just say this staying in the middle of it to be speaking out if that is coming
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:05.320]  and i hope that's not the case we will wake up more people people will see the truth and it
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:10.360]  literally is their minds their souls that are important to save and that's the real treasure
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:18.360]  that's what the enemy's really after and so uh this is a worldwide system and um
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:24.680]  well i mean pastor williams that was pretty intense what he was saying any comments on it
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:31.880]  alex when you get to heaven when alex jones gets to heaven i know of one man who's gonna be there

[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:59.320]  in the u.s. navy let me ask you a selfish question first wane madson we've had little
[3:13:59.880 --> 3:14:03.800]  kid hacker attacks years ago when i didn't have good servers where they put a naked girl on a
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:09.240]  motorcycle on there and say ha screw you you know real grassroots hacker stuff but we built systems
[3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:14.520]  up got more professional have big cds you know hidden servers they went over those into the
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:20.840]  ports we change ip addresses they jump ports then they would attack whole company systems and and
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:27.160]  have so much bandwidth they were blasting entire you know giant facilities in chicago and la they're
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:32.680]  hitting about seven different sites all sorts of stuff threatening phone calls coming in before
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:37.000]  they did it saying they were going to do it and uh what does this sound like to you ain't
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:42.120]  madson what am i saying i don't know what it is i'm saying that's so horrible well we we know right
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:48.360]  now alex that the others that they're creating a new cyber command uh in the pentagon uh the
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:53.960]  current nsa director general keith alexander supposed to be the uh head of that command and
[3:14:53.960 --> 3:15:00.120]  what you're talking about is more in the area of offensive information warfare this is the most
[3:15:00.120 --> 3:15:08.200]  classified part of this whole cyber security uh uh program that's being developed and the issue is
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:15.160]  is that too much power to leave into the hands of an agency like nsa or the cia or in fact the
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:21.400]  pentagon uh what the offensive information warfare entail is it just is it more than just
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:27.960]  buy out the logic warfare operations or does it get into actually uh uh creating these um
[3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:33.640]  embargoes for information uh by using these technical attack mechanisms as you're suggesting
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:39.000]  with coming into ports and uh and uh doing all this other than the fact that what we used to
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:46.360]  see hackers do what was that you know throw up a picture uh you know some scantily clad of
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:51.480]  woman or or something like that on a uh legitimate website it's getting much more
[3:15:51.480 --> 3:15:56.440]  serious than that i'm afraid well i mean they as you know five weeks ago the head guy that obama
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:16:01.880]  had appointed said look this is a takeover of our republic they want control of all the infrastructure
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:05.800]  j rockefeller comes out and says yeah we'd be better off without the web they want to just
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:12.360]  like the nsa moved into telecoms they want an even midsize uh ip companies uh computer companies
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:16.760]  and this is your specialty so you can speak to it you're at the nsa put these grids in there to
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:22.040]  quote shut the web down as a quote to protect it and then we're talking to the big it companies
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:26.440]  are saying yes this is the biggest attack ever you know this is you know this this is government
[3:16:26.440 --> 3:16:33.080]  this is not this is not uh hot pocket eating hackers uh you know having fun the hackers love us
[3:16:33.080 --> 3:16:37.640]  and they they like to work we do their anti-establishment what do you think it is we did it made
[3:16:37.640 --> 3:16:44.040]  them so unhappy well what it is is your uh everyone's offering alternative sources of
[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:52.680]  information uh breaking the monopoly of these mega uh entertainment infotainment uh corporations uh
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:16:58.520]  which control about ninety nine percent of uh where you get your news and other information
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:05.000]  from uh on a daily basis they do not like the internet because there's too many people out
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:11.480]  there offering up i'm not talking about all bloggers but the the media blogs are offering
[3:17:11.480 --> 3:17:17.640]  up alternative sources of information and it's the causing problems for the uh for the oligarchs
[3:17:17.640 --> 3:17:23.000]  who always thought that just by picking up a telephone and talking to a newspaper publisher
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:28.680]  or a bureau chief uh they could kill stories they don't have that capability any longer they don't
[3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:33.720]  like this they don't like this new media now this is obviously bipartisan i mean whatever
[3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:39.800]  whatever bush did it seems is expanding under obama um and i know you know about the j rocker
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:44.680]  feller stuff where do you see this cyber command going and openly saying the pentagon and in us
[3:17:44.680 --> 3:17:50.200]  say you're gonna run domestic networks and spy without warrants and he's protecting bush on that
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:54.360]  and protecting bush on torture but we're not discussing that in the news because it's all
[3:17:54.360 --> 3:18:00.760]  the flu the flu right well we saw we saw this one during the clinton administration when we
[3:18:00.760 --> 3:18:06.920]  fought strenuously fought against the clinton administration's attempt to uh have anyone
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:13.880]  who wanted to use uh encryption to cover their communications you would have to possess a government
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:17.720]  key where the government could go in and say give us a key so we can break the encryption
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:23.400]  we fought those battles under clinton uh then of course bush came in and it seemed like those
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:29.800]  battles were just with you know what bush pulled off were just almost a moot issue but now we see
[3:18:30.600 --> 3:18:34.920]  with this administration some of those same players involved with the clinton administration
[3:18:34.920 --> 3:18:40.120]  and pushing the sort of surveillance technical surveillance capability have come back they're
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:44.120]  back in these federal agencies and they're pushing that same agenda of surveillance
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:49.400]  they're they're going for broke you think they'll be successful quote taking over the
[3:18:49.400 --> 3:18:53.720]  infrastructure of the internet i don't think so because the internet one thing we know about
[3:18:53.720 --> 3:18:58.520]  the internet it's dynamic it was actually engineered uh uh created by the department of
[3:18:58.520 --> 3:19:03.880]  defense to withstand a nuclear attack that's the architecture of the internet and i don't think
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:10.120]  anything that they uh the government can throw up will be able to actually stop uh uh this and
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:15.400]  they also don't they're not bargaining on something else there's a lot of a lot of high tech money in
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:21.400]  the bay area especially uh these are these a lot of these people are very libertarian and if they do
[3:19:21.400 --> 3:19:25.960]  try to control the internet uh i know what's going to come down the pike there's going to be internet
[3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:30.760]  to uh this is the one that the government doesn't have any control over and i think that that's
[3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:36.040]  just what we'll see we'll see so many come up with uh uh former communications that the government
[3:19:36.040 --> 3:19:42.040]  can't keep it you know can't get its hands around so you're talking about a technocrat rebellion
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:46.920]  uh and you'll have all these old globalist dinosaurs you know sitting there 90 years old

[3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:33.640]  and the doctors and scientists for all just i'm not gonna say this is clearly engineered
[3:24:33.640 --> 3:24:37.320]  it came out of the wrong hemisphere wrong time of year usually you see these things develop and
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:42.760]  mutate you'd see it's it's history it's pedigree of mutations this is just out of the blue you
[3:24:42.760 --> 3:24:48.520]  only see vaccine companies busy making things just like this and bragging about it in the last five
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:54.360]  years and then magically having vaccines that are already ready that's pretty unusual to say the
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:24:58.200]  least but of course they don't have a motive or anything to sell vaccines uh what do you
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:03.640]  think's going on here well i gotta say this story kind of caught i caught up with me uh
[3:25:03.640 --> 3:25:10.280]  by surprise i was uh in the process last week of investigating the uh so-called suicide of
[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:18.280]  this ready mac uh cfo i was looking at some other issues uh and and and i i met a journalist with
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:23.640]  one of mexico city's largest newspapers and he and he was very nervous about something i said
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:28.680]  you know what's what's going on he started talking about swine flu i gotta say i hadn't
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:34.120]  heard about it i turned around to uh looked on the television and that's what cnn was covering
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:41.720]  um what he told me was he had been in contact with uh a top u n scientist who's uh actually
[3:25:41.720 --> 3:25:49.640]  been in uh democratic republic of congo looking at Ebola uh hot zones outbreaks also hiv and he
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:55.320]  said the problem with this was that it was the vector transmission on this particular flu did
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:01.800]  not meet all the uh you know natural occurrences it looked at the scientists as though it had been
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:09.480]  engineered uh it was not coming from uh swine to human but it was human to human contact uh it was
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:16.600]  the various uh gene sequences uh there's two uh two strains of uh swine flu uh north american
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:23.880]  eurasian two strains of human flu and of course uh the avian flu the bird flu that uh wreaked havoc
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:30.520]  in in asia uh a few years ago so to be clear saying it's two parts pig one of the four parts two
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:37.000]  parts human two two parts human one part bird and that and he said that does just his experience
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:43.160]  with Ebola which he is scientists apparently thought was also a product of a biological warfare
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:50.360]  research uh it was the same type of transmission method uh the human to human fast acting uh
[3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:57.720]  with uh uh you know disastrous consequences uh uh with the people succumbing from this particular
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:04.600]  flu uh when i started checking into it i contacted a friend of mine who's a journalist in chicarta
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:09.800]  because of course that's where they had some experience with the bird flu and of course
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:15.320]  uh his contacts in the health ministry in indonesia and we had the health minister of indonesia
[3:27:15.320 --> 3:27:21.640]  basically say this looks to be man-made uh they thought that uh the indonesian health ministry
[3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:28.760]  thought with bird flu and with this swine flu that this could be uh uh being uh spread by
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:36.200]  people who want to increase profits for pharmaceuticals well let me expand on that
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:41.960]  i got this is from tuesday evening we uh it came to us and then i got in confirmed and talked to
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:46.840]  the person yesterday i didn't really know what i had till last night but this talked about the boy
[3:27:46.840 --> 3:27:52.360]  that was about to die in houston and we have the name of the medical doctor here and it's an internal
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:57.800]  state document and i got from a school administrator they have a story up on prisonplanet.com texas
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:02.440]  doctor claims swine flu case is far worse than reported uh and that we're already at level six
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:06.440]  now this said we were already level five and it was going to go to level six and they did it out
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:10.760]  yesterday it was a five now they're saying we may go to level six this is confirmed but what's
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:16.600]  important here and i have this directly from the source this one out to health workers in schools
[3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:21.800]  okay i'll just tell you that at the administration level we have the names and i know who this came
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:27.240]  from i know them directly this is don't distribute this under all these penalties and all and it says
[3:28:27.240 --> 3:28:31.480]  that normally in in fact 10 to 15 percent of people that comes in contact with this is a clinical
[3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:36.280]  attack rate maybe more on 40 50 percent they're saying we have never seen anything like this
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:41.960]  they say and he goes on to say this is this is a doctor this is just unbelievable with the state
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:46.520]  but a 23 month old here is fighting for his life and a pregnant woman just south of san
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:50.920]  atonia was fighting for her life the baby didn't die the next day and then it goes on to say in
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:55.560]  mexico these folks might have died already but here in the u.s. they're getting tamaflu
[3:28:55.560 --> 3:28:59.960]  relazine quickly and then again those are drugs folks not vaccines and when you have ready access
[3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:05.000]  to ventilators it goes on what this means is that within a couple of weeks regional hospitals will
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:09.400]  likely become overwhelmed some of the kids with positive cases in comal county had more than
[3:29:09.400 --> 3:29:15.720]  70 contacts before diagnosis there are 10 to 25 times 10 to 25 times more actual cases this
[3:29:15.720 --> 3:29:21.080]  seems to be our headlines folks this is so big not possible cases actually then what is being
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:26.280]  reported in the media the way they fudge on reporting is that it takes three days to get the con
[3:29:26.280 --> 3:29:33.160]  confirmation nod from the cdc on a given viral culture so there's 10 cases for every confirmed
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:37.720]  case during the night we crossed the threshold of the definition of the world health organization
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:42.760]  phase six global pandemic this has not happened in any of our lifetimes so far we are in uncharted
[3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:48.200]  territory he expects president obama to declare emergency sometime the next 72 96 hours stay there

[3:33:22.840 --> 3:33:28.200]  you just heard me read that and they're announcing the u n is in control of our response they're
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:33.000]  declaring emergencies here all over the country they've got police guarding town of
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:38.120]  loose stockpiles we confirmed here in austin but they're saying it's no big deal but acting like
[3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:43.720]  it's into the world meanwhile in regular flues kill 36 000 people on average here in the united
[3:33:43.720 --> 3:33:48.280]  states and there's only been a few deaths uh so what do you think of what i just read and
[3:33:48.280 --> 3:33:54.040]  uh who would stand to gain from releasing a designer flu whether for fear mongering or to
[3:33:54.040 --> 3:33:59.320]  wipe out a bunch of people well obviously the pharmaceuticals would gain in profit but also
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:05.800]  those who want to keep this national security surveillance state uh going uh and full bore
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:12.200]  would also uh gain in that i would i would add to what uh the documents you received i received
[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:18.840]  two internal uh memos uh from uh dr beser who's the acting director of the centers for disease
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:24.200]  control in atlanta uh now it's interesting to point out that dr beser's job before he was
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:30.840]  made acting director was he was in charge of the counterterrorism unit called cotper at the cdc
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:36.200]  and he's turning a he in his memo to the cdc he says we don't know where we're going with this
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:42.920]  we're like uncharted territory but he does say we're in a marathon not a sprint that's all this
[3:34:42.920 --> 3:34:49.080]  kind of alarmist language so yes why is it that they're trying to downplay this now but internally
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:53.800]  they're acting like it's a big deal i would also say based on what jill biden had to say
[3:34:53.800 --> 3:34:59.560]  about not getting in airplanes or on trains uh i have a friend he's a journalist he's a colleague
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:05.320]  of mine he's in quarantine today in new york city because he flew from chicago to new york
[3:35:05.320 --> 3:35:13.240]  uh and he obviously contracted the flu now the hospital will not confirm even do a test
[3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:19.560]  to confirm whether it's swine flu or not um he feels it's swine flu it's all the symptoms
[3:35:19.560 --> 3:35:25.640]  of swine flu he came down with it within the in the two-day period that uh they say you get this
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:32.680]  uh flu um uh and here's the alarming thing i think there may be different protocols for
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:36.840]  when a journalist gets this and is put in quarantine because they know they have access to black
[3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:42.840]  buries and you know iphone's and all this and can actually report on what's going on from within
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:48.040]  these hospitals so they're not going to they did not test this individual for swine flu
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:52.440]  he doesn't know he feel he's being he's in quarantine which indicates that they probably
[3:35:52.440 --> 3:35:59.240]  think he has swine flu but he was on a plane from ohare to new york he checked there are 100
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:05.720]  flights to the daily from mexico to ohare airport so just think about the potential
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:11.480]  people who are flying on these airplanes and who may have transmitted this disease and here in
[3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:17.160]  washington we have our first confirmed case now of the swine flu it's a at the world bank
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:24.200]  downtown and um uh it was apparently an individual who was in mexico and business who came to work
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:29.960]  at the world bank and and then uh they found out he had swine flu instead of telling this individual
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:34.600]  don't come to work he came to work and now they don't know how many other employees of the world
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:40.120]  bank may when you're a smart guy i've been trying to do this but i've just i've been trying to
[3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:46.360]  compute let's say this thing broke out march 18th is when the mexicans said they discovered it so
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:52.280]  let's say early march month and a half ago or more almost two months ago it really starts
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:58.920]  breaking last thursday friday in mexico here we are seven eight days later and now hysteria is here
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:04.760]  so i guess you're gonna see the they say with most flus like this the peaks about 80 to 90 days so
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:12.440]  we're talking we're probably you know 60 70 days till we see the peak of this here and and so i guess
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:16.760]  it's going to be what a week or two till we see if there's start to be deaths tens of thousands of
[3:37:16.760 --> 3:37:21.000]  cases are are they going to go the route of just shutting everything down and telling us oh there's
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:26.920]  there's only a hundred and fifty cases but then i talk to people calling me from mexico
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:31.720]  and doctors and calls from x they say there's vomiting death in small towns death at every
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:37.960]  hospital bbc reports doctors by name at hospitals will send there's dead people everywhere i mean
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:43.400]  what the hell's going on and why am i getting hack attack completely blasted i mean this is
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:49.560]  that well i i would just go on you know that adding a friend who is in quarantine with suspect
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:55.000]  suspected swine flu and they're not telling him the story kept changing the first the hospital said
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:59.080]  look we we don't have the means to test you for swine flu well that's pretty scary alone if they
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:04.920]  must be widespread then it must be and then they say well no it's not us as the cdc says we can't
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:09.720]  test you for swine flu this is incredible everyone who came in his room had to wear a mask he had to
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:15.320]  wear a mask i can tell you here in washington that the drugstore the two major chains cbs and
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:21.000]  right aid are out of tamiflu that stuff and you know you figure where these drugstores are located
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:27.160]  i live between the cia and a pentagon so every drugstore now is and has been is out of tamiflu
[3:38:27.160 --> 3:38:31.800]  and it's and they're out of these uh... these uh... surgical masks well what are these people
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:36.680]  to work at these facilities uh... around uh... this area know that we don't know now that we
[3:38:36.680 --> 3:38:40.920]  have now we have of course our first confirmed case of swine flu here in the district well
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:46.200]  Wayne madson consulted the nsa syndicated writer for major publications reporter in dc
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:53.080]  and the district of criminals are you saying the motive is with big pharma and the government a
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:58.600]  smokescreen for the political collapse the death of christler all of this uh... grandstanding by
[3:38:58.600 --> 3:39:04.440]  the leadership of the government uh... when the public is on the verge of revolution uh... or
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:09.000]  is this them just not knowing what's happening in their pending i think i think the evidence all
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:14.040]  points towards like you said with this designer virus i i think it's a staged event of it the
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:18.360]  question is have they released something really deadly on us or they make believing it's really
[3:39:18.360 --> 3:39:23.960]  deadly and hyping it uh... what's your take well if you know is it is it the uh... placebo virus
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:28.760]  that they're getting us ready for the really nasty one who's who's to know we do know that
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:34.440]  with all the workers uh... work at action around the world french the french employees
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:39.400]  taken a boss's hostage uh... massive street demonstrations against what's going on with
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:43.720]  the try to kill the queen with a car it went after the reviewing stand and killed three or four
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:48.200]  people incredible photos up on the right for wars dot com and we're talking about a
[3:39:48.200 --> 3:39:53.160]  a summer of rage in britain uh... with the g twenty was only a taste of things to come in
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:59.080]  london so yeah there was uh... all this is now off the news uh... as as is all the torture
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:03.880]  you know stuff uh... that's been replaced with this story uh... it does seem a little convenient
[3:40:03.880 --> 3:40:09.000]  let me ask you this is it's going to go ahead on the twenty four hour news cycle but now we have
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:14.440]  twenty four by seven on swine flu not to downplay it i think it may be a lot more serious than of
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:19.800]  course based on what i'm reading internal memos uh... what uh... what they're stating publicly
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:23.400]  now that you know though better than i said though because you've been in government i've just seen
[3:40:23.400 --> 3:40:30.120]  do this from outside that they will strategically lie to police and locals telling them like you
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:34.120]  know bush told police all there have been lots of secret terror attacks every time a chemical
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:38.760]  plant would blow up or something there have been lots of secret uh... terror attacks that's why
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:42.760]  we're taking all the rights but don't tell the public it'll panic them they could also be feeding
[3:40:42.760 --> 3:40:47.640]  the locals like they did with the last bird flu freak out two years ago sing millions would die
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:51.800]  and they didn't like they did with the stars five six years ago saying total death and it didn't
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:56.360]  happen i mean what's the chance of it is just a total hoax there's only been a few deaths
[3:40:56.360 --> 3:41:01.960]  and they're just hyping it well i mean i remember we had the west mile virus scared to here you
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:06.680]  know i think that anytime you see a dead bird you know you know you reported so we had all these
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:11.480]  dead bird sightings all over the whole of the washington area of course you know some people
[3:41:11.480 --> 3:41:16.200]  to get sick but it did seem like it was a little bit hyped uh... with the west uh... west mile
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:21.480]  virus uh... some of that may be a play here but again uh... what what doctor best or seven
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:26.760]  these internal cdc memos that were leaked to me was uh... was like we don't know where this is
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:32.120]  heading but we all have to be in you know in the emergency mode and then this guy's background
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:37.960]  was handling uh... the uh... counterterrorism part of the of the equation for the centers for
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:43.320]  disease control i mean he's in a very convenient uh... position now i'm being uh... somebody who
[3:41:43.320 --> 3:41:48.360]  came out of that particular area counterterrorism uh... obviously you know part of that whole
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:53.560]  counterterrorism thing is is to uh... scare the pop-up the general public
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:03.080]  you know well things are getting really bizarre uh... speaking of scyops day one within hours of
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:08.440]  the giant plane that one of the air air force to one of the four extras they have as part of the
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:15.400]  imperium now policy has several of our own cruisers at it cost unbelievable but the point is
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:20.520]  it's flying between the buildings f-16s and we said my god they knew that would terrorize people
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:24.840]  then it comes out they knew for weeks in advance made a big deal about it staying secret
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:28.520]  told the police this is a big operation the fb i don't tell the public
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:33.240]  there were internal fights about it then they fly it through and terrorize them and obama laughs and
[3:42:33.240 --> 3:42:39.080]  says i didn't know about it was a photo op no one asked a photo op for what well a scyop a photo op
[3:42:39.080 --> 3:42:46.040]  was that to reconjure on top of the bird flu and nine eleven like this is your your uh... the biological
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:51.880]  nine eleven i mean i mean what i mean we know they calculate everything what was the point of that
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:56.600]  well this is this was a strange thing uh... this is all
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:43:01.560]  a whole operation where they said uh... it i never heard of a classified photo op and
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:06.360]  a photo op where were they going to publish the photo what magazine what was this for
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:11.720]  what what why did they spend all that money and and and and classify this thing as some sort of
[3:43:11.720 --> 3:43:16.280]  secret mission uh... if it's if it's just purely a photo op it makes no sense and
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:18.600]  and i can tell you from people i know i know one
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:22.120]  friend of mine was standing on the brooklyn bridge when that happened and witnessed
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:29.320]  those f-16s coming within just yards of some of these high-rise buildings so um the the idea
[3:43:29.320 --> 3:43:33.400]  that uh... they said they informed people i mean bloomberg says he wasn't informed the new york new
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:38.920]  jersey port authority who lost so many of their law enforcement officers on nine eleven they said
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:44.280]  they were not why terrorize them why is obama going on sixty minutes or even a groveling media guy
[3:43:44.840 --> 3:43:48.920]  it was real he said are you punch drunk what's wrong with you see go things are imploding when
[3:43:48.920 --> 3:43:54.920]  you come and bomb it like i thought it was like he was on heroin or something i mean he's it makes
[3:43:54.920 --> 3:44:00.600]  no sense makes no sense at all well what's the sign up i mean you worked in intelligence on on the
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:05.560]  it side surveillance side but i mean what is up to me are these people completely psycho i mean
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:11.080]  what's going on or you know why why do they do anything in new york they know it's the media
[3:44:11.080 --> 3:44:15.960]  capital of the world and it's going to get a lot of attention and it did certainly did
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:21.160]  not good and not good attention in this case but uh... look how everybody was talking about it that
[3:44:21.160 --> 3:44:25.880]  was the uh... it was the news of the day and actually two days uh... with a two-day news
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:31.480]  cycle uh... but uh... it did as a people in new york i can tell you were absolutely panicked
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:35.880]  uh... they didn't know what that would not just new york but also on the journey and their memo
[3:44:35.880 --> 3:44:41.640]  says they knew it would do that so it's an admitted sigh up why would they want to terrorize people
[3:44:42.280 --> 3:44:47.000]  well you know and how does charles schumer would react to all this he says well we need to have a
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:52.360]  law that prevents planes from flying too low instead of questioning it's like the nine eleven
[3:44:52.360 --> 3:44:58.040]  commission there is a law that's controlled airspace exactly why aren't they going after the event
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:45:03.160]  why why why is schumer talking about what's having new law i mean that's ridiculous he doesn't
[3:45:03.160 --> 3:45:09.160]  he's not and he's not going to ask the questions what was called there this military liaison doing
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:13.720]  uh... at the white house uh... approving this in the first place who else was involved
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:17.640]  bob gates says he didn't know what he's the secretary defense why didn't he know
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:22.280]  or is he lying about a lot as much attention as was put on this they admit it was a big debate
[3:45:23.160 --> 3:45:27.240]  right and why would they do it just to re-invoke nine eleven fairs
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:31.960]  well that's what it did for new york that's certainly as a the effect it had and then lower
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:36.600]  manhattan and jersey city and statin island and all the other you know places around here that's
[3:45:36.600 --> 3:45:43.000]  all this this uh... it is just uh... you know taken air force one on a joy ride is uh... you
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:48.680]  know just uh... it is actually is no logical explanation for what they did but i don't know
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:54.440]  i can say it's some psi op psychiatrist came up with this they know it's all about art types
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:46:00.360]  uh... and how are these people are out of their minds so so when in your gut all these years i've
[3:46:00.360 --> 3:46:05.480]  really learned to respect your predictions and things you laid out where do you see them going
[3:46:05.480 --> 3:46:09.880]  i mean it's clear or if you disagree that the economy is just in free fall in the middle of all
[3:46:09.880 --> 3:46:15.320]  the fear of the plane in fear of the flu obama comes out is very calm and very fatherly and
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:19.080]  i mean is it all about making him the leader he's the savior
[3:46:19.720 --> 3:46:24.040]  he'll fix it as they just lead us into darkness i mean what's happening here
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:28.840]  well maybe they didn't get enough balance from the saving the ship from the pirates over there so
[3:46:28.840 --> 3:46:35.000]  they had to come up with some other ideas but uh... certainly somebody who lived in dc during the
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:40.840]  nine eleven and then we had the sniper case and then we had anthrax uh... certainly you can you
[3:46:40.840 --> 3:46:47.240]  know i've i've seen how this this city can grind to a you know a halt in uh... uh... and uh...
[3:46:47.240 --> 3:46:52.200]  it seemed like now with the first case of uh... swine flu we're seeing a repetition of that here
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:57.000]  in the in in washington we know what happened during anthrax they put through that patriot act
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:47:02.040]  when congress came under attack congress had been dispersed and they were able push that push that
[3:47:02.040 --> 3:47:07.720]  patriot act through so that's the reaction of what that that's what how washington reacts to these
[3:47:07.720 --> 3:47:12.840]  crisis uh... these crisis modes and uh... certainly we may see something happen again here with
[3:47:12.840 --> 3:47:17.720]  this uh... swine flu when the bipartisan group of crooks wouldn't pass the bank or takeover bill
[3:47:17.720 --> 3:47:22.120]  that ninety eight percent americans in polls are against as you know wayne they terrorize people
[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:26.920]  bush and the democrats and simple have marshal lobby don't do it will have depression and then
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:33.160]  things got worse uh... now biden's coming out saying don't fly don't get on subways
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:38.600]  mexico shutting down canceling its government they've got to know this is a nail in the coffin
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:43.160]  potentially as all this bad news stacks up what's the scyop
[3:47:43.160 --> 3:47:47.000]  behind that and and and what do you see this whether it's a real deadly flu or not
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:52.760]  what i mean they've got to know this is and and it's clearly engineered so i guess they want to
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:58.120]  fully destroy the economy well so this is an international this is an international scope
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:04.120]  by i i noted that uh... china which is never wanted taiwan to be in part of as part of any kind of
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:09.880]  u n uh... organization that china is now said okay taiwan can now take part in world health
[3:48:09.880 --> 3:48:16.840]  organization meetings on swine flu so we're seeing a big international push uh... right now uh...
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:22.840]  this is a global issue uh... and uh... it seems like uh... like state and municipal governments are
[3:48:22.840 --> 3:48:27.800]  complying with what the federal government saying we're seeing national governments basically saying
[3:48:27.800 --> 3:48:32.760]  i will do whatever the world health organization tell us to do so that it's not just this country
[3:48:32.760 --> 3:48:36.280]  every government in the world is now uh... just saying you know
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:41.320]  uh... what do we do how do we how do we confront this issue that talk about travel restrictions
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:45.240]  we've got bands on flights to mexico bands on flights from mexico now
[3:48:45.240 --> 3:48:50.120]  and now also maybe a band a band on flights to and from the united states to certain parts of
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:54.680]  the world you rica you just that's why i love them people like you on wing you made it just click
[3:48:54.680 --> 3:48:59.480]  clearly this is the international nine eleven whether it's hype or not it has the same effect
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:06.360]  the u n's bragging and in reuters that it's telling the u s canada australia england mexico what to do
[3:49:06.920 --> 3:49:11.720]  this is the global crisis to bring us together just like the sbp documents that they would
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:17.560]  for north american union during this and they're setting up the new bank of the world in the g20
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:23.960]  agreement in the new s dr's uh... i i mean is that what you're getting at that this is their global
[3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:29.880]  nine eleven biological well certainly having that effect if you see the regional organizations
[3:49:29.880 --> 3:49:34.840]  are now having these emergency sessions where the golf corp cooperation council in the persian
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:41.160]  golf you've got this south african development uh... cooperation council meeting because there's
[3:49:41.160 --> 3:49:46.680]  now two cases in south africa you got it a z on meeting so yeah all these regional
[3:49:46.680 --> 3:49:50.760]  organizations are meeting in these emergency sessions that uh... see how they're going
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:55.800]  to confront the swine flu uh... whether it's broken out in those areas or they feel it's
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:50:01.240]  about ready to so yeah so this is very much an internationally coordinated operation
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:05.960]  and we have riots starting and and and and attacks on government everywhere that that
[3:50:05.960 --> 3:50:11.240]  look like they're organic perfect timing to have this is a big unifying effect through fear
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:15.640]  to make everybody drop their rebellion against tyranny to just worry about their lives
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:20.680]  and a perfect beta test or it could be the perfect cover right now for marshal lawline
[3:50:21.720 --> 3:50:26.760]  well certainly uh... yeah i mean that's what i see i mean i think the fear is the only weapon
[3:50:26.760 --> 3:50:31.480]  these people have at their disposal and uh... and when you talk about a pandemic
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:36.840]  not that you know not many people are walking around with degrees in microbiology or virology
[3:50:36.840 --> 3:50:41.480]  so they don't have to they'll just believe what they're told they have no other choice though
[3:50:41.480 --> 3:50:47.000]  uh... these medical emergencies are are really the pure factor you can you can throw terrorism
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:51.480]  stuff at them but a lot of people are onto that that number they you know they know about these
[3:50:51.480 --> 3:50:56.120]  false flag operations and whatnot but when it comes to a pandemic that's when their people

[3:55:26.040 --> 3:55:31.080]  madson wane in closing just amazing points you brought up today really got me thinking uh here
[3:55:31.080 --> 3:55:36.440]  in our little think tank any other things you think are important or things on the horizon with
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:43.000]  pakistan iran israel saying they want to go in is all of this a cover for that uh we know we
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:46.920]  they love the magic trick of look at my pretty assistant while they put the rabbit in the hat
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:51.240]  and pull it out uh i mean we know they love distraction they're trying to pass a lot of
[3:55:51.240 --> 3:55:56.920]  draconian bills world government internet restrictions what do you see happening well
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:01.880]  certainly this uh this thing is as the swine flu is taking attention off of what's going on
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:08.120]  with the possible collapse of the pakistani nation uh nuclear country a nuclear weaponized
[3:56:08.120 --> 3:56:12.760]  country i would i would also point out that one one of the things getting very little attention
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:18.440]  is is the u.s. army bio weapons laboratory at fort detrick maryland now that it's there have been
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:27.640]  reports that uh samples of uh uh uh the various diseases are missing from their bio safety uh
[3:56:27.640 --> 3:56:34.760]  level four laboratory these are things like swine flu uh that that place needs to be closed down
[3:56:34.760 --> 3:56:40.920]  as the the military and cia has no business being involved in this kind of research it's
[3:56:40.920 --> 3:56:47.000]  actually a violation of a 19th treaty between the u.s. then soviet union and britain to ban
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:53.560]  this kind of research we have not uh abided by three it's a violation of the wall um the place
[3:56:53.560 --> 3:56:57.960]  needs to be shut down because we know that that's where the anthrax strain came from the aim strain
[3:56:57.960 --> 3:57:04.600]  of anthrax used in the attacks on congress and the media uh it's high time that somebody uh just
[3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:09.880]  says that said an issue an executive order shut down for detrick turn what needs to be turned over
[3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:14.440]  to the cdc and national institute of health and whatever else is left there just carefully have
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:20.600]  that stuff destroyed because you can't we just can't afford to have have them up there those those
[3:57:20.600 --> 3:57:25.720]  those frankenstein dr frankenstein's work at a frederick uh i mean the only decent guy was
[3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:30.840]  probably dr brook bottom brook siden so they said did the anthrax but i don't think did but they
[3:57:30.840 --> 3:57:36.760]  said he committed suicide well now they've built 36 level four and level three bio weapons labs
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:43.560]  in the name of treatment but even the ball of the um baltimore sun admitted that this is really a cover
[3:57:43.560 --> 3:57:49.480]  for bio weapons go ahead absolutely and then we had the incident on the inner city passenger train
[3:57:49.480 --> 3:57:55.880]  in switzerland the other day where a canister containing swine flu explodes with 61 passengers
[3:57:55.880 --> 3:58:02.200]  on the on the train and now there's 22 documented cases of swine flu outbreak in switzerland uh
[3:58:02.200 --> 3:58:06.760]  what what in the world were they moving that stuff on a passenger train for sounds like a
[3:58:06.760 --> 3:58:11.800]  stage sounds like a stage bio attack to me absolutely absolutely it's incredible what's
[3:58:11.800 --> 3:58:16.040]  going on could this be the start of world war three maybe we don't even know it this is the
[3:58:16.040 --> 3:58:24.280]  future war that could be i i perish the thought all right wane madson report dot com check it out
