[00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.191]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:07.973]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:09.714]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:11.295]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:12.216]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:17.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:25.247]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:29.110]  I do not have words to describe how serious the situation is.
[00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.212]  Things are deteriorating very, very quickly.
[00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:38.241]  This is probably one of the most important broadcasts I will ever do today.
[00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:53.147]  I'm going to try to measure my words and focus my mind to a high level of awareness because I have a tendency to do so much radio that I begin to almost lazily sit around like I'm having a barroom discussion with friends.
[00:00:54.997 --> 00:00:58.460]  And I live so close to the New World Order's criminal activity.
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.021]  I constantly study their evil.
[00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:10.689]  I'm fully aware of their capacity for death and destruction that I tend to get acclimated to it and don't express properly just how serious the situation is.
[00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.533]  Things are extremely dire, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.976]  Extremely serious on every front.
[00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.557]  There is no doubt
[00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:29.805]  The government is trying to create panic and fear while moving to implement full-bore martial law.
[00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:35.613]  The only question is, is this flu truly deadly?
[00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.837]  On a mass scale, or has it just killed a few people?
[00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.456]  Or are they just using this for pure hype?
[00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:45.356]  I have no doubt this was a bioweapon.
[00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:51.157]  There are scientists all over the world in mainstream news saying it clearly has the markers of a bioweapon.
[00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:53.178]  The question is who produced it.
[00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:55.258]  Dr. Horowitz thinks he knows who.
[00:01:55.258 --> 00:02:01.040]  I can't say he has proof of that, total proof of that, but he has a right to what he's saying.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.680]  We respect him.
[00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:19.072]  But regardless, we have globalists that have been caught launching controlled bioweapon attacks many times in the past around the world, ongoing in declassified documents in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:28.219]  Now, the news I've got is so big, so important, that I almost don't want to just come right out and say it.
[00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.801]  We do need what you'd call a drumroll.
[00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:40.051]  To get people's attention so we don't just say this and then it goes off into the ether and people don't realize what's happened or developed.
[00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:55.914]  When we come back in the next segment, I need the audio and then later in the show when I repeat this and have the latest info and the hours to come, the video at PrisonPlanet.tv to go, and the pun is intended, absolutely supernova viral.
[00:02:57.486 --> 00:03:01.568]  This is the highest level alert for InfoWarriors.
[00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:06.569]  Our sites are being savagely hacked with sophisticated denial of service.
[00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.110]  We have that from our big IT facilities.
[00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.291]  My two IT guys here.
[00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.892]  There is no doubt we are getting threats.
[00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:16.173]  You name it, coming in here.
[00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:24.933]  It is off the charts and they are very upset about the information we've been putting out in the last few days.
[00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:28.296]  InfoWars.com, for all intents and purposes, is down.
[00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:32.760]  We have to jump it around on different systems and change ports and
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.101]  Block and move IPs.
[00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:39.042]  We're being attacked.
[00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:49.345]  Classic DoD attacks out of Japan where they have the super high-speed connections and that basic CIA DoD command base they've got over there.
[00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:51.285]  And it is definitely governmental.
[00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:57.287]  When they're done blasting the ports, when we move them, they go ahead and blast the entire facilities.
[00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:03.226]  All the servers, all the other systems, in an attempt to get us kicked off or shut down.
[00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:07.849]  But we have layers and layers of backup servers at other facilities.
[00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.614]  But we're trying to deal with it at this facility right now so we don't have to migrate over and then continue to move.
[00:04:13.614 --> 00:04:17.317]  But we are under attack right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:26.171]  The good news is we're backed up on multiple CDNs, multiple networks, and other systems for the audio, the video.
[00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:29.995]  We also piggyback on giant grids like YouTube and Google.
[00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:34.999]  That's why we're on those is because, well, you can't stop the signal as they say.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.625]  And frankly, every weapon they form against us only blows up in their face, because people then realize we're under governmental attack.
[00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.747]  No doubt, we've seen the signature, the attack profile.
[00:04:45.747 --> 00:04:51.831]  That only made people realize that's a seal of approval, an underlining of our work, a highlighting of what we cover.
[00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:57.134]  The most important news we have covered in many years, on the other side of this break.
[00:04:57.134 --> 00:04:58.215]  Spread the word.
[00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:58.335]  Go!
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.805]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:12.348]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:05:12.348 --> 00:05:17.972]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:25.517]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:05:25.517 --> 00:05:30.400]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.722]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:05:36.722 --> 00:05:42.504]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:48.467]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:51.248]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:51.988]  Or by calling 269-216-9767.

[00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:06.340]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.004]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.004 --> 00:06:19.509]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.490]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.952]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:34.820]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:38.790]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.651]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:47.558]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.558 --> 00:06:55.825]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:57.407]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:58.588]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:07.636]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:23.552]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:29.215]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:35.739]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:39.622]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:42.223]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:47.687]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:50.668]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:50.668 --> 00:07:52.888]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:55.389]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:59.750]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.691]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.472]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.907 --> 00:08:26.430]  Alright, listen to me very, very carefully, folks.
[00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:35.393]  The establishment cannot have the federal government take over Chrysler and force it into bankruptcy to be handed over to Fiat, owned by a member of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:46.017]  They cannot loot your pension funds, destroy the stock market, leverage tens of trillions of dollars, now $12.8 trillion in six months, onto, not your children's backs, but onto your backs.
[00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:53.539]  Now it's well over $100,000 per person in the nation on top of all the other debt.
[00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:59.681]  All being used by offshore banks that have gotten the money to buy up the infrastructure.
[00:08:59.681 --> 00:09:10.824]  And so, in the last month and a half, I've been saying that I believe they're going to stage a large terror attack, or a massive bioweapon release to have a big scare, that they could say that a foreign enemy launched the attack.
[00:09:12.998 --> 00:09:19.441]  But then people would demand they find the enemy in the caves and then that becomes embarrassing so they just say it's naturally occurring.
[00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:30.866]  And I have said on record over and over and over again that I believe that they would play a bioweapon release card or they would claim that it was a natural occurrence.
[00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:34.268]  That is what I saw in the tea leaves as they say.
[00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:57.470]  Because I saw them engage in the preparatory phase of fear-mongering, reintroducing the old anthrax story, tying up loose ends, grabbing that doctor and killing him in a medical facility, and then claiming he committed suicide, blaming the anthrax on him, saying it was cooked up in a bathtub, and they've admitted that it was weaponized and they made it.
[00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:03.451]  The government.
[00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.072]  All of this is important.
[00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:10.964]  And they introduce to the public, oh, the flu's about to get you, give up your rights when the flu comes.
[00:10:10.964 --> 00:10:13.586]  It could kill millions, it could kill billions.
[00:10:13.586 --> 00:10:16.767]  You need to take the vaccines, get ready.
[00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:20.230]  All of these FEMA drills, getting ready for the flu.
[00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:30.636]  And then, Janet Napolitano comes out Sunday and says, oh, well, this flu may run its course and not be too deadly, but another giant pandemic is coming soon.
[00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:36.507]  You see, they need to have a unifying effect.
[00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.549]  They need to make you rally around the government in fear.
[00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:42.192]  They need to make you forget about all the things politically they're doing.
[00:10:42.192 --> 00:10:48.257]  How they're expanding the wars and protecting President Bush when the memos come out that they ordered the torture.
[00:10:48.257 --> 00:10:52.181]  How do they burn their underlings that followed orders but they don't get in trouble.
[00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:53.923]  All of that is now off the screen.
[00:10:55.202 --> 00:11:00.303]  The 6.1% drop in the last quarter in the economy.
[00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:01.364]  6.1% plunge.
[00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:03.664]  6.3% in the quarter before that.
[00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:08.465]  I mean, the economy is in massive contraction implosion.
[00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:12.787]  With an overlay of inflation.
[00:11:12.787 --> 00:11:16.487]  I mean, we are dead on arrival as an economy.
[00:11:16.487 --> 00:11:22.089]  The economic numbers coming in are worse than I even thought they would be and coming on faster.
[00:11:24.028 --> 00:11:32.357]  And in the middle of this, we discover, now here's the latest news, we discover that March 18th, the Mexican government had identified this flu.
[00:11:34.218 --> 00:11:39.542]  And knew that it was very fast spreading, that it had a much higher infection rate.
[00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:45.846]  Most people that come in contact with flu, it's 10 to 15 percent that contract it, and then a smaller percentage of those actually get ill.
[00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:57.153]  That is, you're carrying it, it's dividing in your body, but your body beats it before it divides to a level to cause you to become ill and show symptoms.
[00:11:57.153 --> 00:11:58.814]  This thing is designer.
[00:11:58.814 --> 00:12:00.395]  That's what scientists all over the world are saying.
[00:12:00.395 --> 00:12:01.956]  I've got a bunch of news on that.
[00:12:01.956 --> 00:12:02.897]  We're going to be covering it.
[00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:18.027]  Later in the show, Wayne Madsen, formerly with the National Security Agency, security consultant and reporter on Black Ops, reporting from Capitol Hill.
[00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:20.768]  Wayne Madsen will be joining us in the last hour today.
[00:12:20.768 --> 00:12:23.049]  Powerful report he did on Russia today.
[00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:24.409]  That is coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:12:24.409 --> 00:12:25.169]  I'm going to play.
[00:12:25.169 --> 00:12:28.270]  I was on Russia Today myself, but about Obama's first 100 days.
[00:12:31.715 --> 00:12:35.736]  We're going to get that up on InfoWars.com for you, by the way, as soon as Kirk can get into the server.
[00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:39.278]  The site's been up and down via the hacks.
[00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:41.819]  Confirmed hacks, no doubt.
[00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:46.601]  We've got the IT center in there saying it's the worst hack they've ever seen.
[00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.601]  Just unbelievable.
[00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:53.360]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny joins us in 25 minutes.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.320]  She was in Mexico.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.361]  She's now back in the U.S.
[00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:56.722]  Give us a report on that.
[00:12:56.722 --> 00:13:03.967]  She's gone from thinking it was no big deal Monday to the last time we had her on saying it looks like this is just absolutely horrible what's happening.
[00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.848]  I haven't gotten to the big news yet.
[00:13:05.848 --> 00:13:08.249]  I'm just building up to it.
[00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:12.872]  And Lindsey Williams is going to join us on the economy and the bird flu coming up in two hours.
[00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:18.016]  I am going to be doing a simulcast on international press TV all over the Arab world and Africa.
[00:13:20.643 --> 00:13:29.069]  They wanted me to go downtown to be on satellite feed, and I told them I just wouldn't do it, so they're going to do a phone interview tied in with a simulcast with the radio.
[00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:33.972]  But I'm going to let them, for the 25 minutes I'm on, run the show, because it gets too confusing to do it.
[00:13:33.972 --> 00:13:37.574]  Kind of like when I was on with Tom Hartman with Air America a week or two ago.
[00:13:37.574 --> 00:13:44.479]  I just let him be in control of it, because you can't have two chiefs in over one group of Indians.
[00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:47.741]  You can't have two chefs cooking the same bowl of porridge.
[00:13:53.146 --> 00:13:56.107]  So that's coming up the start of the next hour.
[00:13:56.107 --> 00:14:01.428]  Genesis will run its brakes over me.
[00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:10.630]  First station's out there and then we'll just come back in... in stream, in segway.
[00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.610]  So that's what's coming up today.
[00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.391]  Wayne Madsen, Lindsey Williams, Dr. Sheridan Cunningham.
[00:14:14.391 --> 00:14:16.992]  And a simulcast with International Iranian Television.
[00:14:16.992 --> 00:14:18.312]  I was on again Russian yesterday.
[00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:21.413]  Now, Russian-English transmissions.
[00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:27.078]  Russian TV, Indonesian TV, Chinese TV.
[00:14:27.078 --> 00:14:28.858]  Television everywhere.
[00:14:28.858 --> 00:14:31.100]  Scientists everywhere are reporting.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.600]  Scientists here in this country are reporting.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.542]  This is absolutely designer, no doubt.
[00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:39.924]  It's got... What is it?
[00:14:39.924 --> 00:14:41.665]  Two fowls?
[00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:44.967]  I have the article here on the stack, but... Google make-up of the virus.
[00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.589]  I need the latest info and I was up so late, I'm a bit dingy.
[00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.070]  But it's two fowls, one pig and one human.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.160]  Let's Google makeup of the virus.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.201]  I need to have that.
[00:14:54.201 --> 00:15:07.124]  It's somewhere in the stack of literally a hundred articles since yesterday and I... Okay, here is the giant, massive news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:07.124 --> 00:15:12.905]  Here it is.
[00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:19.587]  And remember, I did an emergency broadcast Saturday
[00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:24.653]  for two hours and 40 minutes from 8 p.m.
[00:15:24.653 --> 00:15:25.894]  to 1040 p.m.
[00:15:25.894 --> 00:15:31.420]  Central Standard Time and I said I hope this isn't a real crisis.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:41.210]  The media is engaged in a PSYOP in a very sophisticated fashion, implemented with precision.
[00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:50.300]  Their actions show that they believe this is the worst thing since the 1918 Spanish flu that killed over 40 million people.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:16:00.822]  Their actions say one thing, but their words are another.
[00:16:00.822 --> 00:16:09.444]  Their words are, oh, it's no big deal, but Mexico's completely shutting down its government, its restaurants, its schools.
[00:16:09.444 --> 00:16:10.844]  But we're going to leave the borders wide open.
[00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:11.404]  It's no big deal.
[00:16:13.715 --> 00:16:18.578]  But if some American has TB and flies back from Greece, everybody's got to panic.
[00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:20.979]  But stuff far worse every day comes across the border.
[00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:25.062]  Meanwhile, the lawyer that did that, Dad's one of the head TB people at the CDC.
[00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:26.863]  That was all PSYOP.
[00:16:26.863 --> 00:16:27.783]  But I digress.
[00:16:27.783 --> 00:16:31.225]  That's just more of the intel that adds into the mix.
[00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:42.332]  To be very simple, and to put it very simply, and I got huge news in a moment, but it's got to be explained in a congruent, connected,
[00:16:43.843 --> 00:16:47.786]  Wholeness.
[00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:51.368]  To be clear.
[00:16:51.368 --> 00:16:52.749]  And I don't like what I'm seeing, folks.
[00:16:52.749 --> 00:17:03.957]  I'm actually not shaken, because I'm steeled against all of this, but more like thunderstruck.
[00:17:03.957 --> 00:17:09.861]  Dumbfounded.
[00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:10.121]  Just
[00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:20.035]  We're going to find out in the next few days, ladies and gentlemen, exactly what's going on, but it doesn't look good.
[00:17:20.035 --> 00:17:22.576]  It looks like this is the move for the complete takeover.
[00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:30.719]  Now, it remains to be seen, is the virus hyper-deadly?
[00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:40.002]  And if it isn't, this is the biggest hoax in history, and is an absolutely diabolical crime of unbelievable proportions.
[00:17:43.228 --> 00:18:00.677]  I mean, if they are gearing up for martial law and shutting everything down and panicking the entire planet over seven deaths in Mexico, the Mexicans are saying it's not 150 something, it's not 200 something, it's seven deaths confirmed and tested.
[00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:02.958]  One death in the United States.
[00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:06.780]  There's other deaths around the United States, but they keep saying, oh, we don't know if it was this flu or not.
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.802]  It was an influenza A, but we don't know.
[00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:17.872]  You've got these vaccine makers now saying they've already done a vaccine trial and have a vaccine.
[00:18:17.872 --> 00:18:25.554]  Novavax, the group fingered by Horowitz, is now out today saying they've got the vaccine.
[00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:30.735]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've got the vaccine a week into this when it normally takes six months.
[00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:31.915]  Come on.
[00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:36.176]  How much more ridiculous does it have to get?
[00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:36.496]  I don't know.
[00:18:40.034 --> 00:18:42.395]  And then I have an internal state report.
[00:18:42.395 --> 00:18:45.295]  When Watson put the article up, he said a Texas doctor.
[00:18:45.295 --> 00:18:48.956]  We've got his full name and everything and have made calls.
[00:18:48.956 --> 00:19:00.439]  This was an internal report, not for distribution, but we cut that off the letterhead when we gave it to Paul yesterday when he wrote the article at PrisonPlanet.com this morning.
[00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.999]  This is not a public document.
[00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:08.901]  This is directly from an AISD, Austin Independent School District, administrator.
[00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:20.099]  And this report says that the state health officials in meetings with the feds say this sucker is the most deadly flu they've ever seen.
[00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:25.060]  And I'm gonna read this secret transmission when we get back.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:32.701]  We brought you the MYAC, we brought you the last big federal DHS report saying gun owners and patriots and veterans are terrorists.
[00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:37.042]  We bring you this information because we bust our butts and because we have contacts everywhere.
[00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:42.257]  This is already about 36 hours old.
[00:19:42.257 --> 00:19:46.740]  This is from Tuesday evening.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:57.428]  We got this yesterday, covered it on Jason Bermes' show, and the article's up on PrisonPlanet.com, and it doesn't tell you one-tenth of how serious this is.
[00:19:57.428 --> 00:19:58.969]  We'll come right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:00.822 --> 00:20:02.803]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:02.803 --> 00:20:08.165]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.785]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:18.188]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:18.188 --> 00:20:23.890]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.912]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:25.912 --> 00:20:28.114]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:28.114 --> 00:20:32.638]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:32.638 --> 00:20:34.860]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:42.727]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:20:42.807 --> 00:20:45.269]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[00:20:45.269 --> 00:20:46.090]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.911]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[00:20:47.911 --> 00:20:49.412]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:50.273]  Or HBextract.com.
[00:20:50.273 --> 00:20:52.154]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:21:04.164 --> 00:21:06.768]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:13.799]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:20.941]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:20.941 --> 00:21:22.921]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:25.422]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.422 --> 00:21:36.367]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:36.992 --> 00:21:38.673]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.513]  It's about a one world government.
[00:21:40.513 --> 00:21:47.436]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.436 --> 00:21:55.699]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:55.699 --> 00:21:57.259]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.259 --> 00:21:58.460]  The people strike back.
[00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:03.678]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:03.678 --> 00:22:09.724]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:10.545]  That's right.
[00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:13.388]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:13.388 --> 00:22:20.896]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:20.896 --> 00:22:24.400]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments
[00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:29.007]  Like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.007 --> 00:22:34.495]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:37.519]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:40.283 --> 00:22:44.807]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:44.807 --> 00:22:45.088]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.088 --> 00:22:46.569]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:46.569 --> 00:22:46.789]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:47.069]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.069 --> 00:22:48.791]  Times are tough right now and people
[00:23:07.827 --> 00:23:08.568]  I don't know.

[00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:43.304]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[00:23:43.304 --> 00:23:44.545]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:23:44.545 --> 00:23:45.445]  Life Change Tea.
[00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:46.586]  We're changing lives.
[00:24:03.732 --> 00:24:10.094]  Yeah, they had to pull a little trick out of their little bag of tricks.
[00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:15.176]  To get their New World Order through.
[00:24:15.176 --> 00:24:21.959]  Well, we're gonna beat them.
[00:24:21.959 --> 00:24:23.559]  This is the empire striking back.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.721]  Okay, let me get into the huge breaking news right now.
[00:24:33.721 --> 00:24:39.463]  I'm going to be simulcasting on international television, press TV, worldwide for 25 minutes to the next hour.
[00:24:39.463 --> 00:24:41.544]  Stations will be able to pick that up.
[00:24:53.851 --> 00:24:57.394]  We got Sherry Timpenny coming up in the next segment, Dr. Sherry Timpenny.
[00:24:57.394 --> 00:25:07.383]  Lindsey Williams, huge news, breaking news, with Wayne Madsen, former of the National Security Agency, consultant to the CIA and others, reporter.
[00:25:07.383 --> 00:25:11.686]  He'll be joining us with the evidence of it being a designer virus.
[00:25:11.686 --> 00:25:16.591]  That is coming up with the designer RNA.
[00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:16.771]  Now,
[00:25:21.841 --> 00:25:27.165]  CNN is directly linked to PrisonPlanet.com right now attacking us in one of their top stories.
[00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:29.266]  Swine Flu, your question's answered.
[00:25:29.266 --> 00:25:41.134]  Got the Wall Street Journal calling me yesterday, New York Times, Total Insanity are out here with hit piece after hit piece rolling off the presses at us as the Pentagon savagely attacks our sites.
[00:25:41.134 --> 00:25:43.956]  That's why I got a bunch of sites.
[00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:49.639]  And we will be launching a new mega-site within a month that will be
[00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:55.264]  Non-dynamic, or what's the term, just where it's text only?
[00:25:55.264 --> 00:25:58.106]  We're going to launch one that has all of our news as an aggregator.
[00:25:58.106 --> 00:26:04.611]  I'm going to call it Sword of Truth or something.
[00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:09.215]  Our new dreadnought.
[00:26:09.215 --> 00:26:10.996]  Our new battleship.
[00:26:10.996 --> 00:26:12.697]  Our new aircraft carrier in the info war.
[00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:13.238]  We have to.
[00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:15.880]  We have to do it specifically to fight these people.
[00:26:16.943 --> 00:26:18.925]  In fact, we need to just go ahead.
[00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:19.865]  I shouldn't say in a month.
[00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:21.547]  I want it launched by next week.
[00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:23.488]  I have to come up with that plan.
[00:26:23.488 --> 00:26:27.571]  We just have to not sleep.
[00:26:27.571 --> 00:26:29.092]  Okay.
[00:26:29.092 --> 00:26:35.357]  CNN saying, could this new swine flu virus be manufactured by bioterrorists?
[00:26:35.357 --> 00:26:37.299]  The elected government?
[00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:38.059]  That's the theory.
[00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:40.861]  Some conspiracy theorist websites.
[00:26:40.861 --> 00:26:42.022]  But experts don't believe it.
[00:26:42.022 --> 00:26:43.764]  Oh yeah, none of the experts believe it.
[00:26:43.764 --> 00:26:45.445]  Link to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:45.445 --> 00:26:46.225]  It's question number 11.
[00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:50.667]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:26:50.667 --> 00:26:54.870]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:00.473]  Some people didn't believe it when we broke the MIAC report out of Missouri.
[00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:02.595]  They didn't believe it when we broke all the other secret documents.
[00:27:02.595 --> 00:27:05.937]  The clergy response teams, going back three years ago, they were getting
[00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:18.555]  Now 26,000 preachers ready to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps to take forced inoculations for flu or smallpox and to turn their guns in to follow Romans 13 and submit to everything the government says.
[00:27:18.555 --> 00:27:21.398]  That's now public and admitted.
[00:27:21.398 --> 00:27:22.879]  Declassified.
[00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:24.061]  Infra-guard the rest of it.
[00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:31.802]  Well, people don't believe what I covered last night, so I know a lot of you weren't listening last night, so this is new news.
[00:27:31.802 --> 00:27:37.247]  A lot of AM and FM stations to pick us up, WWCR, shortwave, satellite, internet.
[00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:40.309]  Some folks weren't listening last night.
[00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:44.373]  There's a story up on PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com is up and down, you can go there.
[00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:49.263]  Title, Texas doctor claims swine flu cases far worse than reported.
[00:27:49.263 --> 00:27:55.471]  Yeah, Watson, add in the headline and that the country's really at level six, which is total martial law.
[00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:58.675]  That means they've implemented it.
[00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:01.118]  They've executed the order and now have to implement.
[00:28:01.118 --> 00:28:03.642]  What level of implementation will they go to is the question.
[00:28:04.704 --> 00:28:07.725]  People accuse us of exaggerating or fear-mongering.
[00:28:07.725 --> 00:28:12.706]  Folks, my people aren't even reporting on one-tenth as bad as this is.
[00:28:12.706 --> 00:28:16.106]  And I'm not knocking Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Kurt Nemo.
[00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:17.187]  I got the U.N.
[00:28:17.187 --> 00:28:23.788]  official press release that they are running the response in the United States and Mexico and all over the world.
[00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:25.368]  It's in Reuters and AP.
[00:28:25.368 --> 00:28:30.909]  I've got them saying they're grabbing people at checkpoints in North Carolina, California and other places.
[00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.610]  Or if your kid's sick at school, they take them and put them in quarantine.
[00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:38.397]  This is in the news!
[00:28:38.397 --> 00:28:43.763]  We've got a prominent Texas doctor with the Health Department at the meetings.
[00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:47.868]  We have the report to try to protect the people that gave it to us.
[00:28:47.868 --> 00:28:49.791]  We excise out the URLs and
[00:28:51.305 --> 00:28:57.607]  The different threats at the top of it saying don't distribute and people say it isn't real when they read it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:57.607 --> 00:28:58.867]  Oh yes, it's real.
[00:28:58.867 --> 00:29:10.271]  And so the next fifteen minutes we scanned in the actual document, with it blacked out, the key information, and it's going up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:10.271 --> 00:29:19.434]  PrisonPlanet.com and it will be posted on the auxiliary JonesReport.com and on the auxiliary TruthNews.us and on the auxiliary
[00:29:21.144 --> 00:29:22.986]  Sites that we have.
[00:29:22.986 --> 00:29:26.949]  Now I'll read this document when we get back, and give you a breakdown of the latest info.
[00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:32.794]  Then we'll talk to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, who's been in Mexico, and get her medical view on this.
[00:29:32.794 --> 00:29:36.017]  Then we'll sample cats on international television.
[00:29:36.017 --> 00:29:40.380]  Then, Lindsey Williams, on the flu, the economy, and a lot more.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:47.546]  Then, Wayne Madsen, formerly with the National Security Agency, on the facts that this is a designer, bio-weapon release to create panic.
[00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:48.067]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.373]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.373 --> 00:29:53.975]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.975 --> 00:30:00.807]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.807 --> 00:30:03.412]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:07.354]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:30:07.354 --> 00:30:11.134]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:30:11.134 --> 00:30:17.716]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:22.937]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:30:22.937 --> 00:30:29.638]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:31.050]  Need something more?
[00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:35.014]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:30:35.014 --> 00:30:43.302]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:47.667]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[00:30:47.807 --> 00:30:50.488]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:50.488 --> 00:30:54.829]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:19.852]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.852 --> 00:31:21.833]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:24.295]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.295 --> 00:31:37.483]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.483 --> 00:31:39.144]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.144 --> 00:31:40.525]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:47.907]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.907 --> 00:31:56.176]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.176 --> 00:31:57.758]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.758 --> 00:31:58.960]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.536 --> 00:32:02.697]  You are a rebel.
[00:32:02.697 --> 00:32:03.437]  Admit it.
[00:32:03.437 --> 00:32:06.400]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.801]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:12.744]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[00:32:12.744 --> 00:32:14.786]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:17.148]  And you can count your real friends on one hand.
[00:32:17.148 --> 00:32:18.248]  Well, join the club.
[00:32:18.248 --> 00:32:24.453]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[00:32:24.453 --> 00:32:27.295]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times,
[00:32:27.395 --> 00:32:27.896]  I think so.
[00:32:49.861 --> 00:32:50.823]  Keep on standing.
[00:32:50.823 --> 00:32:51.686]  800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:51.686 --> 00:32:51.926]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:33:07.065 --> 00:33:12.667]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:18.170]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:23.572]  I've been on fire with Sally, filled on fast with a girl named Bo.
[00:33:23.572 --> 00:33:28.955]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[00:33:28.955 --> 00:33:31.776]  It's a death-defying life I lead,
[00:33:32.606 --> 00:33:34.647]  I'd take my chances.
[00:33:34.647 --> 00:33:39.989]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[00:33:39.989 --> 00:33:50.832]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[00:33:50.832 --> 00:33:53.573]  I might haul from a tall building.
[00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:55.694]  I might borrow a brand new car.
[00:33:57.355 --> 00:34:03.618]  Yeah, the stuntmen around here are the great crew behind what we do at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:03.618 --> 00:34:15.866]  Don't forget, it's not just me, it's our board ops, our directors, our IT people, the webmasters, the people in customer service, the folks shipping the books and videos and t-shirts out from the InfoWars.com store.
[00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:18.333]  And it's all of you.
[00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.394]  We appreciate the team.
[00:34:19.394 --> 00:34:21.076]  We're about to go to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:22.557]  I want to give her the latest info.
[00:34:22.557 --> 00:34:29.864]  I know she's been watching the news and researching herself and been in Mexico reporting for us since Monday, now back in the United States.
[00:34:29.864 --> 00:34:32.587]  But I want to give everybody the latest news and information.
[00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:39.165]  Now, two days ago I told you that when they said we're at Level 4, we're really at Level 5, was the intel I had.
[00:34:39.165 --> 00:34:42.427]  Then they announced yesterday, hey, we've really been at Level 5.
[00:34:42.427 --> 00:34:46.650]  Under Level 5, they can do quarantines, mass arrests, forced inoculations.
[00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:53.334]  That's in the CDC mandates that we've posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the United Nations documents.
[00:34:53.334 --> 00:34:59.698]  And I have all of those right here in front of me, and I'll be going over those with Dr.
[00:35:00.922 --> 00:35:07.804]  Now, I was already getting from my sources inside FEMA and other places but they wouldn't give me documentation because they said that the computers were being tracked and monitored.
[00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:40.330]  I was told that we were going to level 6 yesterday morning, and then they announced level 5, and I said on air, they say we're at 5, we're really at 6.
[00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:48.412]  Then, I was contacted by a school administrator at the IAISD, Austin Independent School District, here in town.
[00:35:50.595 --> 00:35:52.356]  And this, we wrote an article about it.
[00:35:52.356 --> 00:35:57.938]  I wanted Paul to do one last time but he was exhausted at 8 o'clock at night because that's 2 in the morning England time.
[00:35:57.938 --> 00:35:58.618]  He went to bed.
[00:35:58.618 --> 00:36:06.981]  Kurt Nemo couldn't write a story because InfoWars was hacked repeatedly and brought down so he couldn't get into it to upload from New Mexico where he lives unfortunately near the border.
[00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:13.162]  And so, uh, we didn't get it up until this morning.
[00:36:13.162 --> 00:36:20.663]  And the headline is, and this headline is not due at Justice Poll, I'm not knocking you, but this, we need to really point out how dire things are.
[00:36:20.663 --> 00:36:25.084]  You know, the media is fear-mongering and then saying everything's fine as a psych warfare op.
[00:36:25.084 --> 00:36:27.305]  We need to show what's really going on here and explain to people.
[00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:30.446]  Texas doctor claims swine flu case is far worse than reported.
[00:36:30.446 --> 00:36:31.106]  We need to add
[00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:34.400]  Says that feds have stated they're at level six.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.581]  Level six.
[00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:37.802]  The country is under level six.
[00:36:37.802 --> 00:36:39.883]  I'm telling you we're under level six.
[00:36:39.883 --> 00:36:42.044]  That's what's being announced, that's what's being done.
[00:36:42.044 --> 00:36:46.747]  In their actions, the things they're announcing is a level six response.
[00:36:46.747 --> 00:36:50.929]  Joe Biden comes out and says, don't get on planes, don't get on trains.
[00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:58.333]  Mexico is completely shutting everything down, including the government!
[00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:00.474]  They're starting to shut down roads and transport.
[00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:06.158]  This means they believe it is mega deadly.
[00:37:06.158 --> 00:37:08.740]  And as in mega, I mean millions of dead.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.341]  And the U.N.
[00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:11.683]  and others are saying millions and millions could die.
[00:37:11.683 --> 00:37:12.843]  They're out fear-mongering.
[00:37:12.843 --> 00:37:14.044]  I have those reports.
[00:37:14.044 --> 00:37:15.145]  In fact, I was looking at my stack.
[00:37:15.145 --> 00:37:16.306]  I printed it this morning.
[00:37:16.306 --> 00:37:20.950]  Well, you guys print millions dead, millions dead flu, and then it'll pull up the U.N.
[00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.431]  and others saying millions could die.
[00:37:22.431 --> 00:37:24.012]  Now, I'm not saying that.
[00:37:24.012 --> 00:37:25.333]  They're saying that.
[00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:27.455]  And I can't even keep track of how insane this is.
[00:37:31.144 --> 00:37:33.144]  This is the actual document.
[00:37:33.144 --> 00:37:36.145]  Earlier we just took excise parts out and put it in Paul's article.
[00:37:36.145 --> 00:37:39.566]  We're going to post the document itself, but blacked out.
[00:37:39.566 --> 00:37:43.767]  The area so you don't find out who sent it to us.
[00:37:43.767 --> 00:37:50.468]  This message, including all attachments, is for the sole use of intended recipients of Mekin Ten Confidential Students and or employee information.
[00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:55.689]  Otherwise, use of disclosure is prohibited under the Federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act.
[00:37:56.647 --> 00:37:58.688]  And it goes through the codes.
[00:37:58.688 --> 00:38:02.429]  If you are not an intended recipient, you may not use disclosed copier.
[00:38:02.429 --> 00:38:03.590]  Disseminate the information.
[00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:05.810]  Please call and send immediately a reply.
[00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.692]  Well, we were given this by an administrator, so that's their issue.
[00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:12.253]  Now, I'm sorry, we're going to tell people what the feds are telling the state.
[00:38:12.253 --> 00:38:14.754]  This is from an administrator in health.
[00:38:16.823 --> 00:38:18.445]  That's all I can say and I'm going to leave it there.
[00:38:18.445 --> 00:38:21.649]  I'm not going to say whether it's a middle school, an elementary, or a high school.
[00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:24.373]  This is from Austin, Texas!
[00:38:24.373 --> 00:38:29.279]  I know this person!
[00:38:29.279 --> 00:38:29.820]  Period!
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.365]  This is first hand!
[00:38:33.365 --> 00:38:34.006]  You understand?
[00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:42.326]  Flu update from Dr. General.
[00:38:42.326 --> 00:38:44.027]  G-I-T-T-E-R-L-E.
[00:38:44.027 --> 00:38:47.610]  And we have his full name up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:52.413]  Marcus General.
[00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:56.376]  Out of New Braunfels, Texas.
[00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:59.058]  And Paul put in here, to his patience, I told Paul to correct that.
[00:38:59.058 --> 00:39:01.099]  I'm not bashing anybody, it's crazy up here.
[00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:03.260]  This is an internal thing to school administrators.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.581]  He's working with the school.
[00:39:04.581 --> 00:39:08.084]  That's the school district where they shut down the schools where they have the first cases in Texas.
[00:39:08.962 --> 00:39:09.922]  Okay.
[00:39:09.922 --> 00:39:13.124]  Reported Saturday.
[00:39:13.124 --> 00:39:26.628]  After I returned from the public health meeting yesterday with community leaders and school officials in Comal County, Heather suggested I send an update to everyone because what we are hearing privately from the CDC and Health Department is so different from what you're hearing in the media.
[00:39:26.628 --> 00:39:33.351]  Some of you know, so some of you, or maybe all of you, but I will
[00:39:34.656 --> 00:39:36.056]  Just list the facts that I know.
[00:39:36.056 --> 00:39:40.357]  The virus is infectious for about two days prior to symptoms onset.
[00:39:40.357 --> 00:39:46.419]  The virus sheds more than seven days after symptom onset, possibly as long as nine days.
[00:39:46.419 --> 00:39:48.839]  That's a total of eleven days.
[00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:54.900]  Since it is such a novel, new virus, there is no herd immunity, so the attack rate is very high.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.821]  This is the percentage of people come down
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:21.315]  with a virus of exposed almost everyone who was exposed the virus will become infected though not all will be symptomatic this is much higher than seasonal flu which averages ten to fifteen percent the clinical attack rate maybe around this is a quote from the feds he says maybe around forty to fifty percent this is that is the number of people who show symptoms
[00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:24.292]  This is a huge number.
[00:40:24.292 --> 00:40:26.973]  It is hard to convey the seriousness of this.
[00:40:26.973 --> 00:40:32.516]  The virulence or deadliness of the virus is as bad here as in Mexico.
[00:40:32.516 --> 00:40:34.316]  Now that's the question we've always been needing the answer.
[00:40:34.316 --> 00:40:35.417]  Is it race specific?
[00:40:35.417 --> 00:40:36.577]  Is it chemical specific?
[00:40:36.577 --> 00:40:40.019]  Is it the toxic waste and the people being run down in Mexico the poor?
[00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:42.820]  One of the biggest and poorest cities in the world.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.981]  Reportedly the biggest and poorest.
[00:40:45.393 --> 00:40:48.399]  Okay, now, and I'm getting this from other doctors and other people, okay?
[00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:50.904]  You understand this is being confirmed right now.
[00:40:50.904 --> 00:40:52.907]  The virulence and deadliness of the virus is bad.
[00:40:52.907 --> 00:40:55.612]  It's as bad as here in Mexico.
[00:40:57.346 --> 00:41:03.168]  The virulence and deadliness of the virus is as bad here as in Mexico, and there are folks on ventilators here in the U.S.
[00:41:03.168 --> 00:41:03.929]  right now.
[00:41:03.929 --> 00:41:11.512]  This has not been in the media, but a 23-month-old... See, this was Tuesday night, and then he died the next morning.
[00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:13.252]  So this went out Tuesday night.
[00:41:13.252 --> 00:41:14.513]  I got this yesterday.
[00:41:14.513 --> 00:41:17.234]  See, this is confirmed, time-stamped.
[00:41:17.234 --> 00:41:20.555]  He knew about this from the feds before.
[00:41:20.555 --> 00:41:22.256]  He's in New Braunfels, south of Austin.
[00:41:22.256 --> 00:41:24.177]  He knows about the baby beforehand.
[00:41:25.424 --> 00:41:29.087]  But a 23-month-old near here is fighting for his life.
[00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:32.430]  And a pregnant woman just south of San Antonio is fighting for her life.
[00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.553]  In Mexico, these folks might have died already.
[00:41:35.553 --> 00:41:41.979]  But here in the U.S., folks are getting Tamiflu and Resaline quickly and have ready access to ventilators.
[00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:47.945]  We just got a secret Pentagon document confirmed that says the Tamiflu, the military is admitting that, and all the troops, by the way.
[00:41:49.127 --> 00:41:54.390]  What this means is that within a couple of weeks, regional hospitals will likely become overwhelmed.
[00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.491]  Did you hear that?
[00:41:55.491 --> 00:42:01.134]  Some of the kids with positive cases in Comal County had more than 70 contacts before diagnosis.
[00:42:01.134 --> 00:42:04.536]  That means they're saying 35 of them will get it.
[00:42:04.536 --> 00:42:09.379]  There are 10 to 25 times more actual cases, not possible cases, actual.
[00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:11.700]  Did you hear that?
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.341]  Than what is being reported in the media.
[00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:14.142]  This is two days ago.
[00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:27.377]  The way the judge, the way they fudge on reporting this is that it takes three days to get the confirmatory nod from the CDC to give viral culture.
[00:42:27.377 --> 00:42:34.281]  But based on epidemiological grounds, we know that there are more than 10 cases for each confirmed case right now.
[00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:35.342]  Now here's the key.
[00:42:35.342 --> 00:42:37.303]  During the night, we cross the threshold.
[00:42:37.303 --> 00:42:39.124]  This is 30 plus hours ago.
[00:42:39.124 --> 00:42:40.445]  I don't know how many hours ago is
[00:42:44.694 --> 00:42:48.057]  10 o'clock Tuesday night.
[00:42:48.057 --> 00:42:49.798]  How many hours is that?
[00:42:49.798 --> 00:42:51.359]  More than 36.
[00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:56.503]  During the night, we crossed the threshold for the definition of the World Health Organization phase 6 global pandemic.
[00:42:56.503 --> 00:42:59.185]  This has not happened in any of our lifetime so far.
[00:42:59.185 --> 00:43:00.847]  We are in uncharted territory.
[00:43:00.847 --> 00:43:02.488]  They've now announced it's a global pandemic, by the way.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.284]  I expect President Obama will declare emergency sometime in the next 72 to 96 hours.
[00:43:08.284 --> 00:43:12.248]  This may not happen, but if it does, I will be surprised if it doesn't.
[00:43:12.248 --> 00:43:15.571]  When this happens, all public gatherings will be cancelled for 10 days.
[00:43:15.571 --> 00:43:17.593]  I suggest all of us avoid public gatherings.
[00:43:17.593 --> 00:43:21.596]  Outdoor activities are not as likely to lead to infection.
[00:43:21.596 --> 00:43:22.937]  It is contained areas and
[00:43:23.618 --> 00:43:25.502]  Close contact that are the biggest risk.
[00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:25.923]  And it goes on.
[00:43:25.923 --> 00:43:32.097]  I gotta go to Tim Penney because I'm coming up on TV in a minute and I apologize to her for talking the last eight, nine minutes, but I had to put this out.
[00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:33.059]  Then Biden!
[00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:34.081]  We have this last night!
[00:43:35.148 --> 00:43:39.969]  And we're so conditioned around here that, you know, for incredible news, we don't even really do a story on it.
[00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:42.190]  There's no sleeping anymore for my crew.
[00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.190]  This is what everything we've been working towards to fight.
[00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.551]  It's now coming to a head.
[00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:50.072]  The whole world's listening to us, literally tens of millions right now.
[00:43:50.072 --> 00:43:51.372]  We are exploding right now.
[00:43:51.372 --> 00:43:52.432]  We are fighting the enemy.
[00:43:52.432 --> 00:43:53.433]  We are engaging the enemy.
[00:43:53.433 --> 00:43:56.953]  We are in the X-Wings, in the trenches, on the Death Stars.
[00:43:56.953 --> 00:43:58.734]  But right now, we are on their tail.
[00:43:59.574 --> 00:44:00.835]  And this is life and death.
[00:44:00.835 --> 00:44:12.120]  We have got to get the maximum effort and everybody has got to mirror all the stories at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because we are under unbelievable attacks confirmed right now to shut us down.
[00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:14.755]  I want to commend the team out there.
[00:44:14.755 --> 00:44:22.178]  Let's go to Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, who's done practice in Mexico and the U.S., been covering the bird flu extensively on international TV and radio.
[00:44:22.178 --> 00:44:25.239]  And, Dr. Tinpenny, you just heard that briefing I did.
[00:44:25.239 --> 00:44:31.222]  Biden confirms this and just says, look, don't get on trains, don't get in airplanes.
[00:44:31.222 --> 00:44:33.683]  And they've known this now, it turns out, for weeks.
[00:44:33.683 --> 00:44:36.324]  They're using this as a total takeover, whether it's deadly or not.
[00:44:36.324 --> 00:44:37.705]  This may be disinfo Pentagon.
[00:44:38.795 --> 00:44:48.663]  Stuff they put out to scare the locals, to create covert hype for the federalization as a cover during the economic collapse, or, and I hope that, you know, that's the lesser of two evils.
[00:44:48.663 --> 00:44:52.186]  The lesser of two weevils, as they say, in Master and Commander.
[00:44:52.186 --> 00:44:53.728]  But this could be real.
[00:44:53.728 --> 00:44:54.769]  It's clearly engineered.
[00:44:54.769 --> 00:44:57.351]  Dr. Jen Penny, go ahead.
[00:44:57.351 --> 00:45:03.656]  Wow, Alex, that's, um... It's like, what do I say after that?
[00:45:03.656 --> 00:45:04.437]  You know, it's, um...
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:19.104]  It's overwhelming, and it's hard for me to stand over here and feel kind of like the Lone Ranger and say, gosh, I can't imagine that that all is real of the way that they're saying it.
[00:45:19.104 --> 00:45:26.746]  I mean, the pandemic potential, I mean, if this was really super the way that it is, I mean, why are we seeing little spotty things here and there?
[00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:29.523]  Why aren't there tens of thousands of people already sick?
[00:45:29.523 --> 00:45:42.285]  Why is it that if the CDC says that we have 36,000 deaths per year of influenza, why is it that one child who had underlying health problems who died in South Texas, why does that make front page news?
[00:45:42.285 --> 00:45:49.627]  Why is it that, coincidentally, that the government bought $2 billion worth of Tamiflu three years ago,
[00:45:50.157 --> 00:45:56.241]  And I've been told that the Tamiflu has a three-year shelf life, and isn't it just interesting that that was three years ago when they bought that?
[00:45:56.241 --> 00:46:00.664]  Is this a way for Merck to unload their inventory of their old stuff?
[00:46:00.664 --> 00:46:09.529]  Merck is also giving 80,000 doses of pneumonia shots, of adult pneumonia shots, to Mexico, even though it's been proven in the medical literature it does nothing to ward off the flu.
[00:46:09.529 --> 00:46:12.951]  Well, everything the globalists do, doctors, is multifaceted.
[00:46:12.951 --> 00:46:18.735]  They wouldn't just do this for Merck to get the Tamiflu, but that's a fringe benefit, or a little extra goody,
[00:46:19.795 --> 00:46:21.816]  You know, a perk.
[00:46:21.816 --> 00:46:28.920]  It's clearly being used as a smoke screen for Chrysler going under, declaring bankruptcy today, everything imploding.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:43.968]  The economic numbers are just... We are descending into horrible depression right now, and so clearly they're hyping at the smoke screen that, and then Obama, you know, gives a speech last night and hardly mentions it and acts all calm as our daddy figure, but please continue.
[00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:48.150]  Well, it's just, you know, kind of coming in from all directions.
[00:46:48.883 --> 00:46:52.806]  And it's not, we're not going to know the endgame until the endgame's here.
[00:46:52.806 --> 00:46:55.988]  You know, because what you just teed up on your intro there is true.
[00:46:55.988 --> 00:47:00.631]  I mean, is this just a smokescreen or is this the real thing?
[00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:12.599]  It's hard for me to imagine that this is just absolutely the real thing with as few reported cases and as few reported deaths as we've had, that those number of deaths are smaller than the number of people killed in a car accident in a month.
[00:47:13.768 --> 00:47:21.830]  I mean, the hype and hysteria and the panic that's being kind of put out there is just beyond all rationality.
[00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.990]  No, it is an act of psychological terrorism.
[00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:28.751]  It is an act of screaming, fire in the theater.
[00:47:28.751 --> 00:47:29.991]  In a public place.
[00:47:29.991 --> 00:47:32.412]  But meanwhile, their grandstanding is the saver.
[00:47:32.412 --> 00:47:37.913]  Just like they terrorized us and said, give us the banker takeover powers or we'll have a depression and that triggered the depression.
[00:47:38.493 --> 00:47:48.844]  Even though they got their powers and things only got worse, and as they set up the Bank of the World and the World Government publicly, no one's talking about that as the G20 sets it up and they pass carbon taxes.
[00:47:48.844 --> 00:47:58.374]  I agree with you, but what if what the Feds are telling these doctors, and now Biden's confirmed it, that it's so mega deadly and that there's all these people on ventilators,
[00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:03.299]  But Alex, they said that three years ago about bird flu too.
[00:48:03.299 --> 00:48:03.639]  Remember?
[00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:06.240]  They said the exact same thing.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.681]  50% death rate.
[00:48:07.681 --> 00:48:10.202]  This is the setting it up for the next pandemic.
[00:48:10.202 --> 00:48:13.063]  It's being spread by wild geese flying around the country.
[00:48:13.063 --> 00:48:16.845]  They had people on the borders in Germany shooting down geese.
[00:48:16.845 --> 00:48:18.786]  I mean, they said the same thing three years ago.
[00:48:19.534 --> 00:48:20.134]  That's a good point.
[00:48:20.134 --> 00:48:22.154]  We need to do a story on that.
[00:48:22.154 --> 00:48:24.795]  And then I guess none of them will get in trouble when it turns out it wasn't real.
[00:48:24.795 --> 00:48:27.715]  They'll just pat themselves on the backs and make... Absolutely.
[00:48:27.715 --> 00:48:30.796]  We were better prepared this time because of what we did before.
[00:48:30.796 --> 00:48:32.556]  And thank God for Tamiflu.
[00:48:32.556 --> 00:48:39.517]  And thank God that BioShield 2 allowed us to ramp up on all of these vaccines so that we could have them all ready and handy.
[00:48:39.517 --> 00:48:41.278]  It's the same playbook, man.
[00:48:41.278 --> 00:48:46.759]  The same playbook as they did in 1976 with the swine flu, with SARS, with bird flu.
[00:48:46.759 --> 00:48:48.199]  It's the same playbook.
[00:48:48.789 --> 00:48:51.734]  Now the circumstances may be a little bit different economically, globally.
[00:48:52.076 --> 00:48:57.740]  But in terms of what they're doing, they were saying 50% death rate from H5N1, the bird flu, three years ago.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.241]  So this is no different.
[00:48:59.241 --> 00:49:00.762]  Maybe it's even the same thing now.
[00:49:00.762 --> 00:49:04.464]  Well, the only way it's different is the scare is 50 times bigger.
[00:49:04.464 --> 00:49:05.945]  I mean, this is just... Well, I don't know.
[00:49:05.945 --> 00:49:17.633]  I remember the same thing, because I was writing my book, Fowl, at that time, and I felt like I was writing it in real time, with all of the news reports that were coming out daily, this and that and this and that, and do the Tamiflu and ramping up with Roshan.
[00:49:17.633 --> 00:49:19.034]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:19.034 --> 00:49:20.255]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:27.683]  Well, I know they're certainly training us so when they do release a real bioweapon, we all do what we're told.
[00:49:27.683 --> 00:49:29.725]  This is certainly a drill for martial law.
[00:49:29.725 --> 00:49:30.886]  Well, absolutely.
[00:49:30.886 --> 00:49:33.729]  I don't disagree with that at all.
[00:49:33.729 --> 00:49:41.617]  But the hysteria and hype, and I remember it so well because I was in the middle of writing a book in real time while that was all going on.
[00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:43.963]  That it was the same sort of thing.
[00:49:43.963 --> 00:49:47.344]  They were tracking, they were setting up panels all over everywhere.
[00:49:47.344 --> 00:49:52.125]  I went to two or three, I went to the first two National Bird Flu Summits in Washington D.C.
[00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:52.866]  on my own.
[00:49:52.866 --> 00:49:56.807]  I funded myself to go to those to listen to the hype that was happening then.
[00:49:56.807 --> 00:49:59.968]  And they had people from the World Health Organization saying,
[00:50:00.819 --> 00:50:01.580]  This isn't.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.782]  Maybe it's going to happen.
[00:50:02.782 --> 00:50:03.763]  It will happen.
[00:50:03.763 --> 00:50:05.345]  And they said it repeatedly.
[00:50:05.345 --> 00:50:07.007]  And that was three years ago.
[00:50:07.007 --> 00:50:09.009]  And then they put forth all of those documents.
[00:50:09.009 --> 00:50:10.851]  And so, yes, they've ramped it up.
[00:50:10.851 --> 00:50:14.876]  Maybe this is another trial run to see that all the systems are in place.
[00:50:14.876 --> 00:50:18.321]  But it's really the hype is not that much different than it was three years ago.
[00:50:19.827 --> 00:50:21.528]  Well, I don't remember all of this.
[00:50:21.528 --> 00:50:32.271]  I don't remember them shutting down schools all around me and the Vice President... No, they didn't shut down schools, but the whole historic hysteria about not traveling... No, I understand, but I mean, the Vice President has come out.
[00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:34.231]  Dr. Ramon, come back and I'll ask you about this.
[00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:39.893]  The Vice President, in fact, John, you have that clip of the network, right?
[00:50:39.893 --> 00:50:41.574]  No, it's the Joe Biden clip.
[00:50:41.574 --> 00:50:42.134]  It's everywhere.
[00:50:43.602 --> 00:50:44.963]  Yeah, it's drudge, it's everywhere.
[00:50:44.963 --> 00:50:55.807]  I want to play Joe Biden, when we get back, it's only 20 seconds long, on national TV, saying, don't get on planes, don't get on trains, don't get on subways.
[00:50:55.807 --> 00:50:57.707]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:50:57.707 --> 00:50:59.168]  This will kill our economy.
[00:51:00.842 --> 00:51:04.364]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:51:04.364 --> 00:51:06.286]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:51:06.286 --> 00:51:11.849]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.

[00:51:49.347 --> 00:51:50.528]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:51:50.528 --> 00:51:52.088]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.045]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.045 --> 00:52:14.079]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.634 --> 00:52:21.216]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.216 --> 00:52:23.197]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.197 --> 00:52:25.698]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.698 --> 00:52:37.262]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.262 --> 00:52:38.942]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.942 --> 00:52:40.303]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.794 --> 00:52:47.699]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:55.965 --> 00:52:57.546]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.546 --> 00:53:00.668]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.668 --> 00:53:01.969]  Ah, springtime.
[00:53:01.969 --> 00:53:07.133]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[00:53:07.606 --> 00:53:12.090]  The answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:18.054]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:53:18.054 --> 00:53:26.361]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:53:26.681 --> 00:53:29.665]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:36.132]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[00:53:36.132 --> 00:53:40.517]  So pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:43.921]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas,
[00:53:44.261 --> 00:53:44.821]  I think so.
[00:54:14.595 --> 00:54:31.447]  Well, I hope Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is right.
[00:54:31.447 --> 00:54:38.712]  I hope these criminals are just hyping all of this fear as a political smokescreen and to sell tens of billions of dollars worth of vaccines and drugs.
[00:54:38.712 --> 00:54:40.173]  That's bad enough.
[00:54:40.173 --> 00:54:41.194]  I hope it isn't real.
[00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:47.720]  I hope that it doesn't spread with 40-50% infections.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.201]  But I know they compartmentalize doctors and fearmonger them.
[00:54:50.201 --> 00:54:53.863]  I've caught the feds doing this many times in the past.
[00:54:53.863 --> 00:54:58.325]  But Dr. Sherry Timpani, I wanted to ask you about the Royal Society Academy of Medical
[00:54:59.386 --> 00:55:10.795]  Uh, Sciences document, April 27, 2006, tied in with the very vaccine makers that claim they've already got a vaccine for this, by the way, Novavax and others.
[00:55:10.795 --> 00:55:13.698]  It says, uh, use of live vaccines.
[00:55:13.698 --> 00:55:22.044]  Dr. Wood and Robertson were asked their opinion of priming the population for a pandemic using live vaccines and if they consider it to be a good idea.
[00:55:22.987 --> 00:55:24.568]  However, the timing is critical.
[00:55:24.568 --> 00:55:29.131]  Live H5N1 vaccines are used now.
[00:55:29.131 --> 00:55:33.214]  It would be considered too dangerous, but if a pandemic is imminent, the risk may be justified.
[00:55:33.214 --> 00:55:41.479]  A stockpile of live vaccine, with the cleavage site removed, could be used to prime the population in advance of the pandemic reaching the UK.
[00:55:41.479 --> 00:55:43.620]  What does that mean?
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:49.484]  Well, it's the live virus vaccine, the flu shots that are out there are manufactured by FluMist.
[00:55:50.379 --> 00:55:57.843]  That's the intranasal injection of the flu vaccine as opposed to an injection with the other shots.
[00:55:57.843 --> 00:56:11.091]  There were several reports that came out over the last year or so about that they were going to try using the H5N1 in flu mist, an attenuated form of it or a weakened form of it, to try to get it out into the population more.
[00:56:11.519 --> 00:56:14.561]  So, they've been trying to do that all along.
[00:56:14.561 --> 00:56:15.362]  What does the primer mean?
[00:56:15.362 --> 00:56:25.030]  The thing is, Alex, is of them being able to come up with a flu vaccine a lot quicker, the cell line technologies are able to harvest within six to eight weeks.
[00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:29.193]  So, I don't know if any of those factories are up in production yet in the U.S.
[00:56:29.193 --> 00:56:30.374]  They might be in Germany.
[00:56:30.374 --> 00:56:32.916]  No, Novavax, I have their press release.
[00:56:32.916 --> 00:56:35.758]  They say they now have a vaccine for this very flu.
[00:56:35.758 --> 00:56:39.021]  Well, then they're using cell line technology, which means that they're using
[00:56:39.406 --> 00:56:41.328]  Yeah, I've got their press release.
[00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:42.870]  We'll cover it later.
[00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:43.490]  Where are you now?
[00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.572]  I know you're back in the United States, doctor.
[00:56:56.997 --> 00:56:58.298]  Yep, I'm in San Antonio.
[00:56:58.298 --> 00:56:59.898]  We were heading out today.
[00:56:59.898 --> 00:57:07.641]  We're going down to Houston, and then I'm going to California, and my husband's going to Ohio.
[00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:11.703]  What you said at the close of that last segment, Alex, I think is really important.
[00:57:11.703 --> 00:57:20.787]  When you said that if Biden is saying, don't get on trains, don't get on airplanes, don't get on buses, part of this may be the last final implosion of the American economy.
[00:57:21.209 --> 00:57:23.231]  Because I said that as I was leaving Mexico.
[00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:27.994]  They showed scenes of these big mega hotels on the beaches that were empty and empty beaches.
[00:57:27.994 --> 00:57:33.358]  No, that, I mean, if our economy's on the verge of dying, this will kill everything, this will be what pushes us under.
[00:57:33.358 --> 00:57:35.660]  Let's play that clip right now, get your final comment.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.000]  Here we go.
[00:57:37.023 --> 00:57:42.366]  I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now.
[00:57:42.366 --> 00:57:48.970]  It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft, when one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.
[00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:49.950]  That's me.
[00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:56.494]  I would not be at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway.
[00:57:56.494 --> 00:57:59.936]  So, from my perspective, what it relates to is mitigation.
[00:58:00.576 --> 00:58:03.859]  If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing.
[00:58:03.859 --> 00:58:10.303]  If you're in a closed aircraft, a closed container, a closed car, a closed classroom, it's a different thing.
[00:58:10.303 --> 00:58:14.206]  Alright, Dr. Sherry Timpenny, so that will be the final nail in our coffin.
[00:58:14.206 --> 00:58:19.690]  And I guess the bankers get to come in with all the trillions of bailout money they're hoarding and buy up what's left.
[00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:21.271]  That sounds like the plan, Alex.
[00:58:22.904 --> 00:58:24.225]  Oh, but they're elites in power.
[00:58:24.225 --> 00:58:25.065]  They're not ruthless.
[00:58:25.065 --> 00:58:26.846]  They're not into getting more power.
[00:58:26.846 --> 00:58:27.907]  You know, we can trust them.
[00:58:27.907 --> 00:58:29.268]  They actually care about us.
[00:58:29.268 --> 00:58:32.649]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, we've got your website linked up at Infowars.com.
[00:58:32.649 --> 00:58:33.910]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.291]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:36.051]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:58:36.051 --> 00:58:36.531]  Take care.
[00:58:36.531 --> 00:58:36.692]  Bye-bye.
[00:58:36.692 --> 00:58:36.892]  You bet.
[00:58:36.892 --> 00:58:39.893]  Alright, I'm going to be simulcasting on foreign TV stations.
[00:58:39.893 --> 00:58:42.515]  Get ready.
[00:58:42.515 --> 00:58:45.136]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.626 --> 00:58:52.307]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.307 --> 00:58:57.048]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.048 --> 00:58:59.990]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:03.051]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.051 --> 00:59:08.893]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.113 --> 00:59:12.356]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.356 --> 00:59:19.363]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.363 --> 00:59:22.646]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:40.866 --> 00:59:42.868]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.419 --> 00:59:55.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:05.025]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.025 --> 01:00:06.345]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.345 --> 01:00:08.106]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:09.867]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.448]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:12.388]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.388 --> 01:00:17.191]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.191 --> 01:00:19.532]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.413 --> 01:00:21.454]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.454 --> 01:00:25.258]  We've got Wayne Madsen at work with the National Security Agency.
[01:00:25.258 --> 01:00:32.406]  He reports on intelligence agencies as a reporter for major publications in Washington, D.C.
[01:00:32.406 --> 01:00:34.088]  He's on international television.
[01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:41.757]  Russia Today and others have said that the scientific evidence he has is that it is an engineered bioweapon.
[01:00:41.757 --> 01:00:44.219]  That's what our medical sources are saying as well.
[01:00:44.219 --> 01:00:47.002]  He's joining us in T-minus two hours.
[01:00:47.002 --> 01:00:48.763]  Lindsey Williams in the next hour.
[01:00:48.763 --> 01:00:49.484]  Any minute now.
[01:00:49.484 --> 01:00:50.785]  We're already connected.
[01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:51.706]  I'm going to be going on...
[01:00:52.947 --> 01:00:59.329]  International press TV all over the world, which is basically Iranian television.
[01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:04.890]  It's similar to what the Saudis have with Al Jazeera, and seen by millions of people.
[01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:14.013]  So we're going to be simulcasting with them as they ask my take on what's happening with the so-called swine flu, this genetically engineered two-bird viruses.
[01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:34.278]  Pig virus and human virus all spliced together with the genetic markers that it's been engineered that is coming up So they'll be popping in in a moment getting ready for the interview and I'll turn things over to them as we multitask Here and do this and in fact go ahead and put me through audio wise to the folks at press TV Press TV.
[01:01:34.278 --> 01:01:35.078]  Are you there?
[01:01:35.078 --> 01:01:36.419]  I'm ready.
[01:01:36.419 --> 01:01:37.999]  When does the interview start in the next four minutes?
[01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:42.437]  Yes.
[01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:43.338]  Mr. Jones?
[01:01:43.338 --> 01:01:44.320]  Yes, how are you doing?
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.641]  This is Tanya talking with you.
[01:01:45.641 --> 01:01:46.442]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:46.442 --> 01:01:48.505]  And finally, I could get hold of you.
[01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:53.271]  You were so hard to get, you know, to be in our show.
[01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:56.415]  It was really great and we are so willing to have you with us.
[01:01:56.795 --> 01:02:05.683]  You know, we are going to start at about, you know, in four minutes, and just we have got the news brief, and after the news brief, you're going to start.
[01:02:05.683 --> 01:02:14.151]  And I have got Dr. Mike Skinner, the Senior Lecturer in Virology, Imperial College London, and you.
[01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:15.452]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:02:15.452 --> 01:02:18.975]  I look forward to going on the show with him.
[01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:19.916]  Thank you.
[01:02:19.916 --> 01:02:22.959]  And something else, Mr. Jones, can you hear the studio right now?
[01:02:28.752 --> 01:02:31.292]  I passed you through the studio.
[01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.113]  If you could hear, please let me know.
[01:02:33.113 --> 01:02:34.673]  Yes, I heard it for a moment.
[01:02:34.673 --> 01:02:36.473]  Go ahead and test it again.
[01:02:36.473 --> 01:02:38.294]  Okay, I will do it for 30 seconds.
[01:02:38.294 --> 01:02:40.594]  Okay, hang on.
[01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:49.496]  Even though shadowed with a spark of controversy, the meetings between Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso and his counterpart went just for 50 seconds.
[01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:50.796]  Excellent, excellent.
[01:02:50.796 --> 01:02:51.856]  Sounds good.
[01:02:51.856 --> 01:02:52.916]  Thank you very much.
[01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:55.277]  The producer, Kusha, is going to talk with you.
[01:02:55.277 --> 01:02:56.337]  Hold a moment, please.
[01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:56.697]  Thank you.
[01:03:02.188 --> 01:03:03.229]  Hi Alex, this is Kousha, how are you?
[01:03:03.229 --> 01:03:03.449]  Okay, great.
[01:03:03.449 --> 01:03:06.572]  So just give us a little bit of time, just a few minutes, we're going to get to you.
[01:03:06.572 --> 01:03:09.194]  So you're making a show out of our show and we're making a show out of your show.
[01:03:09.194 --> 01:03:09.414]  Great.
[01:03:22.526 --> 01:03:32.799]  Yeah, well we've asked in the past and they said it was fine when I couldn't come down, I couldn't break away to go to the TV studio, but in the future if I get more of a warning I can do it so I can get a guest host.
[01:03:32.799 --> 01:03:33.480]  Absolutely.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:40.769]  So the other guest, he's a professor at the Imperial College in London and he's strictly a scientist, so just keep that in mind.
[01:03:41.209 --> 01:03:41.950]  No, no, fantastic.
[01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.352]  I'll try not to beat him up too bad.
[01:03:44.352 --> 01:03:47.054]  Hey guys, will you Google this guy's name, give me his bio.
[01:03:47.054 --> 01:03:48.475]  Mike Skinner.
[01:03:48.475 --> 01:03:50.096]  Dr. Mike Skinner.
[01:03:50.096 --> 01:03:54.140]  Dr. Mike Skinner, and he's the University of?
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.001]  Imperial College in London.
[01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:59.765]  Imperial College, but there is no British Empire.
[01:03:59.765 --> 01:04:03.147]  Okay, well listen, I appreciate you guys coming on.
[01:04:03.147 --> 01:04:04.429]  I apologize I couldn't come down.
[01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:15.344]  To the satellite studio, but I am here and I'm just going to throw it to your feed and I will be here interviewed by you and thank you so much for having me on.
[01:04:15.344 --> 01:04:16.085]  Okay, right on.
[01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.267]  Looking forward to it.
[01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:18.188]  Thank you.
[01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:18.489]  Bye bye.
[01:04:20.677 --> 01:04:23.839]  They're going to send us their feed here in just a moment.
[01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:26.760]  And we'll get rolling.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.882]  There can be complications with each national visit.
[01:04:29.882 --> 01:04:43.568]  Sometimes it will greatly improve bilateral relations if it's successful, but other times, because some Japanese still feel hostility towards China and vice versa, they'll act out against efforts to improve the relationship around that visit.
[01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:50.916]  Hey guys, Google me the Indonesian president saying it's a bio-weapon.
[01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:52.357]  I can't find it in my stack.
[01:05:08.055 --> 01:05:16.666]  It was also his third meeting with Chinese state leaders in a month, following his meetings with President Hu Jintao in London and with Wen Jiabao in Thailand.
[01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:19.950]  Kathleen Chang, PressTV Beijing.
[01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.833]  And with that we come to an end of the Summer of the World News here on PressTV.
[01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:25.917]  Visit our website PressTV.in for more information on these stories.
[01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:26.257]  Bye for now.
[01:06:00.452 --> 01:06:01.189]  Go silent running.
[01:06:38.135 --> 01:06:38.496]  Yeah.
[01:06:54.002 --> 01:07:06.129]  World countries are scrambling to contain a rapidly expanding swine flu case that's assumed pandemic proportions, according to the World Health Organization, WHO.
[01:07:06.129 --> 01:07:17.515]  The first cases were recorded in Mexico earlier in April, when a new strain of swine-based influenza virus was reported breaking out, taking an initial few lives.
[01:07:18.055 --> 01:07:24.879]  The actual outbreak of the killer disease, however, is believed to have started in March 2009.
[01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:39.088]  Whatever the case, on April 29th, and in an emergency meeting of the WHO, a pandemic alert status of 5 was announced for the spread, calling it an imminent threat to everyone in the world.
[01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:45.112]  By April 28th, the mutated flu virus was confirmed to have spread to the United States,
[01:07:45.572 --> 01:07:50.394]  The United Kingdom, continental Europe, and as far away as New Zealand.
[01:07:50.394 --> 01:07:56.637]  As of April 30th, the number of countries with suspected cases stands at 41.
[01:07:56.637 --> 01:08:05.361]  While there is no vaccine available at the moment for the disease and measures to come up with one... We are simulcasting with international television listeners.
[01:08:05.361 --> 01:08:06.962]  We're throwing it over to them.
[01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:14.065]  ...the situation is far too grave to be contained and immediate steps should be taken to confront the epidemic.
[01:08:14.725 --> 01:08:30.459]  So, Four Corners asks, if the threat is as serious as it is portrayed in the media, what are the socioeconomic costs involved, and whether the global media are doing justice to the issue by inducing a controlled panic?
[01:09:14.935 --> 01:09:21.318]  Hello and welcome to tonight's edition of Four Corners here on Press TV with me, Joubin Zarbon.
[01:09:21.318 --> 01:09:24.779]  The topic of our discussion is swine flu.
[01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:28.340]  How big and real is the threat?
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.861]  Joining me is an interesting panel of guests.
[01:09:30.861 --> 01:09:34.303]  From London we have Dr. Mike Skinner.
[01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:40.145]  He's a senior lecturer in virology from the Imperial College of London.
[01:09:41.516 --> 01:09:45.719]  From Austin, Texas though, on the phone we're joined by Alex Jones.
[01:09:45.719 --> 01:09:55.645]  He's a documentary filmmaker, an investigative journalist, and a syndicated radio talk show host, coming from InfoWars.com.
[01:09:55.645 --> 01:09:57.506]  It's good to have you both, gentlemen.
[01:09:57.506 --> 01:10:00.788]  Now, let me come to you first, Dr. Skinner in London.
[01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:05.371]  Now, tell me about the severity, the magnitude of this medical problem.
[01:10:05.371 --> 01:10:09.274]  How deadly is this virus, and how real of a threat?
[01:10:11.653 --> 01:10:15.815]  We don't yet know how deadly it is.
[01:10:15.815 --> 01:10:35.624]  We really have so relatively few cases outside of Mexico at the moment, which have been documented and well documented, whereas the situation in Mexico is unclear, simply because it being the point of outbreak, of course, it's likely that many cases
[01:10:36.264 --> 01:10:56.544]  Occurred and were maybe relatively mild before we realized that we were dealing with a potential pandemic situation So because of that it's not clear how severe this disease is going to be in terms of its mortality Its ability to spread seems fairly self-evident
[01:10:57.519 --> 01:11:09.288]  Although even there we need to know more information and that will become apparent in the coming days and weeks as we see how much is spread in the countries where it has been introduced.
[01:11:09.949 --> 01:11:24.777]  I'm obviously not a medical expert nor a scientist, but then what happened in a matter of a few days that the WHO raised the alert status bar a couple of degrees higher from level or phase 2 to phase 5?
[01:11:24.777 --> 01:11:27.559]  There must be some clear and evident reason for that?
[01:11:29.501 --> 01:11:33.102]  There are criteria for each of the stages.
[01:11:33.102 --> 01:11:41.325]  What you have to remember is that here when we talk about a pandemic, the main definition is its ability to spread.
[01:11:41.325 --> 01:11:48.988]  It's not definitely tied in with the disease that it causes.
[01:11:48.988 --> 01:11:49.908]  And in this case,
[01:11:50.588 --> 01:12:11.514]  It was shown to move up to five, which occurred last night, required evidence of sustained transmission in two countries in one region, and Mexico and US, the situation there, qualified to raise it up to five.
[01:12:11.514 --> 01:12:17.336]  And Alex Jones, now tell me about the immediate dimensions to this issue.
[01:12:17.336 --> 01:12:19.317]  Now, have, in your sense,
[01:12:20.527 --> 01:12:26.614]  The issue of the threat has been blown out of proportion, exaggerated in some sort?
[01:12:28.035 --> 01:12:33.038]  Well, we're not sure at this time, and I agree with much of what the doctor just said.
[01:12:33.038 --> 01:12:41.663]  I've interviewed six different doctors, several virologists, myself since last Friday when we began covering this in earnest, and here's what we know.
[01:12:41.663 --> 01:12:56.271]  35,000 Americans die on average a year, as many Mexicans die of just the normal seasonal flus that come from the east, and then we have the flu season that just ended a month ago, so it's very rare to have a new flu
[01:12:57.091 --> 01:13:01.075]  This time of year, coming out of the Western Hemisphere.
[01:13:01.075 --> 01:13:08.542]  Then we even have the fact that it's multiple bird RNA, human RNA, pig RNA.
[01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:10.584]  They're saying some other RNA in there.
[01:13:10.584 --> 01:13:16.969]  A lot of bioweapons experts and others are in the international media saying this looks like a designer virus.
[01:13:16.969 --> 01:13:22.034]  Wayne Madsen, who worked with the National Security Agency, has been in the press interviewing members of
[01:13:24.128 --> 01:13:29.193]  Who have degrees in virology, doctorates saying it looks like it's engineered.
[01:13:29.193 --> 01:13:30.594]  So later I would like to ask the doctor that.
[01:13:30.594 --> 01:13:32.076]  But let me get this out to people.
[01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:47.289]  I'm in Texas and just south of me is where they had the first Texas outbreaks and I know high-level school administrators, known to me personally, who yesterday gave me secret documents reporting that they're really at a level six.
[01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.451]  Now they told me
[01:13:49.031 --> 01:13:50.273]  I mean, I hope this isn't a deadly virus.
[01:13:50.273 --> 01:13:52.596]  I hope it doesn't have 40 to 50 percent infection rate.
[01:14:05.172 --> 01:14:07.435]  Uh, people that, uh, come in contact with it.
[01:14:07.435 --> 01:14:10.558]  In fact, they have the terms here, uh, in the, uh, document.
[01:14:10.558 --> 01:14:13.762]  The clinical attack rate is 40 to 50 percent.
[01:14:13.762 --> 01:14:19.147]  They're saying people are really on ventilators, uh, all over Texas, and that it's, uh, far worse.
[01:14:19.147 --> 01:14:23.092]  So Biden's saying don't get on, uh, planes, don't get on subways.
[01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:26.816]  The vice president is basically saying what this secret document
[01:14:27.316 --> 01:14:30.479]  Alright, now back to you in London, Dr. Skinner.
[01:14:30.479 --> 01:14:33.501]  Now, the other guest was purporting that there is an engineered crisis
[01:14:52.586 --> 01:15:03.649]  In the offing, that this virus just might happen to be a syncretic and synthetically made virus and the outbreak as well.
[01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:10.671]  Now, do you have any scientific argument to rebut that or debunk that?
[01:15:10.671 --> 01:15:13.532]  I don't think you need particularly a scientific argument.
[01:15:13.532 --> 01:15:19.234]  It's well known that flu changes, mutates from year to year.
[01:15:19.804 --> 01:15:20.544]  I don't know.
[01:15:40.112 --> 01:15:41.512]  That we're at now.
[01:15:41.512 --> 01:15:51.755]  And one has to say, and let's face it, the same argument was made many years ago about the origins of HIV, that it was a genetically engineered virus.
[01:15:51.755 --> 01:16:04.858]  And in both cases, you have to say that given that we don't really understand the pathogenicity of this present virus, how pathogenic it will be, what might contribute to its particular nature,
[01:16:06.698 --> 01:16:14.903]  Well, Dr. Skinner, with great respect, I beg to differ, Dr. Skinner, and this is still keeping with you now.
[01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:20.506]  Now, is it not true that in the past, 30-odd years ago, there was this hope of
[01:16:22.067 --> 01:16:37.272]  Uh, the flu scare in the States, I suppose it was in 1976, and this, in all intellectual rigor, brings in the question that some people put to you guys, as scientists, that how trustable are these procedures... Yeah, I'd like to comment.
[01:16:37.272 --> 01:16:43.354]  Logically speaking, in terms of identifying, determining an epidemic.
[01:16:43.354 --> 01:16:45.015]  Well, I would like... Sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:45.015 --> 01:16:47.976]  The scientific procedures that you are all familiar with, I mean,
[01:16:49.093 --> 01:16:52.419]  Well, I mean, we know governments have engineered bioweapons.
[01:16:52.419 --> 01:16:52.820]  We know about...
[01:17:00.054 --> 01:17:02.796]  I'm sorry, can you place your question again?
[01:17:02.796 --> 01:17:15.126]  The question was, in the past, in 1976, the American authorities clearly bungled up a crisis of sorts, in terms of saying to the people that there is a pandemic of flu, and then it turned out to be mistaken.
[01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:15.867]  It was a hoax!
[01:17:15.867 --> 01:17:19.630]  Scientifically, that it won't be the case this time around.
[01:17:22.356 --> 01:17:24.177]  We would be pleased if it were.
[01:17:24.177 --> 01:17:42.662]  What happened, I think you remember, and it was many years ago, even in my scientific career, was that in 1976, they discovered, again, a swine flu in the U.S., and that seemed to be causing problems.
[01:17:42.662 --> 01:17:46.683]  It came out of an army camp, and I don't think there was any... It always does.
[01:17:46.683 --> 01:17:48.363]  I'd like to comment on this.
[01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:49.384]  It was an army camp.
[01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.856]  Well, let me hold you there, Doc.
[01:17:52.856 --> 01:17:55.258]  I'm going to get back to you in just a bit.
[01:17:55.258 --> 01:17:57.660]  Alex Jones, you had something to say.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.280]  Go ahead.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:58.961]  Jump in.
[01:17:58.961 --> 01:17:59.941]  Yes.
[01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:02.083]  We are up on the swine flu epidemic.
[01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:04.645]  We have the government fear-mongering ads.
[01:18:04.645 --> 01:18:08.368]  They ran on TV, posted up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:10.550]  They said it was going to kill millions.
[01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:12.592]  They said they had to vaccinate the entire American people.
[01:18:12.592 --> 01:18:13.672]  Gerald Ford did.
[01:18:13.672 --> 01:18:18.176]  And then the vaccine started killing so many people, giving them autoimmune disease and killing them.
[01:18:18.176 --> 01:18:19.057]  They had to stop it.
[01:18:19.057 --> 01:18:20.058]  Just like bird flu,
[01:18:20.798 --> 01:18:26.064]  Uh, trials they just had this year and last year in Europe had to get suspended because it killed so many people.
[01:18:26.064 --> 01:18:30.589]  London Telegraph, BBC, uh, French News Agency have all reported that.
[01:18:30.589 --> 01:18:34.994]  We had black men given syphilis and allowed to die over 45 years in Alabama.
[01:18:34.994 --> 01:18:36.756]  We had 4,000 plus U.S.
[01:18:36.756 --> 01:18:40.861]  foster children taken from their parents and radiated to death in secret tests.
[01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:44.223]  The first, in 1918, broke out at a U.S.
[01:18:44.223 --> 01:18:46.644]  military base as part of a vaccination program.
[01:18:46.644 --> 01:18:48.165]  I have that from the Boston Globe.
[01:18:48.165 --> 01:18:48.645]  Cicero, 1918.
[01:18:48.645 --> 01:18:53.127]  I have all of these documents.
[01:18:53.127 --> 01:19:05.874]  The last swine flu in 1918, I meant to say, and then the last swine flu in 1976 broke out there at a military base.
[01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.735]  So it's the same thing over and over and over again.
[01:19:07.735 --> 01:19:09.035]  I'm saying we have to look.
[01:19:11.097 --> 01:19:13.560]  Stop there for a second.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:20.991]  I'd like you to elaborate for viewership the evidence, the proof that you have so gathered to back up your argument.
[01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:22.613]  Where are they from?
[01:19:22.613 --> 01:19:23.434]  Let me be clear.
[01:19:23.434 --> 01:19:25.377]  I'm not saying this is a government attack.
[01:19:25.857 --> 01:19:27.938]  I'm not saying that we know that right now.
[01:19:27.938 --> 01:19:34.942]  It could be a real mutated flu like he just said, but it's the fact that it came out of nowhere and they weren't tracking anything similar to it.
[01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:37.484]  As he said, it would take years for it to mutate like this.
[01:19:37.484 --> 01:19:39.425]  This just came screaming out of nowhere.
[01:19:39.425 --> 01:19:46.009]  The only place we see something similar to this is in the hundreds of big biotech labs where they're basically cloning.
[01:19:46.009 --> 01:19:48.770]  Let me get back to you in a little while.
[01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:50.711]  Let's talk again to you.
[01:19:50.711 --> 01:19:51.932]  It's the vaccine labs.
[01:19:51.932 --> 01:19:53.073]  It's where it probably came from.
[01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:59.335]  You need to help me out with the political and socio-economic dimensions to this crisis.
[01:19:59.335 --> 01:20:00.238]  How big is that?
[01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:09.355]  No, I can't say that's in my area of expertise.
[01:20:09.355 --> 01:20:24.508]  You're seeing, I think, generally a reasonable approach around the world that have been caused to clamp down completely on air travel and I think the respondents have generally been responsible.
[01:20:24.508 --> 01:20:25.389]  We've recognised that
[01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:42.368]  That would be counterproductive and I think most countries are taking quite a rational approach to try and control the focal introductions of the virus into their countries to try and stop it spreading, to building into
[01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:44.891]  A large epidemic.
[01:20:44.891 --> 01:21:00.609]  At the moment we have the benefit of the time of the year, at least in the northern hemisphere, where it's not the time of year we would expect seasonal flu to normally to spread well and we can hope that with careful control of the
[01:21:01.049 --> 01:21:04.074]  Dr. Skinner, how long before we actually get there do you think?
[01:21:04.074 --> 01:21:07.479]  Your prediction is that we can contain it, if not confront it?
[01:21:17.076 --> 01:21:20.219]  Predictions, I don't think one can be into that kind of a game.
[01:21:20.219 --> 01:21:21.941]  We don't know enough about it.
[01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:25.084]  And a lot of what's going to happen is stochastic.
[01:21:25.084 --> 01:21:25.945]  It's down to chance.
[01:21:25.945 --> 01:21:27.567]  Well, it's worldwide already.
[01:21:27.567 --> 01:21:29.509]  I mean, it's already spreading everywhere.
[01:21:29.509 --> 01:21:34.534]  I think we have a good chance to limit it.
[01:21:34.534 --> 01:21:38.418]  It's not rushing out of control in some of the European countries.
[01:21:39.739 --> 01:21:42.220]  It's been introduced.
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:46.223]  It can go wrong and we have to be on top of it.
[01:21:46.223 --> 01:21:49.344]  This is why people do need to know what's happening.
[01:21:49.344 --> 01:21:52.826]  I think a lot of the reporting has been pretty responsible.
[01:21:52.826 --> 01:21:56.288]  People need to know that there is this threat.
[01:21:56.288 --> 01:22:05.413]  If they have been to areas where they might have been exposed to the virus, then they need to know that if they come up with appropriate symptoms, they need to alert the authorities.
[01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:21.836]  Well, I mean if this isn't a big... Tell me about the ramifications, political ones, and specifically the impact that this crisis will have on global trade, on the back of a huge slump in world economy.
[01:22:22.481 --> 01:22:24.522]  Okay, our governments are not stupid.
[01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:41.211]  The Mexican government knows, quote, shutting down all its resorts, telling Americans and Europeans to leave, uh, shutting down their government, uh, you know, their actions say that they think this is really bad, but then they say everything's fine, everything's wonderful, we're just shutting our whole country down.
[01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:43.952]  You know, they normally have 20 plus thousand or more die of flu.
[01:22:45.658 --> 01:22:49.520]  Second, uh, for you guys to, uh, check, uh, sound and audio quality.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:55.584]  But, uh, if I could, uh, uh, move on with another domain.
[01:22:55.584 --> 01:22:57.765]  Okay, but I mean, this will destroy our economy.
[01:22:57.765 --> 01:22:59.526]  The government is destroying our economy.
[01:22:59.526 --> 01:23:00.086]  Can you hear me?
[01:23:00.086 --> 01:23:04.509]  Because you asked a question and now you're, you're, uh, you're choppy.
[01:23:04.509 --> 01:23:04.929]  Dr. Jones.
[01:23:08.228 --> 01:23:14.433]  Okay, you are not in here right now because there is another, uh, maybe phone line or we can hear other sounds.
[01:23:14.433 --> 01:23:16.214]  Maybe for another show, whatever.
[01:23:16.214 --> 01:23:23.079]  Yeah, well that's not us, uh, so, uh, yeah, I mean, there's also feedback from your line.
[01:23:23.079 --> 01:23:26.241]  Okay, oh, oh, maybe you have got a TV out there, yeah?
[01:23:26.241 --> 01:23:29.183]  No, no, we're not sending any audio out or down.
[01:23:29.183 --> 01:23:35.988]  You guys have got a, you guys have got a feedback loop, uh, you're feeding me too much of your audio.
[01:23:35.988 --> 01:23:37.109]  So, so, yes.
[01:23:38.194 --> 01:23:49.477]  Okay, Jess, I want to fix it.
[01:23:49.477 --> 01:23:50.697]  This is Real Radio, folks.
[01:23:50.697 --> 01:23:51.817]  Doesn't get any more real than this.
[01:23:51.817 --> 01:23:58.859]  Man, we're about to go back live on our main transmission here, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWars.com and on the MNFM stations.
[01:23:58.859 --> 01:23:59.219]  Here we go.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:07.683]  If you have got TV out there and you somehow, the sound is really off.
[01:24:07.683 --> 01:24:09.764]  No ma'am, no ma'am, no ma'am.
[01:24:09.764 --> 01:24:11.325]  We have nothing being fed.
[01:24:11.325 --> 01:24:16.088]  You have a phone line to your studios in England, correct?
[01:24:16.088 --> 01:24:18.549]  And we are not sending anything down.
[01:24:18.549 --> 01:24:22.951]  Your guys are sending too much audio into your board to myself.
[01:24:22.951 --> 01:24:25.173]  Yes, you're hearing your feedback.
[01:24:25.173 --> 01:24:27.114]  I turned it down, alright?
[01:24:27.114 --> 01:24:29.475]  Okay, I'm ready to roll or is the interview done?
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.342]  Yeah, great!
[01:24:33.342 --> 01:24:35.263]  ...will be for all of us, we don't yet know.
[01:24:35.263 --> 01:24:43.068]  Um, so it, it, you know, what happens, um, it, we can't expect it to die.
[01:24:43.068 --> 01:24:52.255]  People die from the flu, and more people will be infected by it.
[01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:59.860]  In 2006, we had another epidemic, and it was like a burst of avian typhus.
[01:25:00.419 --> 01:25:04.542]  And, uh, I'd like to ask you, how do you assess the response of the public?
[01:25:09.631 --> 01:25:13.133]  All right, again, I'm hooked up with Iranian television internationally.
[01:25:13.133 --> 01:25:15.294]  They've got the British scientist on there.
[01:25:15.294 --> 01:25:22.038]  And just to let the Iranian TV know, I am getting the British audio from that studio.
[01:25:22.038 --> 01:25:24.399]  I am not getting your presenter.
[01:25:24.399 --> 01:25:26.660]  Mr. Jones, I'm awfully sorry.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.821]  We are about to finish the show.
[01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:29.242]  No, I know.
[01:25:29.242 --> 01:25:29.962]  I understand.
[01:25:29.962 --> 01:25:33.424]  So the lines were so bad, we somehow cut it off.
[01:25:33.424 --> 01:25:33.804]  I understand.
[01:25:33.804 --> 01:25:34.545]  But you were so great.
[01:25:34.545 --> 01:25:35.365]  Thank you very much.
[01:25:35.365 --> 01:25:37.166]  I wish you'd have again our show.
[01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:38.887]  But the rest of you will be very great.
[01:25:39.147 --> 01:25:40.008]  Yeah, fantastic.
[01:25:40.008 --> 01:25:42.189]  Yeah, next time I'll come down and do it on a satellite feed.
[01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:43.910]  Okay, thank you.
[01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:44.350]  Take care.
[01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:45.611]  Talk to you soon.
[01:25:45.611 --> 01:25:47.352]  All right, let them go.
[01:25:47.352 --> 01:25:48.993]  Oh, man.
[01:25:48.993 --> 01:25:53.176]  Yeah, what was happening was they were either feeding something down the line there.
[01:25:53.176 --> 01:25:57.799]  You could hear that echo, that, you know, that was a feedback sound the whole time.
[01:25:57.799 --> 01:25:59.159]  And then the line was going down.
[01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:00.480]  I wonder why.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.461]  But yeah, that goes into Africa, all over.
[01:26:04.682 --> 01:26:07.123]  All over the Middle East, all over Central Asia.
[01:26:07.123 --> 01:26:08.463]  That is a big channel.
[01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:11.284]  I've been on there probably 12, 13 times, 14 times.
[01:26:11.284 --> 01:26:12.604]  It's quite a few.
[01:26:12.604 --> 01:26:15.145]  They wanted me down there in studio with them today, but I just couldn't do it.
[01:26:15.145 --> 01:26:16.985]  I didn't want to leave the radio audience.
[01:26:16.985 --> 01:26:22.067]  We are simulcasting now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:26:22.067 --> 01:26:26.088]  And I believe that's the Iranians calling back.
[01:26:28.243 --> 01:26:30.845]  Anyways, interesting radio there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:30.845 --> 01:26:38.770]  You know, there's that British scientist saying, oh no, it's, you know, no big deal, this virus probably developed in the last ten years.
[01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:44.773]  Yes, and they tracked the thousands of different viruses, that's what they do, and nothing ever looked anything like this.
[01:26:44.773 --> 01:26:50.337]  This is the kind of stuff they admit, though, they've been testing in labs and creating, splicing all these things together.
[01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:56.056]  And they fear-mongered with the swine flu in 76.
[01:26:56.056 --> 01:26:57.396]  That came out of a military base.
[01:26:57.396 --> 01:27:01.977]  They fear-mongered with the 1918 that did kill over 40 million people that came out of a military base in the U.S.
[01:27:01.977 --> 01:27:04.358]  It always does, inside job.
[01:27:04.358 --> 01:27:10.640]  And meanwhile, Mexico's shutting down all their trade, many of their cities, their whole government's shutting down.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.521]  And they say, oh, but it's no big deal, seven people died.
[01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:16.042]  They're doing this for seven people?
[01:27:16.042 --> 01:27:18.223]  They say, oh, hundreds haven't died, like the U.S.
[01:27:18.223 --> 01:27:18.723]  media is saying.
[01:27:19.682 --> 01:27:20.903]  Only a few have.
[01:27:20.903 --> 01:27:24.664]  And then Joe Biden, everybody say, oh it's no big deal, one kid died from Mexico in the U.S.
[01:27:24.664 --> 01:27:27.026]  No big deal, but don't fly on planes.
[01:27:27.026 --> 01:27:28.386]  Don't get on trains.
[01:27:28.386 --> 01:27:30.547]  Don't get on subways.
[01:27:30.547 --> 01:27:31.728]  So it's these mixed signals.
[01:27:31.728 --> 01:27:34.009]  They fear monger and then say everything's okay.
[01:27:34.009 --> 01:27:35.170]  Everything's alright.
[01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:37.691]  And then I just read to you the bombshell documents.
[01:27:38.877 --> 01:27:43.539]  And maybe none of my audio was even getting good to him, because he kept interrupting me when I would just start talking for a few seconds.
[01:27:43.539 --> 01:27:45.440]  We'll see, though, in the press TV video later.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.282]  Somebody needs to grab that and throw it up on YouTube.
[01:27:48.282 --> 01:27:49.742]  But what a three-ring circus.
[01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:51.003]  We'll get that going again.
[01:27:52.190 --> 01:28:02.759]  Okay, I've got a bunch of guests coming up, and I do have some time in this hour before Lindsey Williams joins us, and we're talking about flu, the economy.
[01:28:02.759 --> 01:28:04.040]  What is this going to do to the economy?
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.302]  And he was asking me, what is this going to do to the economy?
[01:28:06.302 --> 01:28:08.784]  The Iranian presenter was saying, what is this going to do to the economy?
[01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:13.528]  Well, I mean, gee, the peso's fallen massively in the last couple days in Mexico.
[01:28:13.528 --> 01:28:19.813]  The Chinese and other governments are openly dumping dollars and buying real assets and then buying commodities like gold, silver, copper, and other raw material.
[01:28:22.412 --> 01:28:33.341]  If they say don't get on planes and don't get on trains and freeze all of your basic commuting, we're in a confined space and they're shutting down schools all over the United States and all the schools in Mexico.
[01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:35.022]  Gee, what is that going to do to terrorism?
[01:28:35.022 --> 01:28:35.763]  What is that going to do?
[01:28:36.753 --> 01:28:40.574]  Everything they're doing is to destroy the economy, as I've been saying for years.
[01:28:40.574 --> 01:28:41.855]  And that's to consolidate it.
[01:28:41.855 --> 01:28:45.376]  They want to butcher this sucker out, so then you're dependent on them.
[01:28:45.376 --> 01:28:47.916]  They are using this as a crisis.
[01:28:47.916 --> 01:28:59.600]  Now, it's bad enough what it's doing to the economy, it's bad enough what it's doing to our name around the world, it's bad enough the vaccines people are going to take that are going to mess them up big time, they'll just sweep that under the rug like the swine flu does in 76.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:15.470]  But if this sucker's real, if what we're confirming with doctors and others, and by confirming, we're getting this from sources in Mexico, the U.S., everywhere, I have internal documents now up on PrisonPlanet.com and the story Paul Watson wrote.
[01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:18.152]  Texas doctor claims swine flu case is far worse than reported.
[01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:48.081]  country now at level 6 and uh... we'll recap this when we get back and take some phone calls 1-800-259-9231 for your reports on your area specifically mexico or texas or california places hard to sit by this military checkpoints things like that only when eyewitness reports 1-800-259-9231 if you're stoned and all you know high call of amen I don't want that this is serious business this is big boy pants time we'll be right back put big boy pants on
[01:29:48.621 --> 01:29:51.222]  Stop smoking the pot!
[01:29:51.222 --> 01:29:52.603]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.603 --> 01:29:55.123]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.123 --> 01:30:01.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.046 --> 01:30:02.346]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.346 --> 01:30:07.948]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.948 --> 01:30:12.970]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:13.430]  It's true.
[01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:16.251]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:30:16.251 --> 01:30:17.992]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:18.536 --> 01:30:23.758]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.758 --> 01:30:26.059]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:30:26.059 --> 01:30:30.860]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:31.981]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:35.062]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:38.683]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:41.864]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:41.864 --> 01:30:44.085]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:44.085 --> 01:30:45.005]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:48.663 --> 01:30:50.085]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:50.085 --> 01:30:57.715]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.715 --> 01:31:01.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.044]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:31:04.662 --> 01:31:07.264]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.264 --> 01:31:14.851]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:21.017]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.437 --> 01:31:23.397]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.397 --> 01:31:25.918]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.918 --> 01:31:37.481]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.481 --> 01:31:39.161]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:41.022]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.022 --> 01:31:47.243]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:47.924 --> 01:31:56.187]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.187 --> 01:31:57.748]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.748 --> 01:32:00.709]  The people strike back.
[01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:02.390]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:04.130]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:06.831]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:32:06.831 --> 01:32:11.533]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:32:11.952 --> 01:32:15.135]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:32:15.135 --> 01:32:31.609]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:32:31.609 --> 01:32:33.932]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:32:33.932 --> 01:32:35.353]  I use one every day.
[01:32:35.353 --> 01:32:37.795]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:32:38.035 --> 01:32:38.756]  We're good to go.
[01:33:22.594 --> 01:33:36.969]  We do have to remember that the feds have run around before with swine flu in 76, with the SARS a few years ago, with bird flu, saying it'll kill half the people, it'll kill 90%, it's all over.
[01:33:38.365 --> 01:33:41.506]  They'll usually just shut down a few hospitals and fearmonger.
[01:33:41.506 --> 01:33:46.308]  This is military running around, police state checkpoints, saying we're under U.N.
[01:33:46.308 --> 01:33:53.271]  control and mainstream news articles, the vice president coming out and saying don't fly, don't move, and Mexico's totally shut down.
[01:33:54.946 --> 01:33:58.889]  They'll hyperventilate and scare people, but never really shut anything down.
[01:33:58.889 --> 01:34:06.134]  Maybe one hospital room or something, and go around hyperventilating and saying, don't worry, we've got shots and, you know, we've got medicine for you.
[01:34:06.134 --> 01:34:11.999]  By the way, coming up next is, you know, half the sponsor ads of the group they're pushing during the news.
[01:34:11.999 --> 01:34:15.401]  And there's just hundreds of billions of dollars in this fear-mongering every time they do it.
[01:34:15.401 --> 01:34:19.605]  So that's a motive, and reportedly not many people have died.
[01:34:19.605 --> 01:34:21.686]  Regular flu kills a lot more than this.
[01:34:21.686 --> 01:34:22.547]  What is the issue?
[01:34:23.717 --> 01:34:26.738]  But why this incredible, overblown response?
[01:34:26.738 --> 01:34:42.283]  And then I have this document out of Texas from 36 hours ago, and this thing came through then, we just hadn't seen it until then, and it's talking about we're not at a level 5, we're at a level 6.
[01:34:42.283 --> 01:34:48.125]  And saying they're going to go to a level 5, and this was before they even said we were at a level 5.
[01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:50.831]  They're saying we're not at level 5, we're at level 6.
[01:34:50.831 --> 01:34:53.193]  And then we went to level 5 yesterday.
[01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:56.395]  And then Biden's out saying, well go ahead and play the clip, here he is.
[01:35:00.363 --> 01:35:05.727]  I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now.
[01:35:05.727 --> 01:35:12.332]  It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft, when one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.
[01:35:12.332 --> 01:35:13.313]  That's me.
[01:35:13.313 --> 01:35:19.858]  I would not be at this point if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway.
[01:35:19.858 --> 01:35:23.301]  So, from my perspective, what it relates to is mitigation.
[01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:27.224]  If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing.
[01:35:27.224 --> 01:35:34.609]  If you're in a closed aircraft, a closed container, a closed car, a closed classroom, it's a different thing.
[01:35:34.609 --> 01:35:42.475]  So, there you have Joe Biden, or Beedon as Paul Watson likes to call him, Mr. Beady Eyes.
[01:35:42.475 --> 01:35:49.761]  Now, listen, if this turns out, this is a perfect hoax for them because if it doesn't turn out to be as deadly as they're hyping, they just say, well, we were trying to keep you safe.
[01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:51.739]  And then they'll give you the vaccine.
[01:35:51.739 --> 01:35:53.420]  People will drop dead from that.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.321]  Always happens in the past.
[01:35:54.321 --> 01:36:00.446]  It's like the imaginary cervical cancer that only kills 3,000 people a year.
[01:36:00.446 --> 01:36:01.968]  Sounds like a lot, but that's tiny.
[01:36:01.968 --> 01:36:07.152]  I mean, it's way down the list of cancers.
[01:36:07.152 --> 01:36:15.019]  And it's usually people that are run down, have HIV, that get this opportunistic cancer virus, that it infects them.
[01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:21.766]  And then they tell girls they need to take it, boys need to take it, and they take it and they drop dead, and they have autoimmune responses.
[01:36:21.766 --> 01:36:24.987]  I mean, this is bad stuff, folks!
[01:36:24.987 --> 01:36:26.947]  And they're setting a precedent for this.
[01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:31.329]  I want to go over some of this really big UN news, okay?
[01:36:31.329 --> 01:36:40.332]  This is out of the British News, out of TGDaily.com.
[01:36:43.772 --> 01:37:11.451]  and uh... it says a pandemic scares fail to match up to reality and then it uh... goes on from there and it says a draft report of the federal government's emergency plan predicts that as many as two hundred million americans could be infected and two hundred million could die within a few months if the bird flu came to the united states he said and it says once again uh... things weren't so bad at the end
[01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:15.571]  I left my phone in here and it's ringing up against the wall.
[01:37:15.571 --> 01:37:17.492]  Will you get it for me right there?
[01:37:17.492 --> 01:37:18.052]  Thank you.
[01:37:18.052 --> 01:37:18.912]  It's a three ring circus in here.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.941]  So, that's the type of fear-mongering they did in the past.
[01:37:36.941 --> 01:37:41.763]  We need to expose a big article about how they fear-mongered in the past over and over again.
[01:37:41.763 --> 01:37:48.004]  You want to give that to Watson and Kurt Nemo with those... In fact, cue up that... We've got a bunch of these.
[01:37:48.004 --> 01:37:54.146]  Cue up that 1977 when they were still hyping the swine flu with the vaccine killing people.
[01:37:54.146 --> 01:37:55.187]  That fear-mongering video.
[01:37:55.187 --> 01:37:55.667]  Do you have that?
[01:37:55.667 --> 01:37:57.347]  I want to play that fear-mongering video in a minute.
[01:37:57.347 --> 01:37:58.028]  Thank you.
[01:37:58.028 --> 01:38:01.989]  Now, Jason Burmess read this last night.
[01:38:03.339 --> 01:38:17.167]  This is the United Nations directive to the governments, and we have the Reuters article where Mr. Moon, the head of the UN, Secretary General, is saying that they're now controlling and running the operation, telling the United States and Homeland Security what to do.
[01:38:17.167 --> 01:38:22.390]  Supreme Court comes out in the USA Today and says they follow the orders of the Hague and the Netherlands.
[01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:23.511]  That's now their Supreme Court.
[01:38:25.069 --> 01:38:26.830]  Not too supremely, are you?
[01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:35.376]  It says, uh, ensure that mechanisms exist for information sharing between national authorities who, and United Nations agencies, coordinate with their use.
[01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:40.259]  Existing mechanisms set up with implementation of the International Health Regulators.
[01:38:40.259 --> 01:38:46.383]  1.5, legal ethical issues, compulsory vaccination, or implementation of emergency shifts of essential services.
[01:38:47.452 --> 01:39:03.319]  Travel or movement restrictions, leaving and entering areas where infection is established, closure of educational institutions, prohibition of mass gatherings, isolation of quarantined and infected persons or persons suspected of being infected, or persons from areas where pandemic strains of influenza are established,
[01:39:04.181 --> 01:39:05.702]  That's section 1.5.2.
[01:39:05.702 --> 01:39:08.044]  Ethical issues.
[01:39:08.044 --> 01:39:19.595]  They are part of the non-normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selected vaccination of pre-defined risk groups.
[01:39:19.595 --> 01:39:24.359]  Then it gets into compulsory inoculation.
[01:39:24.359 --> 01:39:25.200]  Questions to be addressed.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.783]  What type of surveillance is considered to be needed and feasible in the country concerned?
[01:39:28.783 --> 01:39:30.985]  Who should be responsible for data collection and analysis?
[01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.628]  Who's using information for policy development?
[01:39:34.628 --> 01:39:40.194]  How will national surveillance systems coordinate with regional supranational systems?
[01:39:40.194 --> 01:39:41.515]  With the World Health Organization.
[01:39:41.515 --> 01:39:45.459]  Trying to find the... I read this last night on air.
[01:39:45.459 --> 01:39:48.382]  We've got a compulsory vaccination segment.
[01:39:50.894 --> 01:39:51.855]  In here.
[01:39:51.855 --> 01:39:52.835]  Command and Control.
[01:39:52.835 --> 01:40:04.904]  To have uniform policy that is endorsed by all officials, it is essential to know who is in charge of different activities with communicable disease control and how that might change if a limited outbreak becomes a major emergency.
[01:40:04.904 --> 01:40:06.806]  Who is making decisions for the influence of the pandemic?
[01:40:06.806 --> 01:40:10.148]  The Prime Minister, the President, the Ministry of Health, the Departments.
[01:40:10.148 --> 01:40:17.774]  A command and control structure should be in place outlining the management and decision-making process of all organizations involved in the health emergency including, and now they've announced it's the UN,
[01:40:19.045 --> 01:40:20.086]  in control of this.
[01:40:20.086 --> 01:40:23.268]  You can go read all about that from the U.N.
[01:40:23.268 --> 01:40:29.253]  Here's WorldNet Daily by Jerome Corsi back in August 28, 2007.
[01:40:29.253 --> 01:40:30.113]  Headline, U.S.
[01:40:30.113 --> 01:40:30.714]  under U.N.
[01:40:30.714 --> 01:40:32.235]  law and health emergency.
[01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:36.338]  Bush's SPP power grab set stage for military to manage flu threats.
[01:40:36.338 --> 01:40:39.400]  Remember they sued and got the documents and it said the U.N.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:39.841]  would run it.
[01:40:39.841 --> 01:40:40.882]  Well now they've done that.
[01:40:40.882 --> 01:40:43.684]  They just announced it like it's no big deal and Reuters and AP.
[01:40:46.252 --> 01:40:48.673]  It's in my stack here from two days ago.
[01:40:48.673 --> 01:40:49.774]  World Trade Organization.
[01:40:49.774 --> 01:41:00.880]  It says, the Secretary of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North American Summit in Canada released a plan to establish UN law along with regulations for the World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, Supreme, over U.S.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:06.623]  law during a pandemic that sets the state for militarizing the management of continental health emergencies.
[01:41:06.623 --> 01:41:12.126]  The North American plan for avian and pandemic influenza was finalized at the SPP Summit last week in Montebello, Quebec.
[01:41:13.655 --> 01:41:14.535]  At the time, the U.S.
[01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:20.538]  Northern Command NORTHCOM has created a webpage dedicated to the avian flu, has been running exercises in preparation for the possible use of U.S.
[01:41:20.538 --> 01:41:24.759]  military forces in a continental domestic emergency involving avian flu and pandemic influenza.
[01:41:24.759 --> 01:41:28.261]  With virtually no media attention, in 2005, President Bush shifted U.S.
[01:41:28.261 --> 01:41:34.223]  policy on avian flu and pandemic influenza, placing the country under international guidelines not specifically determined
[01:41:35.183 --> 01:41:36.905]  Uh, domestic agencies.
[01:41:36.905 --> 01:41:48.514]  The, uh, policy shift was formulized September 14, 2005 when President Bush announced a new international partnership with the AVN and Pandemic Influenza to a high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York.
[01:41:48.514 --> 01:41:50.656]  Cutting links to all that at the UN.
[01:41:50.656 --> 01:41:53.958]  And it goes on to say that they'll use foreign assets.
[01:41:53.958 --> 01:41:56.781]  That's in the UN's own document I was just covering.
[01:41:57.691 --> 01:42:01.834]  Take over food and agriculture on the United States roads.
[01:42:01.834 --> 01:42:04.977]  Executive orders for forced labor.
[01:42:04.977 --> 01:42:08.240]  It's just Homeland Security reporting to the United Nations.
[01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:13.572]  NORTHCOM participated in a nationwide Joint Chiefs Staff exercise with the U.N.
[01:42:13.572 --> 01:42:17.013]  involved a scenario with the plague originating in Mexico.
[01:42:17.013 --> 01:42:19.874]  Guys, pull this article up and print me that document.
[01:42:19.874 --> 01:42:27.156]  If you go to the article on page 2, it says a pandemic influenza crisis is one of the four scenarios gained in exercise Arden Century 06.
[01:42:27.156 --> 01:42:29.197]  Well, they practiced really doing the real thing.
[01:42:29.197 --> 01:42:33.658]  Involving a scenario of plague in Mexico reaching across the border into Arizona and New Mexico.
[01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:35.929]  So go to this article.
[01:42:35.929 --> 01:42:38.170]  In fact, let's on-screen that if you can.
[01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:40.050]  Let's put up U.S.
[01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:41.751]  under U.N.
[01:42:41.751 --> 01:42:43.812]  law and health emergency.
[01:42:43.812 --> 01:42:51.395]  And then let's go here to paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[01:42:51.395 --> 01:42:58.398]  Where was that?
[01:42:58.398 --> 01:43:00.299]  No, it's further in.
[01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:02.180]  No, it's like paragraph 30 or something.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:02.960]  It's on the third page.
[01:43:04.456 --> 01:43:08.539]  Just CTRL-F Mexico and it'll bring it up for you.
[01:43:08.539 --> 01:43:10.020]  This is absolutely amazing.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:15.323]  The previous report of NORTHCOM has been established with a command center and press and air force base tasked with using the U.S.
[01:43:15.323 --> 01:43:18.265]  military in continental domestic emergency situations.
[01:43:18.265 --> 01:43:22.348]  They signed a deal last year to use Canadian and Mexican troops inside the U.S.
[01:43:22.348 --> 01:43:23.369]  We need to pull that up.
[01:43:24.687 --> 01:43:29.948]  They suddenly announced troops to patrol the streets of Canada two months ago to quote stop routing us.
[01:43:29.948 --> 01:43:30.969]  Same thing here in the U.S.
[01:43:30.969 --> 01:43:31.569]  has been happening.
[01:43:31.569 --> 01:43:33.429]  I mean this has all been set up.
[01:43:33.429 --> 01:43:37.230]  Now is this another big beta test where they gear up more and more and acclimate each time?
[01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:38.011]  I don't know.
[01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:42.772]  But when they start coming out and saying don't travel, don't get on buses, trains, airplanes, subways, you know.
[01:43:42.972 --> 01:44:05.949]  When they start coming out and we get internal documents from the state saying we're really at level 6, people are on ventilators, this is killing as many people as it is Mexicans, this infects, if you come in contact with it, you get 40-50% of the people get it, normally 10% to 15%, you know, saying, oh, we've never seen this in our lifetimes, oh my god, the feds tell us it's the end of the world.
[01:44:05.949 --> 01:44:09.011]  Man, I'm really sick of the new world order, aren't you?
[01:44:09.011 --> 01:44:11.273]  Here's another one, press release put out by, uh,
[01:44:12.535 --> 01:44:16.498]  Adventist, the big vaccine maker.
[01:44:16.498 --> 01:44:29.707]  Health infrastructure is and is eager to support Mexico's exemplary commitment to public health through influenza immunization and pandemic readiness.
[01:44:29.707 --> 01:44:33.090]  And it says a local approach to global health.
[01:44:35.674 --> 01:44:41.497]  Got the CNN attacking us, saying we're a conspiracy theorist website, pointing towards government involvement.
[01:44:41.497 --> 01:44:44.519]  Let's play Wayne Madsen that's coming up in an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:44:44.519 --> 01:44:47.940]  Let's play that Russia Today clip.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:48.861]  You guys have that, right?
[01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:55.897]  We're going to roll the video on our side, so PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can see this as well.
[01:44:55.897 --> 01:44:59.482]  Here's Wayne Madsen, formerly with the NSA, reporting from Washington.
[01:44:59.482 --> 01:45:05.631]  An investigative journalist from Washington, Wayne Madsen, says the outbreak of the virus is raising suspicion.
[01:45:07.449 --> 01:45:16.997]  I spoke to two journalists, one from Mexico City and the other one from Jakarta, Indonesia, and of course Indonesia had a problem not long ago with bird flu.
[01:45:16.997 --> 01:45:31.070]  Both these journalists have been in touch with UN and World Health Organization officials, including a scientist who's dealt with Ebola virus and HIV AIDS in Africa, and it's their conclusion, these scientists who they've spoken to, that
[01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:37.535]  This is a very unusual form of flu because it looks like it is a product of some gene splicing.
[01:45:37.535 --> 01:45:46.381]  The flu contains elements of bird flu, two forms of human flu, and various forms of swine flu.
[01:45:46.381 --> 01:45:48.923]  To them it doesn't look like this is naturally occurring.
[01:45:48.923 --> 01:45:53.227]  The other thing is the target for this flu, as opposed to other flus,
[01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:55.708]  It's not the very young and the very old.
[01:45:55.708 --> 01:45:59.509]  It's people between the ages of 20 and 45.
[01:45:59.509 --> 01:46:03.730]  And the other thing is, people are not contracting this from pigs.
[01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:07.451]  The National Pork Council here in America says pigs are not being affected.
[01:46:07.451 --> 01:46:09.131]  This is human-to-human contact.
[01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:13.793]  So people who either eat pork or are exposed to pigs are not getting this flu.
[01:46:13.793 --> 01:46:15.673]  Very unusual.
[01:46:15.673 --> 01:46:22.075]  And of course, the scientists are very alarmed by the way it's being spread and the speed at which it's being spread.
[01:46:27.079 --> 01:46:28.960]  He was absolutely on target there.
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.763]  I mean, this thing is spreading quickly according to internal documents we have.
[01:46:32.763 --> 01:46:34.244]  It has nothing to do with pigs.
[01:46:34.244 --> 01:46:35.945]  It's got some pig genetics in it.
[01:46:35.945 --> 01:46:39.228]  It's got double that in bird.
[01:46:39.228 --> 01:46:46.853]  It's two-fourths bird, one-fourth pig, one-fourth human.
[01:46:48.308 --> 01:46:55.432]  And Horowitz is saying, and I've never seen him be wrong yet, I hope he's wrong, it's got some kind of insect thing hanging off the end of it so it can spread even better.
[01:46:55.432 --> 01:47:00.055]  So it can latch on to things with its RNA and get into their DNA and the animals.
[01:47:00.055 --> 01:47:00.855]  You know, I don't know.
[01:47:00.855 --> 01:47:03.197]  This is just getting more and more out of control.
[01:47:03.197 --> 01:47:09.120]  And then I've got this document, and by the way, is this up in the article now on PrisonPlanet.com?
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.141]  I mean, I want to post the document itself.
[01:47:11.141 --> 01:47:16.004]  Ask the guys if it's now posted, if they were able to get that scanned in and get it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:16.004 --> 01:47:17.485]  In fact, let's just call Rob Dew in here.
[01:47:19.173 --> 01:47:21.614]  I want to get this document up, just like MYAC and everything else.
[01:47:21.614 --> 01:47:23.636]  People are living in denial.
[01:47:23.636 --> 01:47:40.726]  This is from a doctor where it broke out in South Central Texas, in New Braunfels, and he's in here, and he was at the meeting with the Feds, and they're saying the clinical attack rate may be 40 to 50 percent, when it's normally only 10 to 15 percent.
[01:47:40.726 --> 01:47:45.888]  Has Watson gotten this up yet?
[01:47:45.888 --> 01:47:48.170]  They're having slight database issues on Prison Planet now?
[01:47:50.253 --> 01:47:53.274]  Working on it right now, to try to get it up.
[01:47:53.274 --> 01:47:56.475]  So, Prison Planet's basically crippled now, too.
[01:47:56.475 --> 01:48:00.496]  I mean, I could still get on the site, but it's, uh... Well, let's go around that problem.
[01:48:00.496 --> 01:48:00.816]  Okay.
[01:48:00.816 --> 01:48:03.056]  Let's go immediately to TruthNews.us.
[01:48:03.056 --> 01:48:06.317]  I mean, it isn't a vacation for the web guys, because the sites are down.
[01:48:06.317 --> 01:48:06.637]  Right.
[01:48:06.637 --> 01:48:09.038]  I need them to immediately go to the auxiliaries.
[01:48:09.038 --> 01:48:11.078]  That's what we have JonesReport.com for.
[01:48:11.078 --> 01:48:12.319]  That's what we have TruthNews.
[01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:13.899]  I mean, this is serious crap going on.
[01:48:13.899 --> 01:48:15.119]  Thank you so much, Rob.
[01:48:15.119 --> 01:48:16.420]  I appreciate your hard work.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:17.020]  Yeah, get them that.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.481]  Get a clone of Watson's article with the point that they're saying it's level 6, and let's get it up!
[01:48:22.481 --> 01:48:23.041]  Let's do it!
[01:48:23.041 --> 01:48:23.421]  Come on!
[01:48:23.421 --> 01:48:27.262]  You know, if we run into a problem two hours ago, let's go around it.
[01:48:27.262 --> 01:48:28.942]  Let's think about ways to go around it.
[01:48:28.942 --> 01:48:30.502]  We've got a great crew.
[01:48:30.502 --> 01:48:33.203]  I'm just, I'm just, this crap needs to go up right now.
[01:48:33.203 --> 01:48:36.763]  This is major news right here!
[01:48:36.763 --> 01:48:40.824]  TruthNews.us, JonesReport.com aren't being hacked.
[01:48:40.824 --> 01:48:41.904]  Go to those!
[01:48:41.904 --> 01:48:44.925]  We've got to get ready to launch a news site if they take those down.
[01:48:44.925 --> 01:48:46.485]  We're going to initiate that right now.
[01:48:47.773 --> 01:48:51.414]  Do whatever we have to to get the information out!
[01:48:51.414 --> 01:48:52.374]  I'm not mad at my crew.
[01:48:52.374 --> 01:48:59.316]  I'm just really getting irritated here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:59.316 --> 01:49:02.577]  Let's take calls, but... Tim, go ahead.
[01:49:02.577 --> 01:49:03.678]  You're on the air from Ohio.
[01:49:03.678 --> 01:49:04.518]  Go ahead.
[01:49:04.518 --> 01:49:05.598]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:05.598 --> 01:49:06.639]  Hi.
[01:49:06.639 --> 01:49:15.601]  I'm not going to review all of the great info that's already been discussed as far as origins and composition and where it's going, but a couple of things that haven't been introduced into the conversation.
[01:49:15.601 --> 01:49:17.522]  Number one, we still have our gun.
[01:49:19.028 --> 01:49:23.751]  Number two, you said that you first reported this last Friday, didn't you?
[01:49:23.751 --> 01:49:34.518]  We've been talking about it since last week, and Quayle said on Monday this was going to be it, and he had the intel they were going to do something in the next couple weeks, and God, I wish he was wrong.
[01:49:34.518 --> 01:49:40.782]  Thursday, April 23rd, was the beginning of the big May ratings sweeps period for all the TV news stations.
[01:49:41.579 --> 01:49:42.519]  And I think it's a total coincidence.
[01:49:42.519 --> 01:49:47.141]  And they're making money off the flu, medicine, and the vaccines, and it's a distraction for the government.
[01:49:47.141 --> 01:49:49.842]  They always do this crap concerted, just like 9-11.
[01:49:49.842 --> 01:49:52.663]  I mean, Sean Hannity started his show right before 9-11.
[01:49:52.663 --> 01:49:53.924]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:49:53.924 --> 01:49:55.064]  It's a radio show.
[01:49:55.064 --> 01:49:56.305]  He's not part of it.
[01:49:56.305 --> 01:49:57.285]  I'm not saying he's part of it.
[01:49:57.285 --> 01:50:03.647]  It's just they know when to launch, just like they knew the put options, betting against American and United at record rates.
[01:50:03.647 --> 01:50:06.669]  Watch for the attack on the food supplies, too, just like they had the Mad Cow.
[01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:10.070]  I think they said already over in Egypt they're going to slaughter hundreds of thousands of pigs.
[01:50:12.116 --> 01:50:12.737]  Ridiculous.
[01:50:12.737 --> 01:50:13.857]  Has nothing to do with this.
[01:50:13.857 --> 01:50:15.999]  Yeah, I think this is just a drill, though.
[01:50:15.999 --> 01:50:18.181]  Maybe just to see how we react to it.
[01:50:18.181 --> 01:50:21.624]  How many times have I said they would do bigger and bigger beta tests?
[01:50:21.624 --> 01:50:22.304]  Hundreds dead.
[01:50:22.304 --> 01:50:23.085]  Thousands dead.
[01:50:23.085 --> 01:50:23.685]  Millions dead.
[01:50:23.685 --> 01:50:31.411]  And then after they train us all to lock down and do what we're told, and, oh, the government's our friend, and they're just going to hit you with a Zychronian-12 that just kills everybody.
[01:50:31.411 --> 01:50:39.458]  And all you foreign troops that are bivouacked around our country, it's time to pack it up and go back to where you came from, because you don't want to take us on.
[01:50:40.916 --> 01:50:42.357]  Oh, they love it.
[01:50:42.357 --> 01:50:47.599]  Look, they're not going to be happy until their whole family dies of Zykron XC4 fiber.
[01:50:47.599 --> 01:50:49.840]  I mean, you know, whatever made-up crap it is they release on us.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.481]  They're not going to be happy until they're six feet under.
[01:50:52.481 --> 01:50:54.042]  They love being cowards.
[01:50:54.042 --> 01:50:55.142]  They love being slaves.
[01:50:55.142 --> 01:50:57.623]  They love sucking their thumbs and believing the media.
[01:50:57.623 --> 01:50:58.844]  They love losing everything they've got.
[01:51:00.851 --> 01:51:03.532]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?
[01:51:03.532 --> 01:51:07.153]  Listen closely to this message from Pepperspray.com.

[01:51:57.482 --> 01:52:06.649]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.419 --> 01:52:13.282]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.282 --> 01:52:19.705]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.705 --> 01:52:21.746]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.746 --> 01:52:24.228]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.228 --> 01:52:34.953]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.398 --> 01:52:39.059]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.059 --> 01:52:40.920]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:47.845]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.845 --> 01:52:56.110]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.110 --> 01:52:57.671]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.671 --> 01:52:58.872]  The people strike back.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.723]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[01:53:02.723 --> 01:53:09.852]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[01:53:09.852 --> 01:53:15.699]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.
[01:53:15.759 --> 01:53:16.559]  We're good to go.
[01:53:35.925 --> 01:53:40.548]  Our competition charges $0.10 to $1.25 per seed for these same heirloom varieties.
[01:53:40.548 --> 01:53:48.234]  But you can now have a head of lettuce, a bundle of carrots, a basket of tomatoes, a giant watermelon, and 16 other varieties for about a penny a seed each!
[01:53:48.234 --> 01:53:49.014]  Be prepared!
[01:53:49.014 --> 01:53:54.278]  Buy your heirloom seeds today from SurvivalistSeeds.com and have food insurance for your family forever!

[01:53:56.079 --> 01:54:00.022]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of the Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:54:17.252 --> 01:54:21.755]  All right, the site you can get to
[01:54:48.263 --> 01:54:50.764]  Info Wars, we got threats here at the office.
[01:54:50.764 --> 01:54:52.384]  A bunch of stuff went on yesterday.
[01:54:52.384 --> 01:54:53.364]  They said we're going to shut you down.
[01:54:53.364 --> 01:54:58.846]  Threatening phone calls, emails, faxes.
[01:54:58.846 --> 01:55:08.148]  And uh... An hour later, the biggest anonymous service attack the big internet company had ever seen, we'd ever seen.
[01:55:08.148 --> 01:55:10.648]  Not at our CDNs, but over those at ports.
[01:55:10.648 --> 01:55:13.769]  We'd move the ports, they'd try to find those.
[01:55:13.769 --> 01:55:17.330]  Every time they found them, we'd put some of the graphs up, they would slam right back in.
[01:55:19.535 --> 01:55:20.256]  But it's not just that.
[01:55:20.256 --> 01:55:23.939]  We've got CNN, everybody else, Wall Street Journal talking about us.
[01:55:23.939 --> 01:55:26.781]  So that's all hitting us.
[01:55:26.781 --> 01:55:28.802]  JonesReport.com is basically down.
[01:55:28.802 --> 01:55:30.784]  TruthNews.com is down.
[01:55:30.784 --> 01:55:33.226]  Infowars.com is up and down.
[01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:37.089]  PrisonPlanet.com, soldiers on.
[01:55:37.089 --> 01:55:41.412]  So PrisonPlanet.com is the site, and it's having problems.
[01:55:41.412 --> 01:55:44.895]  We may have to convert the ObamaDeception.net over.
[01:55:44.895 --> 01:55:46.556]  I've got ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:55:46.556 --> 01:55:47.557]  Those are on different servers.
[01:55:48.328 --> 01:55:55.955]  The problem is that I talk about them and the enemies are basically hitting them all and then people are also traveling to the sites.
[01:55:55.955 --> 01:55:59.859]  So we will continue to try to keep things up and operate here.
[01:55:59.859 --> 01:56:02.841]  Then there's GCN Live and its servers and its audio streams.
[01:56:02.841 --> 01:56:04.383]  We're streaming out audio.
[01:56:04.383 --> 01:56:06.485]  That's all staying up on the CDNs.
[01:56:06.485 --> 01:56:09.828]  The guys don't like to attack our CDNs because those are thousands of servers.
[01:56:10.782 --> 01:56:13.885]  It's just we don't have the money to place our entire sites on CDNs.
[01:56:13.885 --> 01:56:16.007]  We place just certain media.
[01:56:16.007 --> 01:56:21.053]  It's already costing me 30 grand a month or more in bandwidth just for the CDNs.
[01:56:21.053 --> 01:56:21.793]  Yes, that's why.
[01:56:21.793 --> 01:56:28.941]  And look, I've done an hour and 56 minutes with no talk of any of the products.
[01:56:28.941 --> 01:56:31.263]  Most of the network stuff you hear, that's for the network, not for me.
[01:56:31.263 --> 01:56:31.904]  I need money.
[01:56:32.955 --> 01:56:39.760]  And so, I hope you'll buy the books and the videos which are great and informative at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.282]  As the economy further shuts down, the Feds want to be the last man standing.
[01:56:43.282 --> 01:56:51.508]  As they fearmonger and say, don't travel, don't do business, don't have a life, with one death in the U.S., this better not be real.
[01:56:51.508 --> 01:56:54.590]  But then if it isn't real, they've hyped it up, they're just such criminals.
[01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:58.213]  Any way you cut it, they're trying to death-nail this nation and
[01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:03.472]  The listenership is literally off the charts on AM and FM, shortwave internet.
[01:57:03.472 --> 01:57:04.513]  It's just the calls.
[01:57:04.513 --> 01:57:06.954]  It's off the charts here, but nobody's buying anything.
[01:57:06.954 --> 01:57:08.075]  So go to InfoWars.org.
[01:57:08.075 --> 01:57:08.615]  We can't get there.
[01:57:08.615 --> 01:57:09.696]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:09.696 --> 01:57:11.297]  Go over to our Yahoo shopping cart.
[01:57:11.297 --> 01:57:15.879]  We try to spread things out on different platforms, folks, because we've been attacked so much in the past.
[01:57:15.879 --> 01:57:16.380]  Go there.
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:17.540]  Buy some of the books and videos.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:18.161]  That's how you support us.
[01:57:18.161 --> 01:57:19.161]  Get the Obama Deception.
[01:57:19.161 --> 01:57:20.002]  Make copies.
[01:57:20.002 --> 01:57:20.722]  Give it to people.
[01:57:20.722 --> 01:57:21.703]  Get Truth Rising.
[01:57:21.703 --> 01:57:22.603]  Get Terror Storm.
[01:57:22.603 --> 01:57:23.544]  Get Endgame.
[01:57:23.544 --> 01:57:26.325]  Endgame's the most important with all this flu stuff going on right now.
[01:57:26.325 --> 01:57:27.486]  Get the DVDs.
[01:57:27.486 --> 01:57:28.827]  PrisonPlanet.tv's up!
[01:57:30.538 --> 01:57:33.100]  PrisonPlanet.tv's up, right?
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:33.440]  That's another.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:35.622]  They've got so many sites, we've got a few up.
[01:57:35.622 --> 01:57:36.382]  Check it for me.
[01:57:36.382 --> 01:57:39.124]  It's a member site, but it's got free news on the front page.
[01:57:39.124 --> 01:57:42.086]  That sucker's got some gigantic servers.
[01:57:42.086 --> 01:57:45.689]  But again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:45.689 --> 01:57:47.070]  And yeah, money comes in here.
[01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:52.754]  This is a big radio show, and it just shovels, shovels out the door.
[01:57:52.754 --> 01:57:54.595]  And that's why we're doing another Money Bomb.
[01:57:54.595 --> 01:57:57.177]  We're going to launch Friday for coming up in a month.
[01:57:57.177 --> 01:57:59.498]  Because we need capital, we need donations.
[01:57:59.498 --> 01:57:59.979]  You want to go to
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:02.901]  Do we have a donation button?
[01:58:02.901 --> 01:58:05.002]  We have a donation button on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:05.002 --> 01:58:09.426]  Let's put one up on PrisonPlanet.tv and ObamaDeception.net.
[01:58:09.426 --> 01:58:10.687]  Let's put our PayPal up there.
[01:58:10.687 --> 01:58:12.949]  You want to donate and help us.
[01:58:12.949 --> 01:58:15.451]  And I'm watching our account go like this.
[01:58:17.142 --> 01:58:18.083]  The last month.
[01:58:18.083 --> 01:58:20.204]  You'd think Obama deception would fill up our coffers.
[01:58:20.204 --> 01:58:20.925]  It didn't.
[01:58:20.925 --> 01:58:24.367]  Because I am shoveling, like coal into a fire, the fuel.
[01:58:24.367 --> 01:58:25.949]  Money comes in and I'm just shoveling it.
[01:58:25.949 --> 01:58:27.810]  It's all hot.
[01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:28.591]  I'm wiping my brow.
[01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:30.192]  I got black dust all over my face.
[01:58:30.192 --> 01:58:31.233]  Coal dust.
[01:58:31.233 --> 01:58:34.895]  Got the locomotive jammed in high gear going right at the New World Order.
[01:58:34.895 --> 01:58:38.018]  Lindsey Williams, your phone calls and a lot more straight ahead.
[01:58:38.018 --> 01:58:43.262]  We're really under level six.
[01:58:43.262 --> 01:58:44.383]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.728 --> 01:58:50.992]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.992 --> 01:58:52.693]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.693 --> 01:58:57.436]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.436 --> 01:59:00.399]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.399 --> 01:59:03.441]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.441 --> 01:59:09.285]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.505 --> 01:59:12.748]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.748 --> 01:59:19.755]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.755 --> 01:59:23.018]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.018 --> 01:59:24.580]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:59:28.163 --> 01:59:34.425]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:34.425 --> 01:59:38.206]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.206 --> 01:59:39.547]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:39.547 --> 01:59:40.167]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.167 --> 01:59:41.988]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.641 --> 01:59:56.043]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.043 --> 02:00:05.428]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.428 --> 02:00:06.729]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.729 --> 02:00:08.510]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:10.272]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.272 --> 02:00:11.853]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.853 --> 02:00:12.773]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.773 --> 02:00:17.596]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.596 --> 02:00:21.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.134 --> 02:00:42.096]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[02:00:42.096 --> 02:00:46.657]  And I was out of the studio during the break, Charlie Sheen calling up, want to say hi to Charlie listening out there.
[02:00:46.657 --> 02:00:49.338]  Didn't have time to talk to him, I'm going to call him up during the next break.
[02:00:49.338 --> 02:00:50.819]  Maybe get him on the show again, that'd be good.
[02:00:51.713 --> 02:00:53.234]  Let him come out and talk about this.
[02:00:53.234 --> 02:00:54.434]  He really hates the vaccines.
[02:00:54.434 --> 02:00:59.296]  He's really studied it in depth.
[02:00:59.296 --> 02:01:00.156]  Do we have Lindsey Williams?
[02:01:00.156 --> 02:01:03.217]  I forgot to ask you.
[02:01:03.217 --> 02:01:05.318]  Okay, you're calling him right now.
[02:01:05.318 --> 02:01:06.258]  I gotta remember to eat.
[02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:09.379]  I'm getting a little bit light-headed here.
[02:01:09.379 --> 02:01:16.142]  Folks, if you just joined us, we're under concerted hacking attack on every front on all our sites.
[02:01:18.286 --> 02:01:19.047]  No doubt.
[02:01:19.047 --> 02:01:20.108]  We have the IT centers.
[02:01:20.108 --> 02:01:22.229]  Oh yeah, this is the worst ever.
[02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:27.233]  And people do not want you visiting Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:01:27.233 --> 02:01:36.540]  Because all we're saying is, why are they saying don't fly, don't drive in buses?
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:37.661]  You know, don't do this.
[02:01:37.661 --> 02:01:39.923]  Why is the Mexican government saying that they're shutting down
[02:01:41.425 --> 02:01:42.325]  For a couple deaths.
[02:01:42.325 --> 02:01:43.946]  I mean, what is going on here?
[02:01:43.946 --> 02:01:59.132]  And then I've got this internal stuff out of Texas, with the health department, saying we're really at level six, there's people on ventilators, and half the people that come in contact with us get it, and it's so incredibly deadly, and oh my god, we've never had something like this in our lifetime.
[02:01:59.132 --> 02:02:01.492]  Let's take a call before Lindsay Williams gets on with us.
[02:02:01.492 --> 02:02:04.113]  Let's talk to Tim in Kansas, and Kathy, Mark, Robert, and others.
[02:02:04.113 --> 02:02:04.674]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:02:08.502 --> 02:02:09.063]  Just dropped.
[02:02:09.063 --> 02:02:10.565]  That's good, good timing.
[02:02:10.565 --> 02:02:12.627]  Okay, Kathy in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:02:12.627 --> 02:02:14.630]  Go ahead, Kathy.
[02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:16.292]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:16.292 --> 02:02:17.153]  Hello.
[02:02:17.153 --> 02:02:17.733]  Hi.
[02:02:17.733 --> 02:02:27.005]  I was just wondering, if everything goes down where you're talking, how would we be able to communicate with everybody there by phone?
[02:02:28.666 --> 02:02:30.848]  Like if everything went down?
[02:02:30.848 --> 02:02:35.972]  If everything goes down, it's every person for themselves.
[02:02:35.972 --> 02:02:43.577]  My infrastructure is fully maxed, my small infrastructure, to maximize attacking the New World Order.
[02:02:43.577 --> 02:02:44.678]  And to expose them.
[02:02:44.678 --> 02:02:49.602]  And we've not spent our time and resources building up, except for backups to stay online.
[02:02:49.602 --> 02:02:53.064]  But if it's catastrophic and a total implosion, we'll be out of contact.
[02:02:53.064 --> 02:02:54.405]  They can shut the web down anyways.
[02:02:57.892 --> 02:02:59.273]  They can shut us down individually.
[02:02:59.273 --> 02:03:00.934]  That's already happening.
[02:03:00.934 --> 02:03:04.356]  And so, my books, my videos, my materials are out there in your hands.
[02:03:04.356 --> 02:03:05.657]  You've got that.
[02:03:05.657 --> 02:03:09.739]  I mean, you know, you can see a tape I did twelve years ago, and it's the same thing's happening now.
[02:03:09.739 --> 02:03:11.500]  You can hear us predicting what happened.
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:14.082]  Watch the show five years ago where I'm predicting what now is happening.
[02:03:14.639 --> 02:03:18.861]  You know, people are discovering those old TV shows and videos and watching them online are blown away.
[02:03:18.861 --> 02:03:20.581]  And it's not because I'm smart.
[02:03:20.581 --> 02:03:22.882]  I have just found out the Globalist Handbook.
[02:03:22.882 --> 02:03:29.485]  There are a lot of famous cases where a bank robber will leave his plan to rob a bank in the diner and they find it and then bust him.
[02:03:29.485 --> 02:03:36.848]  You know, I mean, we just found their plan and they plan to stage attacks until they get us in a police state grid and then launch the real attacks to exterminate the majority of us.
[02:03:37.759 --> 02:03:42.101]  You know, the bankers plan to implode the economy by design to bring in tyranny.
[02:03:42.101 --> 02:03:45.503]  All of this is going on, so I don't know what to say and do.
[02:03:45.503 --> 02:03:50.046]  I don't know how to reach out to people to get them to realize this new world order means business.
[02:03:50.046 --> 02:03:52.667]  I mean, this stuff is real!
[02:03:52.667 --> 02:03:55.368]  This stuff is not a joke or a game.
[02:03:55.368 --> 02:03:57.590]  This is for all the marbles.
[02:03:57.590 --> 02:04:03.353]  And the same big banks that funded Lenin and Stalin and Hitler and Mao and Pol Pot
[02:04:04.318 --> 02:04:09.304]  On record, are running things and mean to break the back of the world and bring in world government.
[02:04:09.304 --> 02:04:13.428]  This is military conquest through economics and bio-warfare.
[02:04:13.428 --> 02:04:15.431]  And, you know, any way you slice it.
[02:04:16.769 --> 02:04:22.491]  Whether this is a real biotech they've launched or a really weak virus, they're just hyping it, you know, endlessly.
[02:04:22.491 --> 02:04:25.191]  A PSYOP, it's a PSYOP either way you cut it.
[02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:29.052]  It's designer, all the evidence shows, and Wayne Madsen's coming up in the next hour.
[02:04:29.052 --> 02:04:30.093]  Lindsey Williams is straight ahead.
[02:04:30.093 --> 02:04:31.493]  I appreciate your call, Kathy.
[02:04:31.493 --> 02:04:34.774]  We'll talk to Lindsey Williams when we get back, recap some of the incredible new developments.
[02:04:36.838 --> 02:04:39.740]  And, uh, these are the times that try men's souls.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:45.585]  And it is a great responsibility to me, this radio show, because our listenership is just off the charts.
[02:04:45.585 --> 02:04:51.409]  On the AM and FM, they're saying they've never had so many calls or media attention.
[02:04:51.409 --> 02:04:55.672]  And, uh, the internet numbers here are just off the charts, but that's not what's knocking our sights out.
[02:04:55.672 --> 02:04:56.473]  It's attacks.
[02:04:56.473 --> 02:04:57.954]  We are under attack.
[02:04:57.954 --> 02:05:00.396]  Because we're saying something they don't want you to hear.
[02:05:01.488 --> 02:05:03.489]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:05:03.489 --> 02:05:10.452]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:05:10.452 --> 02:05:18.835]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:05:18.835 --> 02:05:24.578]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:05:24.738 --> 02:05:26.580]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:28.763]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:05:28.763 --> 02:05:33.309]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:05:33.309 --> 02:05:35.532]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:05:35.532 --> 02:05:43.362]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:05:43.462 --> 02:05:47.705]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:05:47.705 --> 02:05:49.146]  We've got to give them a stake.
[02:06:09.272 --> 02:06:13.535]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.535 --> 02:06:19.959]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:19.959 --> 02:06:22.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.462]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:06:24.462 --> 02:06:35.369]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.657 --> 02:06:39.318]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.318 --> 02:06:41.179]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.179 --> 02:06:48.082]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.082 --> 02:06:56.346]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.346 --> 02:06:57.927]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:57.927 --> 02:06:59.108]  The people strike back.
[02:07:00.868 --> 02:07:11.438]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:07:11.438 --> 02:07:12.859]  Garden in a Can.
[02:07:12.859 --> 02:07:17.003]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[02:07:17.003 --> 02:07:19.025]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[02:07:19.025 --> 02:07:21.327]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[02:07:21.787 --> 02:07:31.470]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:32.891]  Garden in a can.
[02:07:32.891 --> 02:07:34.091]  It's that simple.
[02:07:34.091 --> 02:07:34.792]  Fresh.
[02:07:34.792 --> 02:07:35.652]  Healthy.
[02:07:35.652 --> 02:07:36.492]  Easy.
[02:07:36.492 --> 02:07:40.834]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:07:40.834 --> 02:07:41.714]  Ready when you are.

[02:07:52.586 --> 02:07:52.646]  866-598-7396.
[02:07:52.646 --> 02:07:54.107]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:54.107 --> 02:07:55.088]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.518 --> 02:08:15.700]  I know we have a lot of listeners who are new to the show today.
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:17.601]  Huge breaking news is rolling in.
[02:08:17.601 --> 02:08:19.602]  I'll continue to update as it unfolds.
[02:08:19.602 --> 02:08:22.763]  Is this a real pandemic?
[02:08:22.763 --> 02:08:26.865]  Internal state documents say it is ultra deadly.
[02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.065]  And we're really at level 6.
[02:08:28.065 --> 02:08:30.286]  I told you we were at level 5 a day and a half ago.
[02:08:30.286 --> 02:08:31.527]  We were really at level 5.
[02:08:31.527 --> 02:08:32.647]  They were saying we were at level 4.
[02:08:32.647 --> 02:08:37.069]  Texas Department of Homeland Security off North Lubin Lamar.
[02:08:38.666 --> 02:08:45.251]  It's Monday morning, they've had 12 to 20 TxDOT squad cars parked off the bridge, lot, entryways, allowing no access.
[02:08:45.251 --> 02:08:49.014]  Squad cars every 100 yards around the perimeter.
[02:08:49.014 --> 02:08:52.117]  What is North Loop and Lamar?
[02:08:52.117 --> 02:08:53.678]  Let's dispatch somebody out there.
[02:08:53.678 --> 02:08:55.019]  I gotta hire more people or something.
[02:08:55.019 --> 02:08:56.981]  I don't have the money to do it.
[02:08:56.981 --> 02:09:02.465]  A lot of stuff coming in.
[02:09:02.465 --> 02:09:03.346]  Alright.
[02:09:03.346 --> 02:09:04.327]  Er, make a call.
[02:09:04.327 --> 02:09:04.907]  Do what?
[02:09:04.907 --> 02:09:05.508]  You got something new?
[02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:07.098]  as well.
[02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:30.155]  The governor is trying to safeguard 600,000 doses of the Tamiflu, which is stored, which we talked about earlier in the show, which is being stored over, I think, at that location.
[02:09:30.155 --> 02:09:31.376]  I'm going to confirm that today.
[02:09:31.376 --> 02:09:33.777]  And you have a buddy who works there, so we already knew this.
[02:09:33.777 --> 02:09:34.817]  We already knew this.
[02:09:34.817 --> 02:09:36.758]  We knew this on Tuesday.
[02:09:36.758 --> 02:09:37.718]  Right.
[02:09:37.718 --> 02:09:40.579]  And that there's a possible... They delivered it at 7 a.m.
[02:09:40.579 --> 02:09:41.080]  in two 18-wheelers.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:56.658]  Yeah, it's possible that there's been an infection in the county that has Bryan and College Station in it as well, and that DPS is going to be deployed to pharmacies to protect the valuable serum.
[02:09:56.658 --> 02:09:58.700]  Well, that's that cabbage patch doll thing.
[02:09:59.611 --> 02:10:06.694]  Where they would hire companies, toy companies around Christmas to stage PR events with a fake fight in front of cameras.
[02:10:06.694 --> 02:10:08.135]  I gotta have the doll.
[02:10:08.135 --> 02:10:12.257]  And then women would see that on TV and run out and actually fight over it.
[02:10:12.257 --> 02:10:16.879]  That's how they do these PR operations.
[02:10:16.879 --> 02:10:17.960]  And so they've been doing drills.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:26.244]  Remember in Indiana, when the Illinois came and said, with a county official, and I talked to him and confirmed it was a real interview, we want to know about mass graves.
[02:10:27.714 --> 02:10:28.295]  In your county?
[02:10:28.295 --> 02:10:36.141]  Then they also had drills where they would have the police practice guarding the mocked hemifluor or drug or vaccines being brought in.
[02:10:36.141 --> 02:10:37.382]  And your buddy works at the facility.
[02:10:37.382 --> 02:10:39.543]  Here they come with two 18-wheelers.
[02:10:39.543 --> 02:10:45.408]  Tuesday morning, 7 a.m., with cops all guarding it, like... Meanwhile, I have the Army's own report.
[02:10:45.408 --> 02:10:46.469]  In fact, you gave that to me.
[02:10:46.469 --> 02:10:48.290]  I don't know if the guys got it up.
[02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:51.173]  Where they're saying it doesn't even protect people in their studies.
[02:10:51.173 --> 02:10:53.094]  It actually makes it mutate.
[02:10:53.094 --> 02:10:53.895]  I think it's Microsoft.
[02:10:55.336 --> 02:10:56.057]  Go ahead.
[02:10:56.057 --> 02:10:57.419]  Yeah, that happened.
[02:10:57.419 --> 02:11:01.965]  Yeah, I gave you that report, and then we've got, oh, there's one other.
[02:11:01.965 --> 02:11:03.827]  Oh, there's so much stuff.
[02:11:03.827 --> 02:11:05.189]  Well, Rob, you're doing a great job.
[02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:09.114]  You were up here until midnight last night, and I really appreciate you and the whole crew.
[02:11:09.114 --> 02:11:09.675]  This is wild.
[02:11:10.376 --> 02:11:16.860]  We'll keep watching, and I'm going to get a confirmation on the guards guarding that outside area.
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:19.141]  I haven't seen any police.
[02:11:19.141 --> 02:11:20.742]  I've been driving all over town the last three days.
[02:11:20.742 --> 02:11:21.943]  They're nowhere.
[02:11:21.943 --> 02:11:23.064]  They're not out writing tickets.
[02:11:23.064 --> 02:11:27.446]  Boy, they'll be back out to get their quota letters.
[02:11:27.446 --> 02:11:28.727]  This is ridiculous.
[02:11:28.727 --> 02:11:29.848]  Alright, thank you so much, Rob.
[02:11:29.848 --> 02:11:31.089]  Continue to analyze.
[02:11:31.089 --> 02:11:31.949]  Great job, Rob Dew.
[02:11:31.949 --> 02:11:33.350]  They're the producer.
[02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:34.250]  Going to Lindsey Williams.
[02:11:35.956 --> 02:11:37.878]  You said, what was it, nine, ten months ago now?
[02:11:37.878 --> 02:11:38.379]  I forget.
[02:11:38.379 --> 02:11:41.303]  And months before that, privately, you had inside sources.
[02:11:41.303 --> 02:11:49.913]  You worked with some of the biggest oil companies up there as their chaplain for years when they discovered larger oil deposits than they have in Saudi Arabia.
[02:11:49.913 --> 02:11:51.315]  You wrote about that back in the 80s.
[02:11:51.315 --> 02:11:55.079]  Now it's been admitted to in the press that they have that all locked up.
[02:11:56.263 --> 02:12:05.715]  But then you got threatened to stop, your video was number one on YouTube and Google for months, literally tens of millions of views, exposing how there was plenty of fuel.
[02:12:05.715 --> 02:12:11.041]  And so they called you up and said, look, we're going to drop the price to bankrupt the Russians, the Arabs, and everybody else, and the Venezuelans.
[02:12:11.041 --> 02:12:11.902]  Since you said that,
[02:12:13.038 --> 02:12:17.200]  It was at $150 a barrel, $149 a barrel, actually at $150 one day.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.861]  It's now dropped to $32 the low.
[02:12:18.861 --> 02:12:22.003]  It's been below $50 now for months and months.
[02:12:22.003 --> 02:12:23.764]  And it just continues on.
[02:12:23.764 --> 02:12:33.049]  And now George Soros goes at the Economic Forum on TV and says they're staging it to bankrupt Russia, Venezuela, and the Arabs, just like you said, seven, eight months before him.
[02:12:33.049 --> 02:12:34.810]  But I wanted to get you on about the flu.
[02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:44.855]  That stage of it, because this person also told you, shut up or we're going to kill you about how we're doing this, but you're allowed to tell the slaves this, and that you should get out of the United States.
[02:12:44.855 --> 02:12:49.598]  So, Lindsey Williams, I appreciate you coming on and holding the last few minutes while I gave that update.
[02:12:49.598 --> 02:12:57.563]  If everything else isn't going to kill our economy, the Vice President coming out and saying, don't get on airplanes or trains or subways,
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:15.372]  Alex, I've never had so much fun being right in all my life.
[02:13:15.372 --> 02:13:25.320]  Now Alex, I want to say before we go any further, I want to say congratulations and tell you about the greatest thing you have ever accomplished.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.342]  I received an email from Mike, I won't give his last name,
[02:13:28.942 --> 02:13:30.843]  He listened to your show.
[02:13:30.843 --> 02:13:35.924]  He wrote, I took your advice, got my spiritual house in order.
[02:13:35.924 --> 02:13:38.886]  He tells how he came to know Christ as his savior.
[02:13:38.886 --> 02:13:40.526]  He had listened to your show.
[02:13:40.526 --> 02:13:45.888]  He received my CD, was saved, got things right with the Lord.
[02:13:45.888 --> 02:13:54.411]  And Alex, when you get to heaven, you, Alex Jones, when you get to heaven, there will be a person there because of you.
[02:13:54.411 --> 02:13:57.272]  You are touching millions of lives.
[02:13:58.058 --> 02:14:00.199]  You're at the bottom of Obama Deception.
[02:14:00.199 --> 02:14:03.220]  Alex, I've seen it from end to end.
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:05.180]  I have never seen anything like it.
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:10.462]  You know, for a number of months there, my DVDs were number one on YouTube.
[02:14:10.462 --> 02:14:14.403]  I am so glad now that I'm taking a back seat to you.
[02:14:14.403 --> 02:14:15.463]  That's right.
[02:14:15.463 --> 02:14:18.264]  Your Obama Deception, I understand, is number one.
[02:14:18.264 --> 02:14:25.466]  And I will gladly take a back seat to you any day in the world, because you are doing such an amazing job.
[02:14:26.050 --> 02:14:31.133]  And you are going to have an eternal value in what you're doing, Alex.
[02:14:31.133 --> 02:14:32.874]  Well, it is eternal.
[02:14:32.874 --> 02:14:35.556]  You know, the enemy doesn't care about money and even power.
[02:14:35.556 --> 02:14:39.018]  They want to control people's minds and their souls.
[02:14:39.018 --> 02:14:44.022]  And I never understood as a child reading revelations about they trafficked in the souls of men.
[02:14:44.022 --> 02:14:46.843]  But this New World Order is obsessed with your mind.
[02:14:46.843 --> 02:14:50.426]  And they want to bathe us in evil and train us that torture is good.
[02:14:50.426 --> 02:14:52.627]  And they want to make us like them.
[02:14:52.627 --> 02:14:53.448]  They want our soul.
[02:14:55.103 --> 02:15:08.527]  Yes, you're exactly right, and it was July the 28th that I had the privilege for the first time of appearing on your show and breaking the news of what I had been told by one of them, the elite, as to what their plans were.
[02:15:08.527 --> 02:15:22.531]  You know, I consider it such an honor and a privilege that God, by His grace, would allow Lindsey Williams, a little insignificant nobody that puts on his britches just like every other man ever wanted, to have lived with the elite of the world for three years' time
[02:15:23.044 --> 02:15:27.145]  And to stay in touch with some of them and know exactly what their plans are.
[02:15:27.145 --> 02:15:31.126]  And it's only because of this that I could appear on your show and say what was going to happen.
[02:15:31.126 --> 02:15:38.408]  And I'm sitting back now, watching this unfold minute by minute, exactly like they said.
[02:15:38.408 --> 02:15:43.690]  I sit back utterly amazed every day when I turn on the news and hear crude oil, $50.
[02:15:43.690 --> 02:15:46.031]  Crude oil, $45.
[02:15:46.031 --> 02:15:51.012]  Even the prognosticators on Wall Street are saying it's going up, it's going up, it's going up.
[02:15:51.731 --> 02:15:56.153]  And people come around and say, well, Lindsey, I guess it's about time for crude oil to go back up again.
[02:15:56.153 --> 02:15:58.033]  And I say, no, it's not.
[02:15:58.033 --> 02:16:02.895]  I was told it's going to stay this way for another 9 to 12 months, exactly like George Soros said.
[02:16:02.895 --> 02:16:04.275]  You said it a moment ago.
[02:16:04.275 --> 02:16:05.855]  George Soros said it.
[02:16:05.855 --> 02:16:12.257]  This individual told me, who called me, he said it's going to stay down there $50 a barrel.
[02:16:12.257 --> 02:16:15.919]  But George Soros said it 8 months after you said it.
[02:16:15.919 --> 02:16:18.559]  He said it when it was $40 a barrel.
[02:16:18.559 --> 02:16:19.360]  You said it when it was $149.
[02:16:21.141 --> 02:16:22.802]  Well, I had a call from one of them.
[02:16:22.802 --> 02:16:29.307]  I mean, you can't get any closer than an 82-year-old man who's been in the elite for years and years and years.
[02:16:29.307 --> 02:16:31.048]  He knows exactly what's happening.
[02:16:31.048 --> 02:16:35.431]  Once you ever become a part of that order of the elite, you never get out of it.
[02:16:35.431 --> 02:16:41.115]  And please, believe everything that you have heard on Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:41.115 --> 02:16:49.481]  I beg of you out there in the listening audience, you've got to believe it, even though it sounds phenomenal, way out in left field, sounds like some wacko.
[02:16:49.481 --> 02:16:50.662]  I'm that way, too.
[02:16:51.229 --> 02:16:52.850]  But all I do is tell the truth.
[02:16:52.850 --> 02:16:55.332]  Alex tells the truth exactly like it is.
[02:16:55.332 --> 02:16:59.514]  And everything you've heard him say over these years, you're finally seeing come to pass now.
[02:16:59.514 --> 02:17:00.695]  Listen to this one.
[02:17:00.695 --> 02:17:02.036]  The tax receipts.
[02:17:02.036 --> 02:17:06.279]  And see, this is what these people told me was going to happen.
[02:17:06.279 --> 02:17:08.380]  That America will see a financial collapse.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:11.382]  And I'm sitting back here just watching it unfold.
[02:17:11.382 --> 02:17:15.945]  The tax receipts in the United States of America are down $54 billion in one month.
[02:17:18.516 --> 02:17:24.606]  And I was told this back in June that we were going to see this complete collapse.
[02:17:24.606 --> 02:17:30.455]  The greatest drop in exports in 40 years plunged this month.
[02:17:31.414 --> 02:17:35.879]  In 40 years, plunged 30% since January.
[02:17:35.879 --> 02:17:39.082]  Chrysler's declaring bankruptcy at the orders of Obama.
[02:17:39.082 --> 02:17:41.685]  Obama removed the head of GM because he wouldn't declare bankruptcy.
[02:17:41.685 --> 02:17:42.967]  They're getting ready for that.
[02:17:42.967 --> 02:17:49.534]  And nobody's even going to pay attention as we go into open depths of depression because they're busy worrying about the flu.
[02:17:51.431 --> 02:17:54.232]  Yeah, Chrysler declared bankruptcy two hours ago.
[02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:56.493]  I heard it this morning, as soon as they happened.
[02:17:56.493 --> 02:18:02.895]  Two hours ago, Chrysler declared bankruptcy so that Obama could give them $8 billion from the Treasury.
[02:18:02.895 --> 02:18:06.216]  He couldn't do it until they declared bankruptcy.
[02:18:06.216 --> 02:18:11.438]  But he gave the bankers $12.8 trillion with no strings attached.
[02:18:11.438 --> 02:18:12.879]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:12.879 --> 02:18:14.239]  Yeah, and the Federal Reserve.
[02:18:14.239 --> 02:18:16.700]  You know, when I first appeared on your show, I was talking about
[02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:20.953]  The fact that the Federal Reserve was going to begin to buy T-Bills.
[02:18:20.953 --> 02:18:22.133]  Well, listen to this one.
[02:18:22.133 --> 02:18:29.238]  The Federal Reserve has purchased $70 billion in T-Bills since they began about four weeks ago.
[02:18:29.238 --> 02:18:38.845]  Folks, you don't have to... I don't know how you can even comprehend that the Federal Reserve, which is not even the agency of the federal government any more than Federal Express is,
[02:18:39.252 --> 02:18:45.614]  Has purchased $70 billion in key bills in order to keep the dollar afloat, so it wouldn't crash until they get ready for the flood.
[02:18:45.614 --> 02:18:48.434]  They're purchasing their own fiat currency.
[02:18:48.434 --> 02:18:55.736]  So we give them the bailout money, they loan it back to us in interest, and begin purchasing government debt themselves.
[02:18:55.736 --> 02:18:58.216]  I mean, this is now complete lala.
[02:18:58.216 --> 02:18:59.357]  This is like eating yourself.
[02:18:59.357 --> 02:19:01.797]  It'd be like if I stuck my foot in my mouth and started eating it.
[02:19:01.797 --> 02:19:04.058]  And I said, well, for dinner tonight I'll have my thigh.
[02:19:04.058 --> 02:19:06.478]  Yeah, lala land.
[02:19:06.478 --> 02:19:08.839]  There's no other way to describe it.
[02:19:09.164 --> 02:19:14.249]  These people are so out of touch with reality, because on the other hand, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:19:14.249 --> 02:19:21.117]  And if I could ever stress it, I've said it so many times in the past, this positively is not a conspiracy.
[02:19:21.117 --> 02:19:23.159]  It is an agenda.
[02:19:23.159 --> 02:19:27.343]  I was told about it back in June of 2008.
[02:19:27.343 --> 02:19:29.766]  Alex allowed me to tell it on his show for the first time.
[02:19:30.331 --> 02:19:35.573]  The 28th of July of 2008, everybody thought, well, what in the world is this guy saying?
[02:19:35.573 --> 02:19:37.154]  It can't possibly happen.
[02:19:37.154 --> 02:19:39.795]  But I've been told by them, one of them, it would.
[02:19:39.795 --> 02:19:42.776]  And here now, we're seeing an unfolding of everything.
[02:19:42.776 --> 02:19:45.277]  Now, here is where the big one drops right now.
[02:19:45.277 --> 02:19:47.618]  All right, stay there, and I'm going to get your take on the flu.
[02:19:47.618 --> 02:19:53.601]  Because, I mean, the economy's... Notice we're rolling over like a dead whale with its belly up in the sun.
[02:19:55.410 --> 02:20:00.158]  And birds are landing and pecking and having a meal right as the flu hits.
[02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:01.080]  I mean, come on.
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:01.781]  You worry.
[02:20:01.781 --> 02:20:04.125]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:20:04.125 --> 02:20:04.666]  Hi.
[02:20:04.666 --> 02:20:07.110]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:20:07.435 --> 02:20:11.979]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:20:11.979 --> 02:20:14.461]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:20:14.461 --> 02:20:17.803]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:20:17.803 --> 02:20:19.745]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:20:19.745 --> 02:20:22.527]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:20:22.527 --> 02:20:26.250]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:20:26.250 --> 02:20:30.674]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:20:30.674 --> 02:20:34.397]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:20:34.757 --> 02:20:41.081]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:20:41.081 --> 02:20:43.422]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:20:43.422 --> 02:20:45.544]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.

[02:20:50.206 --> 02:20:51.127]  Start now.
[02:20:51.127 --> 02:20:52.828]  Knowledge is power.
[02:20:52.828 --> 02:20:53.849]  Better take action.
[02:20:53.849 --> 02:21:01.553]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:04.115]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:07.353]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.353 --> 02:21:14.341]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:14.935 --> 02:21:21.142]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.142 --> 02:21:23.504]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.504 --> 02:21:26.007]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.007 --> 02:21:36.979]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.572 --> 02:21:39.253]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.253 --> 02:21:41.093]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.093 --> 02:21:48.016]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:57.840]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:01.241]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.241 --> 02:22:04.883]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:05.310 --> 02:22:11.195]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:11.195 --> 02:22:12.316]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:22:12.316 --> 02:22:17.020]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:30.272]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:30.812 --> 02:22:36.416]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:36.416 --> 02:22:43.080]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:45.922]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.922 --> 02:22:49.525]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:22:49.525 --> 02:22:50.145]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.145 --> 02:22:52.367]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:22:52.367 --> 02:22:52.427]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:01.160]  I think so.
[02:23:19.551 --> 02:23:19.911]  I think so.
[02:23:48.991 --> 02:23:52.215]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[02:23:52.215 --> 02:23:54.737]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:23:54.737 --> 02:23:56.019]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today!
[02:24:06.198 --> 02:24:15.545]  I am living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:24:15.545 --> 02:24:19.607]  We got famous rappers calling up.
[02:24:19.607 --> 02:24:20.868]  Charlie Sheen just called up me.
[02:24:20.868 --> 02:24:22.930]  He calls me, but I call him, but just weird.
[02:24:24.731 --> 02:24:28.135]  I mean, and they're fear-mongering over some flu.
[02:24:28.135 --> 02:24:30.437]  We've got a world government run by a bunch of bankers.
[02:24:30.437 --> 02:24:33.180]  And right up the street, you've got a buddy that works there.
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:34.181]  We reported here first.
[02:24:34.181 --> 02:24:36.423]  They were hoarding Tamiflu, this facility.
[02:24:36.423 --> 02:24:39.587]  Now you're telling us that they've got state police and a bunch of cars there.
[02:24:39.587 --> 02:24:42.129]  We got an email from a state police person.
[02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:45.151]  And you just called your buddy that works at the facility.
[02:24:45.151 --> 02:24:47.771]  Tell us what we know and then we'll go back to Lindsey Williams.
[02:24:47.771 --> 02:24:51.432]  A big recap of the top news that we're really at level six.
[02:24:51.432 --> 02:24:54.953]  The government claims more people are dying than what the media is saying.
[02:24:54.953 --> 02:24:56.874]  I have that from internal government documents.
[02:24:56.874 --> 02:24:58.174]  And we're being hack attacked.
[02:24:58.174 --> 02:25:00.795]  All the sites are being totally attack confirmed.
[02:25:01.455 --> 02:25:05.937]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, FruitNews.us.
[02:25:05.937 --> 02:25:08.438]  Lindsey Williams is online with us with his take on all this.
[02:25:08.438 --> 02:25:12.399]  I'm going to get his take on the flu in a moment and the big issue he was about to bring up in a short segment.
[02:25:12.399 --> 02:25:15.160]  But Rob Doo, my producer, you just confirmed with your friend.
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.361]  Yes.
[02:25:16.361 --> 02:25:21.022]  And what is going on with him guarding and I mean, I guess they think we're going to be like day of the neglect.
[02:25:21.022 --> 02:25:21.963]  Give me the Tamiflu!
[02:25:24.298 --> 02:25:27.859]  This is at 1100 West 49th Street.
[02:25:27.859 --> 02:25:36.682]  It's the state laboratory and behind it is a pharmacy warehouse and that is what is under lock and key right now.
[02:25:36.682 --> 02:25:39.563]  All entrances into there are being blocked off by state troopers.
[02:25:40.543 --> 02:25:50.770]  And that goes, it covers from 49th Street, if you go back all the way to 52nd, which does turn into North Loop, which corroborates the email that we received.
[02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:52.872]  And they're over there guarding it from the evil Americans.
[02:25:52.872 --> 02:25:53.572]  That's right.
[02:25:53.572 --> 02:26:06.361]  I mean, what would it take to have Americans rioting for the drugs, when they admit, the Japanese government admits, it's got some weird hallucinogen in it, makes people have all sorts of psychotic breaks, it's on the drug insert, it doesn't even really help you.
[02:26:06.361 --> 02:26:07.022]  Yeah.
[02:26:07.022 --> 02:26:08.343]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:26:08.863 --> 02:26:10.944]  It's showboating.
[02:26:10.944 --> 02:26:15.526]  My buddy heard, as he was walking through the hall, somebody saying, well, it's an election year, so it's a photo-op time.
[02:26:15.526 --> 02:26:19.927]  So, you know, it's time for politicians to get out and go, we're gonna save ya, you know.
[02:26:19.927 --> 02:26:21.688]  So even the cops know what's going on?
[02:26:21.688 --> 02:26:22.628]  Pretty much, yes.
[02:26:22.628 --> 02:26:23.949]  This is disgusting criminals.
[02:26:24.409 --> 02:26:26.250]  Alright, thank you so much, Rob Dood.
[02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:28.611]  Oh, quick update on the Level 6 thing.
[02:26:28.611 --> 02:26:34.734]  I heard, I just got an email and I'm going to confirm it, that CNN said we're going to go to Level 6 officially in two days.
[02:26:34.734 --> 02:26:37.516]  So, that pretty much goes with what we've been saying.
[02:26:37.516 --> 02:26:40.377]  Which is exactly what the document says, so that would confirm all the other stuff.
[02:26:40.377 --> 02:26:41.178]  Thank you.
[02:26:41.178 --> 02:26:53.184]  Sorry to interrupt you, Lindsey Williams, but this is happening, because this same document that's about 38 hours old, that we've had since yesterday, and this is confirmed from the source, in administration, in the school district here, from the state,
[02:26:54.468 --> 02:26:56.869]  Thank you Alex for letting me get on the subject of the swine flu.
[02:26:56.869 --> 02:26:58.550]  This is one of my pet peeves.
[02:26:58.550 --> 02:27:00.671]  There was a doctor in Mexico City who had the vaccination.
[02:27:00.671 --> 02:27:01.732]  He died with the flu.
[02:27:18.755 --> 02:27:21.177]  You see, it's not doing any good.
[02:27:21.177 --> 02:27:24.300]  I was hoping I didn't have to say this, but you brought the subject up.
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:26.702]  I know this is number one issue right now.
[02:27:26.702 --> 02:27:28.404]  Tamiflu is not doing an ounce of good.
[02:27:28.404 --> 02:27:31.907]  Tamiflu is made for another type of strain altogether.
[02:27:31.907 --> 02:27:36.611]  It has nothing to do, will not have any effect whatsoever on the swine flu.
[02:27:36.611 --> 02:27:39.674]  It is a, uh, a placido.
[02:27:39.674 --> 02:27:41.976]  The people are taking this thinking it's going to help them.
[02:27:42.446 --> 02:27:44.047]  And that they're going to be okay?
[02:27:44.047 --> 02:27:46.950]  And it is not even prepared for the swine flu.
[02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:50.313]  Vaccinations will not do you any good.
[02:27:50.313 --> 02:27:57.518]  They do not and have not had time to prepare a vaccination for the swine flu.
[02:27:57.518 --> 02:28:02.282]  And there is positively nothing that Homeland Security can do for it.
[02:28:02.282 --> 02:28:04.424]  And I like to call this Obama flu.
[02:28:04.424 --> 02:28:06.146]  He won't close the borders.
[02:28:06.146 --> 02:28:07.787]  He won't protect the American people.
[02:28:08.214 --> 02:28:14.082]  Mexico is closing down everything, and our president hasn't got enough sense to close down our borders.
[02:28:14.082 --> 02:28:25.898]  I like to call it the Obama flu, really, because he's perpetrating this thing, knowing good and well that the Tamiflu vaccine is not going to do anything but make some government officials who are in the business
[02:28:26.708 --> 02:28:30.031]  Millions of dollars while the American people sit back and die.
[02:28:30.031 --> 02:28:31.052]  You've got to get it.
[02:28:31.052 --> 02:28:32.113]  Please.
[02:28:32.113 --> 02:28:37.598]  Yeah, the Tamiflu drug has been proven to... I mean, pull it up.
[02:28:37.598 --> 02:28:40.360]  Pull up the insert for the Tamiflu drug and then the vaccine.
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:45.004]  They're already claiming they've got a vaccine when they said it took six to eight weeks to make it.
[02:28:45.004 --> 02:28:47.586]  How could they just instantly have the vaccine, Lindsey?
[02:28:47.586 --> 02:28:51.330]  And the experts are saying that we've listed here that it looks like it's genetically engineered.
[02:28:52.694 --> 02:28:57.056]  Yeah, there's no way in the world they can have a vaccine for this because it's something completely different.
[02:28:57.056 --> 02:29:05.440]  It's a whole different strain and the Tamiflu, no single vaccine anywhere right now will handle the swine flu.
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.862]  They, they know that they are totally helpless because they want it to happen exactly the way they've got it.
[02:29:10.862 --> 02:29:12.223]  Now, please, I beg of you.
[02:29:12.223 --> 02:29:16.665]  I prepared a one hour presentation on vaccinations.
[02:29:16.665 --> 02:29:17.785]  I beg of you.
[02:29:17.785 --> 02:29:18.806]  I'll give you my 800 number later on.
[02:29:20.214 --> 02:29:22.735]  A one-hour presentation on vaccinations.
[02:29:22.735 --> 02:29:25.016]  I am so disturbed of what's happening here this week.
[02:29:25.016 --> 02:29:27.478]  I know I've written two books on alternative health.
[02:29:27.478 --> 02:29:40.664]  My main thing is crude oil, and I know from what the gentleman told me back in the middle of June what's going to happen to the finances, and the crude oil, and the banking, and all the rest of this, but I had to... Alright, Lindsey, stay there then.
[02:29:40.664 --> 02:29:43.046]  We'll come back, take phone calls, talk about that.
[02:29:43.046 --> 02:29:49.709]  What do you see happening next in the economy in hindsight of that hour-long conversation with the former head of a major oil company?
[02:29:51.519 --> 02:29:55.449]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.449 --> 02:29:58.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.471 --> 02:30:04.553]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:30:04.553 --> 02:30:10.076]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:30:10.076 --> 02:30:15.799]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:15.799 --> 02:30:17.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:26.285]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:30:26.585 --> 02:30:28.425]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[02:30:28.425 --> 02:30:32.646]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:30:32.646 --> 02:30:37.647]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[02:30:55.550 --> 02:31:01.882]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:31:01.882 --> 02:31:07.132]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.905 --> 02:31:13.766]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.766 --> 02:31:20.288]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.288 --> 02:31:22.248]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.248 --> 02:31:24.709]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:31:24.709 --> 02:31:35.591]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:37.896 --> 02:31:39.557]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:41.417]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.417 --> 02:31:48.340]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:31:56.583 --> 02:31:58.163]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.163 --> 02:31:59.364]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.181 --> 02:32:06.748]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[02:32:06.748 --> 02:32:09.731]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.

[02:33:21.175 --> 02:33:24.117]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing.
[02:33:24.117 --> 02:33:28.060]  But they got a hold of me.
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:31.123]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing.
[02:33:31.123 --> 02:33:33.905]  So they got a hold of me.
[02:33:33.905 --> 02:33:38.849]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[02:33:38.849 --> 02:33:43.492]  I helped the blind to see.
[02:33:43.492 --> 02:33:47.675]  I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[02:33:47.675 --> 02:33:50.598]  There can't be a scene with me.
[02:33:59.366 --> 02:34:03.409]  We are back live.
[02:34:03.409 --> 02:34:09.353]  It's got to be No More Mr. Night Sky, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:09.353 --> 02:34:17.198]  The New World Order is coming down on us and we need to start being aggressive about our liberties and our freedoms and not putting up with their tyranny.
[02:34:17.198 --> 02:34:19.800]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:20.700]  to 3 p.m.
[02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:22.962]  Central Standard Time.
[02:34:22.962 --> 02:34:26.804]  Don't forget, we have the free podcast with over 135,000 and growing.
[02:34:30.067 --> 02:34:34.990]  Subscribers downloading it for free every day at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:37.712]  You just click on the listen page.
[02:34:37.712 --> 02:34:40.794]  You can find the code right there for the free podcast.
[02:34:40.794 --> 02:34:45.898]  We'll serve that to your mp3 or iPod device when you want, where you want, how you want.
[02:34:45.898 --> 02:34:47.439]  Also we're being hacked on all sides.
[02:34:47.439 --> 02:34:51.642]  They're trying to shut us down with a concerted effort because we built our architecture to have a lot of
[02:34:52.759 --> 02:34:57.741]  Fleet ships, you could use the parable or the parallel out there.
[02:34:57.741 --> 02:34:59.241]  So they're trying to attack them all.
[02:34:59.241 --> 02:35:00.481]  They've got a lot of targets to hit.
[02:35:00.481 --> 02:35:02.062]  We'll just launch more ships.
[02:35:02.062 --> 02:35:03.182]  That's how we do it around here.
[02:35:03.182 --> 02:35:04.763]  We have a rule.
[02:35:04.763 --> 02:35:06.343]  When we get attacked, we launch another ship.
[02:35:06.343 --> 02:35:07.784]  We're going to launch a big one.
[02:35:07.784 --> 02:35:08.784]  This is the biggest attack ever.
[02:35:08.784 --> 02:35:12.405]  We're going to launch a Dreadnought in the Info War.
[02:35:12.405 --> 02:35:19.527]  And this Dreadnought will be text only, so that it'll be an aggregator of all the sites.
[02:35:19.527 --> 02:35:21.068]  The SS Tyranny Crusher.
[02:35:22.765 --> 02:35:28.608]  The USS Tyranny Crusher.
[02:35:28.608 --> 02:35:32.491]  Now, I've got a lot of really serious news here.
[02:35:32.491 --> 02:35:34.312]  It's so incredible I'm having trouble even covering it.
[02:35:34.312 --> 02:35:44.938]  I'm going to recap that in a moment, but Lindsay Williams, I want to go to Robert, Mark, Kathy, Mary, Pastor James and others that are patiently holding from all around the country with their comments about the flu.
[02:35:45.618 --> 02:35:57.412]  But dealing with the economy, the government knows when they have Biden come out and say, don't get on planes, don't get on trains or subways, that this is going to cause the economy and confidence to be lost.
[02:35:57.412 --> 02:36:01.577]  So they'll say, everything's over, we're all in trouble, but we'll protect you, everything's fine.
[02:36:01.577 --> 02:36:03.679]  They scare you and then play the part of protector.
[02:36:04.571 --> 02:36:07.713]  You can see the psychology.
[02:36:07.713 --> 02:36:09.194]  Clearly they want to destroy the economies.
[02:36:09.194 --> 02:36:11.656]  I mean, that's what they said to you about the oil.
[02:36:11.656 --> 02:36:14.238]  It's meant to destroy all the economies.
[02:36:14.238 --> 02:36:18.681]  When did he tell you that they were going to stop the destruction?
[02:36:18.681 --> 02:36:23.224]  I guess when we're all just begging and licking the boots of the stormtroopers?
[02:36:23.224 --> 02:36:26.086]  I mean, do we have to worship world government?
[02:36:26.086 --> 02:36:29.949]  I mean, what does it take for them to stop the raping?
[02:36:29.949 --> 02:36:32.030]  His remark word for word was, Chaplain,
[02:36:32.538 --> 02:36:37.461]  America will see a financial collapse that will be so great, and here's your time frame right here.
[02:36:37.461 --> 02:36:40.462]  He said it will take years for us to come out of it.
[02:36:40.462 --> 02:36:58.912]  Now, since you have so many new listeners, Alex, let me just very quickly say, hey, back in June, the middle of June of 2008, I had a phone call from one of these elite that I lived with for three years' time on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline when I was a chaplain on that pipeline, had executive status, sat in that board meeting for three years' time,
[02:36:59.423 --> 02:37:03.485]  My life was completely changed when I lived with the elite.
[02:37:03.485 --> 02:37:14.969]  I am so thankful that by the providence of God, He allowed me to have the privilege of doing what very few people on the face of the earth have ever had, and that is literally living with the elite for three years' time.
[02:37:14.969 --> 02:37:19.071]  And this gentleman told me back in the middle of June, he said, all of these things are going to happen.
[02:37:19.071 --> 02:37:25.673]  Now let me recap how they're fulfilling right now, and then I'm going to give you what can you expect.
[02:37:25.673 --> 02:37:27.994]  I'm going to give it to you right down the line, each of the steps.
[02:37:28.539 --> 02:37:31.781]  In light of what that man told me is what you can expect from this point on.
[02:37:31.781 --> 02:37:40.065]  Okay, right now, number one, Dow Jones, I mean Dow Chemicals profits were down 97% in the first quarter.
[02:37:40.065 --> 02:37:43.387]  All of this is a part of that total structure breakdown.
[02:37:43.387 --> 02:37:51.831]  I am quite sure that this swine flu thing is likewise just one more pot and step to fit into the total proposal.
[02:37:52.278 --> 02:37:53.479]  The economy's contracting at over 6% a quarter!
[02:38:11.104 --> 02:38:11.404]  Yeah.
[02:38:26.204 --> 02:38:29.425]  That's the real crisis that we know is coming down on us right now.
[02:38:29.425 --> 02:38:31.066]  That is the issue.
[02:38:31.066 --> 02:38:40.811]  But nobody's, again, worried about all the laws and treaties and world government being set up right now because they're busy wringing their hands over the flu as the government terrorizes everybody.
[02:38:40.811 --> 02:38:41.991]  Go ahead.
[02:38:41.991 --> 02:38:50.315]  Yeah, if you work for a city, a city government, or you work for the state, any state in America, tax receipts, it better scare you to death.
[02:38:50.315 --> 02:38:52.696]  Tax receipts are down $54 billion in one month.
[02:38:55.413 --> 02:38:57.573]  And it takes about three months for these to show up.
[02:38:57.573 --> 02:39:00.834]  You wait until 30 to 60 days from now, you've never seen the light.
[02:39:00.834 --> 02:39:06.595]  You know, every time you say that, I have these fools email me going, Lindsey, you know, they have a set tax on the gas.
[02:39:06.595 --> 02:39:07.475]  It's not going down.
[02:39:07.475 --> 02:39:10.736]  And then they admit all the tax revenues on gas are down.
[02:39:10.736 --> 02:39:12.256]  Federal, state.
[02:39:12.256 --> 02:39:17.917]  They admit that the revenues on property values, on tax receipts, state sales tax.
[02:39:17.917 --> 02:39:21.657]  I mean, it's all over the news every day that tax receipts are plunging.
[02:39:21.657 --> 02:39:23.478]  And they just say, you're lying, Lindsey!
[02:39:23.478 --> 02:39:24.098]  It isn't true!
[02:39:24.998 --> 02:39:27.899]  Well, again, Alex, I've never had so much trouble being right.
[02:39:27.899 --> 02:39:32.741]  I've never had so much fun being right in all my life, but I'm not right.
[02:39:32.741 --> 02:39:39.945]  It's the fact that the person told me this, who is one of them, back in the middle of June, and I merely voiced it, and I'm sitting here watching it happen.
[02:39:39.945 --> 02:39:53.170]  Now, the greatest drop in exports in the United States of America, that means how much we're shipping to other countries and other parts of the world, in 40 years, the greatest drop in 40 years, has plunged 30% since January 1st of this year.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:01.421]  272 major metropolitan areas reported unemployment soaring.
[02:40:01.421 --> 02:40:07.703]  Real estate in the Phoenix, Arizona area is down 50% since the height of the boom.
[02:40:07.703 --> 02:40:12.704]  Whirlpool Corporation, one of the big ones of America, profits down 28% this quarter.
[02:40:12.704 --> 02:40:15.064]  CNN News just reported that 253 police officers
[02:40:19.813 --> 02:40:22.116]  Well, laid off in New York State.
[02:40:22.116 --> 02:40:22.356]  Why?
[02:40:22.356 --> 02:40:24.099]  They don't have the money to pay them.
[02:40:24.099 --> 02:40:25.761]  This is an open door for criminals.
[02:40:25.761 --> 02:40:28.404]  Yeah, they're now announcing it's connected in other areas.
[02:40:28.404 --> 02:40:30.167]  The Army will now be their police.
[02:40:30.167 --> 02:40:31.188]  You can't make this up!
[02:40:32.099 --> 02:40:34.460]  In fact, Google Marshall Law and Schenectady.
[02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:44.823]  And the mayor's going, yeah, we're going to have troops here now, because we're not going to have... I mean, it's cuckoo land, and it's all designed, the globalists will wreck whole nations to get power.
[02:40:44.823 --> 02:40:45.623]  They've done it.
[02:40:45.623 --> 02:40:52.265]  They'll kill a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis, folks, so they can have a black hole for no-bid weapons contracts and oil.
[02:40:52.265 --> 02:40:53.265]  They'll do it to us.
[02:40:53.265 --> 02:40:53.846]  That's the thing.
[02:40:53.846 --> 02:40:54.746]  The New World Order
[02:40:55.683 --> 02:40:57.545]  He's cold-blooded.
[02:40:57.545 --> 02:40:59.227]  Let's take a few calls, Lindsey.
[02:40:59.227 --> 02:41:00.849]  Let's talk to Robert in California.
[02:41:00.849 --> 02:41:02.010]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:03.752]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:41:03.752 --> 02:41:05.133]  Good day, gentlemen.
[02:41:05.133 --> 02:41:10.279]  I sent it to Rob Dew and Aaron, as well as a couple other agencies.
[02:41:10.279 --> 02:41:16.466]  We got a proclamation out here in Los Angeles County that our Los Angeles County is under emergency.
[02:41:17.162 --> 02:41:21.184]  Let me see, it's further that the cop is propping before the state, okay.
[02:41:21.184 --> 02:41:34.450]  Now for this, proclaimed and ordered by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors that a local emergency exists throughout Los Angeles County and shall be deemed to continue to exist until its termination as proclaimed by this board.
[02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:42.014]  And also, I don't know if you guys watch too much television, but last, on Tuesday as well, on the 28th,
[02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:54.197]  Um, Law and Order had a, uh, a television show where, uh, this lady was brought up on charges for not vaccinating her son that killed another child with the measles.
[02:41:54.197 --> 02:41:56.078]  Yeah, notice how that's perfectly timed.
[02:41:56.078 --> 02:42:00.121]  I have literally been sent YouTube clips of scores and scores of TV shows.
[02:42:00.121 --> 02:42:03.484]  My wife sees them, where if you don't take the vaccine, you're a murderer.
[02:42:04.104 --> 02:42:07.265]  And they never point out, wait a minute, this other kid's been vaccinated.
[02:42:07.265 --> 02:42:09.947]  How did you give it to him if he was vaccinated?
[02:42:09.947 --> 02:42:12.288]  And they're getting everybody ready for forced inoculation.
[02:42:12.288 --> 02:42:14.769]  Time, Newsweek are saying we need to do it.
[02:42:14.769 --> 02:42:20.872]  They're setting the precedent with this because they tried to, in fact, did you get the swine flu fear-mongering YouTube video?
[02:42:21.766 --> 02:42:22.407]  That I asked for earlier.
[02:42:22.407 --> 02:42:23.367]  Do you guys have that?
[02:42:23.367 --> 02:42:24.428]  Let's play that right now.
[02:42:24.428 --> 02:42:27.591]  I appreciate your call, Mark in Oregon.
[02:42:27.591 --> 02:42:30.433]  I mean, Robert in California, then Mark in Oregon in a moment.
[02:42:30.433 --> 02:42:32.715]  This is the type of fear-mongering.
[02:42:32.715 --> 02:42:34.757]  This is the audio for radio from PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:34.757 --> 02:42:37.099]  They're watching it right now, PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:42:37.099 --> 02:42:42.003]  This, see, people wouldn't do it, so then they said, okay, it's a regulation, you gotta take it.
[02:42:42.003 --> 02:42:44.045]  And then they said, oh, it's a law, but it's not really a law.
[02:42:44.045 --> 02:42:47.188]  And they go, we'll arrest you, we'll arrest you, but there's no law.
[02:42:47.188 --> 02:42:49.390]  Then they run TV shows where you get arrested if you don't.
[02:42:49.930 --> 02:42:53.311]  Selling everybody that it's a foregone conclusion, it's the law.
[02:42:53.311 --> 02:42:57.731]  Showing you the media, corporate whore, liars, for the hardcore crooks they are.
[02:42:57.731 --> 02:43:00.252]  And if you just wake up to their illusion, it'll all stop.
[02:43:00.252 --> 02:43:02.672]  But they know you're waking up, so they're going to stage these events.
[02:43:02.672 --> 02:43:04.873]  Go ahead and play that clip.
[02:43:04.873 --> 02:43:09.254]  This is the fear-mongering from YouTube of the swine flu.
[02:43:09.254 --> 02:43:12.914]  After they staged that release, then tried to forcibly inject people.
[02:43:12.914 --> 02:43:15.635]  A bunch of people died, so they had to suspend it.
[02:43:15.635 --> 02:43:16.635]  Now they're trying again.
[02:43:16.635 --> 02:43:16.975]  Here we go.
[02:43:18.379 --> 02:43:19.640]  I don't need another flu shot.
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:21.521]  I had a flu shot last year.
[02:43:21.521 --> 02:43:24.182]  A swine flu epidemic may be coming.
[02:43:24.182 --> 02:43:25.523]  Swine flu shot?
[02:43:25.523 --> 02:43:26.223]  Well, I don't know.
[02:43:26.223 --> 02:43:27.484]  I've been thinking about it.
[02:43:27.484 --> 02:43:31.146]  It could make you very sick.
[02:43:31.146 --> 02:43:32.346]  Swine flu?
[02:43:32.346 --> 02:43:35.368]  Man, I'm too fast today to catch me.
[02:43:35.368 --> 02:43:37.249]  You'll want to be protected.
[02:43:37.249 --> 02:43:39.910]  I'm the healthiest 55-year-old you've ever seen.
[02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:42.512]  Hey, I play golf every weekend.
[02:43:42.512 --> 02:43:44.252]  Get a shot of protection.
[02:43:44.252 --> 02:43:45.153]  The swine flu shot.
[02:43:49.218 --> 02:43:51.979]  Joe brought it home from the office.
[02:43:51.979 --> 02:43:56.702]  He gave it to Betty, and one of his kids, and to Betty's mother.
[02:43:56.702 --> 02:44:00.864]  But Betty's mother went back to California the next day.
[02:44:00.864 --> 02:44:09.028]  On her way to the airport, she gave it to a cab driver, a ticket agent, and one of the charming stewardesses.
[02:44:09.028 --> 02:44:15.491]  At school, Joe's kid gave it to some other kids, and Mrs. Merrill got it and gave it to her husband.
[02:44:16.878 --> 02:44:20.702]  In California, Betty's mother gave it to her best friend, Dottie.
[02:44:20.702 --> 02:44:23.305]  But Dottie had a heart condition and she died.
[02:44:23.305 --> 02:44:33.155]  But before she died, Dottie gave it to her girlfriend, the mailman, the keeper boy, and the vet when she went to pick up her chihuahua.
[02:44:35.314 --> 02:44:39.783]  If a swine flu epidemic comes, this is how it could spread.
[02:44:39.783 --> 02:44:44.152]  You'll want to be protected, especially if you're elderly or chronically ill.
[02:44:44.152 --> 02:44:45.314]  Get a shot of protection.
[02:44:45.314 --> 02:44:46.817]  The Swine Flu Shot.
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:50.341]  So there's the propaganda.
[02:44:50.341 --> 02:44:56.663]  So the government can try to make you take something that's a made-up vaccine every year that never matches the supposed flu.
[02:44:56.663 --> 02:45:01.385]  And they're off injecting people in Mexico with a just separate flu shot.
[02:45:01.385 --> 02:45:02.406]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:45:02.406 --> 02:45:06.788]  Doctors admit it'll actually make you sicker to have something else to weigh down your immune system.
[02:45:06.788 --> 02:45:07.768]  And they just don't care.
[02:45:07.768 --> 02:45:08.608]  They're like, Ha ha!
[02:45:08.608 --> 02:45:09.289]  You will take it!
[02:45:09.289 --> 02:45:09.689]  Ha ha!
[02:45:09.689 --> 02:45:10.869]  SWAT team, stand by!
[02:45:10.869 --> 02:45:12.150]  Ha ha!
[02:45:12.150 --> 02:45:13.350]  We have the weapons!
[02:45:13.350 --> 02:45:14.091]  We're the government!
[02:45:14.631 --> 02:45:19.714]  You know, we just run all these tests killing foster children with tests and biologicals before and radiating them.
[02:45:19.714 --> 02:45:24.356]  Trust us, we're only murdering eugenicists who love the New World Order.
[02:45:24.356 --> 02:45:32.481]  Uh, and, you know, somebody ought to take that clip for, like, a white zombie or something, you know, music, because they always use, like, weird, scary, creepy stuff in the intro, like...
[02:45:33.021 --> 02:45:38.803]  And Betty didn't survive, and then she gave it to Billy, and then she... She didn't make it.
[02:45:38.803 --> 02:45:39.763]  She's dead!
[02:45:39.763 --> 02:45:44.185]  I mean, just so sick, these demonic freaks!
[02:45:44.185 --> 02:45:48.126]  Uh, Lindsey Williams, I mean, the fear-mongering is just out of control.
[02:45:48.126 --> 02:45:49.006]  Yeah, positively.
[02:45:49.006 --> 02:45:51.107]  The swine flu shot, there is no such creature.
[02:45:51.107 --> 02:45:52.308]  It doesn't exist.
[02:45:52.308 --> 02:45:56.969]  They haven't had time to produce anything for this new strain.
[02:45:56.969 --> 02:46:02.511]  And when they say that they're going to use the Tamiflu shot, well, that was for something that existed a year or two ago.
[02:46:03.717 --> 02:46:05.118]  It's a total misnomer.
[02:46:05.118 --> 02:46:13.204]  MMR, DPT, all these shots they give to the children, all it does is weakens the immune system so later in life they can't overcome what comes their way.
[02:46:13.204 --> 02:46:16.106]  Vaccinations, oh my goodness, I beg of you.
[02:46:16.106 --> 02:46:17.787]  Well, let me give it to you, please.
[02:46:17.787 --> 02:46:20.189]  Just one time, a time or so here.
[02:46:20.189 --> 02:46:21.590]  My 800 number.
[02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:23.531]  I have an 8-set DVD.
[02:46:23.531 --> 02:46:27.454]  One of them, DVDs and CDs, one of them is on vaccinations.
[02:46:27.454 --> 02:46:29.015]  You've got to hear about this.
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:40.484]  I give it in a one hour, you watch it on your television, what's happening in relation to vaccinations, it'll tell you what to expect about all this swine flu thing, and all that's happening financially.
[02:46:40.484 --> 02:46:43.986]  And this week, this week, I prepared a new presentation.
[02:46:43.986 --> 02:46:45.687]  You've never gotten it before.
[02:46:45.687 --> 02:46:48.848]  I beg of you, I'm trying to do this up to date this week.
[02:46:48.848 --> 02:46:49.368]  Please call 800-321-8000.
[02:46:52.276 --> 02:46:52.596]  2-9-0-0.
[02:46:52.596 --> 02:46:57.458]  You can get my 8-DVD-CD set or my 4-DVD-CD set.
[02:46:57.458 --> 02:47:00.639]  I beg of you, get the one on vaccinations.
[02:47:00.639 --> 02:47:02.980]  800-321-2900.
[02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:05.701]  Now, let me tell you what's happening next.
[02:47:05.701 --> 02:47:11.443]  Alex, I'll break it down to the best that I can see it in relation to what the man told me back the middle of June.
[02:47:11.443 --> 02:47:12.824]  You can expect the following.
[02:47:12.824 --> 02:47:20.427]  First of all, the very next shoe that's going to be, you're going to have to put on, is the commercial real estate bubble.
[02:47:20.427 --> 02:47:21.447]  It will burst.
[02:47:21.934 --> 02:47:25.756]  General Growth Properties, Inc., just a few days ago.
[02:47:25.756 --> 02:47:29.497]  Biggest real estate failure in the history of the United States of America.
[02:47:29.497 --> 02:47:30.738]  Did you hear me say?
[02:47:30.738 --> 02:47:33.119]  The history of the United States of America.
[02:47:33.119 --> 02:47:34.839]  The biggest real estate bubble.
[02:47:34.839 --> 02:47:37.060]  You thought the housing was big.
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:38.461]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[02:47:38.461 --> 02:47:42.162]  Secondly, you can expect insurance companies to begin failing.
[02:47:42.162 --> 02:47:47.284]  Travelers Insurance posted a 32% loss in the first quarter of this year.
[02:47:47.284 --> 02:47:49.085]  Hospitalization Insurance?
[02:47:49.085 --> 02:47:50.245]  How about your life insurance?
[02:47:50.245 --> 02:47:51.686]  You've been paying on all of your life.
[02:47:52.116 --> 02:47:54.398]  How about all these other insurance policies you've got?
[02:47:54.398 --> 02:47:57.140]  Do you know what they're going to be worth in just a short period of time?
[02:47:57.140 --> 02:47:58.081]  They're not insured.
[02:47:58.081 --> 02:48:00.122]  Annuities... ...in the process of the whole thing.
[02:48:00.122 --> 02:48:01.423]  Annuities aren't insured either.
[02:48:01.423 --> 02:48:02.804]  Go ahead.
[02:48:02.804 --> 02:48:03.324]  Yeah.
[02:48:03.324 --> 02:48:09.069]  And the next thing you're going to need is... And the government's going to pay out your FDIC bank accounts with inflated fiat money.
[02:48:10.407 --> 02:48:12.128]  Well, sure, there's no way in the world.
[02:48:12.128 --> 02:48:15.891]  Well, anyway, I've talked about that before.
[02:48:15.891 --> 02:48:19.374]  The dollar positively will collapse.
[02:48:19.374 --> 02:48:21.015]  It is inevitable.
[02:48:21.015 --> 02:48:24.357]  For a while there, I thought, well, maybe you're wrong, Lindsey.
[02:48:24.357 --> 02:48:25.798]  But no, not anymore.
[02:48:25.798 --> 02:48:28.780]  The dollar positively will collapse.
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:34.945]  The loss of tax base is going to paralyze the states and the cities.
[02:48:34.945 --> 02:48:36.926]  You notice what I said there a few moments ago?
[02:48:36.926 --> 02:48:39.088]  You've had billions of dollars of tax.
[02:48:39.793 --> 02:48:44.436]  Loss, revenues, $54 billion in one month's time.
[02:48:44.436 --> 02:48:52.741]  If you work for the school, the government, employee, the highway department, the infrastructure of America, every bit of this depends on taxes.
[02:48:52.741 --> 02:48:58.704]  And the tax loss now is so great because of the corporate profits being down and what's being lost at the gas pump.
[02:48:58.704 --> 02:49:05.389]  Folks, if you work for a state, you must make preparations immediately because there's going to be major cuts.
[02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.989]  The interest
[02:49:06.545 --> 02:49:06.745]  All right.
[02:49:19.827 --> 02:49:22.108]  But Lindsey, we're safe because Obama cares about us!
[02:49:37.557 --> 02:49:41.100]  I mean, he's got a nice suit and reads off a teleprompter, man.
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:43.862]  You know, come on, you're not racist, are you?
[02:49:43.862 --> 02:49:46.724]  I mean, have you noticed how they inject that and everything?
[02:49:46.724 --> 02:49:53.810]  Oh, you're protesting the foreign banks and the 12.8 trillion to them, and the National News said because you don't like black people.
[02:49:53.810 --> 02:49:55.731]  They said that about all the Tea Party people.
[02:49:55.731 --> 02:49:58.714]  I mean, this is how criminal this media and this government is.
[02:49:58.714 --> 02:50:02.817]  This steady diet of horse dung they try to cram down people's throats.
[02:50:02.817 --> 02:50:03.538]  Let's take a call.
[02:50:03.538 --> 02:50:04.578]  Mark in Oregon, quickly.
[02:50:04.578 --> 02:50:04.979]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:50:07.116 --> 02:50:09.258]  Hey, good day to you, Alex.
[02:50:09.258 --> 02:50:10.779]  Pastor Lindsey.
[02:50:10.779 --> 02:50:12.660]  Hi.
[02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:16.764]  Alex, I really concur 100%.
[02:50:16.764 --> 02:50:21.207]  I've been wanting to say it to you, you know, for probably almost a year.
[02:50:21.207 --> 02:50:22.648]  Just one day I had it in my heart.
[02:50:22.648 --> 02:50:25.270]  I think the Lord gave it to me to say it to you, you know.
[02:50:25.270 --> 02:50:33.617]  And I think it applies to all of us to get through these times and the times that are coming up here immediately.
[02:50:34.306 --> 02:50:40.691]  Is that we keep our eyes on our reward that's promised to us in heaven by God Almighty.
[02:50:40.691 --> 02:50:41.451]  I agree.
[02:50:41.451 --> 02:50:42.492]  Stay there, stay there Mark.
[02:50:42.492 --> 02:50:43.213]  Out of hold.
[02:50:43.213 --> 02:50:46.275]  And I want to ask Lindsey Williams as a Baptist pastor himself.
[02:50:46.275 --> 02:50:56.623]  What do you do about all these Romans 13 churches paid off by the clergy response teams by FEMA to tell their flocks to lay down the government and take the shots and do as you're told?
[02:50:56.623 --> 02:50:57.703]  How devilish is that?
[02:50:57.703 --> 02:51:01.026]  We'll find out from Lindsey Williams on the other side from a pastor's perspective.
[02:51:01.684 --> 02:51:05.125]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:51:05.125 --> 02:51:09.367]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:51:09.367 --> 02:51:21.031]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:51:21.031 --> 02:51:26.473]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular
[02:51:26.513 --> 02:51:26.773]  I'm good.
[02:51:48.178 --> 02:51:50.879]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com.
[02:51:50.879 --> 02:51:53.759]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A-Silver dot com.
[02:51:53.759 --> 02:51:56.340]  Or call 888-213-4338.
[02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:58.180]  888-213-4338.
[02:51:58.180 --> 02:52:01.941]  And help us win this battle.
[02:52:01.941 --> 02:52:07.742]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.742 --> 02:52:14.723]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:52:15.333 --> 02:52:21.916]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.916 --> 02:52:23.876]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.876 --> 02:52:26.397]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.397 --> 02:52:37.342]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.964 --> 02:52:39.625]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.625 --> 02:52:41.486]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.486 --> 02:52:48.411]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.656 --> 02:52:58.237]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.237 --> 02:52:59.418]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.328 --> 02:53:03.789]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnobl with Midas Resources.
[02:53:03.789 --> 02:53:07.590]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:10.411]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:53:10.411 --> 02:53:17.614]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:18.054]  I'm good.
[02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:38.353]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:53:38.353 --> 02:53:44.158]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:53:44.158 --> 02:53:49.202]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:53:49.202 --> 02:53:53.665]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:53:53.665 --> 02:53:56.307]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:53:56.307 --> 02:53:56.767]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:24.143]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.
[02:54:24.143 --> 02:54:29.645]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[02:54:29.645 --> 02:54:33.106]  So, Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[02:54:33.106 --> 02:54:34.786]  Excellent.
[02:54:34.786 --> 02:54:36.067]  Great digger.
[02:54:37.413 --> 02:54:39.615]  Well, you dig my grave.
[02:54:39.615 --> 02:54:40.956]  Well, you make it shallow.
[02:54:40.956 --> 02:54:43.818]  Well, you make it shallow.
[02:54:43.818 --> 02:54:44.518]  So.
[02:54:44.518 --> 02:54:47.640]  So I can feel the rain.
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:49.081]  Grave digger.
[02:54:49.081 --> 02:54:51.403]  Grave digger.
[02:54:51.403 --> 02:54:52.103]  All right, Mark.
[02:54:52.103 --> 02:54:53.364]  Go ahead and finish up your point.
[02:54:53.364 --> 02:54:55.706]  We'll finish up with Lindsey Williams.
[02:54:55.706 --> 02:54:56.426]  Yeah, Alex, I...
[02:54:57.685 --> 02:55:13.318]  I believe that you have, I believe Pastor Williams has, I believe I have, I believe all of God's children have run their races, have lived their lives well, and we're getting to the point now where, in all probability, we're basically at the end of our physical life here.
[02:55:13.318 --> 02:55:24.707]  And I face that, and I think it's important for all of us to face that, but at the same time, to keep our eyes on our eternal future, as it's promised to us in the Word of God, and it's written in our hearts.
[02:55:24.707 --> 02:55:25.167]  We know it.
[02:55:26.038 --> 02:55:30.459]  That we're going to be an eternity, and it's going to be never-ending bliss.
[02:55:30.459 --> 02:55:33.400]  And we're living in the opposite of that at this time.
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:43.183]  This time is going to be very short, and especially for us, because, especially in this country, and really throughout the whole world at first here, there's going to be mass death.
[02:55:43.183 --> 02:55:44.663]  And we're right on top of it, Alex.
[02:55:44.663 --> 02:55:46.604]  This is not a beta test.
[02:55:46.604 --> 02:55:51.925]  This is actually a beta test, if you'd want to call it that, that's co-joined to the main move.
[02:55:51.925 --> 02:55:53.566]  And that's what Steve Quayle has said.
[02:55:54.700 --> 02:56:06.908]  Uh, I think in your heart of hearts you realize that, and I think it's time to classify this as that without a doubt that that is where we are and to move accordingly for our own physical self-preservation.
[02:56:06.908 --> 02:56:16.494]  If I was in your tremendous shoes, being who I am, what I would do, and I'm not saying it's what you should do, Alex, but my heart just tells me that anyone should do it, including you.
[02:56:16.494 --> 02:56:20.837]  I would get on an airplane with your family, and I would leave this country.
[02:56:21.795 --> 02:56:25.619]  Because you have been the captain who's tried to save the Titanic here.
[02:56:25.619 --> 02:56:30.164]  We've all been on the ship with you, Alex, as truth seekers and info warriors.
[02:56:30.164 --> 02:56:34.289]  But there comes a time when you have to realize where things are.
[02:56:34.289 --> 02:56:38.714]  And where they are just dictates to save your innocent family.
[02:56:39.096 --> 02:56:42.261]  That you're putting them in a place of safety and I think you deserve to go with them.
[02:56:42.261 --> 02:56:48.650]  I don't believe you deserve to go down with the ship and I'd like to get Pastor Williams' opinion on what I just said and God bless both of you.
[02:56:48.650 --> 02:56:50.653]  God bless you, but let me just say this.
[02:56:50.653 --> 02:56:54.278]  Okay, we'll probably need to hold Williams over and then get the next guest on the date after.
[02:56:54.278 --> 02:56:55.340]  Let me just say this.
[02:56:57.043 --> 02:57:09.150]  Staying in the middle of it, to be speaking out, if that is coming, and I hope that's not the case, we will wake up more people, people will see the truth, and it literally is their minds, their souls that are important to save.
[02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:10.571]  That's the real treasure.
[02:57:10.571 --> 02:57:12.653]  That's what the enemy's really after.
[02:57:12.653 --> 02:57:17.676]  And so, this is a worldwide system.
[02:57:17.676 --> 02:57:23.999]  And, well, I mean, Pastor Williams, that was pretty intense, what he was saying.
[02:57:23.999 --> 02:57:24.680]  Any comments on it?
[02:57:26.118 --> 02:57:33.220]  Alex, when you get to heaven, when Alex Jones gets to heaven, I know of one man who's going to be there because of you.
[02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:36.921]  He sent me this email, I referred to it in the first part of this program.
[02:57:36.921 --> 02:57:41.942]  Now you know, I told you way back in July that I had been advised to get out of America.
[02:57:41.942 --> 02:57:43.742]  You notice I'm still here, don't you?
[02:57:43.742 --> 02:57:44.722]  Yes.
[02:57:44.722 --> 02:57:50.624]  And the reason I'm still here is because there are a lot of people out there that need what you're saying, need what I'm saying.
[02:57:50.624 --> 02:57:55.125]  Everybody out there, and Alex Jones listening audience, you listen to him every single day.
[02:57:55.635 --> 02:57:58.257]  You believe everything he says.
[02:57:58.257 --> 02:58:07.383]  Alex and I are staying at the helm of this whole thing in order to be able to try to help as many people as we possibly can, Alex.
[02:58:07.383 --> 02:58:12.427]  Well, we have to do that, and they'll just track us down somewhere else, kind of like they say in Braveheart.
[02:58:12.427 --> 02:58:15.609]  You know, fight against that, we will run and we will live.
[02:58:15.609 --> 02:58:17.790]  I'm fighting, you may die.
[02:58:17.790 --> 02:58:19.892]  Run and you'll live at least a while.
[02:58:19.892 --> 02:58:22.233]  But many years from now, laying in your beds,
[02:58:23.274 --> 02:58:32.898]  What would you give once, just once, to come back here and tell our enemies, you may take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom.
[02:58:32.898 --> 02:58:35.439]  We'll do five more minutes with Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[02:58:35.439 --> 02:58:41.221]  Then, former NSA operative will be joining us to talk about the Ziner weaponized flu.
[02:58:41.221 --> 02:58:43.622]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.622 --> 02:58:48.023]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.305 --> 02:58:53.006]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.006 --> 02:58:57.748]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.748 --> 02:59:00.709]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.709 --> 02:59:03.750]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:09.593]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.833 --> 02:59:13.075]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation of the cube.
[02:59:13.075 --> 02:59:20.041]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.041 --> 02:59:23.343]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:59:40.493 --> 02:59:42.314]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:53.979 --> 02:59:56.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.360 --> 02:59:59.140]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.279 --> 03:00:30.322]  Major news recap coming up as we go to Wayne Madsen starting the next segment.
[03:00:30.322 --> 03:00:31.162]  So stay with us.
[03:00:31.162 --> 03:00:32.603]  Just amazing developments.
[03:00:32.603 --> 03:00:35.425]  We'll be covering that in just a moment.
[03:00:35.425 --> 03:00:37.827]  Finishing up with Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[03:00:37.827 --> 03:00:42.370]  A few calls and we're going to get Wayne Madsen on who's been going on international television saying his
[03:00:44.212 --> 03:00:51.057]  Doctoral and viral contacts are saying this has got to be a manufactured bioweapon.
[03:00:51.057 --> 03:00:54.860]  We'll get his inside scoop on that coming up in just a few minutes.
[03:00:54.860 --> 03:00:55.621]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:55.621 --> 03:01:03.647]  Websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us.
[03:01:05.794 --> 03:01:16.224]  I want to let everybody know the denial of service attacks over our CDNs at the ports are still going on.
[03:01:18.051 --> 03:01:19.152]  I don't know.
[03:01:38.766 --> 03:01:40.048]  You know, cover what's happening.
[03:01:40.048 --> 03:01:42.371]  Lindsay, Romans 13 in closing.
[03:01:42.371 --> 03:01:43.813]  Romans 13.
[03:01:43.813 --> 03:01:45.235]  They've hired all these preachers.
[03:01:45.235 --> 03:01:51.062]  They're on the government payroll publicly to tell everybody to go to the FEMA centers, take the forced inoculations.
[03:01:51.062 --> 03:01:53.245]  They've been gearing up for this for at least three and a half years.
[03:01:54.434 --> 03:01:59.016]  They say you're to follow the orders of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, King George III.
[03:01:59.016 --> 03:02:00.997]  But then how do other governments fight other governments?
[03:02:00.997 --> 03:02:03.218]  I mean, that's not really in the Bible.
[03:02:03.218 --> 03:02:06.419]  Most of the prophets were killed for saying no to tyranny.
[03:02:06.419 --> 03:02:10.461]  Is this an abomination being taught in the churches, Pastor?
[03:02:10.461 --> 03:02:14.263]  For 50 years, Alex, I've been a minister of the gospel.
[03:02:14.263 --> 03:02:19.425]  The first church I ever pastored, there was no such thing as Bible 123.
[03:02:19.425 --> 03:02:22.406]  I definitely have written an entire book on the subject.
[03:02:22.406 --> 03:02:23.967]  It's entitled, To Seduce a Nation.
[03:02:24.853 --> 03:02:30.918]  These pastors are using the expression, render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's.
[03:02:30.918 --> 03:02:35.201]  And they use that as an excuse to follow every single dictate of the government.
[03:02:35.201 --> 03:02:36.142]  Who is Caesar?
[03:02:36.142 --> 03:02:37.282]  Caesar was a dictator.
[03:02:37.282 --> 03:02:38.423]  Caesar was a king.
[03:02:38.423 --> 03:02:40.445]  We don't have a king in the United States of America.
[03:02:40.445 --> 03:02:44.568]  Pastors, it's time for you to get out there and interpret the Bible correctly.
[03:02:44.568 --> 03:02:47.110]  The Bible says, render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
[03:02:47.503 --> 03:02:52.566]  And you've got to sit down and determine who is Caesar in the United States of America.
[03:02:52.566 --> 03:02:54.006]  Caesar was a dictator.
[03:02:54.006 --> 03:02:57.308]  We do not have a king in the United States of America.
[03:02:57.308 --> 03:03:07.733]  Who is Caesar, if you properly interpret, if you obey the scriptures, which you've got to do, because that's your guideline, render unto who?
[03:03:07.733 --> 03:03:08.714]  Come on now!
[03:03:08.714 --> 03:03:09.874]  Be honest!
[03:03:09.874 --> 03:03:11.195]  Get right here!
[03:03:11.195 --> 03:03:14.917]  Get on your knees and look to the Lord for this thing, like I had to do years ago.
[03:03:15.578 --> 03:03:19.940]  What are the first three words of the Constitution of the United States of America?
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:22.221]  Caesar in America is not a king.
[03:03:22.221 --> 03:03:25.502]  Caesar in America is WE THE PEOPLE.
[03:03:25.502 --> 03:03:26.142]  Hear me.
[03:03:26.142 --> 03:03:27.063]  I beg of you.
[03:03:27.063 --> 03:03:30.864]  Go read your Bible and let the Holy Spirit interpret it to you.
[03:03:30.864 --> 03:03:32.485]  WE THE PEOPLE.
[03:03:32.485 --> 03:03:37.087]  If you obey what the Bible tells you to obey and the Word of God,
[03:03:37.495 --> 03:03:43.940]  You will obey the first three words of the Constitution of the United States of America because we don't have a king!
[03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:47.342]  And on top of that, why did they kill Paul and everybody?
[03:03:47.342 --> 03:03:50.905]  Why did the Caesars order Christians by the tens of thousands killed?
[03:03:50.905 --> 03:03:55.749]  I mean, why didn't they bow down and worship Saturn?
[03:03:55.749 --> 03:04:00.472]  Why didn't they bow down and worship, you know, all these different gods?
[03:04:00.472 --> 03:04:02.334]  Why didn't they bow down and worship Dagon?
[03:04:02.334 --> 03:04:05.676]  I mean, according to what the preachers teach, they should have hit their knees and said,
[03:04:07.762 --> 03:04:11.507]  Well sure, but we don't have what Rome had.
[03:04:11.507 --> 03:04:12.889]  Rome had a dictatorship.
[03:04:12.889 --> 03:04:15.613]  But the Christians didn't follow what Caesar said!
[03:04:15.613 --> 03:04:18.397]  According to these preachers, they're going to hell!
[03:04:18.397 --> 03:04:21.181]  You worship the devil or you're going to hell!
[03:04:21.181 --> 03:04:22.844]  And they shouldn't follow him today either.
[03:04:23.274 --> 03:04:26.616]  They should follow We the People, the Constitution of the United States of America.
[03:04:26.616 --> 03:04:29.979]  Get back down to the basics of what this country was established as.
[03:04:29.979 --> 03:04:33.781]  It was established as a Constitutional Republic, never a democracy.
[03:04:33.781 --> 03:04:36.003]  Under democracy it's We the People.
[03:04:36.003 --> 03:04:38.264]  Under Republicans, We the People.
[03:04:38.264 --> 03:04:39.245]  Lindsey, we're out of time.
[03:04:39.245 --> 03:04:42.247]  You have to fire that number out one more time for your DVD.
[03:04:42.247 --> 03:04:44.348]  I beg of you, get my 8 DVD set.
[03:04:44.348 --> 03:04:44.869]  The number is 800-321-8000.
[03:04:47.392 --> 03:04:48.593]  We're out of time, Pastor.
[03:04:48.593 --> 03:04:49.313]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:04:49.313 --> 03:04:49.713]  God bless you.
[03:04:49.713 --> 03:04:50.934]  Good to hear from you.
[03:04:50.934 --> 03:04:52.174]  Say hi to your wife.
[03:05:10.743 --> 03:05:18.808]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the Heirloom Garden Seed Time Capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere, even underground, for 100 years.
[03:05:18.808 --> 03:05:30.876]  The Heirloom Garden Seed Time Capsule can withstand 3 tons of weight, is 100% roto-proof, waterproof, and comes with a whopping 6,000 healthy vegetable seeds from 20 varieties that will grow anywhere in the USA, unless you trust the government.
[03:05:30.916 --> 03:05:31.396]  I don't know.
[03:06:02.017 --> 03:06:07.843]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.843 --> 03:06:14.851]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.410 --> 03:06:21.992]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.992 --> 03:06:23.973]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.973 --> 03:06:26.473]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.473 --> 03:06:37.437]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:38.050 --> 03:06:39.710]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:41.571]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:41.571 --> 03:06:48.492]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.492 --> 03:06:56.734]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.734 --> 03:06:58.315]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.315 --> 03:06:59.515]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.775 --> 03:07:05.298]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.298 --> 03:07:10.682]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.682 --> 03:07:15.646]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:15.646 --> 03:07:26.634]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:07:26.894 --> 03:07:32.656]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:32.656 --> 03:07:38.879]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:38.879 --> 03:07:39.739]  What about you?
[03:07:39.739 --> 03:07:41.660]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:07:52.668 --> 03:07:52.989]  Big Brother.
[03:08:07.543 --> 03:08:09.305]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:09.305 --> 03:08:11.067]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.067 --> 03:08:12.669]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.669 --> 03:08:14.211]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.211 --> 03:08:18.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.415 --> 03:08:26.584]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.584 --> 03:08:28.186]  Well, just massive news!
[03:08:28.186 --> 03:08:28.546]  I wanna...
[03:08:29.679 --> 03:08:34.680]  I want to go right to Wayne Madsen, but I will recap at the bottom of the hour and get his take on it.
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:40.461]  The information I have about what's happening, I'll just bring up some of these questions for him with the documents I have.
[03:08:40.461 --> 03:08:44.042]  We have huge, huge, huge developments here.
[03:08:44.042 --> 03:08:57.065]  I have a secret document for state health care people that was given to me by a high-level school administrator in the AISD confirming that little boy that died, and this came out the night before,
[03:08:58.303 --> 03:09:05.045]  Saying he was on the verge of death, and that they would then go to level 5, which they did, and then level 6, and that we were really under level 6.
[03:09:05.045 --> 03:09:14.368]  That 40-50% of those that get it, that they have a clinical attack rate of 40-50%, meaning if you come exposed to it, you contract and get sick that often.
[03:09:14.368 --> 03:09:16.369]  With regular flu, it's 10-15%.
[03:09:16.369 --> 03:09:23.291]  But there are more people on ventilators in Texas, that they're covering the shop, that the feds are saying this is super deadly.
[03:09:23.291 --> 03:09:26.072]  The feds are acting like that is what it is.
[03:09:27.056 --> 03:09:30.258]  You know, that it's super deadly, but then verbally they're like, oh, it's not that big of a deal.
[03:09:30.258 --> 03:09:31.179]  It'll probably be all right.
[03:09:31.179 --> 03:09:35.582]  But then Biden comes out and says, don't get on subways, don't get on planes.
[03:09:35.582 --> 03:09:37.664]  Mexico is saying they've suspended the government.
[03:09:37.664 --> 03:09:38.505]  This is getting crazy.
[03:09:38.505 --> 03:09:42.668]  So we're going to go to Wayne Madsen, formerly with the NSA, consulted other intelligence agencies.
[03:09:42.668 --> 03:09:44.409]  Big reporter there for major publications.
[03:09:44.409 --> 03:09:46.330]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:09:46.330 --> 03:09:47.911]  Always incredibly cutting edge.
[03:09:48.846 --> 03:09:57.829]  I mean, you know, there he is on Russia Today yesterday breaking down that a lot of experts think it's weaponized, that the government's really worried about how fast it's spreading, and that's what the internal documents show.
[03:09:57.829 --> 03:10:01.230]  And I've got this from other doctors in Mexico City, doctors here in Texas.
[03:10:01.230 --> 03:10:03.671]  It broke out just south of where I sit in South Austin.
[03:10:05.043 --> 03:10:08.647]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors though that we haven't really thanked today to make this show possible.
[03:10:08.647 --> 03:10:10.369]  One of them is Pepperspray.com.
[03:10:10.369 --> 03:10:12.592]  We live in an unpredictable world.
[03:10:12.592 --> 03:10:14.714]  As everyone knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[03:10:14.714 --> 03:10:17.117]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[03:10:17.117 --> 03:10:22.003]  And especially if you're in anti-firearm areas, it's good to have high-powered pepper spray and tasers and stun guns.
[03:10:22.463 --> 03:10:23.323]  Check your local laws.
[03:10:23.323 --> 03:10:25.084]  In most places, it's kosher.
[03:10:25.084 --> 03:10:28.885]  So I go to Pepperspray.com, a great little augment to your self-protection.
[03:10:28.885 --> 03:10:32.166]  That's why I want you to visit, again, Pepperspray.com.
[03:10:32.166 --> 03:10:44.370]  On the web since 1994, insanely good prices, free shipping on over $99 orders, pepper sprays of all kinds and strengths, stun guns and tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms, and more.
[03:10:44.370 --> 03:10:47.531]  I also want to encourage listeners to support us.
[03:10:48.231 --> 03:10:51.692]  The amount of bandwidth we're spending right now is biblical.
[03:10:51.692 --> 03:11:03.616]  We're not just being hacked and hit with denial of service over our CDNs directly at our ports, and then we change them and they jump, and all the sites are being hit, a lot of them are down.
[03:11:03.616 --> 03:11:12.860]  We are getting threats, just insane stuff going on because of what we're covering and doing, and we're being pretty balanced here, saying we don't know exactly what's going on.
[03:11:14.281 --> 03:11:16.042]  But we've got that going on.
[03:11:16.042 --> 03:11:28.415]  Please buy some of the books and videos at Infowars.com like the Obama Deception, showing it works for the same people that ran Bush, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Who These Eugenicists Are, What Their History Is, Why They're Capable of Controlled Release Pandemics.
[03:11:29.096 --> 03:11:38.998]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv, then you get Burman's show live 9 to midnight, not just on the radio for free, but the TV show with the documents and the video clips.
[03:11:38.998 --> 03:11:43.820]  Also my show, the last two hours every day, usually more, we simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:45.300]  All my films are super high quality.
[03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:48.541]  My book, Paul Watson's book, scores of other films have been authorized to post.
[03:11:49.821 --> 03:11:52.342]  Expanded extras only at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:11:52.342 --> 03:11:53.222]  Super high quality.
[03:11:53.222 --> 03:11:54.422]  15 cents a day.
[03:11:54.422 --> 03:11:55.583]  We've got to pay for all this.
[03:11:55.583 --> 03:11:57.243]  Plus, it's the way to get the word out.
[03:11:57.243 --> 03:11:58.364]  It's symbiotic here.
[03:11:58.364 --> 03:11:59.844]  Please support us.
[03:11:59.844 --> 03:12:02.965]  If you want to donate, or you want to buy a bunch of books and videos, donate.
[03:12:02.965 --> 03:12:04.425]  Everything's a donation, basically.
[03:12:04.425 --> 03:12:13.688]  You can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[03:12:13.688 --> 03:12:15.268]  And I have been getting some donations lately.
[03:12:15.268 --> 03:12:16.589]  Some of them quite generous.
[03:12:16.589 --> 03:12:17.009]  Thank you.
[03:12:17.529 --> 03:12:21.951]  And you can see we put it right back into here with this crew and the people and the computers.
[03:12:21.951 --> 03:12:29.315]  It all costs a lot of money, but we reach so many people that a lot of you give just a little bit by buying the books or videos or supporting the sponsors.
[03:12:29.315 --> 03:12:30.616]  That's how we do it as a team effort.
[03:12:30.616 --> 03:12:34.998]  Also support our local affiliates, support their local sponsors, and keep spreading the word about the show everywhere.
[03:12:34.998 --> 03:12:37.059]  We're gaining AM and FM's two or three a week now.
[03:12:37.059 --> 03:12:38.900]  The show is just exploding.
[03:12:38.900 --> 03:12:43.042]  Number one on Shoutcast, number one on the downloads, number one on podcast.
[03:12:43.422 --> 03:12:45.964]  Just, it is insane responsibility.
[03:12:45.964 --> 03:12:47.285]  I want to go to Wayne Madsen now.
[03:12:47.285 --> 03:12:49.167]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:12:49.167 --> 03:12:53.830]  Wayne Madsen is a Washington, D.C.-based investigative journalist, author, and syndicated columnist.
[03:12:53.830 --> 03:13:02.898]  He has written for the Village Voice, Progressive, Counterpunch, Online Journal, CorpWatch, Multinational Monitor, News Insider, and these times, and the American Conservative.
[03:13:02.898 --> 03:13:10.524]  His columns have appeared in the Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Columbus Dispatch, Sacramento Bee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others.
[03:13:11.024 --> 03:13:16.127]  A lot of times when I'm watching an NSA or CIA hearing in Congress, you always see Madsen sitting in the back covering it.
[03:13:16.127 --> 03:13:18.529]  Madsen is the author of a handbook on personal data protection.
[03:13:18.529 --> 03:13:19.989]  We're going to have him on about that sometime.
[03:13:19.989 --> 03:13:26.954]  Bob McMillan, an acclaimed reference book on international data protection law, genocide and covert operations in Africa, 1993-99.
[03:13:26.954 --> 03:13:29.775]  The books go on and on.
[03:13:29.775 --> 03:13:31.436]  2003, put out by Dandelion.
[03:13:31.436 --> 03:13:35.059]  Nightmare, co-author of America's Nightmare, the presidency of George Bush II.
[03:13:36.421 --> 03:13:41.585]  Author of Jaded Tests, Big Oil, Ops and Brass Plates, Overthrow of Fashion Regime.
[03:13:41.585 --> 03:13:42.806]  That's his newest one.
[03:13:42.806 --> 03:13:45.368]  He's on ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS.
[03:13:45.368 --> 03:13:46.449]  I mean, he goes on and on.
[03:13:46.449 --> 03:13:49.771]  Worked with the NSA, other secret agencies.
[03:13:49.771 --> 03:13:51.232]  A U.S.
[03:13:51.232 --> 03:13:51.833]  Naval officer.
[03:13:51.833 --> 03:13:54.515]  He managed one of the first computer security programs in the U.S.
[03:13:54.515 --> 03:13:54.915]  Navy.
[03:13:54.915 --> 03:13:57.898]  Let me ask you a selfish question first, Wayne Madsen.
[03:13:58.678 --> 03:14:08.321]  We've had little kid hacker attacks years ago when I didn't have good servers where they put a naked girl on a motorcycle on there and say, haha, screw you, you know, real grassroots hacker stuff.
[03:14:08.321 --> 03:14:13.242]  But we built systems up, got more professional, had big CDNs, you know, hidden servers.
[03:14:13.242 --> 03:14:18.624]  They went over those, into the ports, we'd change IP addresses, they'd jump ports, then they would attack whole
[03:14:19.184 --> 03:14:21.665]  I don't know what it is I'm saying that's so horrible.
[03:14:41.018 --> 03:14:48.382]  Well, we know right now, Alex, that they're creating a new cyber command in the Pentagon.
[03:14:48.382 --> 03:14:54.065]  The current NSA Director General Keith Alexander is supposed to be the head of that command.
[03:14:54.065 --> 03:14:59.608]  What you're talking about is more in the area of offensive information warfare.
[03:14:59.608 --> 03:15:00.989]  This is the most classified
[03:15:01.661 --> 03:15:15.804]  Part of this whole cyber security program that's being developed and the issue is, is that too much power to leave into the hands of an agency like NSA or the CIA or in fact the Pentagon?
[03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:19.910]  Uh, what does offensive information warfare entail?
[03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:23.971]  Is it just, is it more than just biopsychological warfare operations?
[03:15:23.971 --> 03:15:39.876]  Or does it get into actually, uh, uh, creating these, uh, embargoes for information, uh, by using these technical attack mechanisms, as you're suggesting, with coming into ports and, uh, and, uh, doing all this other than the fact that what we used to see hackers do
[03:15:40.396 --> 03:15:44.622]  Well, I mean, as you know, five weeks ago, the head guy that Obama had appointed,
[03:15:57.538 --> 03:15:59.620]  Said, look, this is a takeover of our republic.
[03:15:59.620 --> 03:16:01.981]  They want control of all the infrastructure.
[03:16:01.981 --> 03:16:05.144]  Jay Rockefeller comes out and says, yeah, we'd be better off without the web.
[03:16:05.144 --> 03:16:20.335]  They want to, just like the NSA moved into telecoms, they want, and even mid-size IP companies, computer companies, and this is your specialty, so you can speak to it, you're at the NSA, put these grids in there to, quote, shut the web down, as a quote, to protect it.
[03:16:20.335 --> 03:16:23.878]  And then we're talking to the big IT companies, they're saying, yes, this is the biggest attack ever.
[03:16:24.378 --> 03:16:26.541]  You know, this is government.
[03:16:26.541 --> 03:16:32.048]  This is not hot pocket eating hackers, you know, having fun.
[03:16:32.048 --> 03:16:33.851]  The hackers love us.
[03:16:33.851 --> 03:16:34.752]  They like the work we do.
[03:16:34.752 --> 03:16:36.194]  They're anti-establishment.
[03:16:36.194 --> 03:16:38.377]  What do you think it is we did that made them so unhappy?
[03:16:39.335 --> 03:17:01.613]  Well, what it is is everyone's offering alternative sources of information, breaking the monopoly of these mega entertainment, infotainment corporations, which control about ninety-five percent of where you get your news and other information from on a daily basis.
[03:17:01.613 --> 03:17:06.137]  They do not like the Internet because there's too many people out there offering up
[03:17:07.074 --> 03:17:26.550]  I'm not talking about all bloggers, but the media blogs are offering up alternative sources of information, and it's causing problems for the oligarchs, who always thought that just by picking up a telephone and talking to a newspaper publisher or a bureau chief, they could kill stories.
[03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:29.473]  They don't have that capability any longer, and they don't like this new media.
[03:17:31.618 --> 03:17:33.299]  Now, this is obviously bipartisan.
[03:17:33.299 --> 03:17:38.344]  I mean, whatever Bush did, it seems is expanding under Obama.
[03:17:38.344 --> 03:17:40.366]  And I know you know about the Jay Rockefeller stuff.
[03:17:40.366 --> 03:17:48.573]  Where do you see this cyber command going and openly saying the Pentagon and NSA are going to run domestic networks and spy without warrants?
[03:17:48.573 --> 03:17:52.056]  And he's protecting Bush on that and protecting Bush on torture.
[03:17:52.056 --> 03:17:55.479]  But we're not discussing that in the news because it's all the flu, the flu!
[03:17:56.522 --> 03:18:17.873]  Right, well we saw this during the Clinton administration when we fought, strenuously fought against the Clinton administration's attempt to have anyone who wanted to use encryption to cover their communications, you would have to possess a government key, where the government could go in and say, give us a key so we can break the encryption.
[03:18:17.873 --> 03:18:22.055]  We fought those battles under Clinton, then of course Bush came in and
[03:18:22.695 --> 03:18:29.180]  It seemed like those battles were just, you know what Bush pulled off, were just almost a mood issue.
[03:18:29.180 --> 03:18:40.067]  But now we see, with this administration, some of those same players involved with the Clinton administration pushing this sort of surveillance, technical surveillance capability, have come back.
[03:18:40.067 --> 03:18:45.530]  They're back in these federal agencies and they're pushing that same agenda of surveillance.
[03:18:45.530 --> 03:18:46.871]  They're going for broke!
[03:18:46.871 --> 03:18:50.574]  Do you think they'll be successful, quote, taking over the infrastructure of the internet?
[03:18:51.587 --> 03:18:55.189]  I don't think so, because the Internet, one thing we know about the Internet, it's dynamic.
[03:18:55.189 --> 03:19:00.951]  It was actually engineered, created by the Department of Defense to withstand a nuclear attack.
[03:19:00.951 --> 03:19:03.232]  That's the architecture of the Internet.
[03:19:03.232 --> 03:19:08.615]  And I don't think anything that the government can throw up will be able to actually stop
[03:19:10.655 --> 03:19:13.156]  They're not bargaining on something else.
[03:19:13.156 --> 03:19:17.037]  There's a lot of high-tech money in the Bay Area, especially.
[03:19:17.037 --> 03:19:25.059]  A lot of these people are very libertarian, and if they do try to control the Internet, I know what's going to come down the pike.
[03:19:25.059 --> 03:19:27.039]  There's going to be Internet, too.
[03:19:27.039 --> 03:19:31.720]  This is the one that the government doesn't have any control over, and I think that's just what we'll see.
[03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:37.122]  We'll see somebody come up with a form of communication that the government can't get its hands around.
[03:19:39.266 --> 03:19:53.270]  So you're talking about a technocrat rebellion, and you'll have all these old globalist dinosaurs sitting there 90 years old with their mistresses going, Wilford, get me my butler!
[03:19:53.270 --> 03:19:55.091]  Shut them down immediately!
[03:19:55.091 --> 03:19:58.492]  Let's talk about the flu with Wayne Madsen.
[03:19:58.492 --> 03:19:59.672]  Is it a bioweapon?
[03:19:59.672 --> 03:20:00.873]  Was it designer?
[03:20:00.873 --> 03:20:01.333]  Stay with us.
[03:20:03.223 --> 03:20:04.684]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:20:04.684 --> 03:20:10.726]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:20:10.726 --> 03:20:11.547]  That's right.
[03:20:11.547 --> 03:20:14.388]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:20:14.388 --> 03:20:21.891]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:20:21.891 --> 03:20:29.515]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:20:30.017 --> 03:20:35.480]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:20:35.480 --> 03:20:41.304]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:41.304 --> 03:20:45.807]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:20:45.807 --> 03:20:46.087]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:46.087 --> 03:20:48.088]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:20:48.088 --> 03:20:48.689]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:48.689 --> 03:20:48.949]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:01.892 --> 03:21:07.143]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.942 --> 03:21:13.806]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:13.806 --> 03:21:20.330]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:22.291]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.291 --> 03:21:24.752]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:24.752 --> 03:21:35.639]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:37.930 --> 03:21:39.591]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.591 --> 03:21:41.452]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.452 --> 03:21:48.375]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.375 --> 03:21:56.619]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.619 --> 03:21:58.200]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.200 --> 03:21:59.401]  The people strike back.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:03.141]  You are a rebel.
[03:22:03.141 --> 03:22:03.882]  Admit it.
[03:22:03.882 --> 03:22:06.866]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[03:22:06.866 --> 03:22:09.268]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[03:22:09.268 --> 03:22:13.193]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[03:22:13.193 --> 03:22:15.255]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[03:22:15.255 --> 03:22:17.618]  And you can count your real friends on one hand.
[03:22:17.618 --> 03:22:18.439]  Well, join the club.
[03:22:18.679 --> 03:22:24.903]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[03:22:24.903 --> 03:22:29.547]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[03:22:29.547 --> 03:22:34.310]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[03:22:34.310 --> 03:22:37.552]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[03:22:37.552 --> 03:22:39.093]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[03:22:39.093 --> 03:22:41.915]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[03:22:41.915 --> 03:22:44.837]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[03:22:50.609 --> 03:22:51.090]  We're good.
[03:23:00.762 --> 03:23:04.183]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[03:23:04.183 --> 03:23:08.605]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[03:23:08.605 --> 03:23:11.125]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[03:23:11.125 --> 03:23:17.388]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[03:23:17.388 --> 03:23:23.750]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:27.212]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[03:24:02.658 --> 03:24:07.101]  Our memories live on in mortal minds.
[03:24:19.048 --> 03:24:21.450]  Okay, Wayne Madsen.
[03:24:21.450 --> 03:24:23.431]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:24:23.431 --> 03:24:26.654]  I want to get into, is this a designer virus?
[03:24:26.654 --> 03:24:29.316]  Why do you have these different world leaders saying that like the Indonesian president?
[03:24:30.657 --> 03:24:33.659]  And the doctors and scientists, virologists, I'm talking to you, says it's clearly engineered.
[03:24:33.659 --> 03:24:36.101]  It came out of the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year.
[03:24:36.101 --> 03:24:37.843]  Usually you see these things develop and mutate.
[03:24:37.843 --> 03:24:41.466]  You'd see it's history, it's pedigree of mutations.
[03:24:41.466 --> 03:24:42.446]  This is just out of the blue.
[03:24:42.446 --> 03:24:49.372]  You only see vaccine companies busy making things just like this and bragging about it in the last five years.
[03:24:49.372 --> 03:24:51.634]  And then magically having vaccines that are already ready.
[03:24:51.634 --> 03:24:55.157]  That's pretty unusual, to say the least.
[03:24:55.157 --> 03:24:57.999]  But of course, they don't have a motive or anything to sell vaccines.
[03:24:57.999 --> 03:24:59.220]  What do you think's going on here?
[03:25:00.367 --> 03:25:04.630]  Well, I gotta say, this story kind of caught out with me by surprise.
[03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:12.535]  I was in the process last week of investigating the so-called suicide of this Freddie Mac CFO.
[03:25:12.535 --> 03:25:23.402]  I was looking at some other issues, and I met a journalist with one of Mexico City's largest newspapers, and he was very nervous about something.
[03:25:23.402 --> 03:25:25.164]  I said, you know, what's going on?
[03:25:25.164 --> 03:25:27.785]  And he started talking about swine flu.
[03:25:27.785 --> 03:25:29.446]  I gotta say, I hadn't heard about it.
[03:25:29.446 --> 03:25:30.087]  I turned around.
[03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:35.382]  I looked on the television and that's what CNN was covering.
[03:25:35.382 --> 03:25:58.875]  What he told me was he had been in contact with a top UN scientist who's actually been in the Democratic Republic of Congo looking at Ebola, hot zones, outbreaks, also HIV, and he said the problem with this was that it was the vector transmission on this particular flu did not meet all the natural occurrences.
[03:26:00.154 --> 03:26:04.245]  This scientist as though it had been engineered.
[03:26:04.245 --> 03:26:08.577]  It was not coming from swine to human, but it was human to human contact.
[03:26:09.373 --> 03:26:12.315]  It was the various gene sequences.
[03:26:12.315 --> 03:26:26.561]  There's two strains of swine flu, North American Eurasian, two strains of human flu, and of course the avian flu, the bird flu that wreaked havoc in Asia a few years ago.
[03:26:26.561 --> 03:26:30.983]  So to be clear, you're saying it's two parts pig, two parts human, and one part bird?
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:49.501]  And he said that his experience with Ebola, which scientists apparently thought was also a product of biological warfare research, it was the same type of transmission method, human-to-human, fast-acting.
[03:26:50.521 --> 03:26:59.045]  With, you know, disastrous consequences with people succumbing from this particular flu.
[03:26:59.045 --> 03:27:09.110]  When I started checking into it, I contacted a friend of mine who's a journalist in Jakarta because, of course, that's where they had some experience with the bird flu.
[03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:16.714]  And, of course, his contacts in the health ministry in Indonesia, and we had the health minister of Indonesia basically say this looks
[03:27:17.113 --> 03:27:18.795]  To be man-made.
[03:27:18.795 --> 03:27:31.811]  They thought that the Indonesian Health Ministry thought with bird flu and with this swine flu that this could be being spread by people who want to increase profits for pharmaceuticals.
[03:27:34.278 --> 03:27:36.420]  Well let me expand on that.
[03:27:36.420 --> 03:27:45.247]  I got, this is from Tuesday evening, it came to us and then I got it confirmed and talked to the person yesterday and didn't really know what I had until last night.
[03:27:45.247 --> 03:27:48.390]  But this talked about the boy that was about to die in Houston.
[03:27:49.651 --> 03:27:55.736]  We have the name of the medical doctor here, and it's an internal state document that I got from a school administrator.
[03:27:55.736 --> 03:28:02.642]  We have a story up on PrisonPlanet.com, Texas doctor claims swine flu cases far worse than reported, and that we're already at a level 6.
[03:28:02.642 --> 03:28:07.867]  Now, this said we were already at a level 5, and it was going to go to level 6, and they did announce yesterday it was a 5.
[03:28:07.867 --> 03:28:13.192]  Now they're saying we may go to level 6, so this is confirmed, but what's important here, and I have this directly from the source,
[03:28:14.397 --> 03:28:16.803]  This one out to health workers in schools.
[03:28:16.803 --> 03:28:20.252]  Okay, I'll just tell you that at the administration level.
[03:28:20.252 --> 03:28:22.237]  We have the names and I know who this came from.
[03:28:22.237 --> 03:28:22.939]  I know them directly.
[03:28:24.042 --> 03:28:30.606]  This is, don't distribute this under all these penalties and all that, and it says that normally it infects 10 to 15 percent of people it comes in contact with.
[03:28:30.606 --> 03:28:34.348]  This is a clinical attack rate, maybe more around 40 to 50 percent.
[03:28:34.348 --> 03:28:37.770]  They're saying, we have never seen anything like this.
[03:28:37.770 --> 03:28:42.192]  They say, and he goes on to say, this is a doctor, this is just unbelievable with the state.
[03:28:42.192 --> 03:28:47.935]  But a 23-month-old here is fighting for his life, and a pregnant woman just south of San Antonio is fighting for her life.
[03:28:47.935 --> 03:28:49.036]  The baby didn't die the next day.
[03:28:49.861 --> 03:28:58.927]  And then it goes on to say in Mexico, these folks might have died already, but here in the U.S., they're getting Tamiflu, Relazine quickly, and again, those are drugs, folks, not vaccines.
[03:28:58.927 --> 03:29:01.289]  And we have ready access to ventilators.
[03:29:01.289 --> 03:29:06.452]  It goes on, what this means is that within a couple of weeks, regional hospitals will likely become overwhelmed.
[03:29:06.452 --> 03:29:11.896]  Some of the kids with positive cases in Comal County had more than 70 contacts before diagnosis.
[03:29:11.896 --> 03:29:15.678]  There are 10 to 25 times, 10 to 25 times, more actual cases.
[03:29:15.678 --> 03:29:16.959]  This used to be our headlines, folks.
[03:29:16.959 --> 03:29:17.580]  This is so big.
[03:29:18.320 --> 03:29:22.626]  Not possible cases, actually, than what is being reported in the media.
[03:29:22.626 --> 03:29:26.250]  The way they fudge on reporting is that it takes three days to get the con...
[03:29:27.543 --> 03:29:29.204]  We're on the march.
[03:29:29.204 --> 03:29:30.044]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.719 --> 03:29:58.388]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.064 --> 03:30:04.185]  Spring is here.
[03:30:04.185 --> 03:30:05.146]  Growing season.
[03:30:05.146 --> 03:30:07.347]  The economy is not getting any better.
[03:30:07.347 --> 03:30:09.069]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[03:30:09.069 --> 03:30:10.029]  Think about it.
[03:30:10.029 --> 03:30:14.133]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[03:30:14.133 --> 03:30:17.815]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[03:30:17.815 --> 03:30:20.658]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[03:30:20.658 --> 03:30:32.527]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[03:30:32.827 --> 03:30:33.247]  Let's do it!
[03:31:01.883 --> 03:31:07.689]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.689 --> 03:31:14.717]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.265 --> 03:31:21.850]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:21.850 --> 03:31:23.832]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:23.832 --> 03:31:26.333]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.333 --> 03:31:37.302]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:37.896 --> 03:31:39.577]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.577 --> 03:31:41.418]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:41.418 --> 03:31:48.340]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:56.604 --> 03:31:58.165]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.165 --> 03:32:01.286]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.286 --> 03:32:03.867]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[03:32:04.497 --> 03:32:07.820]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[03:32:07.820 --> 03:32:11.603]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[03:32:11.603 --> 03:32:18.189]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[03:32:18.189 --> 03:32:23.413]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[03:32:23.413 --> 03:32:30.119]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[03:32:53.573 --> 03:32:54.033]  Shalane Madsen.
[03:33:23.052 --> 03:33:28.096]  You just heard me read that, and they're announcing the UN is in control of our response.
[03:33:28.096 --> 03:33:31.859]  They're declaring emergencies here all over the country.
[03:33:31.859 --> 03:33:35.661]  They've got police guarding Tamiflu stockpiles, we confirmed here in Austin.
[03:33:35.661 --> 03:33:39.104]  But they're saying it's no big deal, but acting like it's the end of the world.
[03:33:39.104 --> 03:33:45.469]  Meanwhile, regular flus kill 36,000 people on average here in the United States, and there's only been a few deaths.
[03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:56.015]  So what do you think of what I just read, and who would stand to gain from releasing a designer flu, whether for fear-mongering or to wipe out a bunch of people?
[03:33:56.015 --> 03:34:01.518]  Well obviously the pharmaceuticals would gain in profit, but also those who want to keep this national security.
[03:34:02.188 --> 03:34:07.970]  Surveillance State going and Paul Boer would also gain in that.
[03:34:07.970 --> 03:34:11.811]  I would add to what the documents you received.
[03:34:11.811 --> 03:34:19.834]  I received two internal memos from Dr. Besser, who is the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
[03:34:20.499 --> 03:34:31.043]  Uh, now it's interesting to point out that Dr. Besser's job before he was made acting director was he was in charge of the counter-terrorism unit called COTPR at the CDC.
[03:34:31.043 --> 03:34:36.265]  And he's turning, in his memo to the CDC, he says, we don't know where we're going with this.
[03:34:36.963 --> 03:34:42.427]  We're like uncharted territory, but he does say we're in a marathon, not a sprint.
[03:34:42.427 --> 03:34:44.308]  That's all this kind of alarmist language.
[03:34:44.308 --> 03:34:50.893]  So, yes, why is it that they're trying to downplay this now, but internally, they're acting like it's a big deal.
[03:34:50.893 --> 03:34:59.959]  I would also say, based on what Joe Biden had to say about not getting in airplanes or on trains, I have a friend, he's a journalist, he's a colleague of mine,
[03:35:00.359 --> 03:35:09.024]  He's in quarantine today in New York City because he flew from Chicago to New York, and he obviously contracted the flu.
[03:35:09.024 --> 03:35:17.409]  Now, the hospital will not confirm, even do a test to confirm whether it's swine flu or not.
[03:35:17.409 --> 03:35:18.850]  He feels it's swine flu.
[03:35:18.850 --> 03:35:20.811]  It's all the symptoms of swine flu.
[03:35:20.811 --> 03:35:27.796]  He came down with it within the two-day period that they say you get this flu.
[03:35:27.796 --> 03:35:29.797]  And here's the alarming thing.
[03:35:30.555 --> 03:35:44.307]  I think there may be different protocols for when a journalist gets this and is put in quarantine because they know they have access to blackberries and, you know, iPhones and all this and can actually report on what's going on from within these hospitals.
[03:35:44.307 --> 03:35:48.191]  So they're not going to, they did not test this individual for swine flu.
[03:35:48.191 --> 03:35:56.979]  He doesn't know he feel he's being, he's in quarantine, which indicates that they'd probably think he has swine flu, but he was on a plane from O'Hare to New York.
[03:35:57.748 --> 03:36:03.893]  He checked, there are 100 flights to the Rock Valley from Mexico to O'Hare Airport.
[03:36:03.893 --> 03:36:11.139]  So just think about the potential people who are flying on these airplanes and who may have transmitted this disease.
[03:36:11.139 --> 03:36:15.643]  And here in Washington we have our first confirmed case now of swine flu.
[03:36:15.643 --> 03:36:22.309]  It's at the World Bank downtown and it was apparently an individual who was in Mexico on business.
[03:36:23.038 --> 03:36:28.662]  Who came to work at the World Bank, and then they found out he had swine flu.
[03:36:28.662 --> 03:36:35.767]  Instead of telling this individual, don't come to work, he came to work, and now they don't know how many other employees of the World Bank may have died.
[03:36:35.767 --> 03:36:37.328]  Wayne, you're a smart guy.
[03:36:37.328 --> 03:36:41.111]  I've been trying to do this, but I've been trying to compute.
[03:36:41.111 --> 03:36:46.395]  Let's say this thing broke out March 18th is when the Mexicans said they discovered it.
[03:36:46.395 --> 03:36:50.198]  So let's say early March, a month and a half ago or more, almost two months ago.
[03:36:51.790 --> 03:37:00.862]  it really starts breaking last thursday friday in mexico here we are seven eight days later and now is there is here so i guess you're gonna see them
[03:37:01.872 --> 03:37:04.793]  They say with most flus like this, the peak's about 80-90 days.
[03:37:04.793 --> 03:37:12.116]  So we're talking, we're probably, you know, 60-70 days until we see the peak of this here.
[03:37:12.116 --> 03:37:21.960]  And so I guess it's going to be, what, a week or two until we see if there's start to be deaths, tens of thousands of cases, or are they going to go the route of just shutting everything down and telling us, oh, there's only 150 cases, but
[03:37:24.468 --> 03:37:28.490]  Then I talked to people calling me from Mexico and doctors and calls from Mexico.
[03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:32.692]  They say there's vomiting, death in small towns, death at every hospital.
[03:37:32.692 --> 03:37:37.655]  BBC reports doctors by name at hospitals saying there's dead people everywhere.
[03:37:37.655 --> 03:37:42.217]  I mean, what the hell's going on and why am I getting hack attack completely blasted?
[03:37:43.732 --> 03:37:52.236]  Well, I would just go on, you know, having a friend who is in quarantine with suspected swine flu and they're not telling him.
[03:37:52.236 --> 03:37:53.757]  The story kept changing.
[03:37:53.757 --> 03:37:57.619]  The first hospital said, look, we don't have the means to test you for swine flu.
[03:37:57.619 --> 03:37:59.000]  Well, that's pretty scary alone.
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:00.700]  It must be widespread then.
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:03.462]  And then they say, well, no, it's not us.
[03:38:03.462 --> 03:38:06.423]  It's the CDC says we can't test you for swine flu.
[03:38:06.423 --> 03:38:07.504]  This is incredible.
[03:38:07.504 --> 03:38:09.505]  Everyone who came in his room had to wear a mask.
[03:38:09.505 --> 03:38:11.025]  He had to wear a mask.
[03:38:11.025 --> 03:38:12.326]  I can tell you here in Washington,
[03:38:13.022 --> 03:38:18.746]  The drugstores at two major chains, CVS and Rite Aid, are out of Tamiflu.
[03:38:18.746 --> 03:38:21.188]  You figure where these drugstores are located.
[03:38:21.188 --> 03:38:30.955]  I live between the CIA and the Pentagon, so every drugstore now is out of Tamiflu and they're out of these surgical masks.
[03:38:30.955 --> 03:38:33.097]  Well, what are these people who work at these facilities?
[03:38:33.661 --> 03:38:40.887]  uh... around uh... this area know that we don't know now that we have a now we have of course our first confirmed case of swine flu here in the district.
[03:38:40.887 --> 03:38:46.412]  Well Wayne Madsen, consultant to the NSA, syndicated writer for major publications, reporter in D.C.
[03:38:46.412 --> 03:38:47.313]  and the district of criminals
[03:38:48.726 --> 03:39:03.147]  Are you saying the motive is with Big Pharma and the government, a smokescreen for the political collapse, the death of Chrysler, all of this grandstanding by the leadership of the government, when the public is on the verge of revolution, or
[03:39:05.390 --> 03:39:08.092]  Is this them just not knowing what's happening and they're panning?
[03:39:08.092 --> 03:39:14.038]  I think the evidence all points towards, like you said with this designer virus, I think it's a staged event.
[03:39:14.038 --> 03:39:19.802]  The question is, have they released something really deadly on us, or are they make-believing it's really deadly and hyping it?
[03:39:19.802 --> 03:39:21.044]  What's your take?
[03:39:21.044 --> 03:39:26.428]  Well, you know, is it the placebo virus that they're getting us ready for the really nasty one?
[03:39:26.428 --> 03:39:27.809]  Who's to know?
[03:39:27.809 --> 03:39:33.074]  We do know that with all the worker action around the world, French
[03:39:33.533 --> 03:39:36.235]  The French employees taking their bosses hostage.
[03:39:36.235 --> 03:39:39.576]  Massive street demonstrations against what's going on.
[03:39:39.576 --> 03:39:41.257]  They tried to kill the Queen with a car.
[03:39:41.257 --> 03:39:44.199]  It went out to the reviewing stand and killed three or four people.
[03:39:44.199 --> 03:39:47.121]  Incredible photos up on the InfoWars.com.
[03:39:47.121 --> 03:39:50.683]  We were talking about a summer of rage in Britain.
[03:39:50.683 --> 03:39:54.045]  The G20 was only a taste of things to come in London.
[03:39:54.045 --> 03:39:56.326]  So yeah, all this is now off the news.
[03:39:58.326 --> 03:40:02.289]  All the torture, you know, stuff, and it's been replaced with this story.
[03:40:02.289 --> 03:40:04.110]  It does seem a little convenient.
[03:40:04.110 --> 03:40:05.031]  Let me ask you this.
[03:40:05.031 --> 03:40:11.615]  It's been a 24-hour news cycle, but now we have 24 by 7 on swine flu.
[03:40:11.615 --> 03:40:19.541]  Not to downplay it, I think it may be a lot more serious than, of course, based on what I'm reading internal memos and what they're stating publicly.
[03:40:19.941 --> 03:40:35.257]  Now that you know, though, better than I, because you've been in government, I've just seen them do this from outside, that they will strategically lie to police and locals, telling them, like, you know, Bush told police, oh, there have been lots of secret terror attacks, every time a chemical plant would blow up or something.
[03:40:35.737 --> 03:40:38.578]  There have been lots of secret terror attacks.
[03:40:38.578 --> 03:40:40.698]  That's why we're taking all the rights, but don't tell the public.
[03:40:40.698 --> 03:40:41.498]  It'll panic them.
[03:40:41.498 --> 03:40:48.620]  They could also be feeding the locals like they did with the last bird flu freakout two years ago saying millions would die and they didn't.
[03:40:48.620 --> 03:40:52.521]  Like they did with the SARS five, six years ago saying total death and it didn't happen.
[03:40:52.521 --> 03:40:55.122]  I mean, what's the chance of it is just a total hoax?
[03:40:55.122 --> 03:40:58.543]  There's only been a few deaths and they're just hyping it.
[03:40:58.543 --> 03:41:02.003]  Well, I remember we had the West Nile virus scare too here.
[03:41:02.003 --> 03:41:04.504]  You know, they said anytime you see a dead bird, you know,
[03:41:05.049 --> 03:41:10.395]  Yeah, it was reported, so we had all these dead bird sightings all over the Washington area.
[03:41:10.395 --> 03:41:17.584]  Of course, you know, some people did get sick, but it did seem like it was a little bit hyped with the West Nile virus.
[03:41:17.584 --> 03:41:24.371]  Some of that may be at play here, but again, what Dr. Besser said in these internal CDC memos that were leaked to me was
[03:41:25.397 --> 03:41:30.800]  Was like, we don't know where this is heading, but we all have to be in, you know, in emergency mode.
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:39.264]  And this guy's background was handling the counterterrorism part of the equation for the Centers for Disease Control.
[03:41:39.264 --> 03:41:46.888]  I mean, he's in a very convenient position now, being somebody who came out of that particular area of counterterrorism.
[03:41:46.888 --> 03:41:53.572]  Obviously, you know, part of that whole counterterrorism thing is to scare the general public.
[03:41:55.151 --> 03:41:58.416]  Yeah, well, things are getting really bizarre.
[03:41:58.416 --> 03:42:09.253]  Speaking of PsyOps, day one, within hours of the giant plane, one of the Air Force Two, one of the four extras they have, is part of the Imperium now.
[03:42:10.464 --> 03:42:13.305]  Pelosi has several of her own cruisers.
[03:42:13.305 --> 03:42:14.525]  It cost unbelievable.
[03:42:14.525 --> 03:42:20.707]  But the point is, it's flying between the buildings, F-16s, and we said, my God, they knew that would terrorize people.
[03:42:20.707 --> 03:42:30.169]  Then it comes out, they knew for weeks in advance, made a big deal about it staying secret, told the police, this was a big operation, the FBI don't tell the public, there were internal fights about it.
[03:42:30.669 --> 03:42:35.393]  Then they fly it through and terrorize him, and Obama laughs and says, I didn't know about it, it was a photo-op.
[03:42:35.393 --> 03:42:36.794]  No one asked a photo-op for what?
[03:42:36.794 --> 03:42:39.236]  Well, a psy-op, a photo-op.
[03:42:39.236 --> 03:42:42.058]  Was that to re-conjure on top of the bird flu?
[03:42:42.058 --> 03:42:46.301]  A 9-11, like this is your, your, uh, the biological 9-11?
[03:42:46.301 --> 03:42:50.665]  I mean, I mean, what, I mean, we know they calculate everything.
[03:42:50.665 --> 03:42:51.966]  What was the point of that?
[03:42:53.140 --> 03:42:55.743]  Well, this was a strange thing.
[03:42:55.743 --> 03:43:01.769]  This whole operation where they said, I never heard of a classified photo op.
[03:43:01.769 --> 03:43:02.610]  A photo op?
[03:43:02.610 --> 03:43:04.492]  Where are they going to publish the photo?
[03:43:04.492 --> 03:43:05.253]  What magazine?
[03:43:05.253 --> 03:43:07.195]  What was this for?
[03:43:07.195 --> 03:43:08.457]  Why did they spend all that money?
[03:43:08.897 --> 03:43:15.103]  And classify this thing as some sort of secret mission, if it's just purely a photo-op.
[03:43:15.103 --> 03:43:16.484]  It makes no sense.
[03:43:16.484 --> 03:43:27.314]  And I can tell you from people I know, I know one friend of mine was standing on the Brooklyn Bridge when that happened, and witnessed those F-16s coming within just yards of some of these high-rise buildings.
[03:43:27.314 --> 03:43:34.581]  So, the idea that they said they informed people, I mean, Bloomberg says he wasn't informed, the New York, New Jersey Port Authority,
[03:43:34.946 --> 03:43:37.847]  We lost so many of their law enforcement officers on 9-11.
[03:43:37.847 --> 03:43:40.067]  They said they were not informed.
[03:43:40.067 --> 03:43:41.028]  Why terrorize them?
[03:43:41.028 --> 03:43:44.389]  Why is Obama going on 60 Minutes or even a groveling media guy?
[03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:45.609]  Well, it was real.
[03:43:45.609 --> 03:43:46.749]  He said, are you punch drunk?
[03:43:46.749 --> 03:43:47.829]  What's wrong with you?
[03:43:47.829 --> 03:43:49.390]  See, Gil, things are imploding with the economy.
[03:43:49.390 --> 03:43:57.392]  Obama's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
[03:43:57.694 --> 03:43:58.695]  Well, what's the sign-off?
[03:43:58.695 --> 03:44:05.541]  I mean, you worked in intelligence on the IT side, the surveillance side, but I mean, what is the... I mean, are these people completely psycho?
[03:44:05.541 --> 03:44:07.103]  I mean, what's going on?
[03:44:07.103 --> 03:44:09.745]  Well, you know, why do they do anything in New York?
[03:44:09.745 --> 03:44:16.131]  They know it's the media capital of the world, and it's going to get a lot of attention, and it did, it certainly did.
[03:44:16.131 --> 03:44:20.995]  Not good, not good attention in this case, but look how everybody was talking about it.
[03:44:22.310 --> 03:44:25.011]  It was the news of the day and actually two days.
[03:44:25.011 --> 03:44:27.253]  It was a two-day news cycle.
[03:44:27.253 --> 03:44:28.413]  But it did.
[03:44:28.413 --> 03:44:32.075]  The people in New York, I can tell you, were absolutely panicked.
[03:44:32.075 --> 03:44:35.156]  They didn't know what... not just New York, but also in New Jersey City.
[03:44:35.156 --> 03:44:39.419]  And their memo says they knew it would do that, so it's an admitted PSYOP.
[03:44:39.419 --> 03:44:42.380]  Why would they want to terrorize people?
[03:44:42.380 --> 03:44:45.602]  Well, you know, and how does Charles Schumer react to all this?
[03:44:45.602 --> 03:44:50.224]  He says, well, we need to have a law that prevents planes from flying too low instead of
[03:44:50.931 --> 03:44:52.833]  Questioning, it's like the 9-11 Commission.
[03:44:52.833 --> 03:44:53.775]  There is a law!
[03:44:53.775 --> 03:44:55.857]  That's controlled airspace!
[03:44:55.857 --> 03:44:56.398]  Exactly.
[03:44:56.398 --> 03:44:58.160]  Why aren't they going after the event?
[03:44:58.160 --> 03:45:01.844]  Why is Schumer talking about let's have a new law?
[03:45:01.844 --> 03:45:02.865]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[03:45:02.865 --> 03:45:05.949]  He's not going to ask the questions.
[03:45:06.329 --> 03:45:12.493]  What was Caldera, this military liaison, doing at the White House approving this in the first place?
[03:45:12.493 --> 03:45:13.854]  Who else was involved?
[03:45:13.854 --> 03:45:15.275]  Bob Gates says he didn't know.
[03:45:15.275 --> 03:45:16.836]  Well, he's the Secretary of Defense.
[03:45:16.836 --> 03:45:17.896]  Why didn't he know?
[03:45:17.896 --> 03:45:19.297]  Or is he lying about it?
[03:45:19.297 --> 03:45:24.981]  Look, as much attention as was put on this, and they admit it was a big debate, Wayne, why would they do it?
[03:45:24.981 --> 03:45:26.682]  Just to re-invoke 9-11 affairs?
[03:45:27.361 --> 03:45:28.922]  Well, that's what it did for New York.
[03:45:28.922 --> 03:45:36.504]  That's certainly the effect it had on lower Manhattan and Jersey City and Staten Island and all the other places around there.
[03:45:36.504 --> 03:45:42.366]  It's just taking Air Force One on a joyride.
[03:45:42.366 --> 03:45:47.008]  There actually is no logical explanation for what they did.
[03:45:47.008 --> 03:45:49.389]  That's all I can say.
[03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:53.010]  Look, some psy-op psychiatrist came up with this.
[03:45:53.010 --> 03:45:54.471]  They know it's all about archetypes.
[03:45:55.772 --> 03:45:58.496]  Uh, and, oh God, these people are out of their minds.
[03:45:58.496 --> 03:46:03.461]  So, so Wayne, in your gut, all these years, I've really learned to respect your predictions and things you've laid out.
[03:46:04.474 --> 03:46:05.615]  Where do you see them going?
[03:46:05.615 --> 03:46:12.059]  I mean, it's clear, or if you disagree, that the economy is just in free fall, in the middle of all the fear of the plane, fear of the flu.
[03:46:12.059 --> 03:46:15.021]  Obama comes out and is very calm and very fatherly.
[03:46:15.021 --> 03:46:22.965]  I mean, is it all about making him the leader, he's the savior, he'll fix it, as they just lead us into darkness?
[03:46:22.965 --> 03:46:24.186]  I mean, what's happening here?
[03:46:24.186 --> 03:46:31.211]  Well, maybe they didn't get enough balance from saving the ship from the pirates over there, so they had to come up with some other ideas.
[03:46:32.216 --> 03:46:34.698]  Certainly, somebody who lived in D.C.
[03:46:34.698 --> 03:46:39.842]  during the 9-11, and then we had the sniper case, and then we had anthrax.
[03:46:39.842 --> 03:46:53.414]  Certainly, you know, I've seen how this city can grind to a halt, and it seems like now with the first case of swine flu, we're seeing a repetition of that here in Washington.
[03:46:53.414 --> 03:46:55.356]  And we know what happened during anthrax.
[03:46:55.356 --> 03:46:57.177]  They put through that Patriot Act.
[03:46:57.177 --> 03:47:00.500]  When Congress came under attack, Congress had been dispersed, and they were able to
[03:47:00.860 --> 03:47:03.664]  Push that Patriot Act through.
[03:47:03.664 --> 03:47:04.685]  That's the reaction.
[03:47:04.685 --> 03:47:10.553]  That's how Washington reacts to these crisis modes.
[03:47:10.553 --> 03:47:14.018]  Certainly we may see something happen again here with this swine flu.
[03:47:14.369 --> 03:47:26.636]  When the bipartisan group of crooks wouldn't pass the Banker Takeover Bill that 98% of Americans in polls are against, as you know, Wayne, they terrorized people, Bush and the Democrats, and said, we'll have martial law if you don't do it, we'll have depression.
[03:47:26.636 --> 03:47:29.958]  And then things got worse.
[03:47:29.958 --> 03:47:33.960]  Now Biden's coming out saying, don't fly, don't get on subways.
[03:47:33.960 --> 03:47:36.401]  Mexico's shutting down, canceling its government.
[03:47:36.401 --> 03:47:38.663]  They've got to know this is a nail in the coffin.
[03:47:39.483 --> 03:47:42.004]  Potentially, as all this bad news stacks up.
[03:47:42.004 --> 03:47:44.325]  What's the PSYOP behind that?
[03:47:44.325 --> 03:47:47.066]  And what do you see this, whether it's a real deadly flu or not?
[03:47:47.066 --> 03:47:54.009]  I mean, they've got to know this is, and it's clearly engineered, so I guess they want to fully destroy the economy.
[03:47:54.958 --> 03:47:58.362]  Well, also, this is an international, this is international in scope.
[03:47:58.362 --> 03:48:12.498]  I noted that China, which has never wanted Taiwan to be as part of any kind of UN organization, China has now said, okay, Taiwan can now take part in World Health Organization meetings on swine flu.
[03:48:12.498 --> 03:48:16.002]  So we're seeing a big international push right now.
[03:48:16.827 --> 03:48:25.290]  Uh, this is a global issue, uh, and, uh, it seems like, uh, like state and municipal governments are complying with what the federal government's saying.
[03:48:25.290 --> 03:48:30.871]  We're seeing national governments basically saying, uh, we'll do whatever the World Health Organization tells us to do.
[03:48:30.871 --> 03:48:32.912]  So that it's not just this country.
[03:48:32.912 --> 03:48:37.193]  Every government in the world is now, uh, just saying, you know, uh, what do we do?
[03:48:37.193 --> 03:48:39.454]  How do we, how do we confront this issue?
[03:48:39.454 --> 03:48:41.435]  Talk about travel restrictions.
[03:48:41.435 --> 03:48:44.976]  We've got bans on flights to Mexico, bans on flights from Mexico now.
[03:48:45.416 --> 03:48:50.897]  And now also maybe a ban on flights to and from the United States to certain parts of the world.
[03:48:50.897 --> 03:48:51.858]  Eureka!
[03:48:51.858 --> 03:48:53.538]  That's why I love having people like you on, Wayne.
[03:48:53.538 --> 03:48:54.798]  You made it just click.
[03:48:54.798 --> 03:48:57.059]  Clearly, this is the international 9-11.
[03:48:57.059 --> 03:48:59.600]  Whether it's hype or not, it has the same effect.
[03:48:59.600 --> 03:49:00.060]  The U.N.'
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:07.041]  's bragging in Reuters that it's telling the U.S., Canada, Australia, England, Mexico what to do.
[03:49:07.041 --> 03:49:10.622]  This is the global crisis to bring us together, just like the S.P.P.
[03:49:10.622 --> 03:49:12.923]  documents said they would for North American Union.
[03:49:13.803 --> 03:49:21.588]  During this, and they're setting up the new Bank of the World and the G20 agreement and the new SDRs.
[03:49:21.588 --> 03:49:22.789]  I mean, is that what you're getting at?
[03:49:22.789 --> 03:49:24.410]  That this is their global 9-11 biological?
[03:49:43.743 --> 03:49:44.444]  Thank you.
[03:50:01.397 --> 03:50:07.480]  And we have riots starting and attacks on government everywhere that look like they're organic.
[03:50:07.480 --> 03:50:15.824]  Perfect timing to have this as a big unifying effect through fear to make everybody drop their rebellion against tyranny to just worry about their lives.
[03:50:15.824 --> 03:50:20.727]  And a perfect beta test, or it could be the perfect cover right now for Marshall Lalwayne.
[03:50:21.880 --> 03:50:23.401]  Well, certainly, yeah.
[03:50:23.401 --> 03:50:24.481]  I mean, that's what I say.
[03:50:24.481 --> 03:50:28.723]  I mean, fear is the only weapon these people have at their disposal.
[03:50:28.723 --> 03:50:38.207]  And when you're talking about a pandemic, you know, not many people are walking around with degrees in microbiology or virology, so they don't have to.
[03:50:38.207 --> 03:50:39.847]  They'll just believe what they're told.
[03:50:39.847 --> 03:50:40.888]  They have no other choice.
[03:50:42.609 --> 03:50:46.032]  These medical emergencies are really the fear factor.
[03:50:46.032 --> 03:50:50.757]  You can throw terrorism stuff at them, but a lot of people are on to that number.
[03:50:50.757 --> 03:50:53.380]  They know about these false flag operations and whatnot.
[03:50:53.380 --> 03:50:58.445]  But when it comes to a pandemic, that's when there are people worried about their children and whatnot.
[03:50:58.445 --> 03:50:59.145]  Stay there, Wayne.
[03:50:59.145 --> 03:51:00.186]  Final segment.
[03:51:00.186 --> 03:51:00.907]  Wayne Madsen Report.
[03:51:03.373 --> 03:51:03.953]  We're good to go.

[03:51:58.373 --> 03:52:07.522]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.300 --> 03:52:14.184]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.184 --> 03:52:20.688]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.688 --> 03:52:22.649]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.649 --> 03:52:25.111]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.111 --> 03:52:35.998]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.288 --> 03:52:39.969]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.969 --> 03:52:41.830]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:48.732]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.732 --> 03:52:56.996]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.996 --> 03:52:58.576]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.576 --> 03:52:59.757]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.528 --> 03:53:02.429]  Attention, gardeners!
[03:53:02.429 --> 03:53:05.010]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[03:53:05.010 --> 03:53:09.553]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[03:53:09.553 --> 03:53:17.758]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[03:53:17.758 --> 03:53:20.580]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[03:53:20.865 --> 03:53:28.487]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[03:53:28.487 --> 03:53:34.309]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:40.151]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[03:53:40.151 --> 03:53:43.392]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[03:53:43.692 --> 03:53:47.293]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[03:53:47.293 --> 03:53:52.355]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[03:53:52.355 --> 03:53:55.275]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[03:53:55.275 --> 03:53:55.515]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:54:06.567 --> 03:54:07.828]  Got a bunch of control freaks.
[03:54:07.828 --> 03:54:11.550]  They'll kill a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis and not blink.
[03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:12.630]  Feel good all day about it.
[03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:15.332]  Don't think they won't release a designer virus.
[03:54:15.332 --> 03:54:18.874]  Let's just hope it's not really a killer, like they're internally telling their people.
[03:54:18.874 --> 03:54:20.074]  We've confirmed that.
[03:54:20.074 --> 03:54:26.038]  We're at level six, folks, with total martial law, mass arrests, checkpoints, already quarantines everywhere.
[03:54:26.038 --> 03:54:27.679]  They're already running checkpoints.
[03:54:28.439 --> 03:54:30.200]  People are sweating and high because your A.C.'
[03:54:30.160 --> 03:54:30.620]  's broke.
[03:54:30.620 --> 03:54:32.221]  They drag you off the facility.
[03:54:32.221 --> 03:54:34.042]  And I'm not even freaking out over that.
[03:54:34.042 --> 03:54:36.143]  That's how ready for this I've always been.
[03:54:36.143 --> 03:54:37.604]  Tracking the enemy.
[03:54:37.604 --> 03:54:43.067]  Thewaynemadsinreport.com Waynemadsinreport.com We'll put that up on screen for you.
[03:54:43.067 --> 03:54:44.048]  Uninvaluable!
[03:54:44.748 --> 03:54:46.509]  Source of knowledge and data.
[03:54:46.509 --> 03:54:50.970]  We'll have to get him back on the next few days and next week as things develop.
[03:54:50.970 --> 03:54:53.170]  But he is in demand all over the international media.
[03:54:53.170 --> 03:55:01.872]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time, with Jason Bermas, with The Info Warrior, with all the latest developments and guests.
[03:55:01.872 --> 03:55:03.413]  Please continue to spread the word about the show.
[03:55:04.253 --> 03:55:14.803]  If they're hacking and bringing down InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you can try the ObamaDeception.net, JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:55:14.803 --> 03:55:19.227]  Those are the auxiliary sites, and most, if not all, the news is on those as well.
[03:55:19.227 --> 03:55:22.230]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.
[03:55:22.230 --> 03:55:23.391]  Remember those sites.
[03:55:23.391 --> 03:55:23.832]  Remember.
[03:55:25.032 --> 03:55:26.493]  Let's go back to Wayne Madsen.
[03:55:26.493 --> 03:55:29.194]  Wayne, in closing, just amazing points you brought up today.
[03:55:29.194 --> 03:55:31.114]  It really got me thinking.
[03:55:31.114 --> 03:55:40.037]  Here in our little think tank, any other things you think are important or things on the horizon with Pakistan, Iran, Israel saying they want to go in.
[03:55:40.037 --> 03:55:41.657]  Is all of this a cover for that?
[03:55:41.657 --> 03:55:48.199]  You know, they love the magic trick of look at my pretty assistant while they put the rabbit in the hat and pull it out.
[03:55:48.199 --> 03:55:50.400]  I mean, we know they love distraction.
[03:55:50.400 --> 03:55:53.261]  They're trying to pass a lot of draconian bills, world government.
[03:55:53.661 --> 03:55:54.982]  Internet restrictions.
[03:55:54.982 --> 03:55:56.723]  What do you see happening?
[03:55:56.723 --> 03:56:08.970]  Well, certainly this thing, this swine flu is taking the attention off of what's going on with the possible collapse of the Pakistani nation, a nuclear country, a nuclear weaponized country.
[03:56:08.970 --> 03:56:14.493]  I would also point out that one of the things getting very little attention is the U.S.
[03:56:14.493 --> 03:56:17.595]  Army Bioweapons Laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[03:56:17.595 --> 03:56:20.657]  Now, there have been reports that samples of
[03:56:22.869 --> 03:56:29.436]  Uh, various diseases are missing from their biosafety level 4 laboratory.
[03:56:29.436 --> 03:56:33.080]  These are things like swine flu.
[03:56:33.080 --> 03:56:35.482]  That place needs to be closed down.
[03:56:35.482 --> 03:56:40.888]  The military and CIA has no business being involved in this kind of research.
[03:56:40.888 --> 03:56:42.269]  It's actually a violation of the 19th
[03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.290]  I don't
[03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:23.603]  Uh, just, as that's said, issue an executive order, shut down Fort Detrick, turn what needs to be turned over to the CDC and National Institutes of Health, and whatever else is left there, just carefully have that stuff destroyed, because we can't, we just can't afford to have, have them up there, those, those, those Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein's working at Frederick.
[03:57:24.627 --> 03:57:32.112]  I mean, the only decent guy was probably Dr. Bruce Ivins, who they said did the anthrax, but I don't think did, but they said he committed suicide.
[03:57:32.112 --> 03:57:44.579]  Well, now they've built 36 level 4 and level 3 bioweapons labs in the name of treatment, but even the Baltimore Sun admitted that this is really a cover for bioweapons.
[03:57:44.579 --> 03:57:44.879]  Go ahead.
[03:57:45.484 --> 03:57:57.488]  Absolutely, and then we had the incident on the inner city passenger train in Switzerland the other day where a canister containing swine flu explodes with 61 passengers on the train.
[03:57:57.488 --> 03:58:02.350]  And now there's 22 documented cases of swine flu outbreak in Switzerland.
[03:58:02.350 --> 03:58:05.151]  What in the world were they moving that stuff on a passenger train?
[03:58:06.302 --> 03:58:09.903]  Sounds like a stage bio attack to me.
[03:58:09.903 --> 03:58:10.704]  Absolutely.
[03:58:10.704 --> 03:58:11.124]  Absolutely.
[03:58:11.124 --> 03:58:12.684]  It's incredible what's going on.
[03:58:12.684 --> 03:58:14.965]  Could this be the start of World War III?
[03:58:14.965 --> 03:58:15.805]  Maybe we don't even know it.
[03:58:15.805 --> 03:58:18.346]  This is the future war?
[03:58:18.346 --> 03:58:20.007]  Could be.
[03:58:20.007 --> 03:58:21.907]  I perished the thought.
[03:58:21.907 --> 03:58:22.407]  Alright.
[03:58:22.407 --> 03:58:23.908]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:58:23.908 --> 03:58:24.408]  Check it out.
[03:58:24.408 --> 03:58:26.869]  Wayne, thank you for your great insight and your great patriotism.
[03:58:27.708 --> 03:58:28.428]  Good to have you with us.
[03:58:28.428 --> 03:58:29.068]  God bless you.
[03:58:29.068 --> 03:58:32.629]  Ladies and gentlemen, retransmission with jam-packed key news!
[03:58:32.629 --> 03:58:34.390]  I open the show with one place.
[03:58:34.390 --> 03:58:37.671]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and on all our red affiliates.
[03:58:37.671 --> 03:58:38.611]  Tonight, nine to midnight.
[03:58:38.611 --> 03:58:40.872]  Join us, and back tomorrow, spread the word.
[03:58:40.872 --> 03:58:44.493]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:44.493 --> 03:58:46.973]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.547 --> 03:58:53.228]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.228 --> 03:58:57.970]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:57.970 --> 03:59:00.932]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:00.932 --> 03:59:03.974]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:03.974 --> 03:59:09.817]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.057 --> 03:59:13.279]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.279 --> 03:59:20.282]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.282 --> 03:59:23.564]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[03:59:38.732 --> 03:59:40.093]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:40.093 --> 03:59:40.713]  Take action today.
[03:59:40.713 --> 03:59:42.535]  The first step is getting storable food.
