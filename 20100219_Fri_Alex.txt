[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.640 --> 00:32.160]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:32.160 --> 00:39.680]  we are live ladies and gentlemen on this friday the 19th day of february 2010 four
[00:39.680 --> 00:47.040]  hours of radio broadcast lay before us we have our once a week visit in the third
[00:47.040 --> 00:50.640]  hour with bob Chapman of international forecaster of course i'm alex jones
[00:50.640 --> 00:54.960]  of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[00:57.440 --> 01:06.480]  we have got a deeper view into joe stack who is being billed by the mainstream media as the
[01:06.480 --> 01:16.880]  kamikaze attacker of the irs slash fbi field office complex in north austin here in texas
[01:18.080 --> 01:21.920]  of course we broadcast from austin texas we've been out to his burned down house
[01:23.840 --> 01:28.800]  we have talked to multiple witnesses on the ground we have collated local media reports
[01:28.800 --> 01:35.680]  of emergency personnel on the ground before the plane sped into the building yesterday morning
[01:35.680 --> 01:47.600]  at 955 am central time we have a source that talked to the fbi and said that they had dispatched
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.040]  people concerning a possible threat in austin that isn't evidence of a false flag they could
[01:53.040 --> 02:00.640]  have been responding to his suicide slash manifesto it appears the manifesto is real
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.440]  from his own personal website there's been a lot of confusion on that front obviously because people
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.120]  didn't know that was real or not for the first few hours could have been planted on his site we
[02:11.120 --> 02:16.080]  don't know we're going to break down all the different facets today but in the first hour of
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.960]  the radio broadcast yesterday i said that there was a good chance the media was going to try to
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.480]  blame it on the tea parties some people said how can you say that jones well i was right
[02:26.480 --> 02:33.280]  two hours into the show they were already all over time magazine you name it saying that we're
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.360]  going to go over those headlines the good news is myself and many others have culled through the
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.160]  central texas tea party groups leaders of the local tea party groups are on record that he was never
[02:44.160 --> 02:50.640]  at their events not part of their events no one knew him but i will tell you who knew him rob do
[02:53.120 --> 03:00.240]  rob do has footage he shot of mr stack playing for another band that he was friends with and he
[03:00.240 --> 03:07.040]  filled in for them whenever their guitar player or keyboard player was out or unavailable or sick
[03:07.040 --> 03:12.640]  he knew mr stack pretty well and didn't realize it because he's played with so many musicians it's
[03:12.640 --> 03:18.640]  like a small town community you got a million people in austin but the the musician community is
[03:18.640 --> 03:23.200]  like a small town everybody knows everybody basically and it's coming out that mr stack played
[03:23.200 --> 03:29.840]  for some other big musicians in austin texas was a very talented musician never talked about violence
[03:31.840 --> 03:37.520]  his house is burned almost to the ground we've been there tried to talk to neighbors and they said
[03:37.520 --> 03:40.800]  we'd have been here a few hours ago we would have talked to you but we've made a commitment not to
[03:40.800 --> 03:48.080]  talk now i.e the police told them not to talk why is that why did the fbi order his website taken
[03:48.080 --> 03:55.440]  down so then other people could post on the web saying it wasn't his real manifesto that was a
[03:55.440 --> 04:05.600]  point mike revero made and this thing could be a real organic angry person at the irs
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.320]  i don't know we'll find out more in the coming hours and days but i have a lot of key info we're
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.080]  going to go through you can make up your own decision you can call in and give us your take
[04:16.080 --> 04:23.440]  on what's happening on this front but what we do know is the blogosphere the so-called left media
[04:24.960 --> 04:31.600]  has seized upon this in an attempt to demonize the tea party movement as i predicted they would do
[04:31.600 --> 04:37.760]  in the first hour if there was any evidence of this being deliberate and in the first five minutes
[04:37.760 --> 04:43.200]  of the show i said because the plane flew straight in at high speed looked like it was under control
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.440]  because it was a government-filled building that it was probably going to end up being intentional
[04:47.440 --> 04:53.440]  we were right on that front now the question is did he do it on purpose himself or was it a setup
[04:54.320 --> 04:57.920]  we'll go through all the evidence straight ahead we got a surprise guest coming up later in the show
[04:57.920 --> 05:06.400]  as well stay with us one major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system the main
[05:06.400 --> 05:11.920]  event is the wholesale destruction of the world the push for every nation on the globe to identify

[08:06.560 --> 08:23.120]  network i am really excited about the special guest we have scheduled coming up later on the
[08:23.120 --> 08:28.880]  broadcast but just like last week with the blizzards hitting the east coast we were unable
[08:28.880 --> 08:33.920]  to have that professor on which testified on the deadly nature of the fluoride chemicals
[08:33.920 --> 08:38.560]  because they use that as a catchall term and uh literally the university was that was snowed out
[08:38.560 --> 08:44.800]  and shut down and this particular guest is in an area that's snowed out pretty bad right now
[08:44.800 --> 08:52.400]  and their phone is just not this connected it's just dead uh but i'm crossing my fingers because
[08:52.400 --> 08:57.120]  this is a pretty big guest we're very excited about it coming up also bob Chapman the international
[08:57.120 --> 09:03.760]  forecaster always joins us on fridays in the third hour and i talked to mike revero this morning
[09:03.760 --> 09:10.800]  i'm trying to get him to pop in with his view of uh what he thinks his perspective on what's
[09:10.800 --> 09:19.200]  happening with this airplane kamikaze attack on the irs building he seems to believe it's real
[09:19.200 --> 09:28.480]  he seems to believe that this guy was really disgruntled and angry and i respect mikes for
[09:28.480 --> 09:35.520]  you i mean i'm he's a pretty smart guy but i told him obama was a was a bad guy and uh
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.440]  he was wrong for endorsing him i said it's gonna be the same thing and he admitted that later
[09:40.160 --> 09:46.000]  so he's not infallible but neither am i uh i've said from the beginning this thing stinks from
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.680]  high heaven and i believe they're going to stage a terror attack in austin because the evidence
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.320]  is clear that the feds fire bombed the governor's mansion and that's a long story but we've gone
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.480]  over before and i know that a federal informant who was involved with a palestinian man that was
[10:02.480 --> 10:08.720]  clearly murdered was also involved with other austin activists trying to get them to fire bomb
[10:08.720 --> 10:13.680]  brave new books according to their reports was also the guy setting people up in minnesota on
[10:13.680 --> 10:19.280]  record he admits that with the mall off cocktails at the rnc there's a lot of other pieces of evidence
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.560]  that go into this literally hundreds the point is is that i've been looking at austin
[10:25.360 --> 10:29.680]  as one of the prime places and people emailed me in the last two months when i've been saying this
[10:29.680 --> 10:36.000]  every week saying well why are you saying austin why not new york why not la and certainly those
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.280]  are targets as well i'm telling you austin ladies and gentlemen so when i see something like this
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.600]  at the start of the show i didn't learn about if i was driving into work about 30 minutes after it
[10:45.600 --> 10:51.440]  happened at about 10 30 i get ready at home i'd miss the news my wife starts calling me going
[10:51.440 --> 10:57.840]  you know do you know about this i mr call listener voicemail heard it got into the office came on air
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.920]  the preliminary reports were the plane leveled off straight line into the first and second floor
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.400]  accelerating didn't sound like somebody having a heart attack to me then we learned it was a
[11:08.400 --> 11:13.520]  government filled complex what's the chances of a government building being hit by accident
[11:13.520 --> 11:20.480]  like this and i said folks they're probably going to say it was on purpose and then they're going
[11:20.480 --> 11:28.080]  to say the tea parties are involved and what happened hundreds of mainstream news articles
[11:28.080 --> 11:40.800]  saying this hundreds kamikaze attack well here's the headline corporate media blames kamikaze
[11:40.800 --> 11:51.520]  attack on tea parties time magazine here's some of the other articles new york daily news kamikaze
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.480]  pilot joe stack who crashed plane into austin building hailed by anti-government groups
[11:56.480 --> 12:02.080]  and they stick me in here i said if this was intentional it's horrible and gives the government
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.120]  exactly what they want and i'm getting calls and emails saying no it's good let's start the violence
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.120]  now you people have no idea what's going to happen if a bloody revolution starts do you
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.200]  that's exactly what north com is hoping for here's another one in the statesman
[12:18.240 --> 12:24.560]  social media speeds up news gathering and plane crash aftermath and it implies very deceptively
[12:24.560 --> 12:39.280]  this omar galaga is that a pronounce it g a l a g a galaga and it says the austin based website
[12:39.280 --> 12:46.960]  info wars dot com owned by conspiracy theorist alex jones yeah i read the peanut documents on
[12:46.960 --> 12:53.200]  air i read the climate aid emails that are official and admitted and newsweek comes out and says they
[12:53.200 --> 12:58.960]  don't exist i mean people are sick the austin based website info wars dot com owned by conspiracy
[12:58.960 --> 13:06.560]  theorist alex jones had speculated that the manifesto was a hoax no we didn't
[13:09.520 --> 13:19.120]  when watson first found it he said it's on this art website this embedded art website looks like
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.760]  it's stacked site but they've confirmed his name is stacked and it says this is stacked site but we
[13:23.760 --> 13:30.800]  don't know we put it up within minutes everybody else had it and we so for 10 15 minutes we were
[13:30.800 --> 13:38.800]  saying we don't know if this is real the austin based website info wars this is the imply we're
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.120]  wrong about things or just like the rest of media trying to figure out what happened live on air
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.480]  the austin based website info wars owned by conspiracy theorist alex jones has speculated
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.800]  the manifesto was a hoax later in the day info wars itself was inaccessible guys is that true
[13:52.800 --> 14:01.280]  was info wars dot com inaccessible yesterday watson said he never saw that info wars was part of a
[14:01.280 --> 14:08.960]  flood of quickly sprouting blog post then facebook pages examining theories such as austin texas
[14:08.960 --> 14:16.240]  playing crash was staged or supporting stacks alleged point of view that joe take my pound of
[14:16.240 --> 14:26.000]  flesh stacks anti irs fan page so it says info wars was part of a flood nothing on my site written
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.360]  or posted by us saying this was good and then they go on to mention another site but imply we're
[14:33.360 --> 14:40.160]  calling for violence same thing in the new york daily news kamikaze pilot joe stack
[14:40.160 --> 14:47.440]  who crashed plane into austin building hailed by anti-government groups
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.760]  but they've got loy dogged in here saying it was outrageous that some americans were praising stack
[14:57.760 --> 15:04.240]  so the implica and then they go to me isn't that nice this was a cowardly act of domestic terrorism
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.480]  he said and stacks rant reflects a steadily increasing flow of the government is out to get
[15:08.480 --> 15:14.160]  me paranoia on the other end of the crazy scale internet conspiracy theorists including austin
[15:14.160 --> 15:19.680]  radio host alex jones were quick yesterday to declare that the plane crash was staged by the
[15:19.680 --> 15:27.760]  government to demonize the tea party movement no we said this may be what's happening before anyone
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.560]  even knew it was intentional i said watch they may say it's intentional and they're gonna blame the
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.760]  tea party and i was right again which then really got me concerned last night this could have been
[15:37.760 --> 15:47.440]  staged and we don't know now i got a call from someone in our office i'll who's done work for
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.840]  our office i'll just leave it at that who's been a good source in the past
[15:54.720 --> 16:04.000]  and the fbi out of dallas called him in the morning and said we don't know someone he knows
[16:04.000 --> 16:11.360]  us called him and because he worked had worked previously with his father the father of this
[16:11.360 --> 16:18.960]  agent contacted him and said look last night paper came across my desk some type of threat
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.000]  in austin on a government building they dispatched four officers and we wrote an article paul watson
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.160]  did saying look this could be from the screed that was posted from the manifesto and that
[16:30.160 --> 16:37.280]  doesn't mean the government was involved or it could mean because we know with oklahoma city
[16:37.280 --> 16:41.840]  bombing and it was later declassified and confirmed years after it was called a conspiracy theory
[16:41.840 --> 16:47.040]  that the fbi terror response team responded two days before and was in oklahoma city
[16:47.600 --> 16:53.120]  and they tried to deny this for years it's now confirmed just like juliani remember uh kennedy
[16:53.120 --> 17:01.680]  the fema new york director this is in watson's article remember how
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.880]  he went on abc news and cbs on 911 saying yeah we deployed the night before for a terror attack
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.040]  on the world trade centers and then juliani it turned out gave two interviews saying the same
[17:13.040 --> 17:16.240]  thing and then later in congressional testimony said oh no that never happened then it got
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.200]  declassified it was called tripod too for an attack on the world trade center complex and they'd
[17:21.200 --> 17:27.680]  moved the emergency center out of building seven the night before september 10th to the end of one
[17:27.680 --> 17:34.240]  of the big peers in mobile emergency command centers so not only were they there the night
[17:34.240 --> 17:41.440]  before they then lied about it and then later it was proven accurate so we simply say was this
[17:41.440 --> 17:52.800]  staged or did they just get a warning about his manifesto we don't know this needs to be
[17:52.800 --> 17:59.760]  investigated and the fbi agent didn't know he just said you you're talking to this particular
[17:59.760 --> 18:11.920]  journalist that we spoke with i'll leave it at that he just says this went on and he put two
[18:11.920 --> 18:16.480]  and two together it was you know a minor thing that happened during the day to see them hurriedly
[18:16.480 --> 18:21.760]  dispatched he didn't know the specifics other than it was a threat on a government building in austin
[18:22.480 --> 18:26.560]  and then the next morning it all comes together and then we have the local newscast
[18:26.560 --> 18:30.640]  and other eyewitnesses we've talked to that said yeah there were fire trucks and police
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.640]  out there before this happened and then other witnesses that went to their apartment windows
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.080]  is surrounded by apartments and businesses and they said boom they heard the big explosion
[18:42.240 --> 18:46.640]  hundreds of windows falling out of the building on two different sides they go to their window
[18:46.640 --> 18:53.680]  and there's already fbi out there with video cameras in fact let's go to this clip from
[18:53.680 --> 19:01.040]  kxan news nbc of one of the witnesses here it is is there anything else that you would like to say
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.640]  after seeing this this morning i guess sorry the one thing i would like to say is that i know the
[19:06.640 --> 19:10.720]  the fire department got here real fast because they actually had a an engine sitting over there
[19:10.720 --> 19:16.400]  that just happened to be doing something with hazmat so they were over here like right away
[19:16.400 --> 19:23.120]  so i guess i guess that's the one good thing yeah well megan thank you so much again it's always

[27:38.280 --> 27:40.280]  Okay, here's what's going to happen
[27:40.280 --> 27:41.280]  I'm going to go to break
[27:41.280 --> 27:43.280]  In a short segment here in a few minutes
[27:43.280 --> 27:45.280]  And we're going to come back and go A to Z
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.280]  Through the entire Joe Stack story
[27:49.280 --> 27:51.280]  Then I'm going to open the phones up
[27:51.280 --> 27:53.280]  To get your take on what's happening
[27:53.280 --> 27:55.280]  Only on this subject
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.280]  Here's the number, 1-800-259-9231
[28:00.280 --> 28:03.280]  Is there any key pieces of info we haven't covered?
[28:03.280 --> 28:05.280]  What's your gut take on this?
[28:05.280 --> 28:08.280]  What do you think of me being right again, unfortunately?
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.280]  This may end up being an intentional event
[28:11.280 --> 28:13.280]  This is the start of the show
[28:13.280 --> 28:17.280]  Hour and a half before the media confirmed it
[28:17.280 --> 28:19.280]  And they're going to try to blame it on the Tea Parties
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.280]  They've certainly done that
[28:20.280 --> 28:21.280]  Here's AP headline
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.280]  Texas man angry with IRS crashes plane into office

[28:42.280 --> 28:44.280]  Attack in Austin
[28:44.280 --> 28:47.280]  Outrage loaned wolf or false flag op
[28:47.280 --> 28:51.280]  Those are our type of headlines
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.280]  But here's what the mainstream media are saying
[28:55.280 --> 28:58.280]  New York Times, New York Magazine, Washington Post
[28:58.280 --> 29:00.280]  Time agree
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.280]  Joe Stack was one crazy tea bagger
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.280]  This is the national review online article
[29:09.280 --> 29:10.280]  Here's another headline
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.280]  Austin plane crash labeled right wing domestic terror attack
[29:15.280 --> 29:17.280]  By Obama supporters
[29:17.280 --> 29:21.280]  But this morning, news that Joe Stack was not a Tea Party member
[29:21.280 --> 29:23.280]  Disappoints Obamanoids
[29:23.280 --> 29:32.280]  Key article by Paul Joseph Watson

[29:45.280 --> 29:47.280]  I'm super excited

[29:49.280 --> 29:52.280]  Right now to tune on the M&FM or satellite or internet
[29:52.280 --> 29:53.280]  We're on the march
[29:53.280 --> 29:55.280]  The Empire's on the run
[29:55.280 --> 30:01.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:01.280 --> 30:04.280]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[30:04.280 --> 30:07.280]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[30:07.280 --> 30:09.280]  How much ammunition do you want?
[30:09.280 --> 30:11.280]  My answer would be all I can get
[30:11.280 --> 30:14.280]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[30:14.280 --> 30:16.280]  Food is your only ammunition
[30:16.280 --> 30:17.280]  How much do you want?
[30:17.280 --> 30:18.280]  When do you want it?
[30:18.280 --> 30:20.280]  Now or after the battle starts
[30:20.280 --> 30:21.280]  When will you need it?
[30:21.280 --> 30:23.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.280 --> 30:25.280]  Will there be any food?
[30:25.280 --> 30:26.280]  Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.280 --> 30:29.280]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[30:29.280 --> 30:32.280]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[30:32.280 --> 30:35.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[30:35.280 --> 30:39.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[30:39.280 --> 30:40.280]  How much will you need?
[30:40.280 --> 30:41.280]  We don't know
[30:41.280 --> 30:42.280]  How much do you want?
[30:42.280 --> 30:43.280]  All you can get
[30:43.280 --> 30:44.280]  I'm Alex Jones
[30:44.280 --> 30:47.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[30:47.280 --> 30:52.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[30:52.280 --> 30:55.280]  Or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[30:55.280 --> 31:00.280]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633
[31:02.280 --> 31:06.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[31:06.280 --> 31:09.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[31:09.280 --> 31:11.280]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[31:11.280 --> 31:14.280]  We'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[31:14.280 --> 31:18.280]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress
[31:18.280 --> 31:20.280]  And they really are calling the shots
[31:20.280 --> 31:23.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[31:23.280 --> 31:26.280]  As American citizens to pay attention
[31:26.280 --> 31:29.280]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[31:29.280 --> 31:33.280]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[31:33.280 --> 31:36.280]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[31:36.280 --> 31:38.280]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[31:38.280 --> 31:40.280]  They're asking for more matches
[31:40.280 --> 31:42.280]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[31:42.280 --> 31:44.280]  Today seems like nobody does care
[31:44.280 --> 31:46.280]  And right now in Washington DC
[31:46.280 --> 31:49.280]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[31:49.280 --> 31:52.280]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[31:52.280 --> 31:54.280]  At infowars.com
[31:54.280 --> 31:56.280]  We're watching online right now
[31:56.280 --> 32:00.280]  In super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[32:00.280 --> 32:02.280]  George Washington said
[32:02.280 --> 32:05.280]  Government is not reason, it is not eloquence
[32:05.280 --> 32:07.280]  It is force, like fire
[32:07.280 --> 32:09.280]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
[32:09.280 --> 32:12.280]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people
[32:12.280 --> 32:13.280]  And the protector of our liberty
[32:13.280 --> 32:15.280]  But has become that fearful master
[32:15.280 --> 32:18.280]  We the people must understand the nature of this government
[32:18.280 --> 32:21.280]  Gonna ride if we are to be successful in saving our country
[32:21.280 --> 32:23.280]  America is being deliberately destroyed
[32:23.280 --> 32:25.280]  By a cabal of international gangsters
[32:25.280 --> 32:27.280]  So that she can be forced into subjugation
[32:27.280 --> 32:28.280]  To a one world government
[32:28.280 --> 32:30.280]  The God-given, unalienable rights
[32:30.280 --> 32:32.280]  Of the Declaration of Independence are in jeopardy
[32:32.280 --> 32:35.280]  We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men
[32:35.280 --> 32:38.280]  Utopia Silver Supplements believes it is our God-given right
[32:38.280 --> 32:40.280]  To make our own healthcare decisions
[32:40.280 --> 32:41.280]  However, we deem best
[32:41.280 --> 32:44.280]  If we can help you with your supplement needs and better health
[32:44.280 --> 32:46.280]  Then help us win this health freedom battle
[32:46.280 --> 32:49.280]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com
[32:49.280 --> 32:52.280]  That's utopiasilver.com
[32:52.280 --> 32:55.280]  Or call 888-2134-338
[32:55.280 --> 32:59.280]  Again, 888-2134-338
[33:11.280 --> 33:15.280]  There's a man going around taking names
[33:15.280 --> 33:18.280]  And he decides who to free
[33:18.280 --> 33:21.280]  And who to blame
[33:21.280 --> 33:26.280]  Everybody won't be treated all the same
[33:26.280 --> 33:30.280]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
[33:30.280 --> 33:32.280]  When the man
[33:32.280 --> 33:36.280]  When the man comes around
[33:39.280 --> 33:43.280]  The hairs on your arm will stand up
[33:43.280 --> 33:49.280]  At the terror in each sip and in each sip
[33:49.280 --> 33:54.280]  Will you partake of that last offered cup
[33:54.280 --> 34:00.280]  Or disappear into the potter's grab
[34:00.280 --> 34:02.280]  When the man comes around
[34:02.280 --> 34:03.280]  Okay, we are back live.
[34:03.280 --> 34:06.280]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:06.280 --> 34:11.280]  I want to take your phone calls
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.280]  Multitudes are marching to the big cattle drum
[34:16.280 --> 34:20.280]  Voices calling, voices crying
[34:20.280 --> 34:22.280]  And I want to break down all the latest
[34:22.280 --> 34:25.280]  Joe Stack kamikaze attack reports
[34:25.280 --> 34:27.280]  We don't know what really happened yet
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.280]  But it doesn't look good either way
[34:31.280 --> 34:36.280]  It's very sad for those that died.
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.280]  The media is now saying that he died in one other person
[34:39.280 --> 34:41.280]  And several other injured.
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.280]  But I don't really watch Glenn Beck.
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.280]  I watch a little short YouTube clips of him and things.
[34:47.280 --> 34:49.280]  And I'll talk about this more when Bob Chapman's on with us
[34:49.280 --> 34:51.280]  In an hour and a half.
[34:51.280 --> 34:54.280]  Not going to spend much time on it.
[34:54.280 --> 34:55.280]  But it was unspeakable.
[34:55.280 --> 34:57.280]  He compared himself to the founding fathers.
[34:57.280 --> 34:59.280]  Said he was the founding fathers.
[34:59.280 --> 35:01.280]  Then he took a picture of Medina and put
[35:01.280 --> 35:04.280]  Debra Medina running for governor in Texas
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.280]  And put her next to Van Jones and pointed at her
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.280]  And said these people hate America.
[35:12.280 --> 35:15.280]  It's all designed for people with the mind of like
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.280]  Six or seven year olds.
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.280]  How dare him say that she hates America.
[35:20.280 --> 35:21.280]  That's what he did.
[35:21.280 --> 35:23.280]  It's so deceptive.
[35:23.280 --> 35:25.280]  It's so manipulative.
[35:25.280 --> 35:27.280]  And he was covering Joe Stack saying
[35:27.280 --> 35:29.280]  We don't know who this man is.
[35:29.280 --> 35:32.280]  We don't know if he was a left winger or a right winger.
[35:32.280 --> 35:34.280]  Well, analyzing his letter and analyzing
[35:34.280 --> 35:36.280]  Talking to people that knew him.
[35:36.280 --> 35:38.280]  Rob Do is going to be in studio in the last hour today.
[35:38.280 --> 35:40.280]  Rob Do knew him well.
[35:40.280 --> 35:47.280]  Played in bands with him.
[35:47.280 --> 35:53.280]  And this guy was not political.
[35:53.280 --> 35:56.280]  But then Glenn Beck takes his picture
[35:56.280 --> 35:58.280]  And sticks him on the right side of the paradigm.
[35:58.280 --> 36:00.280]  He has this left right paradigm up there
[36:00.280 --> 36:02.280]  And in the middle he has a circle
[36:02.280 --> 36:05.280]  And he says up here is where the extremist are that hate America
[36:05.280 --> 36:07.280]  And he sticks Van Jones up there
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.280]  And right next to it sticks Debra Medina's picture up
[36:10.280 --> 36:12.280]  The video is up on infowars.com
[36:12.280 --> 36:14.280]  And prisonplanet.com
[36:14.280 --> 36:17.280]  And he points at Medina and says
[36:17.280 --> 36:19.280]  These people hate America.
[36:19.280 --> 36:29.280]  They're dangerous.
[36:29.280 --> 36:36.280]  It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[36:36.280 --> 36:39.280]  And I don't watch this show very often.
[36:39.280 --> 36:42.280]  Jaren said he was at a car wash a week ago
[36:42.280 --> 36:45.280]  And people were in the car wash eating popcorn.
[36:45.280 --> 36:47.280]  All of them wrapped.
[36:47.280 --> 36:50.280]  And they were just mindlessly buying into it all.
[36:50.280 --> 36:53.280]  Where he's like a kindergarten teacher talking to mindless idiots.
[36:53.280 --> 36:55.280]  Total guilt by association.
[36:55.280 --> 36:57.280]  And then he stuck the picture of Alan Keyes up
[36:57.280 --> 36:59.280]  Because he's criticized Sarah Palin for being pro-abortion
[36:59.280 --> 37:01.280]  And pro-global warming in the past.
[37:01.280 --> 37:03.280]  Alan Keyes is a real conservative, folks.
[37:03.280 --> 37:05.280]  He's the real deal.
[37:05.280 --> 37:07.280]  Not perfect.
[37:07.280 --> 37:09.280]  I don't get it.
[37:09.280 --> 37:11.280]  I don't get it.
[37:11.280 --> 37:13.280]  I don't get it.
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.280]  I don't get it.
[37:15.280 --> 37:17.280]  Not perfect.
[37:17.280 --> 37:19.280]  I don't agree with all his policies.
[37:19.280 --> 37:21.280]  He's been pro-war at times.
[37:21.280 --> 37:23.280]  But the point is he, Ambassador Keyes is good.
[37:23.280 --> 37:25.280]  He stuck him next to Van Jones, too.
[37:25.280 --> 37:27.280]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[37:27.280 --> 37:29.280]  They get our confidence through a fake like this.
[37:29.280 --> 37:31.280]  And now he's really running his true flag up
[37:31.280 --> 37:33.280]  Showing everybody.
[37:33.280 --> 37:35.280]  All right, I'm already digressing.
[37:35.280 --> 37:37.280]  It's just I can't spend every show analyzing it.
[37:37.280 --> 37:39.280]  Just a lot of people are seeing it for themselves.
[37:39.280 --> 37:41.280]  No wonder he's lost half a million viewers.
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.280]  The last week, his show was climbing and climbing and climbing.
[37:45.280 --> 37:47.280]  And now, according to Nielsen, he's plunging.
[37:47.280 --> 37:49.280]  He's lost 10% of his audience
[37:49.280 --> 37:51.280]  and are more.
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.280]  Well, what's 500,000 out of 3 million?
[37:53.280 --> 37:55.280]  Well, he doesn't care.
[37:55.280 --> 37:57.280]  He's paid to do this.
[37:57.280 --> 37:59.280]  He gets your confidence.
[37:59.280 --> 38:01.280]  And then he stabs you in the back.
[38:01.280 --> 38:03.280]  And look, I don't want to get up here.
[38:03.280 --> 38:05.280]  I don't want to get up here.
[38:05.280 --> 38:07.280]  I don't want to get up here.
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.280]  I don't want to get up here.
[38:09.280 --> 38:11.280]  And look, I don't want to get up here in a technical and back.
[38:11.280 --> 38:13.280]  I don't want to talk about him.
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.280]  I don't want to watch him.
[38:15.280 --> 38:17.280]  They had the TV on in the control room on Fox.
[38:17.280 --> 38:19.280]  And I stopped because I was taking all these phone calls
[38:19.280 --> 38:21.280]  from witnesses and people.
[38:21.280 --> 38:23.280]  My crew had just gotten back from Joe Stax burnt down house
[38:23.280 --> 38:25.280]  here in Austin.
[38:25.280 --> 38:27.280]  And talking to his neighbors.
[38:27.280 --> 38:29.280]  And he goes,
[38:29.280 --> 38:31.280]  these are the people that hate America.
[38:31.280 --> 38:33.280]  They've got to be stopped.
[38:33.280 --> 38:35.280]  These people and he sticks Deborah Medina
[38:35.280 --> 38:37.280]  and Van Jones next to each other.
[38:37.280 --> 38:39.280]  She hates America.
[38:39.280 --> 38:41.280]  This guy is incredible.
[38:41.280 --> 38:43.280]  Then he sticks Alan keys up there.
[38:49.280 --> 38:51.280]  I think Glenn Beck is committing
[38:51.280 --> 38:53.280]  political
[38:53.280 --> 38:55.280]  self inhalation
[38:55.280 --> 38:57.280]  or
[38:57.280 --> 38:59.280]  suicide on air.
[38:59.280 --> 39:01.280]  I mean, you talk about delusional.
[39:01.280 --> 39:03.280]  You'd think when he lost 500,000 viewers last week
[39:03.280 --> 39:05.280]  he'd stop with them.
[39:05.280 --> 39:07.280]  No.
[39:07.280 --> 39:09.280]  Because he's committed to his cause.
[39:09.280 --> 39:11.280]  Deborah Medina and Alan keys are bad.
[39:11.280 --> 39:13.280]  Who's next?
[39:13.280 --> 39:15.280]  George Washington.
[39:15.280 --> 39:17.280]  No, it's worse than that.
[39:17.280 --> 39:19.280]  He compared himself to the founders.
[39:19.280 --> 39:21.280]  It was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
[39:21.280 --> 39:23.280]  He flips the chalkboard over to the other side
[39:23.280 --> 39:25.280]  and has the founders up there and says,
[39:25.280 --> 39:27.280]  they're like me.
[39:27.280 --> 39:29.280]  I don't know.
[39:29.280 --> 39:31.280]  I don't know.
[39:31.280 --> 39:33.280]  I don't know.
[39:33.280 --> 39:35.280]  They're like me.
[39:35.280 --> 39:37.280]  The only person I can think of to compare
[39:37.280 --> 39:39.280]  to the founders is me.
[39:39.280 --> 39:41.280]  Oh, yes to the, oh, yes, Glenn.
[39:41.280 --> 39:43.280]  Yes.
[39:43.280 --> 39:45.280]  Yes.
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.280]  No, you could compare Deborah Medina to the founders
[39:47.280 --> 39:49.280]  or Ron Paul or Alan keys.
[39:49.280 --> 39:51.280]  You certainly can't compare yourself
[39:51.280 --> 39:53.280]  and how dare you stick them
[39:53.280 --> 39:55.280]  up there with Van Jones and admitted communist.
[39:55.280 --> 39:57.280]  You make me sick.
[39:57.280 --> 39:59.280]  And then he went on to demonize the birthers saying
[39:59.280 --> 40:01.280]  these people are so dangerous.
[40:01.280 --> 40:03.280]  You know,cesso burthers, that's more than
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.280]  half of registered Republicans in polls.
[40:07.280 --> 40:09.280]  Search engine in it.
[40:09.280 --> 40:11.280]  More than half of registered Republicans
[40:11.280 --> 40:13.280]  say they question those polls for six months
[40:13.280 --> 40:15.280]  ago.
[40:15.280 --> 40:17.280]  They're scared.
[40:17.280 --> 40:27.280]  Right.
[40:27.280 --> 40:29.280]  I have digressed.
[40:29.280 --> 40:34.200]  a week and they're always so horrible. Craig Sadler was in the control room, literally
[40:34.200 --> 40:41.840]  saying I can't watch it, turn it off. I mean, because it's sickening. In fact, call Craig
[40:41.840 --> 40:49.240]  Sadler in here on the mic. Is he in there? I don't see him. He's talking to my wife.
[40:49.240 --> 40:54.440]  Call him in here. I mean, I could play the clips right now, but it's like 20 minutes
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.800]  of it. I've got two different 10 minute clips because when I got home last night, hung out
[40:58.800 --> 41:01.600]  with my children a while, then they went to bed and I went and watched them in full and
[41:01.600 --> 41:06.440]  it was even worse. That's kind of what happens though. I watch videos. I read news articles,
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.720]  government documents that I get on air and I don't even want to go over them again. Craig
[41:11.720 --> 41:23.360]  won't even know what I'm pulling him in here about. You know what? Look, everybody's seeing
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.720]  it for themselves. There's no point in even covering it. I mean, there's going to be
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.240]  a certain percentage of people that are complete morons that are going to buy into this and
[41:30.240 --> 41:33.800]  there's almost no point in even countering. This shows how desperate the establishment
[41:33.800 --> 41:51.720]  is though. Okay. Recapping the Joe stack saga. There's a lot of different ways to look at
[41:51.720 --> 42:03.880]  this. Remember the Rasmussen poll of last week? 75% are angry at government's current
[42:03.880 --> 42:14.600]  policies. Rasmussen 75% of Republicans and Democrats polled is a random poll are angry.
[42:14.600 --> 42:18.280]  And so there are a lot of people saying, look, we're sick of the IRS killing people and raiding
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.840]  houses and taking homes without due process. And Beck last night was saying it was in any
[42:23.840 --> 42:29.680]  always on American to fight. Well, that's an anti founding father. That's actually not
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.440]  true. I'm saying violence isn't good at this point in time because we want to try to fix
[42:34.440 --> 42:39.160]  things peaceably. But a lot of people are saying, Hey, Alex, don't criticize this guy.
[42:39.160 --> 42:48.000]  He is a hero. Well, I think he's misguided and wrong what he did. I know he was cornered
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.320]  and I know the government has a lot coming to it. But strategically, this is bad and
[42:54.320 --> 42:57.960]  it will only make the government circle the wagons that much more against the people instead
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.800]  of us reaching out to many people in government who were waking up and fixing the system by
[43:02.800 --> 43:10.200]  taking over the states peacefully and by getting our own interest free state banks like several
[43:10.200 --> 43:21.080]  states have doing more research on that. We don't need to go the physical 1776 route unless
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.680]  we continue to get cornered. But we're making so much headway right now on climate gate
[43:26.680 --> 43:32.000]  and on the flu gate and on shooting down government takeover of healthcare on everything. We are
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.860]  hitting on all cylinders. The enemy is in the ditch with their engine blown. And some
[43:38.860 --> 43:42.080]  people I talked to say, Oh, no, the government's scared. They're scared of violence. They're
[43:42.080 --> 43:49.400]  scared of people start standing up. Now, this could be a chelchescu type overthrow. Alex,
[43:49.400 --> 43:59.080]  you want to take that gamble? Hmm? I mean, can you say the average cop or the average
[43:59.080 --> 44:07.060]  IRS bureaucrat or the average FBI agent deserves to die without a judge, a jury, anything?
[44:07.060 --> 44:13.440]  You want to go that route? Because the one thing Lindbeck said that was true yesterday
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.700]  is this could turn into a French Revolution. The problem is he then demonized a bunch
[44:18.700 --> 44:22.040]  of peaceful people like Deborah Medina and Alan Keyes and said they were leading to a
[44:22.040 --> 44:27.640]  French Revolution. See, why is he attacking people that aren't calling for violence? That's
[44:27.640 --> 44:31.080]  how this is going to work. They're going to try to shut down the real political debate
[44:31.080 --> 44:38.320]  we're having because we're winning by fostering violence. I every fiber of my body says stop
[44:38.320 --> 44:49.040]  violence. Don't have violence. Now, if you're defending yourself, that's another issue.
[44:49.040 --> 44:58.560]  It's a very complex situation that we're looking at that we're facing right now, but we don't
[44:58.560 --> 45:03.200]  know if this is his real note he put on his site. No one knows that the government plants
[45:03.200 --> 45:09.400]  passports at all the attack sites on 9 11. What are they doing here? We don't know. We
[45:09.400 --> 45:18.380]  know the underwear bombing was staged. This comes on the heels of it. We know they had
[45:18.380 --> 45:23.860]  emergency personnel out there before it even happened. That's confirmed. We know they blamed
[45:23.860 --> 45:31.880]  it on the Tea Party. Minute one, we don't know. But I know in a whole bunch of mainstream
[45:31.880 --> 45:38.320]  articles in the statesman and in the New York Daily News and a bunch of others, who are
[45:38.320 --> 45:44.480]  they attacking? Alex Jones. They say these people are calling for violence and Alex Jones
[45:44.480 --> 45:51.680]  is with them. Complete lie. Why am I the target again? Two hours after they get the computers
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.840]  of ploskey up in Pittsburgh. They say he's an Alex Jones fan and did it for Alex Jones.
[45:57.840 --> 46:02.640]  Then they actually get the the his emails and his comments and what he said. He hated
[46:02.640 --> 46:14.600]  me because I didn't want violence and I'm not making this whole thing about Jews. First
[46:14.600 --> 46:18.480]  person in the 80 all comes after in Southern Prairie Law Center when they get that computer.
[46:18.480 --> 46:25.000]  Me. First person mainstream media comes after me. Why? Because we've got their number. We
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.960]  know how to think. We know how they operate and they don't like us. What do you think
[46:32.960 --> 46:41.000]  is going on? Jeremy in Minnesota. Hey Alex, can you hear me? Yeah. Fast callers go. Yep.
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.880]  I just wanted to let you know that on Wednesday night when I came home from work, it was the
[46:46.880 --> 46:53.000]  18th. I started watching CNN headline news, not the regular CNN, but CNN headline news
[46:53.000 --> 46:59.440]  where Nancy Grace, CNN student news and prime news all kind of go go together at the two
[46:59.440 --> 47:04.960]  30 from about two 30 in the morning to four o'clock in the morning. And I saw on that
[47:04.960 --> 47:10.760]  that a plane crashed in Texas and a plane crashed in California. Yeah, that was Amarillo.
[47:10.760 --> 47:17.040]  That was Amarillo and Palo Alto. So that was a different crash altogether. Yeah, there
[47:17.040 --> 47:23.640]  was another crash in Amarillo. And there was another crash in. It hit a power pole, knocked
[47:23.640 --> 47:29.600]  out power to 20 plus thousand people in California. Okay. All right. I was a little confused.
[47:29.600 --> 47:33.680]  I thought that had that they might know a lot of craziness going on. Jeremy, probably
[47:33.680 --> 47:41.480]  coincidence. I appreciate your call. John in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey,
[47:41.480 --> 47:46.800]  John, John, you want to go on air? Okay, let him go. Paul in Connecticut. You're on the
[47:46.800 --> 47:54.400]  air. Yes, go ahead. All right. I have a valid point. And I mean, you've been, you've been
[47:54.400 --> 48:00.880]  saying this, this whole while, um, if this is real, this guy was, you know, a lone ranger
[48:00.880 --> 48:05.880]  and he went into to do this cause he, he felt like he was going to, uh, you know, show
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.120]  who's boss or something. It's wrong. We can't have any violence. You know what I mean?
[48:10.120 --> 48:15.760]  No violence at all. And it's yeah, what about secretaries in that building? Turns out they
[48:15.760 --> 48:19.560]  didn't even hit the IRS part. In fact, does anybody know what part of the building, what
[48:19.560 --> 48:24.560]  business that was? I mean, some secretary sitting there deserves is that, you know,
[48:24.560 --> 48:29.160]  to die. They don't, they don't deserve that because they're, they're, they, they're almost
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.760]  slaves. I mean, they're slaves for somebody else, but that's beside the point. And it's,
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.520]  it's really scary that they're, they're not really labeling this as a, a patriotic terrorist
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.920]  or anything like that. They're kind of leaving the word terrorist out. And I believe that
[48:42.920 --> 48:48.320]  this is even more dangerous because no, then they're just saying that Americans who believe
[48:48.320 --> 48:53.080]  something different than what the mainstream media is feeding us and all this other nonsense.
[48:53.080 --> 48:57.280]  They're, they're trying to make Americans afraid of Americans without using the word
[48:57.280 --> 49:03.280]  terrorist, which I believe is really dangerous. If anybody else, I just, no violence, no violence
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.160]  because it's just, it's just, it's just going to come back and it's going to hurt you.
[49:07.160 --> 49:13.240]  That gives the system an excuse to use more violence on us. Great points, Paul. Look,
[49:13.240 --> 49:19.720]  one big issue in the last 10 hours that makes me lean back towards him being a lone wolf.
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.880]  And we don't know that this could clearly be a false flag. There's a lot of evidence
[49:23.880 --> 49:29.120]  there, but that is because that evidence there, we don't know either way. It's this, when
[49:29.120 --> 49:35.600]  it's a staged terror attack, like the underwear bomber, it is wall to wall coverage every
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.400]  channel for weeks and they have some big agenda they're trying to push through. Notice all
[49:39.400 --> 49:43.520]  these cyber attacks they're now reporting. Oh, we've got to pass the cyber security act
[49:43.520 --> 49:49.560]  in the Senate. That's clearly all staged the way at first they said it was terror. And
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.560]  now it's just a criminal act, an intentional act. They're saying, and suddenly it's off
[49:54.560 --> 50:00.120]  all the front pages of the news. I've always said, and this is known in the media in the
[50:00.120 --> 50:04.400]  70s and the 60s, they had over a thousand real terror attacks. And when they're a real
[50:04.400 --> 50:09.840]  terror attack or a real attack, the media doesn't like to cover it. When they do stage
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.640]  an event to blame a certain group, they hype the living daylights out of it. And the fact
[50:14.640 --> 50:19.480]  that they're now not really reporting on this and they're starting to shut it down and
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.840]  it's not on the front page of most newspapers and magazines and CNN tells me it may have
[50:24.840 --> 50:31.520]  been a loan operation. Or because so much evidence of prior knowledge is coming out
[50:31.520 --> 50:35.040]  and it's an embarrassment to the government who didn't get down there and stopping. Maybe
[50:35.040 --> 50:40.040]  that's why I don't know. But that makes me start leaning back towards maybe it is a loan
[50:40.040 --> 50:46.160]  operation. But for those that say maybe he just crashed in a heart attack, folks, his
[50:46.160 --> 50:52.440]  house is burned down. We've been there. This happened where I live. I mean, did the government
[50:52.440 --> 50:55.280]  set his house on fire and then shoot him up with something, put him in a remote-cautel
[50:55.280 --> 50:59.480]  or a plane and do it? That's an operation in Northwoods. Maybe so. We don't know. Time
[50:59.480 --> 51:00.480]  will tell.

[52:02.280 --> 52:07.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[52:07.320 --> 52:13.080]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[52:13.080 --> 52:17.720]  underneath the Americans at home. I've turned an innocent influence on our president in
[52:17.720 --> 52:24.280]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[52:24.280 --> 52:29.400]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[52:29.400 --> 52:35.160]  criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[52:35.160 --> 52:40.040]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[52:40.040 --> 52:43.640]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[52:43.640 --> 52:50.160]  does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your

[54:06.280 --> 54:10.240]  Big development during the break. The guys just played me a clip of Limbex radio show
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.800]  this morning where he apologized to Deborah Medina and said, hey, I got in trouble with
[54:14.800 --> 54:19.040]  Texas for going after her, but hey, we're on the same page. I'm for state's rights.
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.760]  I didn't mean anything. Now that he's damaged her or tried to damage her, now that he said
[54:24.760 --> 54:29.000]  she was basically a terrorist last night, that's what he does though. I mean, he'll
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.440]  have Limbex on one day on TV and the next day attack him on the radio or have him on
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.520]  one day on the radio and attack him on TV the next day. That's what's so bad about
[54:37.520 --> 54:43.560]  him. He runs that whole stage deal. It comes out that Sarah Palin's more of a 9-11 truther
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.760]  in her own video statements a year and a half ago than Deborah Medina who just said, I support
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.360]  people's right to question and have investigations.
[54:52.360 --> 55:01.280]  And going after Allen keys. I mean, this guy is crazy. Absolutely out of his mind. Crazy
[55:01.280 --> 55:07.880]  like a fox though. He's crazy. You think you can get away with this? Our surprise guest

[56:28.920 --> 56:36.440]  I touch on the underwear bomber real quick and then get back into the crash? The government
[56:36.440 --> 56:43.160]  already had a plan to put in those scanners before Christmas, December 25th. Am I right
[56:43.160 --> 56:47.560]  by saying that? Yes. They already had those scanners. They wanted to put those in at the
[56:47.560 --> 56:56.920]  airport and train stations. Well, they found out then of course they staged and escorted
[56:56.920 --> 57:03.360]  this guy on the plane. And now this gave them a reason to my thoughts. And this is my opinion.
[57:03.360 --> 57:09.120]  The reason they want these scanners there, they are government are leaders. They're supposed
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.880]  to be our leaders. They want to make sure because we're over in the Middle East. This
[57:13.880 --> 57:20.520]  is my opinion. We need to be here, minding our own business. They're probably fearful
[57:20.520 --> 57:24.400]  that someone from the Middle East is going to come over here because we're doing things
[57:24.400 --> 57:30.320]  we shouldn't be doing over there. And my thoughts are they are going ahead to do this because
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.040]  they wanted a reason to do it. Now they got one. Now they, if you'll know, and I don't
[57:34.040 --> 57:38.440]  know if you know this or not, but during the trial, the first day of the trial, I guess
[57:38.440 --> 57:43.440]  the Homeland Security lawyer or attorney did not show up. It was something to do with
[57:43.440 --> 57:50.040]  her scheduling. So we know that guy's probably going to get out, you know, the FBI or government
[57:50.040 --> 57:53.680]  or whoever. Well, Christina, Christina, you make some great points. We're about to start
[57:53.680 --> 57:58.240]  the second hour. I'm going to have to let you go. We have a very special guest on the
[57:58.240 --> 58:04.240]  line with us. If anybody was ever persecuted, set up, destroyed because you made a stand
[58:04.240 --> 58:09.120]  for the people and justice. It's our guests. It's coming up. Remember the governor of Alabama?
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.880]  They had to release him from prison. Turned out Carl Rove targeted him and sent him to
[58:13.880 --> 58:19.480]  prison for political gain. That's now confirmed. Well, the railroading of our next guest was
[58:19.480 --> 58:25.720]  even worse and I've wanted to get him on for years and it is about to happen. We're going
[58:25.720 --> 58:32.600]  to break back in 70 seconds. We're going to be simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv, not just

[1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:28.480]  the next hour, ladies and gentlemen, then we're going to get back into the kamikaze
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:36.680]  attack in Austin and what's really going on there. But for the next hour, former congressman,
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:44.760]  James Traficant is our guest. James Traficant, we're very honored to have him with us. He,
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:50.040]  of course, ran in 1984 as a low-budget grassroots campaign for Congress, despite being outspent
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:55.840]  seven to one by an incumbent Republican. Traficant won handily by 18,000 votes. He'd been reelected
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:03.160]  seven times. In 2002, they set him up. Completely transparent, just like with the governor of
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:07.400]  Alabama. That's now admitted. They had to release him from prison. It came out, it was
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:11.640]  a complete fraud, a setup. They threatened to put somebody in prison that worked for
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:16.680]  him, and they didn't lie. Same thing with James Traficant. Mr. Traficant, great to
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.400]  have you here with us. Well, glad to be on your show. Alex, you've
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:25.720]  got a great show. Sorry I haven't been there so far, but you really educated the American
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:30.200]  people for sure. Well, you've been in solitary confinement
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:35.320]  and in the concentration camps, so you couldn't come on, but it's great to have you here.
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:39.880]  Sir, break down what really happened to you for some out there that may not know and why
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:42.600]  it's so important. Well, I think what's amazing about the
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:49.080]  whole ordeal was it was a 15 million dollar investigation over a span of six years, over
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:55.560]  258, all on or about the time that the Trade Center and the Pentagon were being attacked.
[1:01:55.560 --> 1:02:03.720]  The bottom line is the government, and this is the issue now, Alex, that will be coming to bear,
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:09.720]  the government admitted a trial voluntarily that they made no audio or videotapes on me in six years.
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:15.080]  And the reason they did that, it's evident, is because they had no evidence of any crimes whatsoever.
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:20.520]  They had no evidence, physical evidence. They had seven people who were pressured to lie.
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:24.440]  Three of them, four of them already recanted that they were pressured to lie.
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:29.720]  A young man in Nigeria submitted an affidavit to the Nigerian government that his life was ruined
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:34.920]  because he wouldn't burden himself in the trafficking case against trafficking for the government.
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:39.080]  So this thing is going to blow up. I think before it's over, I'm going to get the money out of this,
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:44.200]  and they're going to pay dearly. I've had it, and I think everybody in Austin is
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:50.920]  familiar with the term, I've had it by now. Well, since you brought that subject up to me,
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:55.480]  we went to break. What's your bottom line on the attack on the IRS building?
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:01.560]  Well, you know, the IRS has become such an agency where they actually have testified,
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:09.560]  Alex, before Congress, that fear, fear is what produces compliance, voluntary compliance,
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:15.800]  by the American people. And without fear, there can be no collection of taxes. Now,
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:21.880]  to me, this is an absolute oxymoron in a free republic to hear a statement like that,
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:28.040]  coming from an institution such as the Internal Revenue Service. You know, my particular case
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:33.640]  is quite documented. I am the congressman that did change the burden of proof of civil tax day.
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:39.480]  Before 1998, the taxpayer was guilty and had approved himself innocent. I was able to change
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:46.280]  that in 1998 tax bill with the help of a Texan by the name of Bill Archer, the chairman of the
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:51.160]  Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. And Bill Archer put my language in
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:55.800]  in the conference committee because the IRS had threatened a veto by President Clinton
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:00.760]  if it had the trafficking language. So I want to give tremendous credit in the state of Texas
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:04.760]  to that little man. And I think if George W. Bush would have made Bill Archer his secretary
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:10.120]  of treasury, this country wouldn't be in the fix it then. But having said that, Alex, the results
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:15.880]  were dramatic. They did a study one year before the bill and one year after and all of the variables
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:20.600]  dealt basically with the trafficking burden of proof language. Wage garnishment is dropped from
[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:30.200]  3.1 million to 560,000. Properties dropped from 670,000 to 160,000. An individual family on the
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:39.560]  homes seized by the IRS dropped from 10,070 to 57 homes, Alex, 57 in 50 states. We've got an
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:46.120]  agency that's out of control. One of my last bill was in tandem with two Republicans, one from
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:51.720]  Louisiana, Billy Tozan, and one from Colorado. Congressman James Travacan, I hate to interrupt
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:55.720]  you. We've got to go to break, sir. I am going to skip the next break coming up so we have more
[1:04:55.720 --> 1:05:02.200]  time. Continue from there after this quick break. Stay with us. This is Alex Jones and I want to

[1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:06.680]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:11.560]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:16.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total
[1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:21.640]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three,
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:26.600]  in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist
[1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:31.720]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:36.440]  local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:41.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:44.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:50.840]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:09.400]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:14.600]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:19.960]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:24.680]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:29.560]  food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you
[1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:34.520]  go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:40.120]  food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:45.720]  need? We don't know. How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:55.160]  guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:03.400]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633. The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:12.920]  probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:20.360]  I have studied Governor Siegelman's case when it first happened and he's been vindicated. It was a
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:29.480]  total set up. I have studied James Traficant's case. Absolutely set up. When they can persecute
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:35.720]  governors and congressmen and put them in prison for no reason and ruin them financially,
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:41.480]  when they can persecute a sitting governor or a sitting congressman,
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:45.720]  none of us are safe. Like they tortured Congressman Hanson. We, of course, came to his aid.
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:51.240]  They de-sold him till his feet exploded, driving him around for weeks, chained up.
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:55.560]  This is the type of Hanoi Hilton stuff that's going on. We're going to talk about
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:01.400]  what happened to Traficant in prison, why it was persecuted, the IRS, what he thinks of the event
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:06.440]  in Austin, what he's told me off air if he wants to say that on air. Then we'll talk about who
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:12.840]  targeted him for persecution and why and how he's going to be the comeback kid. And hopefully our
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:17.240]  listeners will support him. We're going to give you an address. He didn't ask for this. I did. I just
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:21.320]  got his address for people to send him, not campaign money. He's going to run again as an
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:26.760]  independent, but to get him back on his feet. So he can, because they've ruined him and sucked
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:31.320]  his treasure out of him. So he can't defend himself. If this ever happens to me, and unfortunately
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:36.200]  there's a good chance it will, when I get out of prison, I want people to support me. I'm ready.
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:41.400]  I understand what happens. Okay, going back to James Traficant, James, you got cut off
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:46.600]  by the break about how you were the number one true defender against the criminal IRS. Go ahead.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:51.720]  Well, Ali, first, I want to say is I know you, you said that maybe one day when you're off the
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:55.400]  air, maybe you might have similar type of problems. And I want to say that this maybe,
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:00.520]  maybe one of the best compliments you'll ever get. I think you would have deserved that because
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:05.560]  you would have drawn the ire of a government that is completely out of control. And I believe
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:09.720]  your voice is becoming that strong that quite frankly, I'm going to give you a little bit of
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:14.280]  advice now. Be very careful and watch yourself because you are having that kind of an effect.
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:18.600]  And when people start and begin to have an effect, if it's not singing to the choir,
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:23.080]  it's a real problem. But having said that, we were talking before about the Internal Revenue
[1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:29.000]  Service. And we're, you know, I'm like everybody else in the country is seeing the headline news
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.080]  and the fiasco and the tragedy that struck Austin. But you know, when you look at the
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:41.080]  Internal Revenue Service, they have evoked over the years fear, fear and abuse. In fact,
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:45.000]  they've testified, Alex, before the Congress of the United States that without fear,
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  they wouldn't have their voluntary quote unquote voluntary compliance.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:54.200]  Let me tell you something. Fear has no place in the Constitution of the United States or in the
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:01.080]  fabric of American government. And we've got a real problem. Now, in 1998, I was the individual
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:06.920]  responsible for changing the burden of proof in a civil tax case. As I said earlier, I want to tip
[1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:13.480]  my hat to a Texan, Mr. Bill Archer. Mr. Bill Archer was the Republican Chairman of Ways and
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:18.840]  Means Committee. And the trafficking language was not in the bill, that reform bill, because
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:23.320]  the IRS had threatened a veto to President Clinton if it contained the trafficking language.
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:28.760]  Well, after the bill passed the House, I got a call from Chairman Archer and he said, you know,
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:32.680]  we have so much support for your bill that he said he was going to put it into the
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:37.320]  conference committee between the House and the Senate. And he did. And I honestly believe this,
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:42.600]  and I want the people of Texas who are listening to hear this, that I believe if President Bush
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:47.560]  would have named Bill Archer, his Secretary of Treasury, America would not be in the fixer
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:53.720]  today. Now, having said that, what the trafficking bill basically said was this, up until 1998,
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:59.560]  Alex, you had an agency that says, Alex, you, you owe us $50,000. And you say, my God, how could
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:04.280]  I owe you $50,000? And they say, well, prove you don't, Alex. The burden of proof, you see,
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:09.960]  was on the taxpayer. The trafficking language changed that. And in 1998, when a bill passed,
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:15.560]  they did a study one year after the passage of the bill, Alex, and they compared one year before
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:22.040]  the passage to one year after the passage. And there were three salient points of concern that
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:27.080]  were covered by their study. The first one was wage garnishment. When the burden of proof
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:32.280]  was on the taxpayer, there were 3.1 million Americans whose wages were garnished.
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:35.560]  The following year, with the burden of proof on the Internal Revenue Service,
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:42.680]  that dropped to 561,000, 3 million less, Alex. The second category was property lien.
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:51.800]  There were 670,000 the year before, 161,000 the year after. And the final category was individual
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:57.640]  family-owned homes that were seized, taken by the IRS. The year before, when the taxpayer had the
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:06.200]  burden of proof, it was 10,073. The year after, it was 57, Alex. One per state when they had to
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:11.720]  prove it. You see, one of the last measures that I had, and it really was upsetting,
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:17.320]  and Chairman Archer said he liked the bill. Well, I teamed up with two Republicans,
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:25.240]  Billy Tozan of Louisiana and Dan Shaffer of Colorado. And it was the flat tax, the fair tax,
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:32.040]  a straight consumption tax. And let me tell you something, it repeals the 16th Amendment
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:39.400]  and throws out the IRS. It abolishes all withholding, all debt taxes, all capital gains taxes,
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:47.080]  corporate taxes, individual tax on expenses for education, investment tax. And it's about
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:52.920]  time, Alex, and what everybody's saying. Well, you're going to put a 25% consumption tax on us
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:57.480]  trafficking, and you're going to bankrupt everybody with these cost increases. Listen to
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:14:02.520]  the study that was performed in Harvard. They said when you throw out this burdensome tax code
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:07.480]  that has destroyed companies and destroyed our competitiveness, they said they will have downward
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:12.200]  movement to gain market share. Sounds like capitalism all over again. And they predicted
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:18.680]  the prices would hardly raise if at all. And you'll have Social Security fully funded, Medicare
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:23.960]  fully funded, and you'll have the same neutral, if not more, revenue stream than we have now.
[1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:30.440]  But the bottom line is, you see, Alex, it's time to reward work. Our tax code is basically a
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:36.600]  progressive communist tax code that was founded by Karl Marx. And here's how it works. The harder
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:43.160]  you work, the more you pay. The harder you work to get hit over the head. We subsidize illegitimacy.
[1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:49.320]  We reward dependency. We kill investment. We chase companies overseas. These companies,
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:53.720]  they say they're not patriots because they left America. The reason they left is the tax code
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:58.760]  is made impossible to make a profit in America. We've got to change it. Scrap it, throw the
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:03.480]  internal revenue service out, abolish the withholding. Absolutely. And that's where
[1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:09.400]  we got to go, Alex. And let me say this briefly about this man in Texas. From what I understand,
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:15.560]  he was not a wacko. He had it. And there's so many people that had it. It's not unusual to see
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:21.000]  him venting at the internal revenue service. My God, Congress United States is derelict in their
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:28.200]  duties to not repeal the 16th Amendment, throw out individual personal tax, reward a man for his
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:32.600]  labor, not punish him. And that's where we got to go, Alex. That's exactly where we got to go.
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:37.320]  Well, look at Geithner and most of the White House don't pay their taxes. But then the news
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:45.160]  is saying, look at this tax cheat, Joe Stack. He's scum. But then the big boys, they don't even
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:49.320]  have to pay the tax. Well, this is one of the problems. You have selective enforcement in all
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:56.360]  areas. First of all, we need a whole address to our central government. This is the United States
[1:15:56.360 --> 1:16:01.960]  of America, not the central government of America. In states, quite frankly, I like to become
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:07.480]  background music in a doctor's office. And I think one of the biggest mistakes ever made
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:14.200]  was the amendment to the Constitution that provided for popular votes for the U.S. Senate.
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:18.520]  I know this might sound different off the people. No, we need the 17th Amendment back.
[1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:24.040]  Here's what I'm saying. We need to get rid of it. In the old days, those two U.S. senators were
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:27.960]  beholding to the state legislature and the respective states. If they didn't do what the
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:32.680]  states wanted, they replaced them. Now you've got these senators that are basically senators for
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:39.000]  America. We've lost states' rights. We've taken away. We've developed this big central powerful
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:44.440]  government that has molded us. My God, we've got to tax codes to become a behavior modification
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:49.720]  for economic activity. This is crazy, Alex. And I think it's not rocket science. There can be
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:55.880]  tremendous changes here. And it's not change that's needed. It's replacement. And I think,
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:01.320]  and I will make this statement on your show. If the United States does not throw out the
[1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:08.440]  progressive income tax and replace it with a fair tax, America will implode similar to the
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:14.280]  Soviet Union. It's just a matter of time with that debt approaching $14 trillion. We can't
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:18.360]  satisfy. We're nothing more than a managed debt economy nation.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:24.120]  Here's James Travacan. Congressman James Travacan, this is powerful information,
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:28.600]  but I also want to get into your persecution, why you were persecuted, who was behind it. Was it
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:33.320]  the Israeli lobby? Was it the IRS? Was it a combination? We're going to break that down
[1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:37.800]  and how if you can be persecuted like a heretic, this can happen to anybody. But
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:43.240]  finishing up with the whole income tax, they're raising all these other state taxes, local taxes,
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:49.560]  federal taxes, everything starting to go bankrupt. Foreign banks are openly looting us.
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:56.680]  They, Paulson can give $200 million of bailout money to himself and give himself a waiver.
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:18:02.280]  And then nobody even knows why James Travacan went to jail completely made up. Same thing with
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:08.920]  governor in Alabama. I mean, this is amazing, but specifically looking at this,
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:14.440]  how long do you think America has till it completely collapses if this out of control
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:22.280]  government continues? I think I would say this. I would say we, I can't predict the exact time,
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.560]  but I will say this. I think it is inevitable. And I think it will be within the next generation,
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:33.320]  the next 20, 25 years where America will implode. Certain states will move towards saving their
[1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:39.080]  own revenue and moving off on their own, maybe a compact estate. I could see a state like Alaska
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:44.440]  with their own revenue stream, uh, bigger than most of the countries in landbaths over in Europe,
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:49.400]  saying, Hey, we're on our own guys and I could see this starting to happen. I think Georgia
[1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:53.960]  legislature has advanced an initiative stating that they'll collect the federal tax, but they
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:58.520]  won't send it to Washington. Yes, sir. Let me just add a Congressman Travacan that,
[1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:03.720]  that 30 plus states are moving to declare ninth and 10th amendment powers as you know.
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:09.400]  And the federal government itself has been hijacked by offshore banks. And I think it's
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:14.520]  going to happen a lot sooner than just 20 years. And so Northcom and Homeland Security,
[1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:17.720]  we got their internal Homeland Security documents a year ago, we broke this,
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:22.600]  we got it from law enforcement, where Homeland Security internally, they trained the police.
[1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:27.640]  This is really to suppress the American people. This is not about fighting Arabs and caves.
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:34.120]  No doubt there's, uh, you, you, one, I think the headline to all Americans may expect,
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.120]  God hope it doesn't happen, but God forbid it does. They'll wake up one morning and they'll
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:44.280]  hear conversation on, on your show, Alex, about the dollar crashing. And when that dollar crashes,
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:49.960]  you will see an implosion in America. You'll see civil uprisings. You will see a massive
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:55.400]  hemorrhage of the institutions of United States of America. See, nobody believes this can happen.
[1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:59.640]  Everybody believes this is America. This is not going to happen. What people are failing to see
[1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:05.560]  is a tremendous problem with the federal government, not basically meeting the needs of the American
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:10.520]  people. And having said that, you asked me earlier, you know, what really happened to me?
[1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:14.840]  You know, in 1983, I was the only American in history to defeat the Justice Department,
[1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:19.400]  a RICO trial, pro se, without being an attorney. I was targeted ever since.
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:27.320]  In, in the late 80s, I was instrumental in bringing back John Dominic from Israel who was
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:32.040]  on trial. He was already convicted and sent to be executed. No one would look into this man's
[1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:38.280]  case. I looked into his case and I discovered, and I was able to get documents from the Justice
[1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:43.720]  Department to not only prove he was innocent, Alex, but who Ivan the terrible really was.
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:50.360]  It was so blatant in America the pressure that Israel and through their lobby had put on me
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:54.200]  and put on our government that Congress wouldn't hold a hearing on my evidence.
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:58.120]  And the Sixth Circuit Court in Cincinnati wouldn't accept the trafficking evidence.
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:02.760]  I sent it over to the Israeli Supreme Court. I did a live interview with Brian Gumbel on
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:07.960]  today's show by satellite from Jerusalem. And I basically said, they put this innocent man to
[1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:13.080]  death. Israel is going to lose upwards of $20 billion a year from the American taxpayers.
[1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:16.440]  And Brian Gumbel jumped in and he says, well, what do you mean? They only get three billion.
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:21.080]  I said, Brian, that's only four and eight. No one's looking at loans. Loans converted to grants,
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:27.080]  grants, economic assistance, military assistance. And I am telling you that the American taxpayer
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:33.880]  is shipping over $25,000 for every man, woman, and child in Israel every year. Well, I got a call
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:38.840]  the following night from the Supreme Court of Israel and they said he'll be in Tel Aviv tomorrow
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:44.360]  night. Take him home. Here's the man on death row, Alex. But when that happened, I had a bullseye
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:49.880]  on my back like you couldn't believe. I had the IRS and the Justice Department already after me
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:55.320]  and had the most powerful lobby in America, a lobby that controls much of the foreign policy
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:59.160]  of the United States now. I'm being branded a bigot and an anti-semite for saying it,
[1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:04.440]  but let me tell you something. There's only one entity that should control the Congress
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:09.240]  of the United States and that's the American people. And people won't even whisper the truth
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:13.960]  about what's going on behind the scenes in Washington. The country's in a free fall, Alex.
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:19.080]  We're in trouble. Well, I want to continue down this line because you had never been an enemy
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:24.520]  of Israel. You simply defended an innocent man and even the Supreme Court looked at the evidence
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:31.480]  and letting go. And now they've grabbed him again and hauled him away. I mean, it's just a complete
[1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:37.160]  and total witch hunt. And now you have all these top professors coming out and pointing out that
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:42.840]  the Israeli lobby and Israeli newspapers brag that they control a lot of Congress. And you have
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:48.440]  Rahm Emanuel in the White House, who's an Israeli government agent, was in their military in the
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:56.360]  Gulf War. I mean, you're only saying what much of the evidence shows. And I've always read and
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:23:01.960]  experts of history has shown that when you do beat the Justice Department and they win what over
[1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:08.520]  90% of their cases, they always come back, back, back, back, back. So was it the IRS
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:13.320]  that you exposed that got them first coming after you and then the icing on the cake was then
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:19.880]  getting an innocent man freed? I think it was a combination of all three, but just remember this.
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:24.760]  I was one of the most bitter enemies of the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service.
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:29.320]  And there's no kidding about that. And I had a struggle. It took me 12 years. And let me say
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:33.240]  this, I've been a Democrat all my life. The Democrats, I almost had a fist fight with Ross
[1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:37.720]  and Kowsky, Chairman Ross Kowsky. Wouldn't even hold a hearing on my burden of proof legislation.
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:44.040]  When Republicans did come in, I'll give credit to Bill Archer again. There's a man that looked at
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:48.280]  the American taxpayer and he did something very significant. And I want to thank him on behalf
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:52.280]  of all Americans. I don't even know what happened to the old chairman. I hope he's still alive down
[1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:57.720]  here in Texas. He's a great man. But Alex, I had a bullseye put on my back, but quite frankly,
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:03.160]  Scarlett, I don't give a damn. And here's the bottom line. If you're afraid to speak out about
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:07.080]  your own country, what has happened to our Constitution and our bill of rights? Why is
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:12.440]  everybody afraid to whisper what's going on? Listen to the strong statement I use on your show,
[1:24:12.440 --> 1:24:17.000]  even though it has labeled me and hurt me politically. Israel has a strangleholding
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:21.720]  United States of America to have us in foreign wars we shouldn't be involved with that have
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:27.000]  bankrupted us. And they've gone so far as having Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:34.840]  making a statement on Israeli radio October 3, 2001, the following. We, comma, the Jewish people,
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:40.600]  comma, control America. And the Americans know it. And no one read that in a newspaper in this
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:46.200]  country. No one knows about it. So maybe Jim Travkin is going to be labeled. But I think if
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:51.000]  we've got a problem, let's straighten our country out. We don't have to hurt Israel. They are a
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.960]  friend. They're a democracy within a cluster of monarchs and dictators. But we don't have to
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:01.240]  prosecute their expansion plans. We don't have to get involved and be pushed into wars by Israel,
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:05.240]  manipulated by Israel. And we shouldn't answer to nobody but the American people.
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:11.480]  Well, look at Ron Paul. I mean, he says cut off foreign aid to everybody. We are going bankrupt.
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:15.960]  And they call him an anti-Semite, though he wants to cut it off to Africa. He wants to cut
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:23.000]  it off to Egypt. He wants to cut it off to Iraq. We can't pay this bill anymore. And the fact that
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:28.600]  whenever somebody says, look, we need to stop being involved in all these wars, we need to stop
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:34.840]  doing this. And the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center come out and attack me when I am
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:39.000]  mild on this because I'm just trying to bring everybody together to audit the Fed, to get the
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Federal Reserve out of here, to get the 17th Amendment overturned, to get rid of the income
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:50.120]  tax. There's no doubt you get savaged when you even mildly criticize. So I can't imagine
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:53.000]  what it's been like for you. Let's briefly, because we're going to break here in about four
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:58.280]  minutes, talk about what happened to you in prison. Because I mean, you're a tough guy.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:02.680]  You're not whining about it on air now, but they treated you like hell I saw in the news.
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:08.200]  Alex, the first place I went was 50% illegal immigrants. And keep this in mind for the people
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:13.400]  of Texas specifically. Jim Travking was a congressman who passed on the House floor,
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:18.840]  utilizing our soldiers on our border. You know, regarding the borders in the Middle East,
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:23.640]  regarding borders all over the world, our troops are going for lunch over in Italy and going for
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:29.160]  the theater in Germany, and our borders are wide open. I was labeled a bigot because here's my
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:33.640]  position on immigration, Alex. Number one, let's put our troops on the border. It's a national
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:37.640]  security check line. And if you're in America illegally, you should be thrown the hell out.
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:42.600]  Not given healthcare and given a false... Well, that's what Mexico does to us. Mexico treats
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:47.560]  American citizens like trash and shakes them down. Hey, listen, here's what I feel. If you're an
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.720]  American citizen, I don't care what ethnic group you are, you're one of us. But if you're not,
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:55.960]  you've got to be thrown the hell out of here now. Both these parties are catering to a growing
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:01.000]  minority Hispanic vote. It's getting larger in America. It is larger than the Black vote.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:05.160]  And both these parties are giving them everything they want. Meanwhile, you've got a healthcare
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:10.120]  system out of control. You've got approximately 15 million troops being only illegal immigrants
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:15.240]  consuming welfare and different programs in this country with falsified documents.
[1:27:15.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  And no one's... Neither party's dealing with it. Congressman, let me stop you. I got a guy that
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:23.640]  worked at Austin Energy here, and I already knew this. It's 800 plus sanctuary cities.
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:29.320]  But the illegals get a fake consulate matricula. They pay a $200 down payment or $250 depending
[1:27:29.320 --> 1:27:35.160]  on the size of the contract to get their power and light turned on. Then they never pay the bill.
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:39.400]  He said over 90% of the time. And then a pneumatricula comes up in six months when they turn the
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:45.960]  power off. And they were told in Austin Energy meetings, let them not pay. And it's the same
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:51.880]  thing. Drunk drivers, they get let go. Everything. But citizens are scum and trash. And so the
[1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:54.360]  average illegals on three or four different welfare lines.
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:28:00.360]  Alex, it's so out of hand that it's a joke and it takes me to the national healthcare bill.
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:05.640]  My God, the American needs a healthcare bill. But there's deserving people need some assistance.
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:09.240]  But you've got about 15 million illegal immigrants are going to be involved in this thing. And
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:13.640]  American people are bankrupted. We've already destroyed companies and thrown them out.
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:18.680]  It's driven them away. We're going to destroy more. I don't think there's any common sense
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:24.120]  right now in Washington. And I think Washington is manipulated and Washington is obstructed
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:28.840]  by outside forces and being very much manipulated. But having said that, let me get back to the
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:33.160]  prison. The first place I went to, I like that 50% illegal immigrants and they knew that I was a
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:37.480]  guy that said, throw them the hell out. I slept with one eye open. The next thing you know,
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:42.920]  I met a medium high, which was known as gladiator school up in Raebrook. People getting cut and
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:48.520]  hurt every particular day. There was a counselor in the system. I won't say where they told me
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:53.160]  when I first went in. He said, listen, my mother is your biggest fan. Be careful. They want you
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:57.880]  to get hurt. The next thing you know, I met a medium high and the truth be known, one more
[1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:04.280]  little infraction. I'd be at a penitentiary, a penitentiary. And the reason I end up in Rochester,
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:10.120]  they told me that I had a corkscrew aorta. And they told me I had his corkscrew aorta and I
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:15.080]  would not take medication, Alex, because they didn't trust me. And I end up in Rochester.
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:21.560]  And then they said I didn't have a corkscrew aorta. Just let me tell you something. I believe
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:26.040]  that our government was hoping I would have died in prison and would not have come out.
[1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:33.640]  Okay, congressman, congressman, we got a break. Come back right there and continue with the saga
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:41.720]  of your years of imprisonment. And we will continue breaking down why you were persecuted. And now
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:48.440]  your comeback kid status, we want today to get people to support you, get you back on your feet
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:54.040]  and launch as an independent because you certainly are a maverick. We're on the march. The empire's

[1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:05.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:10.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:15.240]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:20.920]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:25.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[1:31:25.880 --> 1:31:31.320]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:35.800]  a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:40.920]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:44.920]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:50.840]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:31.720]  that put him in prison, but that's how they bankrupt you so you can't defend yourself.
[1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:40.680]  It's 429, 429 North Main Street, 429 North Main Street and that's Poland like the country, 429
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:51.000]  North Main Street, Poland, Ohio, 44514. So here's the address again, 429 North Main Street, Poland,
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Ohio, 44514. And I've studied his case. I've also studied Governor Don Siegelman's case and back
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.040]  of the time when they railroaded him, we looked at him so this is completely staged, turned out
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:10.840]  U.S. prosecutors at work for Carl Rove, he ordered it. They've testified to this now. Get him. They
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:15.640]  kept coming after him. Investigation after investigation, all made up, lying. Then they
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:20.200]  threatened to indict one of his employees for something totally separate outside the Capitol
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:24.840]  and said, lie about him. We won't send you to prison. Basically, same thing happened to Mr.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:29.000]  Trafficant, Don Siegelman. Now, he got out after nine months and has been vindicated and
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.200]  admitted it was a fraud. He was going to serve a decade, not with Trafficant. He was there seven
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:38.440]  and a half years and they told him, and he'll talk about this in a moment, anytime you say you're
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:44.920]  guilty, we'll let you go. Now, so first they try to pull some medical scams on him. They put him
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:51.000]  in with the illegal aliens. They put him into gladiator school, medium, maximum security,
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:55.080]  high security, continue Congressman Trafficant with what happened to you in prison.
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:36:00.600]  Well, at some particular point, you made the statement that you have to stand on your own
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:05.720]  two feet and you have to be prepared for almost anything. I had an awful lot of enemies in the
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:12.920]  prison system and I didn't know exactly who or how someone might come at you, so you sleep with
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:19.720]  one eye open. The bottom line was that I not only did that, that I developed what I consider
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:23.960]  to be a firm resolve. One thing Nelson Mandela said, you never really know a country unless
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:28.600]  you go through their prison system. And that's one thing he was exactly right about. You see the
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:33.560]  other side of the United States of America, we've got such crippling problems, but I survived.
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:38.280]  I was not afraid to survive. I told them where they could shove that pardon
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:43.160]  because I certainly wasn't going to admit to something that I didn't do. But very few people
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:50.200]  know, is that the, before that trial, the Northern District Court, federal court system of Ohio passed
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:55.800]  a rule that if you got a judge from a particular area, you got a jury from that area and it would
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:37:00.360]  become the trafficking rule because basically nobody in my congressional district was eligible
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:07.960]  to serve on my jury. Second of all, the judge made my witnesses testify in open court under the
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:14.600]  threat of perjury to her outside the presence of a jury and they told her the truth. No one was
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:20.680]  charged for perjury, but she did not allow them to testify to the jury. And four of those people
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:26.600]  said that if the seven people who testified against me, they had admitted to somebody close or whomever
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:31.880]  who had confided in me that they lied so they wouldn't go to prison himself or have their
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:37.640]  wife indicted or their kids indicted or their company taken away, et cetera, et cetera. Four of
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:42.760]  the seven, she didn't allow it to go to the jury. Now we find out after the trial was over,
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:48.120]  one of the key witnesses against me who was perjured himself in my trial because he was caught
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:53.880]  perjuring himself in a previous trial that the judge's husband had a relationship business-wise
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:38:00.520]  with that family. I mean, this thing, it was so abusive that it speaks out, but when you're the
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:05.320]  number one target of the Justice Department, the number one target of the American Israeli Public
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:10.520]  Affairs Committee, Alex, you have nowhere to turn. You've got to stand on your own two feet
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:14.680]  and hopefully outlive it and come back and try and do what you can about it.
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:19.160]  Now, Congressman, let's break this down, though. The type of threats you got when you were in
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:27.080]  Congress and how you got set up, there's this crisis of confidence now because police all over
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:32.920]  the country in every major city of Texas, just as an example, have been caught planting drugs on
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:38.120]  people to take their property. It's now standard procedure. They admit they have informants lie
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:44.120]  on the stand about political enemies they have. I mean, they can put anybody they want in prison,
[1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:49.720]  but the public now knows it's a fraud. It's like the death penalty. I'm for the death penalty at
[1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:54.360]  a grassroots level. If they catch somebody who's murdered a kid, the problem is more than a third
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:59.560]  of those on death row has been proven with DNA or totally innocent. We know that the system is so
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:05.640]  corrupt. You can't trust anything they say or do. But briefly, because I remember seeing it in the
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.040]  news, the hell in the seven and a half years, I know as a man, you don't like to talk about
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:14.280]  what happened to you. You just want to be tough and ignore it, but people need to know the type
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:17.080]  of persecution. I mean, tell us more of what happened in prison.
[1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:24.600]  Well, you're under constant threat. With me, I did months and months after end in the hole in
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:30.600]  isolation because they set my attitude. But basically, they were trying to break me and I
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:35.480]  survived all that time in prison. I never even acknowledged the presence of any of the wardens.
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:41.240]  I couldn't tell you their names. Hold on a minute. Let's go back over this. So explain it. They said
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:47.560]  some little punk jail guard, some sadist has this Congressman, this icon, and they're telling you,
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:50.920]  I don't like your attitude, boy. You're going to spend how long in the hole?
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:56.600]  Well, they find out, they find out, or you use little maneuvers that they have. But I believe
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:40:02.680]  I spent close to seven months in the hole over a period of time. And that's in the hole means
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.960]  that you get to get a shower every second day, three times a week. You get to go out one day,
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:13.480]  or one hour a day. And I tell you the truth, Alex, I never left the place. I became very
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:18.120]  hard. I think that they looked at me and they said, this guy is very hard because I didn't
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:23.480]  give a damn about anything. I fought for this my life. If I survived, I'd do what I had to do.
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:27.880]  But I wasn't going to buckle down. I wasn't going to be intimidated, stood my ground,
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:32.520]  did what I had to do. But like I said, I could have had a partner. But there's no way I was
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:35.960]  going to make admissions is something that I didn't do. And I want all your listeners to
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:42.360]  listen to this very carefully. Six year investigation, $15 million, over 250 agents.
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:48.040]  And they said they didn't make any tapes on Jim Travagan. Didn't bug my telephone.
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:53.080]  Now a Secret Service agent has come out, retired. Mike Robertson had made the following statement.
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:56.760]  He said Travagan was certainly railroaded. He said they had no physical evidence.
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:00.520]  He said they bugged that guy to death. They had people go to him with body mics.
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:04.920]  He said anybody in a right mind knows that. He said the reason the government voluntarily
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:10.600]  made that admission in court is because Travagan could have subpoenaed all of their tapes and said
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:17.320]  where's the crime. Now I want your listeners to remember this. They said they made no tapes,
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:21.880]  didn't bug my telephone or anything for six years now. If you believe that,
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:25.000]  I got some property down in Florida. I think somebody wants to tell you.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:29.080]  Well, sir, you've been vindicated and that's all over the press. I mean, you have officially
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:33.400]  been vindicated like Governor Siegelman, but he only got nine months. You got seven and a half
[1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:37.000]  years and got financially ruined. How are you going to come back at him? I mean,
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:41.560]  you now have the Secret Service agent. You have all these other witnesses against you,
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:47.400]  recanting that it was done under pressure. You've got to get on the attack in my
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:51.160]  estimation or correct me if I'm wrong or they're going to try to set you up again.
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:56.520]  Here's where we are, LA. Right now, there's a man in Washington, DC that was pressured to lie
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:01.560]  against me. He's a brilliant man, Richard Detour. He could fly any aircraft and he's a brilliant
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:06.040]  engineer. And the government wanted him to be a witness against me because he was very intelligent,
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:11.720]  very credible. And they wanted him to say that he saw a businessman give me an envelope with
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:16.440]  money, thousands of dollars in my office. And he basically said, I won't do that. I know Jim,
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:20.680]  if he's done something wrong, go after him, but I'm not going to lie. They come back to him later
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:25.240]  and they pressured him to say that he was standing outside the door and he heard the transaction.
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:30.200]  He said, I just won't do it. Now, his attorney that he had was a former U.S. attorney who was
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.840]  pressuring him along with the government. So he fired that attorney and they indicted him to
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:41.720]  keep him out of my case. The bottom line is, here's how egregious it was when they brought
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:47.720]  the witness to testify against me in trial. He stated that he gave me the money in an automobile
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:54.200]  in Youngstown, Ohio. But the government is clearly on record now. Clearly on record is trying to
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:59.960]  pressure Richard Detour to say that he saw the transaction in my office. And it was the prosecutor
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:04.600]  who was doing this. By the way, the prosecutor is now working for some insurance company in Columbus,
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:09.800]  Ohio, and everybody's scared to death of what happened because they know that I'm not as afraid
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:14.760]  to speak my mind. Well, let's stop there for a second, former Congressman James Travacant.
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:19.880]  I'm sure you're aware of Don Siegelman's case. It's even 60 minutes reported it was all a stage
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:24.680]  deal. The majority of these former state attorneys, U.S. attorneys came out and said it was a fraud.
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:29.320]  A bunch of Republicans came to his aid, even though he's a Democrat. They, it's now admitted,
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:36.200]  ordered one of his aides to lie and say he saw the check, the same thing. And it turned out
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.600]  that was a complete lie. So this is, and it's now been confirmed, Carl Rove ordered this. I mean,
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.520]  do you know specifically in the U.S. attorney's office who gave the orders to set you up?
[1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:53.560]  Yes, I do. I don't know who exactly did it, but it was supervised by Michael Chertoff,
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:58.040]  who they rewarded him, make him head of Homeland Security. It was over. And they made the prosecutor,
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:02.120]  in my case, number two man in the Justice Department, right underneath Gonzalez. He was
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:07.880]  deputy attorney general there until this thing hit with a fellow in Nigeria. And now the fellow in
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:13.080]  Washington, DC, who spent a million and a half dollars, he was acquitted in about about 45 minutes
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:19.320]  because his attorney called him and pressured him, his own attorney, trying to encourage him
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:25.720]  to lie for the U.S. government against me. And what he did is he had a retired Navy captain who
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:30.280]  worked with him, listening on the other end of the phone. And he did then went ahead and did
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.560]  an affidavit. If you read the affidavit, you'd get sick to your stomach, Alex. Terms like this,
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:40.600]  there's no reward for honesty, Richard. They're going to get this guy. Why throw yourself in the
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:44.360]  mix? You didn't do anything. They'll have to indict you or do something to you. So just go ahead
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:47.560]  and tell them what they want to hear. They're going to get trafficking. Just go ahead and do what
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:54.200]  they want, Richard. This is what I'm up against. Now, let me tell you what. Here's the difference
[1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:59.240]  between me and Siegelman. Sixty minutes come in and did a story on Siegelman. I'm going to tell
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:03.480]  it right the way it is. When you're the number one target of the American-Israeli Public Affairs
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:09.240]  Committee, sixty minutes don't have anything good to say about you. Now, that's putting it,
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:14.120]  that's putting a hay where the goats can reach it, Alex. Well, let's talk more about that.
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:19.640]  Were you warned when you... I didn't have this powerful Jewish animus against me. I think I'd
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:24.760]  be a very rich man for what they did. But I'm still the top target of Israel. Quite frankly,
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:29.640]  I think they're delaying that trial over there in Germany because they do not want me to testify
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:35.240]  over there in Germany. They're hoping that old man will die in Germany. Well, let's expand.
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:41.240]  Let's expand on this Israel situation. Let's go through from the start. When did you first get
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:46.040]  on the Israeli lobby's radar? Were there back-channel threats to you in Congress?
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:51.160]  Did they warn you to back off first? What happened? Well, first of all, when I was running,
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:56.360]  they tried to get me $10,000 cash. I told them, you keep your money and I'll keep my vote. So,
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:00.760]  I think I was targeted before I ever walked down there. Second of all, I tried to cut
[1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:05.160]  four and eight every year for everybody. I was asked a couple of times to exempt Israel. I said,
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:09.800]  I wouldn't do that. I never could pass any cuts. I worked hard to try it. We have people sleeping,
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:14.920]  I'm still great, and we're sending money overseas. Don't make much sense to me. But finally, it became
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:22.360]  that deminucate. I was called a Nazi supporter. I suffered great... How did you get involved in
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:26.600]  the case? They came to me, Alex, because they knew they were from Cleveland. They knew the government
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:32.840]  hated me, and they came to me last. They said no one would even talk with them. In fact, I was in
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:39.480]  the office overhearing the conversation outside, and they said, we come to Jim last because no one
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:43.720]  will talk to us, and we didn't want to come to Jim. We know the government hates them, but we have
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:49.000]  no one to look into our place. And they said, and I never forget the son. I heard the son say,
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.320]  look, I never had a speeding ticket. I can't talk to an elected representative. My father's
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:58.440]  not asking to talk to him. I'm asking, what the hell's going on here? I said, send that young man
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:06.120]  into me. And when I did that, Alex, my staff told me, almost verbatim, if you get involved in this
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:12.600]  case, you are finished as a congressman. You're already on the hit list for your cutting foreign
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:17.000]  aid. You get involved with this case. Now, with the newspaper didn't print, they all printed
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:22.600]  trafficking, supports Nazi mass murder. What they didn't print was what I told the family.
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:26.760]  When they came in, I said, look, your father's been convicted of mass murder. If he is guilty,
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:30.280]  I could truly go over and pull the switch. But I believe you should be able at least
[1:47:31.160 --> 1:47:35.640]  take your case to somebody in government. And it should have been your own congressman,
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:40.440]  your own senators. They said no one would talk to them. I got involved in what I found out,
[1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:44.680]  Alex, that he was not Ivan. Well, let me stop you. Let me stop you. Think about this. You're a
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:50.920]  congressman. This guy is supposedly a kangaroo court convicted Nazi. And of course, the Supreme
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:55.960]  Court Israel said, actually, it's the wrong guy. It agreed with you. So why would you get into
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:48:00.520]  something this dangerous unless you had a sense of justice? So you began to look at the case. What
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:07.880]  was there? Well, I started to get, I was known in Congress for taking a look at things objectively,
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:11.800]  and people were not afraid to confide in me. Before long, I started to get whistleblower
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:16.600]  activity. And the whistleblower type of things I got led me to certain conclusions. And I moved
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:21.560]  with a Freedom of Information Act request on Dominic. And they just kept throwing it in
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:27.400]  file 13 and saying, classify, classify, classify. And what I did is basically trick them, Alex.
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:33.080]  There was, I started to look around and I researched, was there ever anybody tried for war
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:37.960]  crimes who was located at that Treblinka polling concentration camp? And there was a man from
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:44.200]  Chicago, a Ukrainian, who ended up coming to Chicago area by the name of Fedor Fedorenko.
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:49.480]  He was tried for war crimes in America at Treblinka and was acquitted in America. Alex,
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:53.880]  he then went to visit his family in Ukraine, relieved of all the pressure. He was picked up
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:59.080]  by the KGB, tried over there and executed. What I did is I submitted a Freedom of Information
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.720]  Act request on Fedorenko. And with that, I got documents from the State Department.
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.760]  And he looked just like the other guy. Yeah. Well, no, I got the documents I got from the
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:14.680]  State Department was in response to a request for information from one of our agents, just
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:21.240]  from agents over in Germany years ago, maybe 25 years ago. And it had on the bottom, Alex,
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:27.080]  it said they had another 100 pages in the file. I immediately got on the phone and I called
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:32.920]  them 100 pages. And that woman sent them to me. And Alex, when it come up, 100 pages. And that
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:43.880]  woman sent them to me. And Alex, when it come over, it had testimony of trials of everybody
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:49.400]  who identified Ivan the Terrible as a man named Yvonne Marchenko. But the big thing was there
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:55.240]  was a photograph in there of two Nazis. And the guy identified the photograph as follows. He said,
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:50:00.520]  the small man on the right is Taktuk with the pistol. The tall man on the left is Yvonne Grozny.
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:06.680]  The man that Jewish prisoners feared the most, Yvonne Marchenko. Now, I had this and I went
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:12.920]  on a house floor and I said, Ivan the Terrible is a man named Ivan Marchenko. And when you ever
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:17.000]  hear the Justice Department make a response, that night they put out a press release. His name is
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:22.600]  even Ivan. And the only thing is he looked a little similar to the guy living in Ohio. Not
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:30.280]  really. When you hear this, the Justice Department went public and said there were two Ivan. Now,
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:33.800]  you know what I said? I said, you sure there wasn't a swing shift. And then I showed the
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:39.640]  photograph. With that happened, everything went underground. The Justice Department shut up.
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:44.280]  Next thing you know, I'm over in Israel. And I think it became a real issue. I got to give
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:49.000]  credit to the Israeli Supreme Court. The Israeli Supreme Court looked at the evidence to take this
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.200]  man home. But see, that's the issue is the Israeli Supreme Court says he's innocent. You have the
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:59.000]  secret files. It proves it. Meanwhile, the American Israeli groups after you stay there,
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:03.320]  Congressman, this is amazing information. James, traffic, hands are guests.
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:09.000]  Is it safe to breathe anymore crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:13.240]  of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder what if there was a

[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:40.200]  stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986,
[1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.760]  yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is out
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:49.320]  performed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your

[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:07.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:11.640]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:16.200]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:20.440]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:25.640]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:31.640]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:35.400]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:41.160]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit
[1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:50.600]  them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:53:50.600 --> 1:53:59.640]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:02.120]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:21.880]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, is coming up at the eight after next hour.
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:25.960]  Former Congressman James Travick will be with us another five minutes to the next hour, and he
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:30.520]  says he wants to come back. We really appreciate his courage. I've studied him. I've looked at what
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:35.080]  he's done. I looked at why he took the case of this supposed camp guard. It turned out it was just
[1:54:35.080 --> 1:54:41.960]  all lies. And the government knows that. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that. Why did the Israelis
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:47.000]  tell the truth about this? But then in America, the Israeli lobby came after you. Is it two different
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:51.080]  groups or one different group? I mean, you were telling me during the break, you think this is
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:56.360]  all going to hurt Israel, and that's not what you want? No, absolutely not. I think I think I've
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:55:01.880]  been branded as anti-Semite, and quite frankly, I am a supporter of Israel. A supporter of Israel
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:05.880]  when they're doing what's right, when they do something wrong, I'm not going to be remiss here
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:10.760]  and not mention it. I believe that they have undue control of our government. But I'd like to say
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:17.400]  this to start with, the Israeli Supreme Court gave a lesson in justice to the United States of America.
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:21.960]  This was the most controversial case, perhaps in Israeli history, one of them,
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:27.800]  and they looked at the evidence, Alex, and they said, take him home. Now, what everybody doesn't
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  know, Alex, is that our government went back and wanted Israel to prosecute Dominic again
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:40.920]  on this other charge, and the Israeli Supreme Court would not allow it. So let's give kudos where
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:46.520]  it's due. Let's give it to Israel and their Supreme Court. Okay, so then how does the Supreme
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:51.880]  Court of Israel agree with you and the government files that prove it 100 percent? Why is APAC
[1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:59.240]  putting you in prison? Well, I think it's once you're targeted, and they fired a woman in 1990
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:03.480]  or 1991, I don't know if you remember this, Alex, a top-ranking woman in the America's
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:08.200]  Israeli Public Affairs Committee, and she gave out their hit list of the politicians that they
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:13.000]  wanted to get rid of, and Jim Travken was the number one target in the world. And I think it was
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:18.040]  because the way I handled that case, no one would help me, and I went to the House floor,
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:23.400]  and I dramatically presented the case on behalf of Dominic and his family, and I believe that I
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:28.840]  riled up many, many of the people, whether they felt that just the fact that I looked into this
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.400]  case, that no one should look into it, I had to have some anti-Semite blood, this is what they said.
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:37.560]  And now Germany's hauled this guy off, is on the death's doorstep.
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:43.560]  Yeah, I think they're holding and delaying this, because I firmly believe that they do not want
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:48.680]  me over in Germany to speak out on this issue. I think they're holding this case up, holding
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:55.000]  that the old man will die over there. But what a shame. He was not guilty, Alex. Bottom line,
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:01.160]  and let me say this, when you allow one citizen's right to be trampled, you endanger the right of
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:06.440]  all Americans. What the hell is wrong with us? What have we come to? What have we turned into here,
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:10.200]  Alex? Well, that's why I support you, because I mean, I looked at the facts and
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.640]  you've been persecuted a lot worse than Siegelman, and he's been vindicated, you've been vindicated
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:21.160]  as well. But what comes next? I mean, how do you go after these guys? Do you sue people?
[1:57:21.160 --> 1:57:25.480]  Do you call for new investigations? What do you do? I really don't have any strength to do that,
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:30.760]  but this fellow in Washington, D.C., this Richard Detour may file suit. If he does, I will then
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:35.960]  back up into that suit as well. And it's going to be a long, hard struggle. But I think that
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:40.280]  there's so many revelations to do that it's going to surprise an awful lot of people.
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:45.080]  But right now, I'm looking politically. I'm looking at politically, not just for vengeance,
[1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:49.640]  but looking politically, because I think America needs somebody to speak out on what the hell's
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:54.760]  going wrong, who's not afraid to speak out, who's not controlled by their party. I think too many
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:59.160]  of the politicians today have allegiance to the party, allegiance to be to the American people.
[1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:01.240]  And so you're planning to run as an independent. Give us the battleground.
[1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:05.960]  I'm an independent and this is a Democrat area. My chances aren't great. I'll be quite honest
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:11.560]  as an independent. But I just don't see, I can't see anybody following Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid
[1:58:11.560 --> 1:58:16.520]  in the battle. And Bobby, damn, beam me up if I'm going to be involved in that party.
[1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:22.280]  But I mean, why not use the machinery like Ron Paul does,
[1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:24.840]  and use their machinery? You would still be an independent.
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:33.480]  It would be impossible for me to do that. I would be so, so castigated here. I have to basically
[1:58:33.480 --> 1:58:39.240]  run as an independent. Be hypocritical for me to run now as a Democrat with the positions that
[1:58:39.240 --> 1:58:41.640]  I've taken. Okay, we got a break. One minute, sir. Stay there.
[1:58:44.680 --> 1:58:50.520]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.520 --> 1:58:57.880]  Hey, hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:58:57.880 --> 1:59:03.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:09.160]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president
[1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:15.080]  in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:59:15.080 --> 1:59:20.760]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:26.120]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:29.960]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists,
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:34.040]  they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:40.360]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the
[1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:47.320]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online
[1:59:47.320 --> 2:00:11.320]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:00:17.320 --> 2:00:27.880]  Well, he doesn't do a lot of interviews. He did a big one on Fox News, as you know,
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:32.520]  a while back, that sent shock waves across the country. But he's been on with us for an hour,
[2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:36.440]  and he says he'll come back soon. We're very thankful. James Traffican, I was asking during
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:42.200]  that one minute break, former congressman, other key points. And you brought up the fact
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:47.000]  that you have people in Washington that are telling you you are being watched and that there
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.560]  was a big secret investigation about the denominated case, but it was about how did
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:57.400]  Traffican get the info? Yes. When I brought him home, the big investigation didn't center about
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:02.120]  how they support and perjury to ruin this man's life. And this was a capital offense.
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:05.960]  They're going to put the death penalty. It wasn't about how they withheld evidence,
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:12.120]  about how they violated civil rights. It was how did Traffican get this information? Imagine that,
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:17.480]  folks. I mean, it's unbelievable that there's something to think you hear. So I just worked
[2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:22.520]  very hard. I just put my nose to the grindstone and kept going. And that's about it. That's all
[2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:27.240]  you can do, Alec. But I'll tell you something. We've got a real problem. No one should fear
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:31.880]  our government. The government, if anybody, they should be fearing the American people.
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:36.440]  American people are the government. And we've got this thing so complicated and messed up.
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:43.240]  It's really a crime shame and it's got to be changed. We also need to thank your wife and
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:50.200]  all of this. Patricia Traffican, she stood beside you. You stood beside her. And for
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:55.880]  better and worse, and people, if they do write checks to try to get you guys back on your feet
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:02:01.000]  to the address, they need to address those. You were telling me to Patricia Traffican 429
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:11.240]  North Main Street, Poland, Ohio, 44514. Congressman, we've got about three minutes left,
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:14.200]  and you were going to give me a liner for the show about...
[2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:19.400]  You know, Alec, I've gotten volumes of mail all through the seven and a half years. And one of
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:23.560]  the reasons I got them is people followed my little one minute speeches. And I just didn't do
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:29.080]  the grandstand. I made salient points during that time and dramatized things that I think had to be
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:34.600]  made. But I became known for the statement, beam me up. And basically I just said beam me up because
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:40.040]  there's no intelligent life here. But here's what I'd like to say to the Alec Jones show.
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:46.920]  You don't need to be beamed up. Jim Traffican doesn't need to be beamed up on Alec Jones show
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:52.120]  because there is an intelligent audience there. And there is the message coming out that's
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:58.040]  educating that audience. And believe me when I say this, if more people were listening to Alec
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:03.000]  and could listen to Alec, I think you'd see a direct and intended change.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:06.280]  And some of these misdirected policies that are coming out of Washington,
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:10.120]  so misdirected and absurd that if you threw them at the ground, they'd probably miss. So
[2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:15.480]  there's no need to beam me up here in Austin, Texas. There's intelligent life in Austin, Texas.
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:21.240]  And before I leave, again, I want to say I don't know what happened to Chairman Archer, Bill Archer,
[2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:25.800]  but Alec, I want you to run him down. I want you to find him. And I want you to say that Jim
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:29.480]  Traffican said thank you on behalf of the American people.
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:32.920]  Absolutely. We've got about a minute left here.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:38.280]  What's the timeframe for the election for people to start getting behind you in Ohio?
[2:03:38.280 --> 2:03:42.760]  Well, this means I'll be on the ballot in the November election, but I have to get signatures
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:48.120]  signed. I have to get petition signed up until May the 3rd. I need a couple thousand signatures
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:52.920]  here and it's going to be an uphill struggle. I'm not supported by any newspaper, any political
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:04:00.680]  party, any entity of anything and it's an uphill struggle. But you know what? I've had it and maybe
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:07.240]  get back to where we started. Well, the first thing we need and we're going to get some
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:11.480]  domains and just give them to you to make sure whoever the volunteer is doesn't just get a
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:15.000]  domain and keep it. We've already grabbed some domains. We're going to give them to you.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.560]  You need to get a volunteer to build you a nice website with PayPal buttons, the rest of it.
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:25.320]  Get everybody doing these petitions now because we do need you in Congress to counterbalance
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:30.920]  all the offshore corporate forces and others that are doing this. And thank you so much,
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:34.920]  former Congressman James Travacant, for your courage and we're all praying for you and we're
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:39.640]  glad they weren't able to kill you or break your will in prison. And it seems you've come out
[2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:43.480]  even stronger on the other side. Well, I'd like to thank you for being on your show.
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:47.400]  You've got a great show. You get a great message to people. I think if I could leave
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:52.360]  anything out there, I'd just say tune in to Alex's show and I hope you get more coverage
[2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:56.600]  around the country. I think they need to hear a rational voice like yours. So thanks for having
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:01.960]  me, Alex, and good luck. Beam me up, but you don't need it down here in Texas. Thank you.

[2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:32.120]  Mike Riverao to give us his take with Bob Chapman on the Kamikaze attack in Austin,
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:35.880]  the media trying to say it was the tea parties that did it. As I predicted before the media even
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:41.560]  said it, they would. Very, very suspicious. We're going to recap all of that coming up and of course
[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:47.640]  wide open phones on the Kamikaze attack coming up in the last hour. We totally opened phones
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:52.360]  in the last hour. Today, we've reached the halfway point here in the four hour radio
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:57.800]  broadcast. I'll be back Sunday, four to six PM central standard time live. I want to tell you
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:01.560]  about a few of the sponsors that make the radio show possible. One of them is the Acola Blue
[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:08.760]  company, AcolaBlue.com. They have little bitty moisture evaporators that grab water out of the
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:12.360]  air, send it through a whole bunch of great filters, put it in a stainless steel tank,
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:17.240]  all computerized, very easy to use. AcolaBlue.com, they've got big ones that can, you know,
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:26.360]  hundreds of people can get water from very economical and they have 10% off until Monday.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:32.920]  They're once a month special being run right now. 10% off on some of their key units. Just tell them
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:39.880]  the product code, Alex Jones, to get that discount. AcolaBlue.com or 800-691-6043,
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:46.200]  it grabs water out of the air. That's what the clouds are. AcolaBlue.com, 800-691-6043,
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:52.920]  also want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com. Have you lost your power and wanted to simply

[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:08.600]  These portable power systems need no installation, supply household current,

[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:49.160]  Okay, going to Bob Chapman before we get into the economy, the kamikaze attack and more.
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:54.440]  You just heard Travacant on, Bob. I know you're on hold. Man, it's good to see him up and fighting
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:11:01.080]  like this and surviving his railroading into prison. We certainly need him. That's for sure.
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:10.200]  This guy is fearless. As you said, he's stronger now that he's ever been. And I hope that his
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:20.200]  coming back will cause these people in Washington and in New York City spasms of despair.
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:29.480]  Well, over 90% in polls now want to abolish the Fed or audit it. 75% are angry Republican
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:34.600]  and Democrat and independent at government policies. Rasmussen, it's gaining a few points every week.
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:38.760]  I mean, the government is collapsing right now. Before we get into all the big developments
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:42.280]  in the last week in the economy that people tune in to hear your expertise on and your
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:48.120]  insight every week, the kamikaze attack. Is he a lone, angry guy who was persecuted?
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:53.400]  Is it a setup? The fact that instantly they said Tea Parties did it and then,
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:56.360]  lo and behold, he was angry at the tax system is very suspicious.
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:01.080]  The reports we got that they had the emergency crews there, that was on the local news before it
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:05.880]  happened. We talked to multiple witnesses, not just the local newscast. The fact that one of our
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:11.480]  sources in the FBI said they had a threat to buildings, government buildings the night before
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:16.120]  and dispatched Dallas agents. Was that because of his screed on the web? That doesn't prove inside
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:23.560]  job. The fact is we don't know. Looking at this Bob Chapman 24, now 28 hours in, what do you
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:32.280]  think is going on? There's a lot of conflicting information and that makes it difficult.
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:39.560]  We're on the outside looking in. We're backing into what we think can be a solution as to why
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:47.880]  it happened. The Tea Party, I don't think has anything to do with it. I think that this man
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:55.560]  was hounded by the eternal revenue service and he saw all the things going on around him.
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:01.640]  He didn't like it. He was losing what he had. He wanted to get back at him and he was prepared
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:15.000]  to die to do it. I think that's what happened. Continue. As far as the emergency equipment
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:26.200]  being available before it happened, if the FBI was called or found out that he was going to do that
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:35.400]  because of something he said on the internet, I would think that that would be a reasonable
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:42.280]  explanation as to why it was there. Maybe the FBI was on to the whole thing that probably didn't
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:49.320]  know how to stop it. Or didn't want to stop it so they could play the victim. Well, that's true,
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:54.760]  too. I mean, if they're coming down to Austin or they already have emergency equipment out there
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:58.920]  and all this is going on, they knew where his airplane supposedly was in Georgetown. Why weren't
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:06.600]  they there? That's a good question. If all of that is fact that they didn't know where his plane
[2:14:06.600 --> 2:14:13.480]  was, they should have been down there guarding it or impounding it or something. Well, we're not
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:17.560]  sure. I mean, this is what the source said. And that's just one of many reports as we tried to
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.600]  put all the evidence out there for all of our collective minds to come to a conclusion on.
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:27.800]  What about the larger issue? I mean, traffic can off air was going, hey, what about Austin?
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:32.280]  You're down there. This guy was fed up. We're sick of it. Then on air, he said similar things.
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:38.120]  A lot of people out there want to believe that he did it on his own and they like it. And I
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:43.640]  think that overall is dangerous because Northcom and the globalists normally bomb themselves
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:50.440]  as a pretext of crackdown. And I mean, I just think we're making such inroads right now peacefully.
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:57.880]  I don't know if targeting secretaries in an IRS building is a good idea or a good thing.
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:03.800]  PR wise, what's your take on that? I agree with you completely. And you know,
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:09.960]  we've preached this on all of the shows that we've been on. Don't get sucked into the vortex of
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:15.240]  the government getting you to do things that they would like to do themselves. But if you're dumb
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:23.240]  enough to do it, well, go ahead and do it. And so with that said, we don't want violence.
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:32.920]  And I feel very bad that the man is now deceased. And there had to be another solution. I would
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:39.480]  say in retrospect, too bad somebody wasn't around who could have calmed him down and taken
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:51.240]  the ideas of destroying himself and in the process and killing possibly killing innocent people.
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:56.520]  Well, here's what we know now. And I predicted this yesterday morning and now they've done it
[2:15:56.520 --> 2:16:02.280]  last night and today. They want to put body scanners in x-rays security at all airports.
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:08.920]  Most airports maybe have 10, 15 planes. They're all over the place. And this will destroy
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:14.120]  general private aviation if they bring TSA level control into the small airports.
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:18.120]  Now they announced yesterday. They already started this yesterday morning before this even happened.
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:22.520]  The Viper teams are now popping up everywhere with random checkpoints on the streets
[2:16:22.520 --> 2:16:27.560]  and at bus and train terminals. So they're certainly using this to put a giant police
[2:16:27.560 --> 2:16:33.720]  state stasi in. What's next? If people use cars to run over cops, will we ban citizens having cars?
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:42.040]  Well, I also heard yesterday of someone who defended their home by using a sword. And so
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:45.960]  they'll have to start out lowering, lowering swords and of course, butcher knives and
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:51.000]  and just about everything. Well, Oklahoma just passed a law that you can't fortify your home
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:55.240]  with more than three dead bolts. You can't have burglar bars. They're now illegal because the
[2:16:55.240 --> 2:17:01.080]  criminal government wants in and so do their little buddy criminals. Yeah, I saw that. That's
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:07.480]  they're going all the way. There's no question. And they're trying to draw us into this. And
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:15.160]  again, what you've said is very positive. Don't go out and commit suicide.
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:21.800]  Like this gentleman did. It's not a good idea. It's not good for you. And it's not good for
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:27.720]  what we're trying to accomplish. We want to get people like Jim Traficant back into Congress.
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:33.880]  We want to get anybody into Congress except the people who are there with minor exception.
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:38.920]  And goodness knows you've heard me say this over the last couple of years on this program.
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:46.360]  We have to. We have to take Congress away from the people who are being paid off.
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:53.960]  If we can do that, we can get the Fed reserve audited and then gotten rid of. We can get rid of
[2:17:53.960 --> 2:17:59.240]  executive orders. We can get rid of the plunge protection team, which is a working group and
[2:17:59.240 --> 2:18:06.680]  financial market markets, which is a executive order. We can get rid of campaign financing.
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:13.640]  And we can also get rid of lobbying. And in one fell swoop in six to eight months with the right
[2:18:13.640 --> 2:18:19.960]  Congress, we could accomplish all of that. And at the same time, we could make inroads to this,
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:30.360]  this disbanding homeland security. Bob Chapman with Chilchescu in Romania or Stalin or Hitler or
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:36.520]  Mao or any of these thugs and dictators, Pol Pot picked your poison. I've seen a lot of police
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:39.800]  writing me letters and they say, yeah, it's coming to the point where they're going to have to make
[2:18:39.800 --> 2:18:46.120]  decisions. And when government goes bad, it's no longer legitimate and it's natural God given
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:51.160]  rights for people to defend themselves. And what I've been shocked by is the level of anger of
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:57.880]  the public cheering this guy on and it's real. It's not provocateur. I wonder if the government,
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:02.520]  and I mean the minions that are going to be facing the true brunt of this, realize what 150
[2:19:02.520 --> 2:19:07.480]  million gun owners, 16 million guns sold in the last year, 14 million last year, already more
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:13.960]  than 2 million this year, realize that if 1% of that 150 million decide to stand up and fight,
[2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:21.640]  that is 1.5 million people that are, I mean, that's unstoppable. Don't the globalist understand
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:27.560]  that they may have put us to sleep for a while, but those old American 1776 instincts are there
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:34.920]  and that if the sleeping giant stands up and it's starting to get up, it's going to be devastating.
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:43.080]  I mean, and it's going to be hell on earth. It's going to be cultural and tribal. 450 million
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:50.040]  guns, 80 million veterans, 40 million that have been in combat. Don't anybody tangle with them
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:57.160]  if it comes to that. It's bad news. You know, the military puts out the line,
[2:19:57.160 --> 2:20:13.720]  we'll crush the American people. Folks, no one can stop a guerrilla army of this size.
[2:20:27.240 --> 2:20:36.840]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[2:20:36.840 --> 2:20:41.880]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[2:20:41.880 --> 2:20:46.760]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no
[2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:52.840]  word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:58.520]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:06.520]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:12.520]  in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:18.680]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence
[2:21:18.680 --> 2:21:24.680]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[2:21:24.680 --> 2:21:30.680]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:21:30.680 --> 2:21:36.520]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:41.000]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:45.640]  more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:51.640]  does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:11.640]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across a nation are preparing for the worst.
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:19.240]  The world is changing fast. Are you fully prepared? Or will you be forced to eat government soup?

[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.680]  We got Mike Rivera popping in for about 10 minutes with Bob Chapman
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:18.840]  on the kamikaze attack and the latest developments and get his perspective.
[2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:23.720]  That I tend to agree with on a lot of fronts too early to tell right now though. We're going to get
[2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:28.680]  his view coming up. Bob, right now and then when Mike leaves us we'll get back into the economy.
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:33.160]  What's going on with the economy? The months ago you said they were going to target Greece
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:38.120]  and Spain. The word was out. Now Reuters is reporting that the Spanish government is looking at
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:43.480]  this being coordinated by Goldman Sachs and others. Again, you hit the nail right on the head. What's
[2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:48.120]  going on with the dollar? Interest rates going up? What's happening with gold going back up?
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:53.240]  What do you see happening? Well, first of all, I wrote about Goldman 10 years ago
[2:24:53.880 --> 2:25:00.280]  when Greece and Italy were trying to qualify and the term I used was
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:08.680]  they're making mousing the books. And the rest of the Eurozone at that time, which they only
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:17.640]  make up 16 of the 27 European Union members, they looked the other way. They wanted that union
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:24.200]  and so they got it. And those books have been phony all along. And as we have found out,
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:30.200]  it's been proven now that Goldman Sachs arranged the whole thing. Where is it going?
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:39.640]  I think it creates a sense of urgency now. I think things are starting to come unglued even more
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:49.880]  quickly than I had anticipated. I think there's a possibility that they may bring down a number
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:58.120]  of these countries' sovereign debt prior to the election. And it may include the United States.
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:03.480]  And if they do that, there may not be an election. Now, I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:10.680]  And I don't want to give these people any ideas, but that would be the perfect thing to do to get
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:17.400]  control. And so that's possible. Whether it's probable, I don't know at this point, but there
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:26.200]  are a number of countries that are on the edge. We've got Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain,
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:34.840]  and Greece, which we know about. And then nobody ever hears about Latvia, Sonia, Latvia,
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:44.440]  Sonia, Lithuania, Romania, Hungary, Poland. And that will send debt shock waves a lot
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:49.960]  bigger than the housing bubble throughout the planet. Meanwhile, the Chinese are already moving
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:57.000]  and dumping their UST bills. That's correct. And even Denmark's having problems, of course,
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:04.920]  the two worst really for their size is Great Britain, the United States. Now, I think what
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:11.160]  government wanted to do, or those behind government wanted to do, is after the election
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:18.920]  start these things going by taking all of these countries to the edge and then having a meeting,
[2:27:19.880 --> 2:27:25.640]  like they did with Smithsonian and the Plaza Record and the Louvre Record, and revalue,
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:33.880]  devalue currencies and have a debt default between nations. And everybody falls off a cliff
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:42.200]  together and we have everybody devaluing their currencies, almost everybody. And then we go
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:48.280]  into a deflationary depression, which they want to from behind the scenes, people like Goldman
[2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:54.120]  and Morgan and Citigroup and all of those people and the Bilderbergers and all those groups,
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:01.160]  they would then try to suppress the people of the world, quote, legally while they were on
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:06.920]  their knees financially and economically. Let's expand. Let's expand on that. We now
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:18.840]  see open discussions of devaluation of the dollar. And we also, as you talked about last week,
[2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:22.600]  they're talking about coming in and taking people's pension funds, the government taking
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:27.000]  over people's pension funds, then paying you part of it back. The neocons are pushing for
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:35.480]  new taxes as if that's a good thing. No, I don't think taxes are the answer. The real answer
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:43.080]  is the cut government spending all over the country, not just in Washington. I mean, let's cut it
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:50.280]  by 50%. So you've got to lay off 30% of your employees, so that's too bad. This is really
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:56.600]  the solution, purging all of those banks and insurance companies and brokerage firms and
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:29:02.680]  transnational conglomerates. And let's explain that though. All the studies show one government job
[2:29:02.680 --> 2:29:08.360]  cost to private sector. So you get rid of the government jobs, a lot of them. Then you get
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:13.400]  two jobs back for every job you get rid of there and people have their own tax money, that would
[2:29:13.400 --> 2:29:21.240]  fix it. It's going to happen sooner or later and they know it. They want it on their terms so they
[2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:27.080]  can control it so they can make people do what they want to do under those circumstances. And
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:33.160]  that's why all the things that you talk about in regard to what's going on in America about
[2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:39.240]  Homeland Security and you can't put bars in your windows and all of these things,
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:48.440]  that is because they know the public is going to be very, very disturbed about all this and who
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:53.560]  knows what they'll do. Stay there Bob Jatman, our guest straight ahead joining us, Mike Rivera.
[2:29:53.560 --> 2:30:00.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:02.600 --> 2:30:06.840]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that
[2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:10.920]  produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science fiction,

[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:10.440]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[2:31:10.440 --> 2:31:15.480]  electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:20.360]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[2:31:20.360 --> 2:31:25.640]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:30.920]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:31:30.920 --> 2:31:36.040]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:40.600]  lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[2:31:40.600 --> 2:31:45.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:31:45.160 --> 2:31:49.400]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[2:31:49.400 --> 2:31:56.280]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:09.720]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much
[2:32:09.720 --> 2:32:15.240]  ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives
[2:32:15.240 --> 2:32:20.840]  of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now
[2:32:20.840 --> 2:32:25.640]  or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:30.520]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:35.640]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:41.480]  you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:47.080]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[2:32:47.080 --> 2:32:55.080]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web
[2:32:55.080 --> 2:33:00.920]  at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:33:17.160 --> 2:33:22.200]  We had James Travican on for the entire second hour of the show today. That'll be on the free
[2:33:22.200 --> 2:33:28.280]  podcast served up at the end of the show. It'll be reposted in higherqualityatprisonplanet.tv
[2:33:28.280 --> 2:33:34.360]  for members. A huge interview, a newsmaking interview. What incredible courage he's got.
[2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:39.720]  That's why we're standing beside him and behind him here. So that is coming up in an hour and
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:47.320]  27 minutes when the official live radio broadcast ends. Of course, I'll also be back live this Sunday
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:54.680]  4 to 6 p.m. Don't forget the free iTunes application. It's got five stars, hundreds and
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:34:01.000]  hundreds of ratings and iTunes as we launched it a week ago. What is it, like 10,000 plus downloads
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:05.080]  of it? It needs to be a lot more than that. It's absolutely free. Tell your friends and family that
[2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:10.040]  have iPhones or Apple about it. It's a great system. It streams a lot better than some of the other
[2:34:10.040 --> 2:34:14.920]  free systems that have our show or it's in larger listings. We do have other things like flycasts
[2:34:14.920 --> 2:34:19.880]  that have the show. We have links to where you can find us there. That's all at infowars.com
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:23.640]  and prisonplanet.com. Now, we're going to go back into the economy here in about 10 minutes,
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:30.200]  but Mike Rivera has been kind enough to join us because, again, this building got hit at about
[2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:35.640]  9.55 central. I learned about it about 10.30 when I got into work and we've been all over the map.
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:40.120]  Before they said Tea Party, before they tried to blame it, I said it's a government building.
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:43.640]  Watch them try to blame it on the Tea Party. I was right about that. Then we have a source
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:47.240]  that said the FBI was dispatched into Austin about a threat to a government building.
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:52.520]  They don't know specifically because it was another department. They just saw it and saw them leave.
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:57.320]  Could that be something else? Who knows? But we know we've played the KXAN piece
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:02.680]  where the woman said, I saw the emergency vehicles out here beforehand. I talked to multiple listeners
[2:35:02.680 --> 2:35:08.440]  who called in and we've talked to some of them off air as well. I mean, masses of calls here to
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:12.280]  the office in the comment line that, yeah, there were emergency people out there before and we
[2:35:12.280 --> 2:35:18.680]  heard the boom. Some saw them before others heard the boom and then went out and saw the
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:24.440]  police out there with cameras already within seconds. Did they know a threat was coming?
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.120]  They weren't sure. Were they on alert? They were having terror drills that they before
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:31.640]  with FEMA and Homeland Security in the city of Austin. In fact, bring me that city of Austin
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:35.160]  document. I forgot and left it in there. So we don't know what's going on. But
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:39.480]  Bob Chapman seems to think this was just if somebody fed up,
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:43.800]  traffic ants leaning towards that. And I wasn't leaning really towards that. I wasn't sure.
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:49.480]  We were looking at everything until I began to notice and I noticed in Rivera also,
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:52.920]  also because he's worked with the media, he recognized this, that real terror attacks or
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:57.000]  real attacks against government they tend to ignore. This was so big they couldn't ignore it,
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:01.800]  but that suddenly it kind of left the news cycle today. It was gone. With the underwear bomber
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:05.400]  we know was staged, it never left the news cycle and they had something they were pushing
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:09.000]  like they're staging fake cyber attacks right now to get through the Senate. No doubt that's
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:13.880]  fake and staged. So I wanted to get Mike Rivera's take on what he thinks going on here and then
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:19.400]  pop back in with Bob Chapman, who's with us as well right now. Mike Rivera joining us via video
[2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:24.360]  Skype from Hawaii. Good to have you here with us. Thanks an awful lot for having me on your show,
[2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:29.320]  Alex. Okay, give us your bottom line on with all the evidence this early on. We're not sure
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:33.400]  about what you think is going on. Well, I'm definitely leaning toward thinking this was a
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:39.400]  genuine spontaneous action by this gentleman who he's just an ordinary working American and he got
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:44.120]  pushed to his limit and he snapped and we all have a breaking point. And I think the media was
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:49.640]  attempting to spin this to make him look like a demon and a bad guy. And then when that really
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:54.760]  wasn't working, my concern was that the media was going to try and pull away the focus as quickly
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:58.920]  as possible, which as you point out they're doing today, it's all Tiger Woods all the time.
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:02.360]  And I think what's in there is we need to understand that from the point of view of the
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:07.560]  government and the media, their big priority right now, they don't want people actually reading
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:12.440]  this guy's suicide note. They're calling it a manifesto to make it sound like it's a bad thing
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:17.880]  because the commies had a manifesto and the unabomber had a manifesto. So this is a manifesto
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:23.320]  and you shouldn't go read it. But everybody who's actually read this suicide note, nobody condones
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:30.040]  what Joe Stack did. But everybody seems to say, I understand why he did it. We are all at that
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:35.880]  breaking point. We're seeing the work of a lifetime being taken away from us under threat
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:41.000]  of force, spent on wars, spent on corruption, spent on Israel. And much of Congress and
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:45.960]  Geithner and the White House don't even pay taxes. That's exactly right. That's further
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:50.600]  annoying a lot of people. And we've got callers into our show from people who've been thrown
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:56.040]  out of their homes by the IRS. A woman called into the show, her veteran husband had been
[2:37:56.040 --> 2:38:01.000]  neglected by the VA for nine months, came down with cancer. The week he died, the IRS
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:05.560]  took her bank accounts. It's just a horrific story out there. And everybody understands
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:09.400]  what this guy was feeling. They don't agree with what he did, but they understand where
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:15.080]  it was bad enough. It was bad enough with the IRS outside the law, no due process robbing
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:19.560]  everybody before for the private fellow reserve. But now everybody's starting to go bankrupt
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:24.520]  or on the edge of bankrupt and they don't even have money for gas or food. And now the government's
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:28.360]  taking the house. The only thing they've got or their little bank account with 500 bucks
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:33.480]  in it. Here's Rasmussen last week, 75% of Americans are angry at government current
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:38.360]  policies. And you know, that's a low number. Go ahead, Mike. Yeah, you're right. Most people
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:42.920]  are still trying to be polite and say, yes, I'm a loyal American. And there was a survey
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:48.120]  they did about, is it okay to cheat on your taxes? And I expect probably most people lied
[2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:51.640]  on that one as well, because they're afraid of, you know, they're afraid of the IRS. The
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:58.360]  IRS is the instrument of terror in our society. And again, nobody's condoning what Joe Stack
[2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:03.800]  did. But everybody who has written into my show or called into my show, they understand
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:09.000]  why he did it. I have not heard a single word of sympathy from anybody regarding the IRS in this
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:12.760]  affair. Talking to you this morning on the phone, you were saying the government's scared.
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:19.800]  Yes, absolutely. Because if there's one thing that Joe Stack has accomplished, it's kind of in a
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:26.200]  positive sense. It has made the abuses of the IRS acceptable and polite conversation. People are
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:30.440]  now willing to talk about how many of them are in serious trouble with the IRS. You've seen the
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:36.040]  flood of TV commercials for all these tax resolution services. You know, that alone tells you that
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:41.640]  most of Americans are in some kind of tax trouble. And now, because of Joe, it's okay to talk about
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:46.360]  it. It's okay to talk about the abuses of the IRS. People are even now openly talking about
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:52.120]  was the 16th Amendment actually ratified? Are the taxes illegal right from the start? I understand
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:56.200]  Jim Traficade and by the way, please give him my highest regards when you have him on the show.
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:40:00.440]  He's talking about if he gets elected back to Congress, he wants to kick the IRS
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:05.640]  in a very sensitive portion of the genitalia. So and I think most Americans are going to sign
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:13.560]  up with him on that. In your mind, is there any way this could have been an inside job? Because
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:18.600]  you know, they can remote control aircraft. We know that they were out there beforehand.
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:23.400]  Something was going on. We know the underwear bomber was staged. I mean, this is the season
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:27.880]  I've been predicting an attack in Austin from the activities I've been seeing. They need to
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:32.040]  demonize the tea parties. They certainly jumped on this within three hours of it happening. And
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:36.680]  I predicted they wouldn't said the tea parties. I mean, here's the New York Daily News, Kamikaze
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:41.000]  pilot Joe Stack crash plane into Austin building hailed by anti government groups. And they say
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:46.360]  in here that I'm hailing it. Austin American statesman in an article, social media speeds
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:52.600]  up news gathering and plane crash aftermath says that I was hailing the attack. I was saying maybe
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:58.200]  staged or we don't know or I mean, I mean, so I'm being singled out here. They're certainly
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:03.320]  trying to put this on us. Well, they're putting it on you. They're putting it on Glenn Beck.
[2:41:03.320 --> 2:41:06.920]  They're putting it on me. They're putting it on Rush Limbaugh. They're looking to basically
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:13.960]  take the focus off the letter as for the exact nature of it. I'm 95% convinced it was a genuine
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:20.360]  spontaneous act by this gentleman. If it was a false flag attack, it's a very poorly thought out one
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:26.200]  because the patsies that are supposed to be framed for it. It's not a very good case. And in this
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:31.560]  case, back when the Oklahoma City bomb went off and little kids were being killed and everybody
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:35.640]  was shocked and said, Oh, this is a terrible thing. They're not getting that reaction here. The
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:40.680]  attitude of most of America is well, yeah, it's a bad thing. But you know, maybe they sort of
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:46.120]  to be clear, you've done the research. Oklahoma City inside job, underwear bomber inside job,
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:52.520]  9 11 inside job, Operation Ajax inside job, Gulf of Tonkin inside job, Operation Northwoods inside
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:58.280]  job, Gulf of Tonkin was not an inside job. It was a deliberate misinterpretation of the available
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:04.920]  information. But that is still an inside job to say you've been attacked and it's made up as a
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:10.600]  pretext for war. What I'm saying is staged, staged provocation. Well, definitely a lot of a lot of
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:14.840]  propaganda and a lot of lying in misstatement. You know, there were no torpedoes there. But in
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:19.960]  the case of yesterday's attack, I think they were trying to take something that happened genuinely
[2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:25.560]  and attempt to use it for propaganda purposes. And they didn't get the traction with it. It just
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:30.920]  doesn't feel like it was planned or known about ahead of time. They just tried to take advantage
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:35.640]  of it and they didn't really get it to work. That's what it feels like to me. Let's bring
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:43.640]  Bob Chapman and Bob, your comments on this. Well, first of all, I think it could, unfortunately,
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:50.040]  bring about other such events. And for all of you who are listening out there, please
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:59.160]  keep your cool. Talk to somebody about a problem. I mean, everybody out there's got problems now,
[2:42:59.160 --> 2:43:09.000]  some are worse than others. I know it's compelling when you lose everything you have. But we have
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:18.040]  a society that we shouldn't be running around killing ourselves. And usually, the only people
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:24.680]  who do that are people who become unbalanced. And there are reasons for that. But the point is,
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:33.400]  and don't let this get you carried away. Secondly, I, in the international forecaster,
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:41.800]  I guess it was two issues back, maybe three. And I had a piece in there about Remington
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:48.120]  taking an order, and I can't remember how many. It was shotguns for the IRS.
[2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:55.240]  Yes. Yeah, these are sawed-off shotguns. I mean, 14 inches is a sawed-off shotgun.
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:44:05.080]  And I think that the IRS obviously is terrified that people are going to react against them.
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:09.720]  Yeah, for those that don't know, a sawed-off is generally defensive. So people that don't know
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:12.840]  what they're doing can just aim in a general direction when you're getting rushed.
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:20.200]  Exactly. And the legal limit on the shotgun barrel is 18. And that's what a riot gun is.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:23.640]  Yes. So the IRS gets to have illegal shotguns.
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:30.440]  That's right. Well, it's obviously legal for them, but illegal for us. And like so often,
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:38.360]  we have two sets of rules. But I agree with what Mike had to say, and very well said.
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:46.760]  And you as well, Alex. And I think unless something else pops up, I think it was
[2:44:48.680 --> 2:44:56.040]  an act of utter frustration. What am I going to do? I work my whole life. And I may as well make
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:45:00.920]  a statement. Well, here's the last question. Here's the last question I have for Mike Rivera.
[2:45:00.920 --> 2:45:03.960]  And then you are going to let Mike go. And we'll finish up with some economic news a little bit
[2:45:03.960 --> 2:45:09.560]  in the next hour, Bob. Mike, how do you see this unfolding? Because undoubtedly there's teachers
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:15.960]  almost every day shooting principals or their students. There's violence. Cops are being caught
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:22.680]  robbing banks and raping people. I mean, statistically crime, but also craziness is way up. And a lot
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:26.280]  of times it's by government because they're under stress. And a lot of them have a bullying
[2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:31.320]  psychology. And you've got citizens being pressed and squeezed and driven into a corner.
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:36.200]  No doubt, just like if our government attacks Iran, we're not going to have to see stage terror.
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:41.160]  Iran will defend itself. It will be called terror. Just like as the government squeezes,
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:45.000]  they know they're going to force people to finally stand up and they're going to call
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:51.400]  that terrorism. How do you see this unfolding, Mike Rivera fading away from the public
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:56.520]  consciousness, although Joe Stack is already sort of a cult hero in a lot of places, got a lot of
[2:45:56.520 --> 2:46:02.200]  Facebook fan clubs springing up. There's nothing new with the tax against the IRS. Generally,
[2:46:02.200 --> 2:46:07.640]  they tend not to be reported. But because of the high visibility of the plane crash into the building
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:12.120]  and the subsequent release of the suicide note on the internet, this one did get out there and
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:16.840]  it had to be dealt with. But there have been attacks against IRS facilities and people before.
[2:46:16.840 --> 2:46:20.920]  And no doubt it will continue into the future. I'm in agreement with your other guests.
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:26.200]  You know, this is not a call to arms to go out and start attacking the tax people because
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:31.560]  that would just give the government the justification it needs to suspend the Bill of Rights and really
[2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:35.720]  become the bullying dictators that we all know they secretly lust to be.
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:40.360]  And I don't want that to happen, but I think that'd be a miscalculation by the establishment as well.
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:45.320]  I think them bringing the tyranny more out on the open and getting more confrontational will only
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:48.680]  make things blow up quicker. So this is like a Mexican standoff.
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:52.760]  I agree with you. I mean, we have the saying around here, the fastest way to bring down
[2:46:52.760 --> 2:46:57.560]  a dictator is to force him to act like one where everybody can see it. I just don't want to see
[2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:02.760]  the kind of Kent State bloodshed, you know, that this kind of a process usually entails.
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:09.160]  Absolutely. Well, Mike, thanks for joining us. Whatreallyhappened.com is the great site. We'll
[2:47:09.160 --> 2:47:13.240]  talk to you again soon. Thanks an awful lot. Look forward to it. All right, there goes Mike.
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:17.800]  Anything else you want to add on the plane situation? I'll be recapping the latest developments
[2:47:17.800 --> 2:47:23.000]  in the next hour. I am open on this because I've been predicting an attack in Austin.
[2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:30.520]  I've seen Glenn Beck now come out and put on his little blackboard slash magnet refrigerator board.
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:35.960]  It's really what it is, but it looks like a blackboard. Deborah Medina next to Van Jones.
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:41.240]  And he said, these people hate America. Then he did a weird siob where he said, well,
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:46.920]  I'm in trouble in Texas with my listeners. He's lost 500,000 viewers conservatively according to
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:53.560]  Nielsen. His radio numbers we'll find out later earlier next month. Those come out once a month.
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:57.960]  But his websites, anywhere people can comment, he's being shredded everywhere.
[2:47:59.240 --> 2:48:04.920]  He does this basic psychology where he puts up a picture of Van Jones and then some other
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:11.400]  weatherman bombers next to him and then sticks Medina up and then Alan Keys of all people and
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:17.080]  says, these people are dangerous. They hate America. And he's not just saying 9 11 truthers are going
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:22.600]  to stage terror attacks, but he's now saying the birthers are the most dangerous. If these are
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:27.480]  the most dangerous when in polls, that's more than half of registered Republicans. So he's like
[2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:31.960]  emulating. I guess that's the word for burning yourself up in front of everyone because he's
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:37.160]  been ordered to do it. So I, and I see all the talking points demonizing tea partiers that
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:42.360]  they're going to commit terror acts by not just him, but Chris Matthews the last few weeks.
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:49.400]  And then this happens. I don't know, Bob. I don't know. This may be staged yet. They have
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:55.960]  psych warfare experts that new people are angry may make him a hero. Then I mean, this, I don't,
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:01.000]  I think the jury's out on this. I'm saying we should look at everything, but I'm just not sure.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:05.960]  But, but, but then the media quit covering it today. We know if it was staged, they'd be hyping
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.640]  it, but maybe it wasn't going like they wanted. So they pulled back. What do you think, Bob?
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:14.920]  Hi, I think we've just got to wait and see. You know,
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:23.800]  they're always looking for another horse to vessel. He was the young street tough who was in
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:30.680]  the brown shirts, shirts who was killed in clashes with the communists in Germany. And the Nazis
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:37.160]  made him into an ideal. In fact, it was the, they had the horse to vessel lied, which is the
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:46.200]  song of horse to vessel. And we don't want that to happen. We don't want someone to come along
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:56.120]  who is going to be cited by the government in doing these kinds of things so that they can move
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:01.880]  against people who agree with him, whether it's Joe Stack or somebody else. And we got to stay
[2:50:01.880 --> 2:50:08.840]  away from that. You know, we're doing very well doing what we're doing. And this is very important.
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:17.080]  I saw a figure and you quoted some 8% of the public voting public
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:24.200]  want to bring back their congressman or senator. And now that is astounding.
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:29.560]  I mean, that means 92% want their people out of office.
[2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:31.800]  Yeah, I've seen that number.
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:39.000]  It is so powerful. It is so good. We don't want to lose that momentum. We want them all out of
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:45.720]  there so we can get the legislation legally that we need. And we want to take the states back,
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:50.920]  which is why Deborah Medina getting elected is so important to send that message. Bob Chapman,
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:58.040]  stay there coming up in the next hour. I'm going to open the phones up 1-800-259-9231.

[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:17.640]  off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have turned
[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:23.400]  an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:30.040]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies
[2:52:30.040 --> 2:52:36.040]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:40.840]  on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:45.160]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today
[2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:51.960]  seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[2:54:13.720 --> 2:54:18.200]  Bob Chapman with us for a few more segments. We're going to open the phones up for a few
[2:54:18.200 --> 2:54:27.880]  questions for Bob coming up in the next segment or on any of these issues. 1-800-259-9231.
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:31.240]  Now look, the media said a lot of different aircraft, but we have the tax records.
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:41.240]  It was a PA-28 Cherokee aircraft, a Piper. Is that a Piper? Registered owner, Stack Joseph A.
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:49.320]  Okay, that's the aircraft. The media was saying this Cirrus aircraft. That's not what it is.
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:52.680]  Now here's the Texas division of emergency management document. Give me a document
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:54:57.240]  cam shot on this, guys. Texas division of emergency management, fiscal year 2010,
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:04.760]  training calendar October 2009, September 2010. Here's February. They were running all these
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:09.960]  different emergency, multi hazard emergency planning drills and others.
[2:55:12.680 --> 2:55:23.080]  And all the drills ended on the 18th yesterday. So maybe that's why those vehicles were out there.
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:26.840]  Maybe it was just part of a drill or maybe not. They only run drills in association
[2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:35.560]  with this. Bob Chapman, going back to you. So much is happening with the economy separately.
[2:55:36.280 --> 2:55:39.880]  What happened with gold going down the last month, now surging up again?
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:46.120]  Well, I think that's a good question. And, you know, we've just had gold negative news,
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:54.360]  supposedly. First of all, the situation in Greece was in the media interpreted as being
[2:55:54.360 --> 2:56:00.200]  bad for gold. And of course, it really wasn't because gold didn't go down. And then we had
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:05.160]  the IMF come out and said, well, we're going to sell some gold. And that turned out to be a
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:11.880]  non-event. And then, you know, higher interest rates has been touted as bad for gold and
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:19.000]  going down and came back up again. And so a gold seems to be impervious in here to the downside.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:26.760]  Right. And it's up 460 right now here in the late trading for the April month. And that'll go on
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:34.120]  for about another hour. The stocks are mixed to slightly weaker. And, you know, it's a Friday.
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:40.120]  People are evening up the books. And so it's hard to get a real read on it. But if I had to guess,
[2:56:40.120 --> 2:56:50.760]  I think gold will be up next week. And if it goes through 12-20-24 in that area, then we're
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:59.240]  going to very quickly see a move up toward 1500 to 1650. And if it doesn't happen by the beginning
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:06.120]  of April, it may very well happen before the end of the year, although I think much more quickly,
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:14.840]  especially in view of what I said earlier about the problems being expedited, I don't think
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:22.040]  that Goldman Sachs ever thought that they would run into the buzz saw that they're into right now
[2:57:22.600 --> 2:57:30.840]  because of their secret advice to these different nations and how to keep two sets of books. And
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:36.520]  of course, it's against the law, but that doesn't mean anything for the likes of
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:42.440]  Goldman, Morgan, and Citi. I mean, these people are criminals. And I spent 28 years in Wall
[2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:52.520]  Street. I think I got a right to say that. And so I think that this is causing the
[2:57:52.520 --> 2:57:59.960]  alumnus behind the scenes to have to, even though they don't want to, expedite what they're doing.
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:08.600]  And every time you do that, you make mistakes. And I think by next year, all this thing's going
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:17.080]  to start coming down bad. And as I mentioned earlier, we're there to bring it down in October,
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:28.120]  down being the sovereign nations defaulting simultaneously and having chaos within the
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:32.520]  financial world worldwide would give them an excuse not to have an election.
[2:58:58.440 --> 2:59:02.200]  Right from the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science fiction. It's very real. I know

[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:15.080]  It is already the fourth and final hour of this Friday edition.
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:21.160]  Bob Chatman and the international forecaster.com is our guest. I'm Alex Jones of infoawards.com
[3:00:21.160 --> 3:00:25.240]  and prisonplanet.tv. I want to say hi to all the great radio listeners out there and also the
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:30.840]  prisonplanet.tv viewers who are such key supporters of this radio show. You make it all possible.
[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:37.320]  Now, Bob's going to be with us till 15 after we're going to get more into the economy here in just a
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:43.640]  moment and have him continue with that question I just posed. He's saying he believes they may be
[3:00:43.640 --> 3:00:48.360]  moving up their time frame to fully implode things because every day they lose more credibility.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  That's scary from Bob because he's always been saying it's further out in the future.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:55.960]  We'll talk about that coming up in the next segment briefly before he leaves us.
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:01:01.080]  Right now, let's take a few calls. It'll be on a bunch of issues. Alex in Canada, you're on the
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:07.800]  air. I've had the gut feeling they're going to do something at the Olympics for a long time now,
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:11.560]  maybe about a year. I've always said you don't spend a billion dollars on security and then not
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:16.520]  stage a terror attack. And now on the heels of this, I really feel that they're stirring up 9-11
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:19.800]  memories and everyone's thinking 9-11, 9-11. Well, they don't even have to say terrorism,
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:24.280]  but you're still thinking 9-11. Because it's a plane into a building, yes.
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:27.800]  Exactly. And ever since that article about two weeks ago by We Are Changed Vancouver about
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:32.920]  possibility of a false flag, Kinder Morgan being bought out by Goldman Sachs and the Carlisle.
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:37.800]  And now it's in a Canadian newspaper. I meant to get to that, that they've caught police provocateurs
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:42.600]  again. They lost that two times of ammonium nitrate mysteriously. Now, my big thing is I
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:46.520]  started thinking now, when are they going to do this? And what I came up with is February 22nd,
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:52.600]  2-2-2, because we all know they love to use silly numbers. 3-3-3, 7-7-7, 9-11.
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:56.280]  And that being three days away, this happening right before that. They're stirring everyone's
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:01:59.560]  thoughts about terrorism, 9-11, 9-11, and all of a sudden on Monday morning,
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:03.240]  we'll see if I'm right or not. Hopefully not. I've gone as far as to bet people money this
[3:02:03.240 --> 3:02:05.560]  is going to happen. Now I know that's kind of immoral right about it.
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:10.280]  Well, I hope you're wrong, but Alex, I appreciate your call. Let's get a comment from Bob Chapman
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:19.800]  on that. We'll just have to see. The possibility certainly exists and they are into numerology.
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:29.640]  And I'm surprised that something didn't happen in Vancouver. And I know people who I talk to
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:35.960]  all the time who live there and many of them, many subscribers there. And they say that they've,
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:44.520]  it's like a guarded camp. And the Olympics haven't gone over that well.
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:52.920]  Well, the American Idol is out pointing them, so to speak, which is rather surprising. And
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:58.360]  it just hasn't drawn what the producers would have liked it to draw.
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:03.320]  People are sick of police states. Most Europeans won't come here now because of the police state.
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:10.280]  Well, that's true. In fact, what's happening is that most Americans don't want to fly and
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:16.920]  only fly if they absolutely have to. And you can tell that because of the dropping amount of people
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:27.640]  who are using airplanes in America commercially. And the price of tickets continues to soar.
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:34.280]  They're up about, I would say, 40 to 50% over the last few years.
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:38.840]  But see, we have the head of the NASA climate and the UN people and others saying they want to
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:43.800]  make a stop flying. They want us to stop driving. So there's some strat as a business that don't
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:48.760]  like it. Some big airline CEOs saying, don't put the scanners in from Australia to the US.
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:52.840]  But the real head honchos, they love the fact that people aren't traveling.
[3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:05.400]  Your take on that, Bob. Well, I can't figure that out. We're looking at a situation where
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:11.080]  if they're people who are running airlines and they don't want people to fly, they're not going
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:18.200]  to be in business very long. No, if they're executives with other companies, well, that might
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:25.400]  be, you know, the hearty line, so to speak, by the elitists. But no, that's what I'm saying.
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:30.680]  The airlines, all of them are saying they don't like it on record, but Cherdoff's got to make
[3:04:30.680 --> 3:04:36.040]  his little bit of money. So it's over. You know, well, that's disgusting.
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:45.000]  Cherdoff, man, he looks like a vampire out of Nosferatu movie. I mean, literally, maybe we can
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  cast him. We ought to put a picture of Nosferatu up next to Cherdoff. You can't. I mean, literally,
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:54.520]  there's like their twin brothers or something. Bob, stay there. Let's get into the economy.
[3:04:54.520 --> 3:04:59.240]  And after Bob leaves, just Ron, Jennifer, Fred, Dan, others, wide open phones. And then in the
[3:04:59.240 --> 3:05:03.960]  last 20 minutes, I'm going to have somebody who knew Joe Stack in studio here. This is Alex Jones
[3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:08.360]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one,
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:12.680]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[3:05:12.680 --> 3:05:17.560]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:05:17.560 --> 3:05:23.160]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:27.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:05:27.560 --> 3:05:32.840]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:37.320]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:42.200]  from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:05:42.200 --> 3:05:46.200]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[3:05:46.200 --> 3:05:52.920]  Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:05:58.840]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:07.080]  or call 1-877-327-0365. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:12.440]  Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[3:06:12.440 --> 3:06:16.760]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:06:17.400 --> 3:06:22.040]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:06:22.040 --> 3:06:26.760]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[3:06:26.760 --> 3:06:33.480]  nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[3:06:33.480 --> 3:06:37.560]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products,

[3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:12.680]  bacteria and other nasties? In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknob,
[3:07:12.680 --> 3:07:17.400]  shopping carts and handrails we touch every day. Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:21.880]  few seconds, goodbye effectiveness. No more protection until you use it again. Pure works to

[3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:51.960]  supple. No more dry skin. Here's to a little piece of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free

[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:29.400]  Texas, Alex Jones. Okay, your calls are coming up in T minus five minutes. Bob Chapman, the
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:36.920]  international forecaster.com is our guest as he is every Friday. Bob, briefly, you've been saying
[3:08:36.920 --> 3:08:45.080]  that you saw 2011-2012 when they would have the designed total implosion. Are you revising that
[3:08:45.080 --> 3:08:50.040]  and now say it may happen this year or what are the chances of that? Why are the globalists planning
[3:08:50.040 --> 3:08:57.560]  to do this? Well, I think the globalists are being forced into it or perhaps being forced into
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:09:10.280]  considering it. I think a lot depends on what happens over in Europe. These nations want a
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:16.040]  guarantee so that they won't go onto, but you can't do that. I mean, the amounts are colossal
[3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:23.640]  collectively and that doesn't just leave the United States out of it. So they know that
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:31.560]  they're going to have to sculpt this thing so that it suits their purposes. And before we want to
[3:09:31.560 --> 3:09:41.640]  break, I said it is possible that they may try something simultaneously to bring sovereign
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:47.960]  debt nations into a meeting because they say there's going to be chaos and they'll make all kinds
[3:09:47.960 --> 3:09:54.920]  of exclusive excuses prior to the election. But I think the chances of that happening are maybe
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:10:03.560]  30%. I think it's much more likely that starting toward the end of the year that they will be
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:09.560]  making announcements that we got to get together and sort this thing out and we got to have that
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:18.840]  meeting that I have referred to of all the nations, revaluing, devaluing, defaulting among
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:28.280]  nations, a new international trading unit such as a G7 weighted and perhaps even partially backed
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:35.880]  by gold, they're going to have to do something. And it's going to come sometime between, let's say,
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:43.160]  October and the end of next year. And the situation in the United States-
[3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:47.240]  Hold on, October this year and then the end of next year. You say sometime in there.
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:54.920]  Right. And you know, in the United States, we're still experiencing, as they are in Ireland and
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:11:03.640]  Spain, these tremendous losses in the real estate business, both commercial now as well as the
[3:11:03.640 --> 3:11:11.400]  residential. And the number of people who are losing homes is phenomenal. And on top of that,
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:20.280]  the amount of people getting laid off is less than it's been, but it's still in the minus
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:26.440]  column. In other words, unemployment is continuing to grow, but at a lesser rate.
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:35.160]  The stimulus, which is in process right now, of which, you know, we hear so many varying stories,
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:41.720]  the government says that they've got 35% of the money yet to go and others in Washington
[3:11:41.720 --> 3:11:47.960]  when I talk to say, look, the money's all gone. And we're almost out of time. So bottom line,
[3:11:47.960 --> 3:11:53.560]  we're in a real depression. The media propaganda won't pay for over that. And the globalists are
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:56.920]  damned if they do, damned if they don't. So they may want to intensify the crisis. We'll
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:00.200]  continue to follow that. I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up for just two minutes and then
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:06.600]  plug international forecaster for folks that want to get a copy of it because I didn't dump
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:12.680]  gold. I bought it $280 or 300 or 400 or 500 or 600. And when it went down a few weeks ago,
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:16.840]  I didn't dump it. Now it's gone right back up because I know there's concerted global
[3:12:16.840 --> 3:12:22.680]  devaluing of currencies together by the G20. We just put up the headline out of Australia two
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:30.760]  weeks ago, secret banking summit by the 24 top private central banks of the world. Clearly,
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:37.080]  they are just absolutely out of control. And regardless, we know they're devaluing currencies.
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:43.400]  Gold is the place to be. I wanted to bring Ted up briefly because I know he's busy. But Ted,
[3:12:43.400 --> 3:12:51.320]  you've been offering a deal of Franks that you bought back at the 1,050 level with its 1,100.
[3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:59.480]  What's gold at today, Ted? Well, gold high today is 1,126. Currently, right now,
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:06.120]  gold is trading right around 1,120. So it's gone up quite a bit since that 1,050 range.
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:11.000]  Yeah. So it's gone up over $70. It's gone up over $70. What's the deal you're offering now and
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:17.320]  can you still offer somebody buys one coin that was at the price when it was $70 something less
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:23.240]  and they get a free yearly subscription of the international forecaster? Yeah, they do. It's
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:28.680]  the Frank. The Frank point is a 1,5 of an ounce gold coin. And currently right now, they're trading
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:37.720]  for $249.61. Now, if you buy one of those coins, Midas is going to pay for the $159 subscription
[3:13:37.720 --> 3:13:44.840]  fee to have the international forecaster for a year for you. And I don't know how I can make this
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:51.800]  easier, but that comes out to be about $480 in gold in the price to take that subscription
[3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:57.160]  on ounce money out of it. Yeah. So I mean, that turns the clock back about 10 years
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:05.000]  to buy gold at that price. That is such a... Alex, it's a great deal. It's all about educating
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:10.280]  the people and getting people interested in gold, obviously. And you're saying you can still offer
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:13.640]  that because you were talking three days ago that you were about to get rid of it. You're still
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:19.720]  offering that deal. I can still offer that deal because I still have supply. I was able to buy
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:25.720]  enough. And in addition to that, gold prices have gone up and then it backed off a little bit,
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:29.240]  which kind of scares people away from the marketplace. I wish people were smarter than
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:34.680]  that, Alex, because they really need to be getting into the gold right now. Bob is talking about
[3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:39.320]  October. You and I both know there's going to be a lot of motivating factors this fall
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:45.480]  that are just going to drive people to gold like crazy. It's like a time machine. Once you
[3:14:45.480 --> 3:14:50.840]  get into the fall, gold and silver just rages forward. And there's so many economic problems
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:55.640]  then. The bottom line, the bankers have been trying to drive down gold. They've been unsuccessful.
[3:14:55.640 --> 3:15:01.800]  You bought gold when it was 1,050. It's 1,120 something a day. You're offering it to them at
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:07.800]  the lower price. You buy it when it's low, sell it when it's high at the old low price, and give
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:11.800]  people the free newsletter that's invaluable. This is a thick newsletter. Tell us about your
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:17.960]  newsletter, Bob Chapman. This is Finance, Economic, Social, and Political Issues All Over the World.
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:25.000]  By email, we produce a publication every Wednesday and Saturday, runs around 40 pages each time.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:29.640]  And for the people who are not on the internet, we have a hard copy as well that goes out twice a
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:41.960]  month. So I can't see how anybody can turn down Ted's offer. Absolutely. 800-686-2237.
[3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:45.880]  The gold prices on his website are a lot higher, and they're still great deals. This is for my
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:50.920]  audience. Ted, can you run this through Sunday? Yeah, we're going to run it right straight through
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:55.800]  Sunday. And you've got to remember that Federal Reserve raising the interest rates was to shore
[3:15:55.800 --> 3:16:00.280]  up the value of the US dollar, and gold's going up anyways. That should be a tell-tale sign for
[3:16:00.280 --> 3:16:09.240]  people to be getting into gold. 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. Brokers will be there until
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:13.880]  about 10 tonight, central. There'll be some of them there on the weekend. If they don't answer,
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:17.880]  leave your name and number. You'll still be able to get the deal on Monday if you got your call in
[3:16:17.880 --> 3:16:27.640]  by Sunday evening, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, and get that free copy international forecaster
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:31.960]  and get the gold at a cheaper price, or go to the internationalforecaster.com and pay for it.
[3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:35.000]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for spending time with us. We'll see you next Friday.
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:40.840]  Surely, and thank you all for listening. Ted Anderson, again, one more time. Explain to
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:46.440]  people the deal they're getting here. Yeah, it's a frank coin. It's the coin that was used in Europe
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:52.920]  for trading. It's out of Belgium. Switzerland had them. The French had them. It's a one-fifth
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:59.960]  of an ounce gold coin. Right now, it's at $249. Bob Chapman's newslet is $159. If you take $249
[3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:05.720]  and you multiply it by five and you subtract the $159 from that, you're going to find about $480
[3:17:05.720 --> 3:17:11.080]  gold. I don't know how I can make it easier for you to buy gold and also give yourself an education
[3:17:11.080 --> 3:17:15.640]  at the same time. Hopefully, you'll be able to make some smart decisions about your money,
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:21.080]  because I can tell you right now, there's way too many cracks in the plaster. The United States is
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:26.040]  way too far into debt. The European countries right now, obviously, are falling apart,
[3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:31.000]  and for some reason, they think they can bail each other out. The United States can't bail out.
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:36.280]  Europe can't even bail ourselves out. And they're devaluing currency simultaneously,
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:41.880]  $800, $686, $2.37. Ted, thanks for joining us. Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:46.360]  Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to now move to your calls quickly. Please throw out your question,
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:50.040]  your comment, and move the next person. In the last 15, 20 minutes, I'm going to have Rob do in
[3:17:50.040 --> 3:17:55.160]  here. He knew and was in an off and on with different bands with Joe Stack. It turned out,
[3:17:55.160 --> 3:18:00.120]  supposedly played with Joe Ealy and all these other big Austin is, I mean, Rob do says he was
[3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:05.720]  an incredible musician, very quiet, didn't talk about politics. We'll talk to him in studio.
[3:18:05.720 --> 3:18:08.760]  Let's go to Ron in Texas. Ron, thanks for holding.
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:13.720]  Oh, no problem, Alex. I appreciate you letting me take the call. I just want to be real quick
[3:18:13.720 --> 3:18:19.640]  and say that today on Fox News, they had another interview with another band member that Mr.
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:24.600]  Stacks played with. And he basically said the same thing that Mr. Dew said yesterday,
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:29.400]  that this guy was a real intelligent, was very squared away individual, you know,
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:36.680]  he was basically baffled at what happened. You could, if he was able to go back and see the
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:41.720]  report yourself, you clearly see that the reporter was trying to get something more out of him,
[3:18:41.720 --> 3:18:47.560]  other than what, you know, the individual was saying. And after reading that into Mr. Stacks,
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:51.640]  I don't want to call it a manifesto because it doesn't sound like one to me. It sounds more like
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:59.320]  a personal vent of his frustrations. It shows his intelligence. He's just frustrated or was
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:05.000]  frustrated. And I think what we're seeing is a change in tactic as far as, you know,
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:11.240]  like some people label Psyops, it's where an individual actually does something on their own,
[3:19:12.040 --> 3:19:18.840]  but yet the higher echelons of, you know, lack of a better term to enemy will let it play out
[3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:21.880]  and let people react to it in a way they want to see it.
[3:19:24.280 --> 3:19:28.200]  Very well said. That's probably what's going on here. Though there's a lot of others,
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:33.880]  very suspicious signs. So the jury is going to be out for a while as we study it early on. It was
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:38.920]  clear the underwear bomber was inside job. Now it's 100%. By the way, we have video has never
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:44.120]  been seen of Joe Stack that Rob do went home and dug out last night. Now we've cropped the video
[3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:47.240]  to leave the other band members out. We're not going to play the music. We're going to show you
[3:19:47.240 --> 3:19:52.360]  some video with Joe Stack here. Nobody's ever seen coming up at prisonplanet.tv. If you're a
[3:19:52.360 --> 3:19:57.400]  prisonplanet.tv viewer, of course, it'll be all over the web after that. But that's coming up.
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:03.640]  We're going to talk to Jennifer, Fred, Dan and others straight ahead. Great call run hounded by
[3:20:03.640 --> 3:20:08.840]  debt collectors with phone calls and letters thinking of calling a debt relief company.

[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:13.000]  century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:17.800]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. They've turned a tremendous
[3:21:17.800 --> 3:21:24.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[3:21:24.040 --> 3:21:29.960]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the
[3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:36.120]  enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[3:21:36.120 --> 3:21:41.080]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:45.720]  more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[3:21:45.720 --> 3:21:52.600]  does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy

[3:24:01.640 --> 3:24:12.760]  Oh, Sheriff John Brown.
[3:24:31.880 --> 3:24:42.200]  Let's go to your calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:47.960]  Let's talk to Jennifer in Texas. You're on the air.
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:51.640]  Hello, Alex. Welcome. Thanks for taking my call.
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:56.520]  Thanks for calling. I just wanted to make some quick comments. I'll try to make it quick.
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:25:02.920]  Beck has made himself irrelevant. And the 500,000 years that he has lost, probably half of those
[3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:08.600]  are Texans because we're angry about him attacking Deborah Medina. I'm on the fence like you are
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:14.120]  with this man yesterday that flew this plane in this building. Although I don't condone what he did,
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:19.480]  I can sympathize with him. If I had more time, if I even had an hour, I could tell you some very
[3:25:19.480 --> 3:25:24.200]  harrowing stories of what me and my husband had been through for the last 11 years. And if someone
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:29.240]  wants what you have and they don't want to take it legally, they'll do it illegally in any way,
[3:25:30.200 --> 3:25:32.680]  you know, form or fashion or anything. And I just wanted to tell your list.
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:38.760]  Hey, with my dad, with the 89 retroactive tax increase, he paid all the taxes, had a CPA,
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:44.520]  and they came to him and said, we want $500,000. And that was a lot more money than he had and
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:50.200]  sold our cars, everything. I mean, I mean, they're, and my dad went in with all the receipts and
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:54.760]  everything. And they said, look, Mr. Jones, and this happened in Mesquite, Texas. They said,
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:01.000]  we are white collar criminals. Give us the money. And they are criminals. And it's an illegal tax
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:07.640]  of the federal reserve. Believe me, I know about the IRS. It's disgusting. We stayed up on our taxes.
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:13.080]  Our problem is we've got land. My dad did too. They did a retroactive tax increase and then put
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:17.640]  penalties on it. Oh yeah, that's been happening to us. And I just want to tell your listeners though
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:22.360]  that tyranny does not happen just at the federal and state levels. It happens at the local level.
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:26.520]  And that's what's been happening to me and my husband for the last 11 years. And these people
[3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:31.560]  in this town want this little jewel of a piece of land that we have, that they don't want to buy
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:35.320]  it outright because we're not going to sell it in the first place. They want to take it illegally
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:39.560]  and they have done everything in their power to take it away from us. And we are still going through
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:44.040]  this. We still have stuff coming up on our TV. For God's sakes, we don't know where it's coming
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:49.960]  from. That even a best front of ours that lives in Delport work area, that has sold these TVs
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:54.360]  for years, even expert on these, can't tell us what this stuff is coming up on our TV. Now I'm
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:26:59.080]  not saying our television is bugged, but I'm saying our television is picking up. Are you kidding?
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:03.480]  It came out. It came out. Public schools are using the quote free laptops they give kids
[3:27:03.480 --> 3:27:07.720]  to use the spy cams to spy on them and read everything they're writing. No, everything's
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:11.800]  a surveillance grid. I appreciate your call, Jennifer. Fred Main, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:17.000]  Yeah, I'll expect you to pick up my call. I just wanted you and all your listeners to be aware
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:21.720]  of the fact that there's a historic press conference happening right now in San Francisco.
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:29.880]  And I'm one of 1,041 architects and engineers and 6,600 other people whose son Richard Gage
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:35.400]  is petitioned demanding of Congress a truly independent investigation with full subpoena
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:42.680]  powers on the 9-11 day. Well, that's wonderful. I mean, that's wonderful, Fred. And we've
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:46.280]  plugged it. We've supported it. We've had Richard Gage on many times. And yes,
[3:27:46.280 --> 3:27:51.000]  9-11 truth is only growing stronger and stronger. Good to hear from you. Let's talk to Dan
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:57.880]  in Pennsylvania. Dan, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. Yeah, this is what is it? Last night,
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:05.480]  I listened to Kayden Kirk on the CBS Evening News, and she had mentioned that, like in passing, that
[3:28:06.200 --> 3:28:11.400]  the mother and the daughter, they had been in a hotel room when all of this had happened,
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:17.000]  when yesterday while I was watching your show on the commercials, I was watching MSNBC,
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:23.560]  and the gentleman in the brown jacket had said that a neighbor went into the house
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:29.640]  and got the mother and the daughter out. And also, one other question just for Bob,
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:35.080]  what does it mean with the Goldman Sachs guy that is taking over in Greece?
[3:28:36.680 --> 3:28:40.920]  Well, Bob's gone now, but it's come out in mainstream news what Bob said a decade ago.
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:45.720]  Goldman Sachs set up double books all over Europe. They ran the scam here. It's not that
[3:28:45.720 --> 3:28:49.960]  they own the whole scam. It's other big banks involved. They're the little criminal group they
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:56.760]  chose to coordinate it, kind of like Enron and all these other crooks had Arthur Anderson
[3:28:56.760 --> 3:29:03.480]  cook their books. It's like they were the go-to for that. The piloting group of the criminal gang
[3:29:03.480 --> 3:29:08.120]  is mainly Goldman Sachs. And so that's what's happening there. Yeah, I just thought I'd mention
[3:29:08.120 --> 3:29:12.280]  also the fact of that, of the mother and the daughter, because there seems to be conflicting
[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:18.440]  stories happening there. The whole thing is incredibly suspicious. And what's happening is,
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:23.320]  because a lot of people somewhat agree with what he did because people are ready to fight.
[3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:27.960]  I think that's clouding some people's judgment and saying, no, it's not a false flag.
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:33.080]  We don't know that. We're still collating data. There's a lot of signs that say false flag,
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:37.800]  a lot of signs that say it isn't, you know, it could be a false flag, but it didn't go the way
[3:29:37.800 --> 3:29:42.280]  the media wanted. So they may be backing off of it now. But the fact that they are backing off of it,
[3:29:43.160 --> 3:29:47.320]  that could also mean that it is a real event because if it's a real event, they don't hype it.
[3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:51.880]  That's always a key sign. More calls straight ahead than Rob do in studio.
[3:30:04.200 --> 3:30:08.360]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:30:08.360 --> 3:30:13.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:16.840]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:30:16.840 --> 3:30:20.360]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:25.640]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:30:25.640 --> 3:30:31.240]  as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:30:31.240 --> 3:30:37.640]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:41.960]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[3:30:41.960 --> 3:30:44.520]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:30:44.520 --> 3:30:51.720]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:31:14.280 --> 3:31:17.320]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.

[3:32:02.120 --> 3:32:07.640]  Hi, neighbor. No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply,
[3:32:07.640 --> 3:32:12.360]  every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets. Even those who haven't wasted a
[3:32:12.360 --> 3:32:17.720]  single penny on Christmas birthdays and vacations in order to store all the food possible. Even
[3:32:17.720 --> 3:32:22.760]  those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food. Even those who have traded their
[3:32:22.760 --> 3:32:29.240]  gold while it will still buy food. Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[3:32:29.240 --> 3:32:33.880]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[3:32:34.440 --> 3:32:40.200]  We will still have two regrets. We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:46.120]  sooner. We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food. Putting off emergency food
[3:32:46.120 --> 3:32:54.280]  preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make. Call 800-409-5633
[3:32:54.280 --> 3:33:00.680]  on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:38.680]  I'm gonna let me take you down to your knees. So who are you? Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you?
[3:33:38.680 --> 3:33:41.800]  Yeah, we are live.
[3:33:44.680 --> 3:33:48.280]  Rob Duesen here with us at studio right now. I'm gonna go back to some of your phone calls
[3:33:48.280 --> 3:33:55.560]  and we've got this world exclusive video of him playing in multiple local bands. Rob shot this
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:34:01.160]  a few years ago. Rob knew Joe Stack and didn't hit him till yesterday when they just left his house
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:04.600]  and he got back and saw finally his photo and he said he, because you said you were driving back
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:09.400]  saying I know Joe Stack. I know what Joe Stack was in another state I lived and then it all hits you
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:14.280]  because it's Austin's a big size city but the musician community is like a small town. Everybody
[3:34:14.280 --> 3:34:20.440]  knows each other. He knew him well. They weren't in the same band but Joe did back up in some bands
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:23.720]  and it turns out he played for Joe Ealy and a bunch of other people I'm seeing in the news now.
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:31.320]  So meanwhile I have a whole bunch of mainstream news articles. The statesman saying I'm praising him.
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:38.440]  Not true. Daily news saying it. Look at this headline. Does Austin playing crash pilots
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:43.720]  rambling suicide notes sound like Alex Jones manifesto? So you can always see who the enemy is.
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:47.960]  Some guy kills a cop in Pennsylvania. They say he did it for me and they get his actual emails.
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:52.440]  I hate Alex Jones. I want to get him. I mean they're after me and I wonder why but it's not
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:57.800]  going to work. It's like the old song. I got one more silver dollar and they're not going to catch
[3:34:57.800 --> 3:35:02.360]  me. Now they're not going to get me the midnight rider. Let's jam in some more calls here. Frank
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:07.560]  in North Carolina. You're on the air Frank. Go ahead. Thank you Alex. It's an honor. I just
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:13.400]  wanted to plug a movie real quick. It's a mainstream movie out right now. It's Edge of Darkness.
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:19.000]  Mel Gibson's new movie. Haven't seen it. It's very good. It's the first movie I've seen since
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:24.280]  that movie that Truth or Movie Shooter came out in 2007 with Mark Wahlberg. What's it about?
[3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:30.680]  I mean does it have a patriot message? Yes. It's basically a cautionary tale.
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:39.480]  Mel Gibson plays the role of a Boston, just a regular detective and his daughter basically
[3:35:39.480 --> 3:35:45.080]  gets assassinated and he mistakes that everyone thinks that it was some old enemy of his that
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:49.560]  was trying to take him out. He starts investigating and during the course of investigating going
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:55.000]  through her things and what not he finds out that she was an activist. And it gets really
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:36:00.200]  interesting. It's got some Truth or Elements in there, black op elements, all that kind of
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:04.680]  shattery. Yeah well we know Mel Gibson knows all about the New World Order and I'll just leave it
[3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:10.760]  at that. But I mean he's definitely on board and knows what's going on on every front. I appreciate
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:14.920]  your call. I'm going to go see that. I just work all the time. I got two, three hours a day off.
[3:36:14.920 --> 3:36:19.800]  I go play with my kids, throw the football, watch them ride their scooters and their little push
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:24.600]  scooters and then that's it. I mean it goes take my grandma out to eat once every two weeks and
[3:36:24.600 --> 3:36:30.440]  there is no life literally. But all work and play hadn't made Jack a dull boy. It's made me crazy.
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:35.560]  Let's talk to Dennis in Texas. Dennis, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:42.520]  Alex, thank you for having me on the show. I voted for Deborah Medina today so I feel like
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:47.880]  I've struck a blow for liberty. That's right, early voting running for the next two weeks.
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:53.480]  Yes, people ought to get out and do that. It's well worth it. You avoid all the lines.
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:37:00.280]  Alex, you're a patriot. Mr. Trafficant is a statesman. Bob Chapman is America's muse.
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:06.680]  I'd also like to say that Red Beckman woke me up. I heard him on your program
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:14.200]  a couple weeks ago now and ordered the books. Everybody's wondering what they can do
[3:37:14.200 --> 3:37:20.920]  short of revolution and short of utilizing the Second Amendment. The mainstream media
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:25.720]  is definitely afraid that the citizenry is going to realize...
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:29.240]  They're afraid we're going to take over? Yeah, that we're the boss. That we're going to take
[3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:34.440]  over the state houses legally, take over the juries, grand juries. That's all this show is
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:39.160]  about is solutions. That's why the Co- and Tell Pro have this line that I don't give solutions.
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:45.160]  All we give is solutions. All we bring you is guests that are about solutions and give them
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:54.200]  a bigger platform. Yes, and the IRS can be defeated by the citizenry using their three votes.
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:38:01.800]  Vote at the ballot box, vote as part of the grand jury, and vote as part of the jury
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:11.000]  pettit. And the IRS cannot overturn a not guilty vote. We can defeat the income tax
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:17.880]  and all taxes and all laws that are unjust by simply being Americans.
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:22.120]  And that's the Founding Fathers? Are we with the Founding Fathers of the New World Order?
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:26.040]  Let's take a few more. Thank you. Let's talk to James in Minnesota. James, you're on the air.
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:35.720]  Hello? Yes, sir. Hi, my name is James Caterford, Minnesota. I just want to say thanks for letting
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:42.360]  me be on your show real quick. And second, just to talk to you briefly, I'm a former military vet
[3:38:42.360 --> 3:38:49.560]  myself. I just got out less than a year ago. And I feel bad for a lot of these guys that come back
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:55.640]  all torn up, and the government don't stick by us or nothing like that. So I just want to say
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:38:59.400]  thank you for opening up my eyes. I mean, I already knew that they were crooked as a
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:06.120]  three-legged door anyway, but I want to say thank you for opening up my eyes to more and
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:11.320]  plus see if there's any way that I can, what I could do here in Minnesota to spread the word.
[3:39:11.880 --> 3:39:16.360]  Every person, well, the best thing is my films. Get the DVDs, make copies. We found that as the
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:21.160]  most effective. Follow the Republic, Obama Deception, the free MP3s of this show,
[3:39:21.160 --> 3:39:25.320]  sending people to infowars.com. I mean, they're going to hear a wide spectrum breakdown of the
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:30.280]  New World Order and solutions here. I mean, let me ask you, how did you wake up? You say I woke
[3:39:30.280 --> 3:39:34.840]  you up fully. You already knew something was wrong. How did you find the show? This is actually
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:42.040]  really funny. About three months after I got out, I was working at a target in Rochester,
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:47.960]  and a friend of mine came up to me. And she's like, you know, one of my buddies came up and said,
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:51.480]  oh, don't talk to her. She's a conspiracy theorist and this and that. And I'm like,
[3:39:51.480 --> 3:39:56.120]  well, you know what? She's right up my alley. So I went over there and I talked to her a little
[3:39:56.120 --> 3:40:02.120]  bit and she handed me your DVDs. And I was like, wow. And then I got a couple of my buddies, you
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:07.960]  know, they've watched it and I just watched their mouths just drop. Well, when I say that
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:12.920]  Obama Deception and fall the Republican in game are devastating truth weapons. I mean,
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:17.720]  the truth is powerful. It trumps everything. And these films give you a full spectrum breakdown.
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:22.120]  It's the truth. It's in the globalist own words, their own documents. See, I said,
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:26.840]  you said, how do I help? Well, she woke you up. You then woke your buddies up. It's not going to
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:32.040]  be an instant war. We win. It's slow one foot in front of the other. I'm getting chills right now.
[3:40:32.040 --> 3:40:41.640]  Never stopping. And then I just got big chills having the will to have the enemy crush you
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:44.520]  because here's the deal. I'm a big fish and they've tried to crush me and hadn't worked,
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:49.080]  but they probably will. But I just am happy for this to happen because it doesn't matter.
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:53.480]  I've already done my damage to them. You have to be fully committed and not care and be confident
[3:40:53.480 --> 3:40:57.560]  and focused and have the truth and it's over. God bless you. Good to hear from you, James, in
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:03.640]  Minnesota. Bob, Dave, Jerry, Moses, I want to get to you, but I've got and we probably will,
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:11.320]  but I've got to go to Rob do right now because I did a special transmission from 530 to 630
[3:41:11.320 --> 3:41:16.040]  or 530 to 640 last night. That's just on the internet streams and prisonplanet.tv and that's
[3:41:16.040 --> 3:41:22.040]  all posted up at prisonplanet.tv because as I was about to go live, he or as I was live,
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:25.000]  you ran in and said, I knew this guy. You hadn't put two and two together because you worked with
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:30.680]  so many musicians. So just in a nutshell, what type of guy was he? Do you think he was capable
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:37.080]  of this? What do you think's going on here? And then we're going to show some video
[3:41:37.080 --> 3:41:41.880]  and we'll talk over because it doesn't have audio because we're not going to play the band's music
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:49.800]  here because but but break this down how you met this guy and what your gut tells you what's going
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:56.440]  on. All right. I had a neighbor who was a musician. He was a little older than me. He's playing like
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:02.360]  an older style kind of blues country rock and so I would go in and sit in playing bass because he,
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:07.640]  you know, always needed a bass player and Joe Stack was in his band and in different versions
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:11.960]  of the band. One that was I got to stop you. I guess we didn't test the video. It's crashing in
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:18.120]  there. It's not playing. So what other formats do you have of it? So we can, I guess we didn't
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:23.960]  test it. Oh, well, I brought it on a DVD and I just so the DVD doesn't play.
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:34.040]  I'll just turn the mic on. I can hear you. No, I know, but if the DVD isn't working,
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:37.640]  we'll just, we'll just want, if they pull it on the hard drive, it should work. So sometimes
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:41.960]  DVDs, when it's a, it's, it was not a DVD file was an actual quick time file. So if you pull that
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:48.440]  on the hard drive, it should work. But tell you what, I'm going to go out there and deal with
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:55.240]  this. You go ahead and tell folks about Joe Stack. Okay. I met Joe a few years ago. This is in the
[3:42:55.240 --> 3:43:02.520]  mid 2000s. I was, um, you know, playing bass with a neighbor and, um, and Joe was in the band. I kind
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:08.920]  of sat in, in with the band several, several times. And so I got to know Joe and, and practices and
[3:43:08.920 --> 3:43:17.480]  playing gigs. And he was a very mild manner guy, a very clean cut guy when by South Austin
[3:43:17.480 --> 3:43:24.520]  standards, South Austin people, you know, usually are a little more a rag tag type group, um, you
[3:43:24.520 --> 3:43:30.280]  know, longer hair and stuff. And Joe, you know, always button up shirt, clean hair and, you know,
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:35.880]  glasses and a real smart guy. He was, uh, you know, a software engineer. And I knew he had been doing
[3:43:35.880 --> 3:43:40.840]  some software work and I knew he was a pilot as well. And, you know, just somebody who really
[3:43:40.840 --> 3:43:46.600]  seemed to have it together when you, uh, when you look at, you know, when you look at different
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:49.960]  people, you know, some people don't look like they have their stuff together. Well, Joe always
[3:43:49.960 --> 3:43:57.320]  looked like he had his stuff together and that's, um, I was kind of shocked when I first heard, um,
[3:43:57.320 --> 3:44:01.560]  you know, when I put two and two together, like this is the Joe stack that I knew I was, I was
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:06.600]  really shocked because I didn't think this guy would ever do anything like this. I mean, it's
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:12.120]  really at a character, um, for him. And I mean, I think we just need to start asking the questions,
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:16.680]  especially, you know, what, what would drive somebody to do something like this? If, if he is
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:21.400]  indeed, you know, the, the lone wolf type, what would make him, what would put some push somebody
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:27.080]  to the brink to do this? Well, everybody's saying that, uh, he was an amazing musician and we, and
[3:44:27.080 --> 3:44:31.080]  we did get the video working. It was working fine. And then as soon as we went live, it would play.
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:34.840]  But thanks for getting that ready. Uh, but other musician friends of his around the news,
[3:44:34.840 --> 3:44:42.360]  there's other video of him, uh, at, uh, events. Uh, but again, everybody is going with the line.
[3:44:42.360 --> 3:44:47.320]  Oh, he did this on purpose. Uh, we've seen so many false flags. If a government's done false
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:51.720]  flags over and over again, and caught doing it, we have to investigate this as a possible false
[3:44:51.720 --> 3:44:57.480]  flag. It is being blamed on the tea parties and Alex Jones. Right. Well, I got, I've been looking
[3:44:57.480 --> 3:45:02.680]  at stuff on this all morning. There's some video out there, the same girl who talks about the hazmat
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:07.480]  vehicles and the fire trucks being right nearby. She also says she was close enough,
[3:45:07.480 --> 3:45:11.320]  she didn't see a pilot and she was close enough to where she could have seen a pilot.
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:16.600]  And she says it on one of these, uh, CNN, uh, CNN clip that I sent to, uh, Matt,
[3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:19.960]  and they had technology 50 years ago to remote control a plane. They could have burned his
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:25.080]  house down, killed him, stuck him in the plane or buried him somewhere. Some people are saying,
[3:45:25.080 --> 3:45:30.760]  maybe he staged his death. You know, Northwood says they have CIA agents get on board an aircraft
[3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:36.200]  with the same tail numbers and, and, and the same make take it off, land it, take another one off
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:40.600]  that looks similar and blow it up a drone. I mean, we have a government plan to do this
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:45.320]  with airplanes. So we have to look at this. I mean, I think it's very important to ask
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:50.360]  the questions and look and definitely find out, you know, what, you know, how the IRS was
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:55.480]  investigating this guy. And at least, you know, looking to that, I got a couple, uh, tips today.
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:46:02.280]  Uh, one guy said that, uh, apparently one of his neighbors right adjacent to him is in, uh,
[3:46:02.280 --> 3:46:07.160]  as an IRS employee who actually worked in that building that I don't, that's not,
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:10.680]  not confirmed, but we got sent that this way. Now you went out to his house. Yeah. Well,
[3:46:10.680 --> 3:46:13.960]  I mean, anything else about Joe stacked them and what would you talk to him about? I mean,
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:17.800]  we always talked music and, and we never, I didn't get too personal with him other than,
[3:46:17.800 --> 3:46:22.280]  you know, general stuff, but he was always there, always on time and always happy. I always saw him,
[3:46:22.280 --> 3:46:25.720]  you know, he was, he was, you know, serious when he's playing cause you're really concentrating,
[3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:31.000]  but afterwards he was smiling. He didn't really drink or smoke or do any, anything like that.
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:36.760]  He was just a, he just seemed to be a pretty clean guy who was really smart, very precise,
[3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:41.400]  totally squared away. Yeah. He looks very focused. I mean, he looks intelligent. Yeah,
[3:46:41.400 --> 3:46:45.800]  he was very intelligent. I, we actually played a few of his, his own compositions that he wrote
[3:46:45.800 --> 3:46:49.560]  and they were, you know, they weren't easy. They're pretty difficult. They're kind of jazz,
[3:46:49.560 --> 3:46:53.800]  rock type stuff, which seemed to be the vein of music. He really liked playing was sort of a
[3:46:53.800 --> 3:46:58.520]  jazz rock. You know, he liked the upbeat stuff, but with, you know, more interesting chords in
[3:46:58.520 --> 3:47:03.160]  which you would find an oblique. What were his favorite bands? Well, I know he liked, he was a
[3:47:03.160 --> 3:47:09.720]  big Steely Dan fan cause we actually played a few Steely Dan songs and, you know, that's one band
[3:47:09.720 --> 3:47:13.960]  that I can bring off the top of my head. I can't remember any other bands offhand, but, you know,
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:19.000]  he was all, you know, he'd bring in these huge, he wasn't a tall guy. He was a, you know, kind of
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:23.960]  short compared to me, but he was carrying in these huge pianos all the time for practice. He'd walk
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:28.280]  in with them and drop them down and get his stuff set up, you know, and, you know, talking the whole
[3:47:28.280 --> 3:47:34.120]  time while he was doing it. And just, you know, never, I never saw him get angry at anybody. If,
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:38.200]  if we had disagreements with something, you know, in terms of like a song, you know,
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:41.400]  we just sit and talk about it. And you never heard him talk bad about the government.
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:45.560]  I never, you know, I never heard him get political. The band wasn't, they weren't really,
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:49.640]  they were older guys with kids and they were more just, you know, trying to put bread on the table.
[3:47:49.640 --> 3:47:54.520]  How long ago did you know him? I think I met him in the mid 2000s and I probably,
[3:47:54.520 --> 3:48:01.000]  I haven't seen him in about at least a year, maybe two years. But, you know, I've talked to people
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:05.880]  who had seen him, you know, a couple of weeks ago and said he was, you know, he was fine. They were
[3:48:05.880 --> 3:48:10.680]  working on recording sessions together. So that it's really sad that in that short amount of time,
[3:48:10.680 --> 3:48:16.040]  you know, a guy could get pushed like that to the brink. If that's, you know, what happened. And,
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:21.160]  you know, I don't know if we'll probably never know what the IRS knows because they're probably
[3:48:21.160 --> 3:48:24.920]  not going to divulge there. And you shot this video. We were just watching. Yeah. That was shot
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:33.160]  in 2007. So that was about three years ago. What bar was that? I think it was called the Moon
[3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:39.880]  River Bar. It was out, it's outside of Austin near Lake Travis. So in, and you know, the green
[3:48:39.880 --> 3:48:43.080]  lights on them, we were setting up lights. They had no lights there. So me and my brother were
[3:48:43.080 --> 3:48:46.840]  shooting the video and we set up a bunch of lights. So, you know, they would look, you know, like,
[3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:52.440]  could you play in one band with him or multiple? It was just one band that I would sub on bass
[3:48:52.440 --> 3:48:55.960]  for. And he was the main keyboard player there. But, you know, he also played bass. He was a
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:01.400]  real good bass player and he played bass in several bands. I know that. And someone, I never knew
[3:49:01.400 --> 3:49:05.480]  he played accordion, but apparently he was an accordion player too, which doesn't surprise me.
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:10.040]  The guy was, you know, multi-talented. He was a real smart guy. And he was also, importantly,
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:15.960]  a really good pilot and flew a lot. Yeah. Yeah. He flew bands around. He had that, that plane
[3:49:16.680 --> 3:49:21.960]  for many years, I think before he moved to Austin and the guy that was the band leader,
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:25.800]  the band I was in, he said, you know, we've, I've flown in that plane, you know, down to
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:34.360]  San Antonio. So, you know, a nice guy. I can't believe I'm really in shock. And I was really
[3:49:34.360 --> 3:49:38.920]  in shock yesterday when I pulled it up because I knew, I knew a Joe Stack and I'm, but everybody was
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:43.560]  saying Andrew Joe Stack. So you're thinking Andrew Stack the whole time. And I'm asking people out
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:46.280]  at his, in his neighborhood, you know, did you know this guy? Did you know this guy? Well, it
[3:49:46.280 --> 3:49:49.960]  turns out I know that, you know, I knew the guy. And it turned out though, the neighbors were like,
[3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:53.000]  we would have talked to you, but we've made a commitment not to talk now. Right. There was
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:57.960]  one neighbor that did not want, he said he was morally and ethically obligated not to talk to us.
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:02.040]  And here, here's something else that's interesting. Another guy who works,
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:07.400]  um, I worked for the IRS in Austin. He said, uh, they had a guy from DC come in and was talking
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:11.880]  about, he, they kept calling it an accident when, and the several, the employees corrected him,
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:15.560]  you know, cause you know, they were disturbed in him calling it an accident. And afterwards,
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:19.160]  he made a comment that there were no warning and how these fringe groups, groups couldn't be
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:25.000]  predicted. And then he said the day before at 9 30 AM, he heard some top level local management
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:30.120]  in the building discussing possible shelter in place. That's all he mentions. This is definitely
[3:50:30.120 --> 3:50:33.800]  a guy we ought to talk to. Wait a minute. In that same building, they're talking about sheltering
[3:50:33.800 --> 3:50:38.040]  in place the day before. Yeah. And now he doesn't say it was the exact same building. So I'm going
[3:50:38.040 --> 3:50:41.800]  to confirm this is something we need. And then the sourcing to know, right? We're not going to
[3:50:41.800 --> 3:50:46.600]  say who they are. And again, we have a comment line, uh, that people can call us at, uh,
[3:50:47.320 --> 3:50:51.640]  five, one, two, six, four, six, four, four, four, four. It's only a one minute message. Leave
[3:50:51.640 --> 3:50:57.160]  your name, a number, a brief, only serious calls. And we'll have more for you on Sunday,
[3:50:57.160 --> 3:51:01.960]  four to six PM. And then obviously, uh, back on Monday, but we're going to come back with more

[3:51:43.160 --> 3:51:47.000]  always Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:50.840]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a

[3:52:15.960 --> 3:52:22.120]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:28.440]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:28.440 --> 3:52:33.880]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[3:52:33.880 --> 3:52:38.520]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:38.520 --> 3:52:43.640]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[3:52:43.640 --> 3:52:48.280]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[3:52:48.280 --> 3:52:55.320]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:18.840]  you want to add in this small world? You turned out to know Joe Stack. Everything I've heard about
[3:55:18.840 --> 3:55:24.120]  him and conflicting stories from the family and all this weirdness. My gut tells me there's
[3:55:24.120 --> 3:55:28.520]  some hanky-panky going on here. I'm not quite sure. And now this IRS letter, all these calls,
[3:55:28.520 --> 3:55:33.320]  witnesses, the TV news, them being in place beforehand, sheltering in place, all this.
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:39.160]  It looks like it was written for people that want to have war to go, yeah, let's go and maybe try
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:43.560]  to start something. I'm not sure about that, but I've been saying Austin's going to be the target,
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:51.320]  haven't I? One thing will be interesting is to find out when the, exactly when the fire department
[3:55:51.320 --> 3:55:58.920]  was called for this fire, because he apparently drove from his house about 25 miles north to the
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:04.760]  airport to pick up during rush hour traffic. North Austin's locked up. It's horrible in,
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:09.160]  you know, anywhere in Austin, pretty much on the highways. So unless he had some, you know,
[3:56:09.160 --> 3:56:15.080]  I, I can't see him getting there that quickly, but you know, we say the fire started at,
[3:56:15.080 --> 3:56:20.440]  right at about nine. So he gets from North Austin to Georgetown 25 miles away in horrible traffic.
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:24.600]  But I talked to my uncle, who's a pilot. He said from that, from Georgetown to that North
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:29.960]  Austin, six minutes in that Piper, once he got it up. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So he could have done it.
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:34.520]  Now, and, and I talked to a neighbor that said she left her house at eight 45 in the morning,
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:38.280]  and apparently the fire was going then, although she didn't see it. And by the time she got to
[3:56:38.280 --> 3:56:41.160]  work, her, you know, cell phone was going nuts. You know, people calling her saying,
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:44.600]  there's a fire in your neighborhood. There's a fire in your neighborhood. Oh, so others have
[3:56:44.600 --> 3:56:49.160]  set around nine. Yeah. She, she said she went to work at eight 45 that morning and she didn't see
[3:56:49.160 --> 3:56:53.720]  it. Well, why would the family already be out of the house? Yeah. Why were, why were the police
[3:56:53.720 --> 3:56:59.480]  not called? I don't know that from things I've read, they were, I've heard some reports is some
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:04.600]  guy, a neighbor helped them out of the house. Another report was that they were at a hotel
[3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:09.480]  the night before and came home and found it that way. So, uh, you know, I think a lot will come out
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:14.440]  when, when they interview, um, interviews, wife, I wonder why the cops would tell the neighbors
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:19.320]  not to talk to people. That's very, because you think they would, you know, let them be open
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:23.720]  to the press. And some people did talk to the press, but the one guy that who was really,
[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:28.120]  you know, sharp, sharply dressed, let's just go ahead and use that term. Uh, didn't want to talk
[3:57:28.120 --> 3:57:33.640]  to us. And he was a younger guy. So, um, you know, that'll be, uh, that'll be interesting to see,
[3:57:33.640 --> 3:57:37.480]  you know, if he talks to anybody in the future, I remember what he looks like. And, uh, so we'll
[3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:41.560]  be able to know, but the neighbors around him seem to be, you know, older. There was the
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:47.080]  one younger lady that I talked to that left at eight 45 that morning. Um, but, you know, the
[3:57:47.080 --> 3:57:51.160]  real, you know, the real victims, in addition to the people that were in the building, you know,
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:55.960]  he's, he's left behind a wife and daughter, a stepdaughter, I guess. And then he's got, um,
[3:57:56.600 --> 3:58:02.920]  you know, he's got a daughter in Norway. So, you know, I've put my heart and prayers out to them.
[3:58:02.920 --> 3:58:06.680]  And, uh, you know, I hope somebody, uh, can maybe put some, and I've seen different numbers,
[3:58:06.680 --> 3:58:11.240]  one person missing, including him and then two injured or did he kill anybody?
[3:58:11.800 --> 3:58:16.360]  I think they did pull out one, two bodies total. They think it's one's his and one is somebody
[3:58:16.360 --> 3:58:21.560]  who they haven't identified yet. So that, that'll be interesting to see, you know, who that I,
[3:58:21.560 --> 3:58:24.680]  the identity of that person. Well, you said reporters on the scene though, we're going,
[3:58:24.680 --> 3:58:29.880]  how did the police know so much so soon? That's also suspicious, but retransmission starts now
[3:58:29.880 --> 3:58:37.240]  with an incredible special guest, James Traficant. This interview was off the charts, powerful
