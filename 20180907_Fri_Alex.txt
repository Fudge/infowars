[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  Another World! Another Time! In the Age of Wonder! Another World! Another Time! His life was created until the present day.
[00:28.000 --> 00:41.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:59.000]  I was in four wars under such attack. Why is it demonized so much by corporate media, by the Republican establishment, by the Democrat establishment, by foreign governments? What is it we're covering? Well, it's that there's a breakaway civilization. That's not just a statement, it's true.
[00:59.000 --> 01:09.000]  Of the military industrial complex controlled by a technological elite, those are quotes from President Eisenhower and his farewell address in 1961.
[01:09.000 --> 01:20.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[01:20.000 --> 01:37.000]  Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.
[01:37.000 --> 01:48.000]  A kin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial military posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades.
[01:48.000 --> 02:05.000]  In this revolution, research has become central. It also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. For every old blackboard, there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.
[02:05.000 --> 02:17.000]  The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
[02:17.000 --> 02:30.000]  A technological elite of eugenicists, that was the big craze up until the end of World War II. They went underground into the U.S. DARPA development system.
[02:30.000 --> 02:40.000]  Most of them were pro-Hitler, the others were pro-communist. They all believed in command and control, centralization by elites because they're the elites.
[02:40.000 --> 02:52.000]  And they've now established much of a world government that's based on austerity and based on racial division and based on balkanization and based on divide and conquer.
[02:52.000 --> 03:08.000]  And so we are coming at it from a position of it's unelected, it's unaccountable, it's corrupt, it doesn't have your interest in mind, it's very, very evil.
[03:08.000 --> 03:16.000]  We should say no to this and people around the world are starting to say no to it. People around the world are starting to understand this.
[03:16.000 --> 03:29.000]  Instead of just being tribal about a football team or a baseball team or even your church, which isn't about Christ, but about the community of the church and most of these things, they're just social clubs.
[03:29.000 --> 03:40.000]  What about the human ethos of renaissance and controlling your own destiny and being free that God really tried to build and give you a chance at?
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  What about that first understanding of free will?
[03:46.000 --> 03:56.000]  And globalism is about a worldwide social credit score, a mark of the beast, where if you don't behave and do what they say, you're basically blocked off from society, you can starve to death.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  You try to live out in the country like the Amos or something, here come the armored vehicles because they say you're a cult.
[04:01.000 --> 04:15.000]  This is manifesting. This is happening. This is the big issue that we face as a civilization and as a society right now.
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.000]  So that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[04:22.000 --> 04:42.000]  It's because you can talk about left-wing or right-wing, you can debate fascism versus anti-fascism, you can debate all this window dressing and all the deck chairs and furniture and silverware and cutlery and plates and China and the food being delivered onto the deck of the Titanic right as it hits that iceberg.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  But you've hit the iceberg. And so the question is, what are you going to do about it?
[04:47.000 --> 04:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live. You've now been completely banned from every major platform and they're moving against thousands of others an hour.
[05:17.000 --> 05:27.000]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[05:33.000 --> 05:44.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.000 --> 06:24.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:24.000 --> 06:38.000]  Well, my friends, just 60 days ahead of this historic midterm election, Twitter completely banned me for bullying and aggressive behavior in Congress.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  George Soros literally owns much of the big telecom stock, the big tech stock.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  He's openly pushing for censorship of myself and thousands of others, which now happened.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  He's been caught through his foundations paying people cash to go in and disrupt the meetings and get arrested.
[06:55.000 --> 07:12.000]  I went in, had a press conference totally dominated, ran into Oliver Darcy of CNN, who admittedly runs the operations interfacing with Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it, to censor myself and thousands of other conservatives,
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.000]  who writes articles calling for them to blacklist me and ban me, who is a thought police general.
[07:19.000 --> 07:37.000]  I confront this monster public figure, a man, and they go and tattle and say he bullied me and the Antifa supporting Twitter that's banning thousands of conservatives a day.
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  Everyone you know has basically been banned, comes out and says we've banned Alex Jones for being a bully.
[07:43.000 --> 07:51.000]  And then they've got quotes in the Associated Press by members of Congress.
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  New Jersey Democrat Rep Frank Pologne praised Twitter's action in a tweet.
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  Glad Twitter is taking steps to put an end to the abusive behavior from Alex Jones and Info Wars.
[08:02.000 --> 08:14.000]  The tweet said, tweets designed to threaten, belittle, demean, and silence individuals have no place on this platform.
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.000]  They are silencing me. They are calling me a white supremacist. They are demonizing this country.
[08:22.000 --> 08:35.000]  They're saying get rid of the American flag and then they turn around and bully us and bully you and then say take him off. He wants to silence people.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  It's the left banning free speech on universities. It's the left doing brainwashing, diversity training and all the big corporations.
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  It's the left and Nike pushing Kaepernick and force feeding that garbage.
[08:45.000 --> 08:54.000]  But the good news is America is rejecting it across the board. White, black, Hispanic, Asian. It doesn't matter. People are seeing through it.
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  And all the polls and all the numbers and all the facts show that the NFL is going straight down.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  Nike is going straight down. Hollywood is going straight down.
[09:03.000 --> 09:13.000]  These big tech corporations stock is starting to go down because people understand just 60 days now that Google and Facebook and Twitter,
[09:13.000 --> 09:35.000]  all over the world are blocking nationalists and patriots and the man in the front running who said in his translation from Spanish and Portuguese and Brazil to Brazil first and God over everything.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  We've got video coming up of him getting brutally stabbed yesterday while he was being carried on the shoulders of a crowd.
[09:44.000 --> 09:57.000]  And they stabbing and then the left and the media in this country and Brazil celebrated it, stabbed him in the liver, stabbed him in the lungs and stabbed him in the kidneys.
[09:57.000 --> 10:09.000]  Vicious. He's fighting for his life right now. Brazil's far right candidate in serious condition.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  There's your violence. That's what's going on and pray for him.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Pray for him to survive. We'll get more into that coming up.
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  But this is what they're trying to ban, ladies and gentlemen, are people standing up to these globalist.
[10:26.000 --> 10:35.000]  And there's a real photo taken in the committee hearing where I'm in the front row right behind Darcy and the media spotted.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Oh, Jones tried to attack Darcy or Jack Dorsey. He bullied him.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  The media is all chasing him out. First, they said, oh, he's already outside. Everybody runs outside.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  I said, I got a feeling he's actually still in here. Boom.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  He comes out and I say, Jack, I hope you really do support the First Amendment.
[10:51.000 --> 10:59.000]  I'm not sure saying you do, but when you put that fake strike on me, I never threatened to use battle rifles on the media.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  So see, everything they've done has been a fraud.
[11:02.000 --> 11:15.000]  And all they were doing was legitimizing getting rid of info wars because Twitter is the worst right now at purging people in mass.
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.000]  What's going on? So I promise Jack Dorsey and everybody else this.
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.000]  We are going to be visiting with you.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  We are going to be coming to your events, your conferences. We're going to have demonstrations.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  I'm going to be coming to the committee hearings and I'm going to be in the third dimension.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  We are going to invade with information and with love and with justice, bringing the truth.
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  And we're going to be exposing big tech and their interference in the election, their violation of Federal Elections Commission laws,
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.000]  their civil rights violations of conservatives and Christians in mass and the organized persecution that we have in your internal documents,
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  that we have thanks to Project Veritas undercover videos and that we've experienced.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Look at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  Media briefed ahead of time.
[12:07.000 --> 12:23.000]  At the exact minute, BuzzFeed, CNN, AP and others all published lengthy articles that I had been banned with their official story in mass that I was a bully.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  They didn't say who I bullied.
[12:25.000 --> 12:35.000]  But later, Oliver Darcy of CNN and BuzzFeed writers all bragged how they had engineered it.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  So there they are coordinating the entire thing and bragging about it in your face.
[12:42.000 --> 12:56.000]  How they coordinate to bully me and deplatform me and call me a white supremacist and stalk me and lie about me and going around harass our sponsors and all of this.
[12:56.000 --> 13:03.000]  And then turn around and say that I did to them what they did to me because like a man, I dared stand up to him.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  There you see it.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  347. When did Twitter announce it?
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  347. When did AP announce it?
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  346.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  They jumped the gun.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  They jumped the gun.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Look at that coordination.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  BuzzFeed, 345.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  Look at the criminal coordination of the New York Times, the Washington Post, all of them together.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  I didn't get told.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  I never got a call.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  I never got an email because I'm a slave.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  I'm a nobody.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  I'm one of those Americans.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  I'm an effing white male.
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.000]  You've got the real alpha males, the real alpha males posing as little liberals.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Oh, we're so sweet.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  Oh, we're so nice.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  But they're the savage killers of free speech.
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  And they're the ones creating race war in this country to control all of us and play us off against each other.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  But AP was the assassin of truth in their article.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  But in the minute and a half clip, they ran in the same story of my press conference.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  They got it right.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  There it is.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  I'm here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  And the Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[14:21.000 --> 14:28.000]  to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  So I want regulations like the First Amendment to be enforced to say you're not going to violate people's free speech.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  You're not going to be able to shut people down like this.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  And I'm also here to face my accusers.
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.000]  This is the 11th hearing they've had where they make up all these incredible lies about me and others to sell the end of the First Amendment.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  It's happening to everybody now who's a libertarian or a conservative.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  The dominoes are falling, the First Amendment's being destroyed, but I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has been off more than it could chew.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  And what you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  But I'll say this, shame on the mainstream corporate media, shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment,
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with Big Tech.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  These big monopolies need to be broken up, and these are digital commons.
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  They've said in their own words and under federal law, and they shouldn't be in there controlling what individuals are saying in those private discussions
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  and in those discussions online if it's not criminal what's being said and what's being done.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  So there you go. That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  That's what I really said, and I was effective.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  And they're saying, I bullied Marco Rubio when he came over to where we were with our cameras.
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  They're saying that I bullied the CNN operative who is the true racketeer by the very definition of the thought police could stop up.
[15:53.000 --> 16:19.000]  No, no, these criminals don't want to be confronted because that's what they are.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  To be part of your security solution, be vigilant, but not fearful.
[16:27.000 --> 16:54.000]  Health care reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the health care system has become a challenge.

[17:41.000 --> 18:00.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They soak pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the-
[18:00.000 --> 18:12.000]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[20:11.000 --> 20:31.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar.
[20:31.000 --> 20:51.000]  Now we see the earth. You got it, you got it.
[20:51.000 --> 21:19.000]  Alright folks, I'm going to get more into the total attack that's taking place on the First Amendment in this country and the organized criminal corporate media.
[21:19.000 --> 21:35.000]  That as a racketeering wall is focused and is integrated towards setting the stage to ban all their competition.
[21:35.000 --> 21:43.000]  Now, this is all being done because the midterms are here. It's all being done because they know the American people have woken up.
[21:43.000 --> 21:51.000]  It's all being done because we have true authoritarianism coming to this country. So it's a lot bigger than infowarstore.com.
[21:51.000 --> 21:59.000]  Everyone I know is being either shadow banned or totally banned off of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and that's over 90% of the internet.
[21:59.000 --> 22:09.000]  Google has delisted anything pro-Trump. It is just getting more and more and more intense by the minute.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  Which shows that these authoritarians will basically do anything and are going for broke.
[22:16.000 --> 22:33.000]  And I have personally, behind the scenes, been experiencing all of this and it's mind blowing.
[22:33.000 --> 22:42.000]  Now, think about infowarstore. We've got hundreds of radio affiliates, hundreds of TV affiliates.
[22:42.000 --> 22:54.000]  And we're still able to reach a lot of people and our information ends up getting out there on these platforms one way or the other.
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  But for the average person that just had a popular Facebook page or Twitter that they spent years promoting, and maybe they have a local radio show,
[23:04.000 --> 23:14.000]  or maybe they're formerly a city council member or they're just a business person, being banned from this is like being put in solitary confinement.
[23:14.000 --> 23:24.000]  And the companies know that, so it's very abusive socially and it's being done to politically control people and make examples of people so others submit
[23:24.000 --> 23:31.000]  so they won't be blacklisted from the global social score that's being brought into place.
[23:31.000 --> 23:43.000]  Now, we were the first to report on this global social score five years ago, but now Facebook and Twitter and Google admit they're doing it and they're allied with China.
[23:43.000 --> 23:52.000]  And Jack Dorsey and all of them, they're talking about how concerned they are about China while they're doing it here in America and Google wouldn't even show up.
[23:52.000 --> 24:02.000]  Google won't even work with the US military now, even though it was founded by DARPA. They won't even, but they'll work with the Chinese military.
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  So these are globalists allied against America and our own government hasn't even figured it out yet.
[24:08.000 --> 24:15.000]  Trump's figured it out. I figured it out. You figured it out.
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  Now, Paul Watson's put out a new hot report on this that we're going to cover when we come back in the next segment.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  Then Drew, one of our great camera folks, stayed an extra day in D.C.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  He caught some amazing things when he was there that you haven't seen yet.
[24:29.000 --> 24:36.000]  We'll exclusively play that next segment, but I just briefly want to talk to you about a couple of key issues here.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  And that's this. Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear. Everybody says there's a tip of the spear.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  And if you're on the ground, you are. And the listeners aren't just important, they're critical because you're the activist.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  You're what's unstoppable in the third dimension.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  And we've got to fight harder in the silicon dimension.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  We've also got to fight harder in the third dimension.
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.000]  And that means InfoWarsArmy.com. Oh, and Troyer's idea to get the activists out there doing legal and lawful things.
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  Stunts, unfurling banners, sporting events. You name it.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  It's absolutely critical. And then we'll air those videos. We'll air that audio. We'll show those photos here.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  And then it will spread across the Internet. So we're going to up our game.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  What you saw me do in D.C. was just step one.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  I predicted in the car leaving the Senate and House hearings that I would be banned within days. It happened.
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  So the rest of the crew, they said they're going to hit us for bullying Oliver Darcy.
[25:40.000 --> 25:52.000]  The man behind getting us deplatformed and lying about us and organizing with mainstream media to brigade and go out and have us taken off the air.
[25:52.000 --> 26:05.000]  He brags he led brigades. So do these other guys. These are arrogant, horrible, grimer-worm-tum, golem-like, Judas Iscariot creatures.
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  But for InfoWars to maintain its attack profile against the enemy and to really go into this strong, why they fear us, is your strength.
[26:13.000 --> 26:28.000]  If you simply do one thing, if you simply every day print up some cards or whatever and tell people at the grocery store, at the racetrack, you know, at church, at work, wherever.
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  Hey, you've probably heard about Alex Jones and why he's being demonized everywhere. People are asking why is this guy demonized almost as much as Trump?
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  What is it he's really saying? You might want to go see it and watch it. He's been banned everywhere, but his own platform.
[26:42.000 --> 26:56.000]  And like the Alamo, with his crew, he's making a stand to get the word out against overwhelming odds, but thanks to you, we're going to win.
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  Because the information we're talking about is cutting edge about the chai comms, the globalists, the sell-out, the Democrats playing to end the First Amendment,
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  their plans to bring in authoritarianism, their plans to federalize elections. This is all happening. The AI control, the censorship, it's here.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  They're making their move. Trump just got a beachhead.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  If you will tell people about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[27:22.000 --> 27:30.000]  If you will tell people about InfoWars.com forward slash show with the free podcast, one click to your device, you subscribe right to us, remove the middleman, it's free.
[27:30.000 --> 27:42.000]  Or you can find the live audio feeds, the live video feeds. But if you simply tell people, hey, go to infowars.com forward slash show and find the verboten information.
[27:42.000 --> 27:49.000]  And then tell them, if you find it compelling and research it and find out it's true like I did, pass it on.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  That's how we have this underground network to defeat them like we did in 2016. We've made them show their hand now.
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  We've made them come out and openly restrict speech. We've made them show the tyrants they are and people are really waking up.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  And so now's the time to move the ball up the field. InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[28:10.000 --> 28:20.000]  And it's important to subscribe directly to the podcast. Listen how you want, when you want and find the free audio feeds, the video feeds and all the rest of it.
[28:20.000 --> 28:27.000]  Because it's only a matter of time, I think, till they kill the Android and the Apple app that are both number one in news worldwide.
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  So they just delisted it when it hit number one. We lost the app like a week before they banned us.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  And then it got millions of downloads per platform into number one. And so they just then, it's delisted. It's still there.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  You got to hand search it or go to infowars.com forward slash app or infowars.com forward slash show. It's also there.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  So this is it. This is authoritarianism come to America. We're facing it down. They're the censors. They're the bullies. They're the monsters.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  They're colluding together to defrock us of our freedom of speech. And then they turn around and call us bullies that are silencing people.
[28:57.000 --> 29:14.000]  They're true liars.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sewn American made jeans.

[33:22.000 --> 33:30.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[33:30.000 --> 33:45.000]  Well, it finally happened. I was suspended by Twitter for posting a video in which I confronted CNN reporter which resulted in being banned altogether.
[33:45.000 --> 33:54.000]  Wait, who is **** and who is ****? I can't tell you. Otherwise, I'll be ****. But there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[33:54.000 --> 34:01.000]  Honest. I mean, if you literally tweet about how you want to murder the president, you'll not only retain your account, you'll get verified.
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  If you tweet racist bile about how you want white people to die, you'll not only retain your account, you'll get verified.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  But there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  Terra group Hamas still has an account. Jew-hating gay basher Louis Farrakhan still has an account.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  The people who threatened to kill Mike Cernovich as baby still have accounts.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  This verified media matters reporter who threatened violence still has an account.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  The actor who called for putting Baron Trump in a cage with paedophiles still has an account.
[34:30.000 --> 34:38.000]  But there's no social media bias against conservatives, so **** was banned for targeted harassment against ****.
[34:38.000 --> 34:46.000]  But CNN reporters can literally show up at an old lady's house, harass and dox her, but that's not targeted harassment.
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  The reporter of President Trump's received a slew of online abuse after American news network CNN publicly shamed her.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  Goldfarb was viciously attacked online after the short interview spread like wildfire.
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  CNN reporters can intimidate and threaten to dox a private citizen over a meme, but that's not targeted harassment.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  Because as we know, there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  CNN. Trump is trying to shut down the media, also CNN.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  Lobby's big tech to shut down the media.
[35:14.000 --> 35:23.000]  Now I'm sure the fact that Twitter and **** tweeted at the exact same time about **** as banned is just a coincidence.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  And I'm sure that Buzzfeed tweeting about it at 4.45, AP at 4.46, then New York Times followed by the Washington Post and Politico,
[35:30.000 --> 35:37.000]  almost like they were all tipped off by Twitter beforehand, after this Buzzfeed writer lobbied to get **** banned.
[35:37.000 --> 35:45.000]  While Fox News didn't get the memo that **** was about to be banned, it's all just one big coincidence.
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.000]  There's no collusion between big tech and corporate media outlets that want to shut down their competition,
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  because as we all know, there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  And the fact that this all happened the day after big tech leaders testified in front of Congress,
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  so Jack Dorsey wouldn't have to face questions about this, is also just a coincidence.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  Because as we know, there's no social media bias against conservatives.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  But Paul, my private company.
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  Oh shut the **** up. Social media is the new public square.
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  They're colluding with lawmakers, they're colluding with corporate media giants to silence dissidents.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  I'm done with your excuses and intellectual cowardice. I'm done with your glib myopia.
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  This is a free speech crisis.
[36:32.000 --> 36:40.000]  If you don't think 20 SJWs working at Twitter or Facebook getting to decide who has free speech is a problem,
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  then I'm done with you. Sign the petition in the description.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  I'm going to ride it until the wheels fall off.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  You can ban us all, but at least what we did in the moment mattered.
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  At least we were part of a movement that will reverberate throughout history, and you can't censor that.
[36:58.000 --> 37:26.000]  You can silence individuals, but you can never silence ideas.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  We're launching our own players, our own live feeds, our own apps, and our own push notifications.
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.000]  They're going to start this weekend where you don't just get a push notification when David Knight goes live,
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  or I go live, or Owen Schreuer goes live three times a day.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  All the little special times I go live at home, or I go live here at the office, or I go live on the road,
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  that will now push to here at infowars.com and to the Apple and Android apps.
[37:54.000 --> 38:05.000]  But even if they ban those, it will push right to the front page of infowars.com with an article that pops up with the video.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  So again, this is just forcing us to innovate as we are thrown off of all those other platforms.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  I want to be clear, we have the bulk of our audience on AM, FM, radio, and TV.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  It's just that in the modern age, you don't think of that as an audience, because people just passively listen.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  We think of the Internet as the only audience that is out there.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  So I have the Washington Times, the New York Times, all trying to call me saying,
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  what are you going to do now that you're not on the air?
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's like saying, what's Rush Limbaugh going to do?
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  He has a very small web presence, but he's one of the biggest shows in the world.
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  Or George Norrie, or Michael Savage. It's crazy.
[38:44.000 --> 38:51.000]  And they hate DrudgeReport.com because they want to censor all libertarians, all patriots, all nationalists off the air.
[38:51.000 --> 39:00.000]  There he is with more traffic than CNN, the New York Times, and Facebook when it comes to news, combined.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  And they don't know what to do, and they can't stand it.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  So again, I want to thank DrudgeReport.com and Matt Drudge, who started yesterday when we got banned at about 4.30.
[39:09.000 --> 39:17.000]  He had us as the top story right up there with the frontrunner Donald Trump of Brazil being stabbed and critically injured by a leftist.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  Now, let's move down to the middle column. Twitter bans Alex Jones for life.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  They want to shut us up.
[39:24.000 --> 39:32.000]  Media briefed ahead of blacklisting. Well, the media actually coordinated it.
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.000]  That's what mainstream media does now, is they coordinate the censorship of conservatives and nationalists and patriots.
[39:39.000 --> 39:53.000]  And then, coming up in the next segment, I'm back there in the coffee room, getting a glass of water, back there in the break room,
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  and everybody's shaking their head watching Fox News.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  We've got different TVs on different areas of the office.
[40:02.000 --> 40:10.000]  We don't watch CNN while we eat. That would make us nauseous. It's on the hallway. MSNBC is on in the outhouse.
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  We live in Texas. We don't have running water here, or even like Christie. Only the New Yorkers have that.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  Out in the outhouse, we have MSNBC. I'm being sarcastic.
[40:19.000 --> 40:29.000]  But seriously, it was Obama taking credit for the 4.6 growth rate when he said it would never go to 3% because Trump didn't have a magic wand.
[40:29.000 --> 40:37.000]  When it's 100% Trump and the American people believing in the country again and announcing that America is open for business, that is coming up in the next segment.
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.000]  Speaking of America being open for business, info wars is now a referendum on Americana.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  They see us as Americana. They see us as the spirit of Americana.
[40:47.000 --> 40:57.000]  I was very honored when Matt Rudge years ago, before I even met him, said in an interview, Alex Jones is a beautiful piece of Americana that's still left.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  And you know what? I am Americana. So is Matt Rudge. So are you.
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  This audience are a bunch of activist Americanist. Americana, Maximus.
[41:06.000 --> 41:16.000]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young. You are Americana. When you love liberty, when you love freedom, when you're a rugged individualist, when you believe in self-defense, when you believe in God, or when you believe people's right to not believe in God.
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  When you believe in not running somebody else's life, you are Americana and I salute you.
[41:21.000 --> 41:32.000]  That's why it's now a fight. It's now part of the leftist religion to stalk me and to demonize me and to attack me and I'm willing to do it for America.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  We've already seen the country come back from the dead and so it's worth it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  It'd be really depressing if we weren't winning on so many fronts and then I was still being destroyed.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  But it would still be the right thing to do.
[41:45.000 --> 41:58.000]  Let's believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything. I'm not comparing myself to the military like Kaepernick does, but this is an information war and they have come after my family and a lot of other things and they are trying to set me up right now.
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  Warriors don't want me to get into that yet, but I want to do it very, very soon. It's just things have gotten insane.
[42:04.000 --> 42:14.000]  Things are very, very dangerous. They're very, very critical right now and in closing, if you will just financially support info wars and continue to do it,
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  we are basically barring them killing me unbreakable thanks to you.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  We've got products you need, extended labor day special, 50% off many of our best selling items.
[42:23.000 --> 42:34.000]  It's got to end with body's ultimate turmeric formula. Amazing. What is it? 95% curcuminoid level. Nobody else has got that because we're selling out of it.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  Everybody knows how great turmeric is. This is the best formula.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  Other leading brands are twice, three times as much, aren't even as good.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  Infowarslife.com, the bone broth, ultimate bone broth formula that's so amazing for your body.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  That is $19.95, leading competitors are $60 or even as good. That's about to end.
[42:51.000 --> 43:19.000]  Bunch of other specials on BrainForce X2 and Infowarsstore.com. It's critical to find us. Thank you.

[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[47:20.000 --> 47:31.000]  You are a senator. You could become president one day. You have to talk to everybody. Just go ahead and answer him to be gentlemanly.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  Rubio was very fake about it.
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.000]  Yeah, you could tell that he was faking for the camera. I didn't like it.
[47:42.000 --> 47:54.000]  What I agree or disagree with Alex Jones, you could become the president and one day this is going to haunt you because you have to be president for everybody.
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.000]  You are a senator. Not just for Florida. You have to be for everybody. All of that he played to the camera.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  Yeah, that's all it was.
[48:04.000 --> 48:17.000]  I got front row tickets to the House hearing and I'm going over there and I'm going to go on to the Senate hearing, too, because here's the deal.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  They've had five hearings in the House the last year and five hearings in the Senate about me.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  I mean, literally, they spend half the time about me and they go, yeah, and we've got Alex Jones, this Russian agent.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  When they had McCarthy hearings with real communists being drug into the hearings, which I think were good, by the way, they faced their accuser.
[48:35.000 --> 48:46.000]  You got to go into the hearing and then Cohn and all the lawyers were sitting there and they were able to talk back to them.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  I want to be in hearings. I want to face these people.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  I'm not afraid of you.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  I'm not afraid of you. You're the one walking over getting in my face, buddy.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  Well, you're the one that's in the whole world's face.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  No, you know you old stinky man.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  I happen to be nonviolent.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  That's good.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  You support the free speech?
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  Your words are violent.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  You support free speech?
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  I do support free speech, but I do not support hate speech.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  Oh, yeah, good old communist term.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  You're a white supremacist.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  That's a little worn out there, brother.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  He's banned from all social media for his right wing ignorance.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  So there you go. This is another fascist leftist who wants my speech banned.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  I'm from here.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  And look, she's shredding around arrogantly saying it's good that people are getting banned.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  So you don't support the First Amendment, do you?
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  I support everything. I serve this country.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  Well, you just got really, you just got what did you do?
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  You just got really excited about going, oh, he got banned all the time.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  I heard to be that salty.
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  I'm telling you, our audience is double the size.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  I'm kidding you. I'm kidding you.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  I'm kidding you're just a hateful, mindless, leftist.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  I'm a really full star for you, ladies.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  You think your wife probably has involved everything else?
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  You're so horrible. You're a terrible person.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  You sound like an eighth grade.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  You sound like an eighth grade.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  We're going to yell at you.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  We're going to yell at you and make you feel bad.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  You're not supposed to talk back. You're supposed to just be a meme.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  I just don't even know. I'm going to call you scum.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  And when you talk back, I just can't believe it.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  Are you sure you get this?
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  I just can't believe it. I can't believe you actually talked back at me.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  I can't believe it.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  They have used the lies of these committee hearing meetings
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  in the House of Senate to platform me and unperson me off of the Internet
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  so that I can't respond to the future lies and the strong men that they built.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  This is a danger in this country.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  In what free nation do they have hearings at the national level
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  and talk about someone like Alex Jones who works truly for hours
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  and then never have a chance to then be heard by the committee?
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  What country have we turned into for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  openly lobby to take me off every platform and openly lobby
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  that anyone that talks about Alex Jones in a positive way
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  will then also be blacklisted off the Internet?
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  Hours of them lying about me just saying outrageous stuff
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  are the Democrat congressmen and women all I say some terrible thing.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  You know, like you heard Alex Jones, you'll kill Jesus, right?
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  They're like, yes, we know, but it can still be honest.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  They're like, well, we want him taken down.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  I sat there and I watched members of Congress and hearing after hearing
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  say we want info wars off the air.
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  And then you've got Senator Murphy, you've got Senator Warner,
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  you've got all these people, Senator Wyden saying take Alex Jones
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  completely off the Internet and thousands of others.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  That is so un-American, that is so dangerous, that is so out of control.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  Wake up America, stop living like this, stop being idiots.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  Realize you're having your birthright stolen from you right now.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  This is serious business.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  We've been so trained to hate our own country that we see somebody who's pro-America
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  and we think he's a bad guy.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  No, Hollywood's the enemy.
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  My God, the left is literally recreating Nazi Germany here in America.
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.000]  The press is silent.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  Look it up.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  We've had them try to take our credit card process away.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  They took one away.
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  They're saying, oh, you can have your own website.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  No, they're trying to take our website down right now.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  They're trying to take infowars.com down.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  All right, Jack, you got time to do that.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  Thank you.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  Thank you.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  Now, again, it was about 20 minutes ago.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  It was the break before last.
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.000]  And I walk into the break room and people's mouths are hanging open.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  And I said, what's Obama doing?
[52:38.000 --> 52:43.000]  And they go, don't you know they took you and everybody else off social media the last few weeks
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  ahead of his big rollout.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  And I go, oh yeah, I heard he's going to be on the campaign trail.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  And they're like, yeah, this is insane.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  They're like two minutes ago.
[52:52.000 --> 52:58.000]  He was just saying that Trump has a good economy because of him.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  And then I was watching and then he took credit again.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  I then walked in here and said, hey, just back it up two minutes.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  That should be the spot.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  I'm not sure if it's the spot, but I'm told since then he's just been still taking credit.
[53:09.000 --> 53:16.000]  I guess the press conference is ongoing with former President Obama up there taking credit
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  for the US economy when he said it would never go to 3%.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  And he said that there was a magic wand and all the rest of this.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  But before we get to the magic wand, let's just start going to some of this press conference.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  And again, we're going to go through the whole thing later and have the clips.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  But he's taking credit every few minutes.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  So we probably picked a spot on the DVR where it's at.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  Here it is.
[53:39.000 --> 53:49.000]  I wonder about this economic miracle that's been going on when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers,
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  and suddenly Republicans are saying it's a miracle.
[53:53.000 --> 54:04.000]  I had to kind of remind them actually those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  Anyway, I digress.
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  Wow, we just randomly picked a spot.
[54:17.000 --> 54:22.000]  So we made progress, but, and this is the truth,
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.000]  my administration couldn't reverse 40-year trends in only eight years,
[54:29.000 --> 54:36.000]  especially once Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2010 and decided to block everything we did.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  Even things they used to support.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  So we pulled the economy out of crisis.
[54:44.000 --> 54:57.000]  But to this day, too many people who once felt solidly middle class still feel very real and very personal economic insecurity.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  Okay, let's stop there. I'm going to come back the next hour and play some more.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  So just this is unbelievable.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  And I haven't seen much of it. I'm told it's just wall-to-wall BS.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  And so far, you just heard whoppers.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  You got a business, you didn't build that.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  Two plus two equals whatever I say it does.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  If you got a doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Obamacare is free.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  Trump will never get the economy at 3%.
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  Once he got a magic wand, he said it would never get to this level.
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  But now it has. Let's hear that magic wand comment one more time.
[55:28.000 --> 55:35.000]  Somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for,
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What are you going to do?
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  There's no answer to it.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  What magic wand do you have?
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  And usually the answer is, you don't have an answer.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  So.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  And this is from a couple of years ago, and it's already up.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  And they also go, well, it's at 3.9% or it's at 4.2%, but only this quarter.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  And then they'll even be on CNBC and go, no, it's actually since he got elected president,
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  it went to 3%.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  And the 3.2, 3.5, 4, 4.2 projected to be at 4.6 right now,
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  but the final numbers aren't in.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  So that's all coming up.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  But yes, we're all being banned and shadow banned and blocked ahead of the midterms now,
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  55, 59 and a half days out.
[56:32.000 --> 56:38.000]  We're 60 days out, 59 and a half days technically out from this incredibly important election.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  And all I can say is everything is on the line.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  And they wouldn't be doing a mad dash to censor everybody.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  I mean, look at these articles.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  There's so many of these.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  Just type my name in.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  In the U.S., a lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  That's why Alex Jones and M4s were too dangerous not to be banned.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  That's right.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  It's CNN saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  It's CNN saying the guy that shot Scalise was a hero.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  They're the ones calling for Baron to be kidnapped and raped.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  They're the ones that have antivirus running around doing all this.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  It's left to stabbing the Brazilian Trump in the stomach.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  They're the ones nine times out of 10.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  But now I can't be on air preemptively because I'm going to cause people to go shoot folks with guns
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.000]  because the media lied and said that I said get your battles rifles ready for the media,
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  which they won't show me saying because it's a lie.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  So I said to Jack Dorsey, hey, I didn't say that.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  Magic wand being your band because we're not going to let you respond to our lies.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  We're going to tell our lies and hope they work.
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  Let's see folks are already awake to you so it doesn't work.

[59:49.120 --> 01:00:05.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:16.800]  He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:36.000]  All right, if you just joined us, I got the DVR up here in the studio of Obama just 20 minutes
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.880]  ago live giving a press conference or a speech and it's just unbelievable. We've been stopping and
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:46.720]  starting at random times and he's taking credit for the 4.2% growth rate, the 4.6% projection
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:54.160]  he's taking credit saying his economy is what did this. It is, I mean, I haven't seen much of it.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.640]  It's all horrible. So we're just going to start randomly playing it from early on this segment,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.840]  the next and analyzing it because I've been told by folks that watched it live. It is a whopper
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.000]  because remember he said it'll never go to 3%. There is no magic wand. Paul Krugman, New York Times.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:21.680]  This is crazy. And notice I've been banned from everything a day out from him now reemerging.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.280]  It's not just me. Thousands of libertarian conservative pro-Trump accounts. It's happening
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.520]  absolutely everywhere right now and they are making their move. So what do we do?
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.400]  We don't let them steal our republic or take our first amendment. You hit the third dimension.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.320]  You go to colleges. You go to speak at city council. You call it a talk radio. You call
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.960]  it a C-span. You hand out cards with infowars.com and say forbidden information.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.320]  You redouble your efforts because the reason they're getting so desperate right now
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.400]  and the reason infowarsarmy.com is so critical is they've got internal polls that have already
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.640]  come out even CNN hit the panic button last week and said, okay, it looks like a red wave.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.480]  It looks like the Trump effect is unstoppable. We are going to lose big.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.120]  And they said, what are we going to do? And they said 25th amendment. Get him out now. Get him out
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.840]  now. Publish fake reports. All the people that are quoted say, I never said that. There's no tapes
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:25.360]  of it. It's solid lies, ladies and gentlemen. So let's go to some more of President Obama
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.560]  telling incredible whoppers. Here it is. Thanks for people around the world.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.520]  That's the story of America.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.280]  A story of progress.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.160]  Fitful progress in complete progress, but progress.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.280]  Good pause. Well, you can tell where this is going. Back in another minute, please.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.400]  I haven't even seen this. I know where it's going. Progressive is in progress. Things getting
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.160]  better because of bigger government. No, that's not the history of the United States. It's rugged,
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.720]  individualism. It's swashbuckling. It's inventiveness. It's the dynamic human spirit.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.760]  But they act like we have a totally open border. Come here, be inducted into racial
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:18.160]  hatred of white people and become a socialist under a victim ideology of liberation theology
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:24.000]  taught by the Ford Foundation at all the colleges and then be a vulcanized controlled slave state
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.440]  of the globalist. That's the America he's selling. That's the great America, not the real great America
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.280]  that Trump's talking about. That's about individuals. His is a collectivist model,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.480]  which he supports. Let's go back to Obama. We need to hear from you. Just a little something.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.360]  Oh my gosh. You know what? I've got to back this up at the start and begin.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.880]  Wow, they're not clapping and he's having to tell him to clap.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.040]  Wow, this is amazingly train wreckish. Let me just stop right there then. I'm going to try to be a
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:59.360]  good boy. It's just that everything I see is just cringe worthy failure with some packed audience of
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:05.120]  low energy drooling zambos. When you go to the Capitol, state, Capitol or federal and you see
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.080]  someone that looks like they've had a lobotomy, black, white, old, young, dragging over to you
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:19.680]  and they start saying, no NRA, no KKK. You know they've been paid. You know. So this is echoes
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:27.280]  of Jeb Bush saying, please clap. Come on. But Uncle Bear, they bring in folks have the applause.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.560]  I mean, you know, hit the applause light. Come on, applause. Sometimes they got folks out front
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:40.000]  going, come on, come on, come on. Clap. Whoo. Yeah, let's bring down America. Have a race war. Whoo.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.920]  Yeah. Oh, ban the guns. Whoo. Whoo. Be like Venezuela. Whoo. Maybe I should get a laugh
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.080]  track going in the background, you know, like old shows. There you go. Yeah, there's Old
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:05:22.000]  Colbert. He gets to say hello or anybody else does their careers over info wars life and info wars life.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release.

[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:37.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:07:07.680]  I gotta tell you, I miss Obama. Because especially now, he literally is riding Trump's magic wand here. He got tired of Michelle's. And he is doing the most incredible stuff you have ever seen. Now, I've only stopped and started this 30-minute speech. I've only seen, like, five minutes of it. It's all whoppers. Every 10 seconds is a galactic level lie. So let's control ourselves, though, and I want to show you a riding shotgun host of the War Room, three o'clock Central every day.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:29.440]  Let's just write down notes, because it starts out with them not clapping. So he says, oh, just a little applause. Come on. So Bombshell, he can't even, he's reemerged after the purge. As Trump said, millions of conservatives and Christians, thousands of prominent people. Everyone I know has been banned off major platforms or totally banned or shadow banned.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:52.400]  I mean, it's just every hour the numbers are coming in. You had a bunch of your stuff banned yesterday. Everybody that works here, Anthony Comey, I had all his stuff banned simultaneously. And they admittedly, the AP BuzzFeed, all of them, the same minute, published huge articles about why I was banned, what I did. I bullied an innocent person. They won't say what. They speculate it was another child totally made up.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:08:16.880]  No, it was Oliver Darcy, who is the bully, trying to get media platforms. So then they have a congressman going, Jones tries to silence the innocent. No, you just silenced me. So everything is inversion because they're in full panic mode. So Ellen's here, we're going to play and try to be good boys and get to this, because this just, he just concluded this train wreck speech a few minutes ago, and it is the ultimate whopper.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:25.200]  I mean, they got caught lying in the last election. And so they said the answer is lies of the next level, where I've never seen such lying, Ellen.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:39.280]  Well, I've been watching this speech from the beginning. And let me tell you, first of all, the biggest difference, the biggest noticeable difference is Obama no longer has his confidence. He no longer has his swag. He's obviously desperate. He's in fear.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:48.960]  Remember, he's been hiding for the last two years. So this is like him coming out of the woodworks finally to fight for the Democrat Party, because he's been so scared of whatever is going on behind the scenes.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.400]  The possum's crawling out at this point.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:09:05.680]  But he's not Obama. So he's up there fumbling and stumbling and bumbling all through this speech, like you said, next level propaganda. I mean, the average American Alex listening to an Obama speech when he was president or a state of the union, he was smooth.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:19.360]  That was smooth propaganda, baby. The average American is not going to pick up on that. This speech, the average American is going to hear this speech and their eyes are going to go, Whoa, what in the hell is going on here?
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:29.840]  I have some of the I agree they've gone crazy. Because just what I've watched is just like whoppers. I mean, I'm the reason the economy is better. I always said this would happen. No, you said it would never happen.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:48.800]  Oh, you just you just dipped your foot in the in the pool, Alex. I'm telling you. And what I'm almost thinking about doing, Alex, is is playing Trump's speech last night in Billings, Montana, just total kick ass, real applause, American power, America's great, we're coming back, we kick ass.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:10:02.000]  I love you. And then and then after you play that play Obama's speech, where it's like America sucked, but I made America great and everybody's racist and awful. But but if I was president, we'd be better and and rich people suck and white people suck.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:15.840]  And it's just like, Oh, my God, like, what is going on? How do you have the president of the United States give a rousing real speech last night, telling you how great America is to Obama, the former president fumbling and bumbling and muttering and
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:30.720]  here's why he knows they're screwed. They can destroy me. They can even maybe even kill Trump. People now are awake. They've got the internal polls. And they're even, like I said, the Democrats at the panic button last week, in the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and CNN, they said, No, it's a red wave, we're screwed.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:44.960]  And so they said the Trump effect is in full effect. He's unstoppable. America hates us now. What are we going to do? And that's when the Panetta, the former head of the CIA, and the former head of the NSA, Hayden came out and said, We need to stop now.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:55.440]  But the problem is Trump derangement syndrome, they're coming on like a stampede of crazy cows. Yeah, they can't stop. That's the most incredible thing. Yeah, there it is. Trump bump has become a tsunami.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:06.400]  Let's just go to this whole bonus. I'm telling you, the average American and everyone rebroadcast this, they rebroadcast this on every measure. They ban us and then this is what they ought to be banning.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, folks. Here, here, just go to it. Go to it. He said, Is it really that hard to say not to say that?
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:29.520]  The point that is essential to American democracy is that in a government of and by and for the people, there should be no permanent ruling class.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:41.040]  Which is what Trump upset. They're only citizens. And it's the ruling class of Trump. Elected and temporary representatives determine our course and determine our character.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:12:02.400]  I'm here today because this is one of those pivotal moments when every one of us as citizens of the United States need to determine just who it is that we are. Just what it is that we stand for.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:16.480]  As citizens, huh? And as a fellow citizen, he's a globalist. They don't have citizens on the. But as a citizen, I'm here to deliver a simple message. And that is that you need to vote because our democracy depends on.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:36.800]  You didn't have to ask for that applause. It's coming up. We backed it up enough. We'll get the non applause in here. Some of you may think I'm exaggerating when I say this November's elections are more important than any I can remember in my lifetime.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:49.760]  That's true. Well, a rare moment of truth. I know politicians say that all the time. I have been guilty of saying it a few times, particularly when I was on the ballot.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:13:07.920]  But just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different. Read our corporate news. The stakes really are higher. The consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:26.320]  Are more dire. And it's not as if we haven't had big elections before or big choices to make in our history. Fact is, democracy has never been easy. And our founding fathers argued about everything.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:45.840]  Founding fathers. We waged a civil war. They try to sound like an American now, but it's not came to pressure as a globalist. We've lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:14:03.280]  But still, most Americans alive today, certainly the students who are here, have operated under some common assumptions about who we are and what we stand for.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:20.720]  Out of the turmoil of the industrial revolution and the Great Depression, America adapted a new economy, a 20th century economy, guiding our free market with regulations to protect health and safety and fair competition.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:39.440]  Oh yeah. Empowering workers. With your influence. And shipping your jobs to China. Investing in science and infrastructure and educational institutions like U of I. Strengthening our system of primary and secondary education.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:52.480]  This is the beginning. He's kind of greasing the crowd right now. He starts laying out the propaganda and starts fumbling and bumbling like a miserable fool pretty soon here.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:15:06.320]  We'll come back on the other side. This is really hard to watch. We're going to do it. But it gets really hilarious here in a minute. We'll cover it all on the other side. Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that he represents the folks that don't want you to be wealthy or successful or independent.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:19.440]  He represents those that want you to live in austerity and poor to control your life. He admits that he goes to Africa and says, you have to stay poor. This guy is a monster. We are asking you. We're not funded by the Rockefellers. We're not funded by the globalist.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:34.480]  We're not funded by any of these people. We are funded by you. And so when you buy the products and informer store.com, I'm just going to tell him we can stop it there. That's good. Thank you. I want to come back where we were at. Thank you.

But anyways, most people should not be doing radio TV show and the directing of themselves live on air. But I just want to come back with the interview where it was with Obama.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:57.200]  Anyways, if you don't fund us, we won't be here. We won't be able to operate and they'll be able to shut us down. And we've got great products that you need. We've got them there.

[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:57.880]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com for a slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:28.880]  Okay, so you're learning about this as we're learning about it. This just ended a few minutes ago. We've got the whole thing taped and we've got the headlines. Owen watched a bunch of it. It's headlines like Obama angry Trump taking credit for his economy.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:47.880]  These are the headlines that are going out. So he was just busy telling us about what America's real history is about government coming and making it great. And so when you've got some of these quotes, let's just get right back into what the president, former president Obama was just saying, here it is.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.880]  The status quo pushes back.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.880]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:10.880]  Sometimes the backlash comes from people who are 15 in 2016. And anyway, I digress as a total why.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:35.880]  So we made progress, but and this is the truth. My administration couldn't reverse 40 year trends in only eight years. Trump did it in two, especially once Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2010 and decided to block everything we did.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880]  Except Obamacare.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:22:01.880]  Even things they used to support. So we pulled the economy out of crisis. But to this day, too many people who once felt solidly middle class still feel very real and very personal economic insecurity, which they would keep going, even though we took out bin Laden.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:10.880]  Tell me Alex, it's about this is about to get on real man in Iraq and our combat role in Afghanistan and God Iran to halt its nuclear program.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.880]  The world's still full of threats.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.880]  His nose like growing 50 feet long.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.880]  People's televisions every single day.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:38.880]  And these challenges get people worried and it phrase our civic trust and it makes a lot of people feel like the fix is in and the game is rigged.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:48.880]  And nobody's looking out for them, except Trump, especially those communities outside our big urban centers rigged by this guy.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:58.880]  And even though your generation is the most diverse in history, with a greater acceptance and celebration, you're taking their basic differences than ever before.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.880]  That's your new freedom as your diversity, not any real wealth or freedom.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  Those are the conditions that are ripe for exploitation by politicians.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.880]  Like you do in communist China.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.880]  And no shame about tapping into America's dark history of racial and ethnic and religious division.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:18.880]  South America says you can't be wealthy. He goes to Africa and says that.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.880]  He goes up a dark past.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.880]  So you can't be part of America.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]  That's what he's saying.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.880]  Feeling too fear hitting one group against another.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]  That's what you do.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:36.880]  Telling people that order and security will be restored if it weren't for those who don't look like us or don't sound like us.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.880]  No, you're letting criminals in and not vetting people.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.880]  People get checked when they go to his house.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.880]  There's security at his house.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.880]  Listen, he's fumbling, though, Alex.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.880]  We can't have a border.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.880]  And in a healthy democracy, it doesn't work.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.880]  Our antibodies kick in.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.880]  Oh, and ban all the free speech?
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.880]  People go well from across the political spectrum.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.880]  Call out the bigots and the fear mongers.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.880]  That's all they do is call people racist that aren't.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.880]  We're going to compromise and get things done.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.880]  Because they're the racist racists.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:10.880]  They promote the better angels of our nature.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.880]  But when there's a vacuum in our democracy.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880]  When we don't vote.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.880]  That's the left.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:23.880]  When we take our basic rights and freedoms for granted.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.880]  When we turn away and stop paying attention.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.880]  The factories come back, the jobs come back.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.880]  Stop engaging.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.880]  Double the number of blacks vote for Trump.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:32.880]  Yeah, he's scared.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.880]  He's really scared.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:41.880]  We're the newest diversion, the electronic versions of bread and circuses.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.880]  Oh, that was very telling me.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880]  Electronic versions of bread and circuses.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.880]  Yeah, that's what corporate media is.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.880]  That's what all the brainwashing is.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  So this is right when the propaganda, though.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.880]  For some reason, our stream is cut here.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.880]  But this is right when the propaganda, Alex, starts going next level.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:03.880]  And the average American, normally the smooth talking propagandist, snake-tongued Obama,
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880]  could trick the average American with a speech like this.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.880]  But he's lost his swagger.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.880]  He's clearly frazzled.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880]  He's been in hiding.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.880]  And I think we know why.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.880]  Because they'd artificially sold the country out and had external tariffs set up.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  Well, he attacks the tax cut.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.880]  China had a 15% tax on corporations.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880]  We had a 40.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.880]  So everybody moved there.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.880]  Trump goes to 15 to match them.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.880]  That's fair trade.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.880]  He goes to 40 to match them.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.880]  China goes to zero.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.880]  And so Apple and Google moved there.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.880]  But he's saying it's bad that we're even being competitive.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.880]  Continue.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:49.880]  The other voice is filled void.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.880]  A politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment takes hold.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.880]  That's what they push on universities.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.880]  This is the one telling you you should be scared if you're not white.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:58.880]  That's him.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.880]  It's complex problems.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.880]  No promise to fight for the little guy.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.880]  Even as they cater to the wealthiest and most powerful.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.880]  That's him.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  No promise to clean up corruption.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  This is why people left Obama.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880]  No closer away.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.880]  They start undermining norms that ensure accountability.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.880]  And try to change the rules to entrench their power further.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.880]  That means he won't let them sell out to Russia or China.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.880]  What, you mean like signing the NDAA to legalize propaganda to entrench your power further?
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.880]  That was Trump, right?
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.880]  No, that was Obama put the CIA group here to take us off air.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.880]  Oh, so that was Obama?
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.880]  Yeah.
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.880]  I understand this is not just a matter of Democrats versus Republicans or liberals versus conservatives.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.880]  And he's the one that also illegally spot on Trump during the campaign after he got caught lying about it.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880]  That's right.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880]  Very Nixonian.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]  He got caught red-handed.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.880]  Both parties.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.880]  Southern Democrats were the bigger defenders of slavery.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.880]  Wow.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.880]  One thing he said was true.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.880]  He said a Republican president.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.880]  Abraham Lincoln to end it.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  We've been saying that for years.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880]  Dixie Cratt's filibustered anti-legislation.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.880]  Those guys are grabbing all our rhetoric because they know he wouldn't win it.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.880]  Next he goes to status quo.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:28.880]  And although it was a Democratic president and a majority Democrat Congress spurred on by young marchers and protesters,
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.880]  they got the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act over the finish line.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:42.880]  Those historic laws also got passed because of the leadership of Republicans like Illinois' own Everett Dirksen.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.880]  Illinois?
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880]  Oh, they're going to be mad at him for that.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.880]  So neither party has had a monopoly on wisdom.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.880]  Yeah.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  Even I know that.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.880]  Neither party has been exclusively responsible for us going backwards instead of forward.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.880]  So he's attacking Dinesh D'Souza's truth that it was Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.880]  He acted like, oh, they helped a little.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  No, you're a damn liar.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  Because sometimes we hear a plague on both your houses.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.880]  I think only like a handful of Democrats voted for it.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.880]  You could pull up the famous vote.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.880]  They fought it even after the vote.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  Oh, look, he just gave him a little bit of credit, though.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880]  There were a few Republicans for it.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.880]  That's Dinesh D'Souza that I put in jail.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880]  You know, maybe there was some accuracy in his film.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.880]  Well, Jim Thompson was governor.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.880]  He had a lot of good Republican friends there.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880]  D'Souza was an effing white male.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880]  You just wait until Obama starts all night.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  We have another guest joining us, but we're getting to the big enchiladas.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.880]  There's the parts towards the end where there's been some whoppers, but he starts taking credit for the economy.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.880]  And then says that, you know, despite Trump.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]  Thank you, Obama.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.880]  I think Obama may have just cost the Democrats a blue-way.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.880]  He basically said it was like pregnant.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880]  He was, I was pregnant.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880]  And it just took longer.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:29:22.880]  Now the baby's without the baby.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880]  That's Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:54.880]  Thank you, Obama.

[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:25.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:32.880]  So CNN is very famous for bullying people.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:39.880]  Woman receives abuse, threats, violence, CNN tracks down, publicly shames her for sharing Russian event on Facebook,
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:46.880]  which it wasn't a Russian event, a Russian bot posted a link on her Facebook page.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.880]  And again, you can go hire a Russian bot, you can hire Australian bots, Brazilian bots.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.880]  The most bots come out of the U.S. and Canada and England.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.880]  This is the tech in China.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:04.880]  But remember that? CNN blackmail's source of Donald Trump wrestling video to come out and apologize that they would dox them.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880]  Remember all that?
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:12.880]  But CNN's Oliver Darcy has had me banned, he's a public figure and a man, for confronting him at the Capitol and saying,
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:20.880]  how dare you lobby to have us take off these platforms and attack our sponsors and go around and police things.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.880]  And then he just arrogantly went and complained and they said, you're blown out the airlock.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:29.880]  And of course, they then all worked with mainstream media to announce why I was banned.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.880]  All nebulous saying that I was bullying.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:38.880]  Yes, full grown adults at the Capitol that have literally been racketeering against me and bullying me.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.880]  I knew when I did that, he'd do that.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880]  I even said it after I left.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880]  I think I even said it on the tape.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.880]  In fact, I said, I bet I'll be banned for bullying this guy that bullied me.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.880]  Because it's all subjective, but it doesn't matter.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.880]  The guy gets a hundred retweets.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:58.880]  He has the whole power of CNN behind him that no one watches to try to get viewers.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880]  And he doesn't.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.880]  He's a joke.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880]  And that whole system's coming down.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:03.880]  But look at this.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.880]  In the U.S., a lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  That's why Alex Jones' Info Wars were too dangerous not to be banned.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880]  That's Yahoo News.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.880]  And he called Darcy to his face a rat.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.880]  Well, that's what he is going around, paddling, lying, evil.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.880]  I said, you're like the Hitler Youth.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.880]  Well, the left constantly calls us Nazis.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.880]  Jones made negative references to his eyes, which looks remarkably mild, slightly bemused to me when I watched it.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.880]  And accused him of smiling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.880]  They saw all sorts of stuff like that about me on Comedy Central.
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880]  It's a great description.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:49.880]  But the point is this guy goes around lobbing to have me taken down and then lies to our face with pure arrogance.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.880]  And it's, oh my God, take the guns away.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.880]  Take the free speech away.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.880]  Because Jones is a bully and is going to get people shot.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.880]  Wow.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  Well, that ban video is in the video feed at infowars.com.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  And it's linked on the story on DrudgeReport.com, right in the middle column.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.880]  It says, Alex Jones, they're trying to shut us up.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.880]  You can go see all the ban videos that are now going viral and see for yourself.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:29.880]  You see the monster that wrote more than 30 articles that called publishers and got people fired that were even talking about publishing a book that I was doing.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.880]  And runs around saying, look, this violates this.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  This violates that.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:50.880]  And then they've been ordered at Twitter by the Democrats and others that when these fat checkers, Darcy testified, Jack Dorsey testified about that when God calls, but Oliver Darcy calls, it's over.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:51.880]  You just ban it.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]  You just do it.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:56.880]  I want to go back to this Obama clip where he really gets into the whoppers here in just a moment.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880]  But this is where we are.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  We're building our own YouTube.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.880]  Mike Adams has built his own real.video.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:11.880]  We're doing a lot of big things, but really the power to resist these globalists is that I'm going to announce sometime this afternoon at infowars.com.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:16.880]  You got to go there to see it.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:36.880]  And the power of you to then say an hour or two before, hey, he's about to go live.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:42.880]  Let's say I'm going to go live at four o'clock tomorrow with critical intel.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:50.880]  You can tell everybody, hey, go get the app, the verboten app at infowars.com or just go to infowars.com.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.880]  It'll be on the front page of the site tomorrow.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:01.880]  And I'm going to have some special guests and things like that and some big exclusive news that just like I told you on Tuesday, hey, Wednesday, you want to tune in?
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.880]  Did I not deliver?
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:04.880]  Okay.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880]  Then I said, tune in tomorrow.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.880]  You'll have giant news and did not get crazy on Thursday.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.880]  And I've got even bigger news that I'm not at liberty to cover yet, but we're going to cover it tomorrow.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:17.880]  I made the decision to go public with it before I go to the FBI.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.880]  So that's what's going on here because Mueller made his move.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.880]  We have got incredible information.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.880]  All I want to say is thank you, Matt Rudge, for caring about America and having courage.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.880]  And thank you for being the only organization and group that has had our back and had the courage to be a trailblazer for 10 years.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:43.880]  And what you've done outside of our audience and outside of God and outside of this crew and my family, Matt Rudge is the key stone to this.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:52.880]  And Matt Rudge is an American hero and an icon and a true Maverick, a trailblazer, a game changer.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:56.880]  And without him, info wars would have been defeated long ago.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:01.880]  So he's under attack, go to his site, click on his sponsors, pray for him, support him.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.880]  Matt Rudge is a one in a billion.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:07.880]  He is an absolute game changer.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:11.880]  And there's a lot of talk in this world, but let me tell you, that's the game changer right there.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.880]  You, the viewers, the game changer.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:17.880]  And it's true.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:23.880]  We're bringing in as much money for August and September as we've ever brought in.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.880]  But I have a bigger crew.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.880]  I have Soros financing a bunch of lawsuits that I can beat if I can finance fighting.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.880]  Hands down, we will win them.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  The stuff they're doing is not in law, no matter how much emotion or lies or propaganda or how much to try to try at the press.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.880]  We've already got a bunch of them thrown out, but we got big top law firms that bankrupted Remington.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.880]  You name it coming after us.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:53.880]  If you buy the products that you already need and steadfastly support us, I promise you I will never compromise or back down or give in.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.880]  I'll never compromise anyway.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880]  So they can have a gun to my head.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  I wouldn't sell out.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.880]  But, you know, at a certain point, the soul is willing, but the flesh is weak.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:11.880]  But you have my trillion percent commitment that I'm never going to back down or never falter or waiver as much as I can.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.880]  But literally, you buying products is like giving somebody in a desert hike water or food.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  These are products you need.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.880]  So the Labor Day specials are extended throughout this weekend and they're over.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:24.880]  And we're talking 50% off on all our best sellers.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.880]  These are great products you need.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:32.880]  The t-shirts are the best we've ever had, the best fabric, the best quality, so many designs, so many great ways to spread the word.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:39.880]  But if you get things like coffee or supplements that you're going to want every 15 days, every month, every two months, it goes all the way out to like a year.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.880]  You can sign a ferrato ship out to a year.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.880]  Cancel anytime it's free.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.880]  There's 5% Patriot points on top of it.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.880]  10% off when you sign a ferrato ship.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.880]  Free shipping on order $50 or more.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.880]  There's so many specials, so many deals that all of these products we don't make money on.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.880]  So I'm going to lend coffee.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  It cost me like $12.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.880]  And it's a good deal at $17.95.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.880]  I mean, they sell the exact same stuff in Whole Foods for $25.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:06.880]  So one thing we need to do is probably raise prices.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.880]  I just love to give you a great deal.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:10.880]  It's got 700 plus reviews on power reviews.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.880]  97% positive.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880]  It's just a high quality medium.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.880]  We have several others as well from the Chiapas Farmers.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.880]  Basically it's right on the border with Guatemala.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:21.880]  It is amazing.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.880]  American coffee.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.880]  That's something you want to order every month.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.880]  And just doing that.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.880]  Reordering the super blue toothpaste, fluoride freak, little silver fortified iodine fortified.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:32.880]  Get that back in.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.880]  It's great concentrated toothpaste.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.880]  Yeah, we make like three, four bucks on that.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.880]  But it's the ultimate turmeric bodies.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.880]  It's the fish hole for you and your children.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.880]  All these are the best quality products out there.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:51.880]  We have Dr. Steve Pachennick coming up later to give us his take on these bands.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  The election 60 days out and more.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.880]  I was going to be right in shock then with me.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:59.880]  We have another gentleman who's running for Senate against the fake Indian Pocahontas.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.880]  So we've got Sheba for Senate joining us.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:04.880]  And so much more.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.880]  I didn't get to the really bad parts of Obama yet, but I'll do that with Pachennick.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.880]  And when we upload this to info wars.com, from the point we were at,
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.880]  let's just make a note where it gets in the real whoppers where he says,
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.880]  Trump didn't do the economy.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.880]  I did it.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:17.880]  America still sucks.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  America's KKK.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:21.880]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.880]  Yeah, you've got Clinton.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.880]  Most blacks in jail says their animals must be brought to heal like super predators.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.880]  Most blacks on welfare.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.880]  That's Obama.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.880]  So Clinton's most blacks in jail.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:38.880]  Obama's most blacks on welfare and Trump is most blacks with jobs and highest wages ever.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.880]  Just a fact, delivering the goods like he's always done.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:43.880]  That's what he does.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.880]  Faithful and truthful servant Donald Trump.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.880]  And we are your faithful and truthful servants as well.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:49.880]  Straight ahead more.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:50.880]  Stay with us.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:51.880]  Spread those live links.

[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.880]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:27.880]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:34.880]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.880]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:48.880]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:50.880]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps,
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.880]  how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.880]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.880]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.880]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress,
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:11.880]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:16.880]  That's why infowarslife created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:33.880]  I feel like we get up here and we laugh and we joke a little too much and I'm not blaming you, I'm not blaming me.
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.880]  But as patriots, as rugged individualists, we're pretty tough.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.880]  The left is good at whining and bitching and complaining and they're having testimony people saying,
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:53.880]  Trump's killing me, Kavanaugh's killing me. It's all this drama queen. He's Hitler. Oh, we're all dead.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:59.880]  But thousands and thousands of prominent libertarians and conservatives have all been banned.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:08.880]  They banned me off Twitter and say because I bullied people when it's Darcy, this CNN guy that's getting me banned everywhere.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:14.880]  He's a monster. He's a full grown man. He's on national TV. I get in his face and I say, you are a liar and a fraud and anti-free speech.
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:21.880]  How dare you? And they have articles going in the U.S. A lot of twisted people have access to guns.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.880]  That's why Alex Jones and them for wars were too dangerous not to be banned.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:31.880]  He compared Darcy, the CNN journalist, Oliver Darcy, to Hitler youth.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:38.880]  And I said, you're like the last stringer. You're horrible. You're low quality.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.880]  And the globalist prop CNN up to stop, you know, the allies advance on Berlin like Hitler youth.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:50.880]  I was saying, you're being used. It was a very nuanced literary thing. It wasn't like, you're a Nazi. Go to hell.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:54.880]  Hell, Twitter would give you an award for that if I'd said that to some conservative.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:03.880]  So everything they do, they claim we're doing. So I'm banned because I talk bad to the guy that got us banned everywhere.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:08.880]  Because I'm claiming he got me banned, which is true. So now I'm banned for daring talk to him.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.880]  And then they all colluded and knew it was going to happen hours before and wrote articles and admit they were colluding on it.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.880]  That is crazy. It's also been put in London independent.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:25.880]  So they're now combining the First Amendment with the Second Amendment and saying, take them both.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:30.880]  Now, our next guest has been hit with exactly this. He's showing nicely in the polls.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:42.880]  Shiva, I Do Your Eye is our guest. And it's vasheva.com. It's a central sheva for senate.com.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:46.880]  He'll give us the best websites, but everybody knows who he is. He's been on the show.
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:51.880]  He's the inventor of email on record. He's a big engineer, big scientist, MIT, whole nine yards.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.880]  And he has been barred or they're trying to bar him from the debates because the fake Indian, Pocahontas,
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.880]  cannot have the real thing there, a businessman to confront her.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:05.880]  So great to have you here during this great season of banning.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:13.880]  You're, I know, having to sue be part of the debates because she doesn't want to actually stand on the battlefield of ideas like a authoritarian leftist.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:17.880]  She wants to shut down your speech. So thanks for joining us, Shiva.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.880]  Thanks, Alex. Yeah, basically, whitey doesn't want darky on the stage.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.880]  Well, let's let's break that down. So you're saying because if I say it, the media will clip it out and say I said it to you.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.880]  What are you saying?
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:34.880]  Well, what I mean by that, Alex is Elizabeth Warren claims she's for blacks and minorities and for right.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:45.880]  And here you have a minority, you know, as someone who came through the legal immigrant process, struggled as it went through the American journey,
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.880]  education, innovation, right, immigration, all those processes.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:57.880]  And I would consider myself an embodiment of the American dream. Elizabeth Warren needs to step aside and let a real American worker,
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:05.880]  real inventor and educator really represent the state and be a real part of the U.S. Senate. Instead, what she's doing is she's colluded with a fake
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:15.880]  Trump or a guy called Dirty Deal who voted for Joe Biden as a Saudi lobbyist, as his campaign manager, and they colluded to not even invite me to the debates.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:22.880]  I'm a bona fide candidate. You know, our volunteers who are here, we got 20,000 signatures to get on the ballot.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:30.880]  We struggled out there. We played by the rules. And what Warren did was right after the primaries, in fact, midnight before the primary,
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:38.880]  she said, I will debate the Republican. Well, what about the dark Indian guy? Is he just a illegitimate, you know, quote unquote bastard, right?
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:46.880]  So that's how they want to treat the American people, because this is not about me. It's the fact that the Republicans and Democrats in Massachusetts,
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:54.880]  by the way, there's only one party in Massachusetts, the Democrats, and they have another face called the Republicans, the guy that won the primary.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:52:01.880]  Again, I said this guy voted for Biden, switched from Republican to Democrat. The same time Warren went from Democrat, I mean, Republican to Democrat,
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:08.880]  he went from Democrat to Republican. So what you have is you have a uniparty system and they really want to keep freedom of choice out.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:18.880]  What we did, Alex, was I was thinking this was going to happen. So we sent a legal notice to the University of Massachusetts, which is a federally funded government institution,
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:26.880]  which will be hosting these three debates, which I'm excluded of. And we told them that's a violation of free speech because you can't really attack the private media companies,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:35.880]  but you can expose the University of Massachusetts, by the way, which is run by a former Democrat, one of the most corrupt politicians called Marty Mehan.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:43.880]  And so it's clear, the Republicans and Democrats said, we got to keep that darky real Indian off of the stage because he's going to cause problems.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:48.880]  Because you know when I'm on the stage, Alex, I'm going to expose the hell out of her. I'll mop the floor with her.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:59.880]  But she's put this fake Trump on there. The fake Indian wants a fake Trump to mislead all the Massachusetts voters that he's a Trump to take it away from the real guy who's anti-establishment,
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:05.880]  from the real guy who's supported the president. So that's the insidious game, but we're not going to let him get away with it.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:11.880]  Wednesday, if they don't put me on stage, Alex, we're going to file a federal lawsuit. And you know I do pretty well with lawsuits.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:23.880]  That's right. Let's spend a few minutes talking about what you would say on the debate stage against her, what you would hit her with in your first opening three-minute statement.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:31.880]  Well, the first thing I'd hit her with, and the other guys, the establishment is one. The Republicans and Democrats have been colluding against the working people of this country.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:41.880]  I would hit her with the fact that, A, you voted for the Monsanto Protection Act. You voted Yayford. You voted to support corrupt defense contractors.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:47.880]  You wanted to bomb Syria, and you wanted a bigger military budget than Trump. You're an imperialist globalist.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:56.880]  The third thing I'd hit her with very hard was that her Dodd-Frank destroyed 1,200 community banks, that she is not a champion of everyday working people.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:08.880]  She's not a champion of the poor. She has created segregation in Massachusetts. The average net worth of a black person is $8, and the average net worth of a poor white person is never spoken about.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:18.880]  I would hit her with the fact that she is part of the deep state. She is part of Harvard University, which she's never ever criticized, and Harvard is the epicenter and the alpha and omega of the deep state.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:34.880]  That's what I'd bring about, Alex, because that would expose her to the liberals who are being misled, but it would also share with the true Trumpers, the true Republicans, that the Republican Party of Massachusetts has no interest in defending their interests.
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:41.880]  They actually work with the Democrats and collude to keep real Republicans like me out of the debate, and we're not going to let them get away with it.
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:48.880]  And that's exactly what they're doing. That's exactly what they're doing on the censorship against us, is a lot of the Republicans are for it, like Marco Rubio.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:57.880]  What do you think about what's happened to me and thousands of other prominent conservative leaders and millions of people, as Trump said, there is a total crackdown 60 days out.
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:03.880]  It's outrageous. What do you think Trump should do? I know he's readying an arsenal of action.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:11.880]  First, first of all, Alex, I thought the way you hit Rubio was awesome. I don't think any other real journalist would have hit him like that.
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:21.880]  I use this technical word called scumbag, and that's what Marco Rubio is. He's never stood for any principles but himself, so I thought what you did was great.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:32.880]  Now, related to what they've done to you and the attack on you, it's an attack on the foundation of the principles of this country, which was First Amendment, which was we have access to free discourse, free speech.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  And the reason the founders set that up is so you have an opportunity to have a whole range of views, so people can listen to a whole range of views, and they believe that people had a brain of their own so they could come to decisions by trying to ban you, you know, leave people like me off the debate stage.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:52.880]  They want to narrow it and control it. It's the centralization of power.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:56:05.880]  I agree. And what do you think of the new role of the corporate press openly cheerleading to have everyone libertarian, everyone nationalist, everyone free market removed, and then horrible race baiting to make everyone fight with each other.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:15.880]  This is so criminal. I think it's going to backfire A and then B. I want to hold you over and ask you, if you played a lot of this earlier, did you see Obama hours ago taking credit for the Trump economy?
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:17.880]  This is getting ridiculous.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:24.880]  Yeah, well, you look at the Barack Obama, you know, he went to this place called Harvard Law School, you don't have to be that smart to go there.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:32.880]  A lot of idiots go there. Obama has never created anything in his life. So obviously he wants to take credit for something because he's trying to rewrite his legacy.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:40.880]  That's what Obama is about. That's what most of these so called politicians are about. But at the fundamental level, Alex, we actually have a solution.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:47.880]  And I've talked about it before on how we can actually overcome this attack on free speech. And maybe we should talk about it when we get back.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:56.880]  But it's fundamentally using the framework of the institutions that the founders set up. One of them is called the United States Postal Service, which was actually set up to protect free speech.
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:06.880]  We need to resurrect that and really use that institution to offer what I call a federal digital service that will protect email social media.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:11.880]  That's a service by the people.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:17.880]  They actually set the post office up because they wanted people to be able to accurately communicate because before the crown would manipulate mail and stuff.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:27.880]  Exactly. The Postal Service was set up. It was the teeth behind the First Amendment up until 1970, nearly 70%.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:37.880]  And it was the secret of the federal expansion the whole country being formed, was communications and accurate communications and fair communications.
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:59.880]  That's how we override Hillary and Soros. It's how we beat the enemy.

[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:21.880]  Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do, saw it through without exemptions.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:29.880]  Well, the mainstream media are so blind to how they attack me. I'm talking about this in the next segment, but they think that when I'm getting attacked,
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:34.880]  I'm getting monetary things taken away that I think I'm losing.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:37.880]  I'm not just trying to make money or I would have joined them.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:39.880]  I'm trying to take the country back.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.880]  I'm trying to defeat them because they're a clear and present danger of nasty, horrible people.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:49.880]  And after they've done all this stuff to us and everybody else, don't they get, we're now just reconordering and reorganizing
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:53.880]  that we're not going to go away, that now they really have.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:57.880]  Because I sort of asked this question earlier and then I forgot to get to the answer.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.880]  We kind of joke around about this too much. This is real authoritarianism.
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.880]  How do we bring a media seat of this and let folks know this is deadly serious?
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:15.880]  Because even if, you know, Shiva, Dr. Shiva, running for Senate doesn't win, he's won by taking the arena.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:18.880]  He will be hurting the globalist and he could win.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.880]  And so that's what we're getting at.
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.880]  So, Shiva, continue here again.
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  What's the best website for folks to visit to find out more about you running for Senate?
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.880]  Thanks, Alex. The best website is Shiva for Senate, the numeral for Senate dot com.
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.880]  And by the way, Alex, you know, we have these awesome magnetic signs, road warrior signs.
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:39.880]  We probably got about a thousand of them out on the road right now.
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:44.880]  And in response to us getting this meme out, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian,
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:48.880]  the Boston Globe, which used to be previously owned by the New York Times.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:55.880]  I think they paid some ridiculous amount of money and then sold it back to some guy who runs the Boston Red Sox here.
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:00.880]  The interesting thing about that is they wrote nearly like a 15 page article, Alex,
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:05.880]  trying to say that Elizabeth Warren did not get into Harvard because she was Native American.
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.880]  And this was a direct response to our explosively growing campaign on the ground.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:16.880]  What's interesting in that article, Alex, is that they don't tell this to the people
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:21.880]  that no university is ever going to say, oh yeah, we hired Alex because he's a Native American.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.880]  We hired Owen because he's Irish.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:31.880]  But Harvard got sued though this year and they had to admit the admissions that they said Asians may have the highest test scores.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:39.880]  But because they test low in our score for having a soul for being funny, we're saying they're stupid.
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:42.880]  That is the most racist, whacked out.
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:48.880]  And that's the thing is how's the left going to deal with the top richest groups per capita being Asians?
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.880]  Nine groups of Asians are on top and then with some white people.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.880]  How in the world are they going to sit there and say, now you put blacks in slave camps?
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:58.880]  I just don't get it.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:07.880]  Yeah, well, remember what the liberal elite do is they actually like to pit black against white, black against yellow.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.880]  They like to create race war.
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:12.880]  So what Harvard, affirmative action was a gain of the civil rights movement.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.880]  It was a band-aid and never really solved the real fundamental issues.
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:24.880]  And what Harvard did was if an Asian American applies, they apply a 20% discount to their SAT scores, for example.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:31.880]  So that's how they were discriminating against Asians and then Asians get upset with black people and black people get upset with Asians.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:37.880]  And Hollywood puts out movies that Asians owning stores are exploitive than to have your own store.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:42.880]  I'm not against black Asian anybody, but like this, I just love how I hardly ever see Asians running around bitching and complaining.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:49.880]  But that's why I think they've hired that racist lady at Harvard, SJW, is they're really trying to find some racist Asians to get that stirred up.
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:50.880]  Right.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  And the thing is, you know, many of these liberal elite always want to do diversity reports.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:59.880]  There's no diversity report done on the faculty composition of Harvard.
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:02.880]  Why don't we do that? And we'll probably find some very illuminating things.
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:04.880]  Well, yeah, they're all basically white.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:08.880]  They're white and let's even do a religious analysis.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:10.880]  If you were to say that, that's not allowed.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:13.880]  So the bottom line is, you know, they do analysis of other people.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:17.880]  Right. You just hit it. A certain religion dominates it, which exactly.
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:21.880]  And then it's leftist that are always pushing race because they're obsessed with it.
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:23.880]  Right. But they don't put it on themselves.
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:31.880]  So Elizabeth Warren, you know, will wants a white guy on stage with her, a dumb white guy, you know, a dumb white guy who's a fake Republican,
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.880]  because the Democrats want, you know, real Republicans, real conservatives, not really to be exposed.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.880]  No, exactly.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:39.880]  Look, if you got on the stage, you could probably win an upset.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:41.880]  And so we got to get you in there.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  Absolutely.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:45.880]  Let's come back and do a few minutes with you, though, on the history of the post office, because you know your stuff.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.880]  I want to hear your plan for that.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.880]  And then Owen, I'm going to ask you a big question straight out.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.880]  This is a big question.
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:55.880]  So folks, stay with us and spread those links or Soros wins. Seriously.
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:59.880]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.880]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States.
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:08.880]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:16.880]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:22.880]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:28.880]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:32.880]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:39.880]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:44.880]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:50.880]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:06:15.880]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:37.880]  She was running for Congress and he's really got Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas mad.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.880]  She doesn't want him in the debates.
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:43.880]  But just finishing up, you have a plan for the post office that I find intriguing.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:47.880]  And I read about Benjamin Franklin and the whole setting up of the post office and the plan.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:51.880]  Because the British were always manipulating mail and charging you more or less.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.880]  And things were notoriously might take a year to even, you know, go 500 miles.
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:56.880]  People were really sick of it.
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:01.880]  And our post office was like the model of well oiled corporate machines later.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:06.880]  So how did our government then deliver a system because it was privatized that now has become such a problem?
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:08.880]  And I know big companies want to get rid of it.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:12.880]  But couldn't we reform it to create checks and balances with the private corporates?
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:14.880]  That's a big debate.
[02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:16.880]  What's your plan, doctor?
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:20.880]  So Alex, I don't want to promote anything, but this is a pretty good book I wrote.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.880]  It's called The Future of Email.
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:24.880]  And I say it's here and it's dangerous.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:25.880]  And one of the chapters.
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.880]  You're the inventor of email on record.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.880]  I invented the first email system.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.880]  So I know a little bit about email.
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:32.880]  One of the chapters I have, you can see it.
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.880]  It's called Hillary's email and the new caste system.
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:41.880]  And what I talk about in this book is that when the post office was set up,
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:49.880]  it was set up as just like the checks and balances of the United States government.
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:52.880]  The post office was a very important institution.
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:54.880]  And the goal was that I could send an email to Alex.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:58.880]  Alex could send an email to Owen and no one would intervene with it.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:01.880]  And if they did, 20 year prison sentence, right?
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:05.880]  And it was also designed low cost and it was pretty amazing.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:12.880]  And the postal service still today is quite amazing that you could send for a, you know, a small amount of money, letters all over.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:15.880]  And in fact, Amazon exploits a U.S. Postal Service.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:16.880]  Exactly.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:20.880]  And if it wasn't there, that infrastructure wasn't there, the corporates would triple charges.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:21.880]  Exactly.
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.880]  So the Postal Service is an amazing institution.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:33.880]  Now, in 1997, you know, one of the companies I did separate from the invention of email was to actually analyze email that grew to a very large company.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:43.880]  And in 1997, the reason I bring up that date was that was a date that email volume exceeded snail mail or paper mail volume.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:45.880]  And I saw this very interesting trend.
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:56.880]  Four years before that, you had companies like Hotmail, Yahoo, Google came, came into the mix and they were offering public free email services.
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.880]  Everyone remember this 1993?
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:01.880]  1993 was when those companies started coming.
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:04.880]  Now, 1997, email volume exceed.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.880]  So I actually met with the Postal Service while I was running my company Echo Mail.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:11.880]  And I said, look, there's a serious problem here.
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:20.880]  The U.S. Postal Service should offer a public email service as an alternative to these private free email services.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:23.880]  And you guys could probably charge about 50 bucks.
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:30.880]  And but you would protect the email because that would put under federal laws umbrella that no one can read it.
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:31.880]  Exactly.
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:35.880]  Because what most Americans don't know is when they sign up for their free Google.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:36.880]  Is it Google and all of them?
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:37.880]  Read it all, sell it all.
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:38.880]  Read it all.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:42.880]  And they're signing away, frankly, their freedom because it says they own it.
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:45.880]  You were growing up hearing about dictatorships in third world countries where they read your mail.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.880]  You'd get so pissed.
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:47.880]  Right.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:51.880]  Family that lived in Central America and they'd send us letters that all be ripped open and nothing in it.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:53.880]  It was like, oh, he's outrageous tyrants.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:54.880]  But here it's happened.
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:55.880]  Right.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:57.880]  So that's what Google and Facebook are fundamentally doing.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:59.880]  So the Postal Service was set up.
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:05.880]  So the Postal Service, these guys are making a lot of money, these fat cats, not innovators like Franklin.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:06.880]  They laughed at me.
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:08.880]  They said, look, we're in the Postal Service.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:09.880]  We don't need to do that.
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:10.880]  We're in the print mail business.
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:12.880]  What are you talking about email?
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:13.880]  Well, fast forward 2011.
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:17.880]  Sure, they didn't get, then they could have advertisements, then they could have other services.
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:18.880]  They could have been.
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.880]  They could have been the Amazon.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:21.880]  Exactly.
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:27.880]  So fast forward to 2011, the morons at the Postal Service announced that they're going out of business bankrupt.
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:28.880]  Okay.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:29.880]  And I hit them hard again.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:32.880]  And there was an article that came out in Time Magazine.
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.880]  And I said, look, you guys didn't listen to me.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.880]  You should have done what I told you to.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:41.880]  The IG of the Postal Service contacts me.
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:43.880]  And he says, Shiba, what are you talking about?
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:44.880]  And I said, look, I gave this solution.
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:50.880]  He actually hired me, gave me about $100,000 to do two reports.
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:54.880]  And we mapped out, and the reports are public information we can give them to you,
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.880]  which basically show that the Postal Service could make billions of dollars
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.880]  by A, offering a public digital service, not only for email, Alex,
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.880]  but for social media services.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.880]  And it would protect us as Americans.
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:08.880]  Well, again, I delivered those reports.
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:11.880]  They threw them in the trash probably because these guys,
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.880]  you know, lawyer lobbyists affect them.
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.880]  They probably, you know, I haven't done the research,
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:19.880]  but they probably are in collusion with Google, Facebook, et cetera.
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:23.880]  But the opportunities of Postal Service, think about it, has all the infrastructure.
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:26.880]  They have little physical real estate in every little town.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.880]  Well, on that physical real estate, they have the federal law and the culture
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.880]  where they're not allowed to read it.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.880]  But it gets even more interesting, Alex.
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:39.880]  On each of those Postal Service towers, we could put up what are called a mesh network,
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:42.880]  antennas, and we could create our own.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.880]  And there you have a true federal communications network.
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:47.880]  And people are like, this is government.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:48.880]  We don't want that.
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:50.880]  The tech companies are already bigger than government.
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:53.880]  And this is something that I think President Trump will understand.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:57.880]  And Brad Parscale, perhaps, 2020 campaign manager is something, you know,
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:11:58.880]  where she was breaking it down.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.880]  Because it could be a free network that isn't censored,
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:03.880]  and it would destroy Facebook and Google and everyone.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.880]  Yeah, that's a hell of an idea.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:11.880]  So, like, inventor of email comes up with plan to stop big tech censorship,
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.880]  the post office, that's the headline for this segment.
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:16.880]  And that's why they want Sheva off the stage for this debate
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.880]  and not in Congress, this right here.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:21.880]  Because if these big companies won't do it, they should be regulated A
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:23.880]  because they're violating the First Amendment.
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:24.880]  Let them get their money all day.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.880]  Just don't have monopolies.
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:26.880]  But you're right.
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:27.880]  It's the post office.
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.880]  We already have the damn infrastructure.
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:30.880]  Right.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:33.880]  We would create a physical network, which would be independent of AT&T,
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:34.880]  Vodafone, et cetera.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.880]  Because remember what Mumbarak did in Egypt,
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.880]  when the students were protesting, right when the workers came on the street,
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  he shut, he made one phone call to Vodafone.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.880]  We can't have that.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.880]  So, I'm of a deep, deep...
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:50.880]  Because we have Google and the big tech companies attacking Trump and the U.S. government
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:53.880]  for foreign assets trying to stop our elections.
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:56.880]  We need our own U.S. communications.
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:58.880]  We do need U.S. communications.
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:12:59.880]  We talked about the Second Amendment.
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:02.880]  We talk about the Second Amendment, but the pen is mightier than the sword.
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:07.880]  And the First Amendment has been gutted because we've gutted the U.S. Postal Service.
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.880]  And one of the things I would do is to lay out that architecture,
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:15.880]  resurrect the Postal Service. And anything goes on it, but stuff that's illegal.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.880]  It has to be absolutely open and free.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.880]  That's already protected by the laws.
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:20.880]  We don't have to do that anymore.
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.880]  You know, you can't send illegal stuff.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.880]  But the most important thing is if anyone interferes, it's 20-year federal sense.
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:29.880]  We need a federal digital system.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:32.880]  And we already have, we already pay for it, and it's there.
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.880]  Dr. Sheva, you really are a genius.
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:37.880]  We've got to have you up to do a full hour on this because...
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:38.880]  Alec, let me just finish this one thing.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:42.880]  When Hillary Clinton put her private mail server, we're talking about a caste system.
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:46.880]  So what's going to happen is a wealthy people will create their own digital networks,
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.880]  and we get the free crap from, you know, Facebook, Google, everyone else.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.880]  You see, they're creating a two-tiered communication.
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:53.880]  That's what they all do.
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:55.880]  And then they cut us out of the marketplace.
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.880]  Exactly.
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.880]  So, Alec, I think the fundamental issue here is we're probably going to have a revolution in this country
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.880]  the way things are going with this kind of banning.
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:09.880]  But the patriots like you, myself, others, the quote-unquote alternative media,
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.880]  we need to start organizing as one united front.
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:15.880]  That is also another piece of this.
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:16.880]  No, that's the answer.
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:17.880]  Not just President Trump taking action.
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:22.880]  We have to organize into a united front for the First Amendment and deploy ideas,
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:28.880]  both that are positive and also that are administrative to people
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:30.880]  that are already corporately usurping us.
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:31.880]  We're not calling for regulations.
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.880]  We're calling for laws to block corporate usurpation.
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:37.880]  Well, in fact, that's what happened.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:42.880]  In the Reagan era, DHL and FedEx, the lobbyists gutted the Postal Service.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:48.880]  They took away all the very valuable services and they left the Postal Service with the spoils.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:51.880]  That's what happened in the 80s, and that's why we're suffering today.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:56.880]  Alec, you know, look, the debates are planned against the fake Trump or the fake Indian,
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.880]  and we want to plan massive protests.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:01.880]  So if you guys want to come here, we should do this.
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:05.880]  There's a historic opportunity to expose a fake Indian and the fake Trumpers.
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:06.880]  No, I agree.
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:08.880]  I'm going into the third dimension now.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:10.880]  They're kicking me out of the internet.
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:11.880]  What's that?
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:12.880]  We're going to come.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:13.880]  Yeah, you guys got to come.
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.880]  We got to raise hell because this is where the revolution took place.
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.880]  And I'm telling you this singular issue of trying to keep a real Indian off the stage
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:25.880]  by Elizabeth Warren, who claims is a huge historic opportunity to expose these people.
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:28.880]  And I say we need to create a massive, massive movement.
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:30.880]  And what better place in Massachusetts?
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:31.880]  Alec, you're invited.
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:32.880]  Oh, and you're invited.
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:36.880]  We got to get all the media people here, and we got to take this down.
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:39.880]  And if they don't let me on that stage, we need to raise hell.
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:43.880]  And that hell needs to be why they attacked Alex Jones, why they're...
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:44.880]  Well said.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:45.880]  Well said.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:46.880]  Again, the best website for folks to visit.
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:47.880]  Shiva for Senate.
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.880]  SHIVA for Senate.

[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:07.880]  Remember?
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:15.880]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:23.880]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they feel.
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.880]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.880]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:33.880]  A first home.

[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:59.880]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:00.880]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:03.880]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.880]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:09.880]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:10.880]  I can help you too.

[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:27.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.080]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:37.960]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:43.520]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.760]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:53.000]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.160]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:00.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.240]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:06.760]  to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:11.640]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:13.160]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:18.040]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:19.880]  the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:25.080]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.080]  a year.
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:30.480]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:31.720]  as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:35.880]  You want to yourself, you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:41.040]  in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:46.400]  because we need you, the remnant of America to reignite those rush fires the next level
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:50.040]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:51.040]  together.
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:52.040]  We're changing the world.
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:58.920]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:16.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war.
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:33.600]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones here back live on Troy Rodgers shotgun coming up about an hour
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:34.600]  and a half.
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:38.640]  He'll be live with the war room with Roger Stone for as long as he's here before he
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:39.640]  gets indicted.
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:45.760]  And of course they've got the Obama, Hillary version of the FBI breathing down my neck
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:50.440]  doing just insane bonker stuff I can't tell you about but they're not just trying to take
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:51.440]  me off the air folks.
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:56.400]  I can, I can tell you that this has reached war level proportions in this country.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  These people are insane.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:02.280]  Now Dr. Steve Pachinick was head of psychological operations of the state department and worked
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:04.520]  with the CIA and was helped found Delta Force.
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:07.760]  He's the bestselling author and of course helped write the whole Jack Ryan series which
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:12.160]  is back now on television as well and work closely with Tom Clancy is one of his main
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.160]  sources.
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:18.960]  And Steve Pachinick for now still on Twitter and StevePachinick.com where with info wars.com
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:25.640]  and news wars.com you told me back in February when they lied in the news and said Jones
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:31.200]  has no one died at Parkland and they took me off YouTube you said YouTube which in Google
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:36.280]  was founded by Incutel and the geospatial center and I knew that was true so was Facebook
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:39.920]  and it will be stopped you will be back up three days later they said rogue groups did
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:44.480]  it the Southern Prairie Law Center Bloomberg reported Alex Jones is back up.
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.960]  So I know there's governmental connections and I know there's a CIA stay behind group
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:52.720]  that Obama signed an executive order on in December of 2016 and I know that's what's
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:59.680]  going on and who the officers of it are we've got this guy at CNN that's that's that's one
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:01.480]  of the heads of it.
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:06.120]  These are some real snot noses and I confronted one of them and that's they said oh I'm banned
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:08.320]  for talking to him it's like he's royalty.
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:16.520]  He tells this Brandon Darcy guy tells Twitter what to do literally because they think it's
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:20.880]  from like Obama like he's still the president they still call him Mr. President and he's
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:21.960]  sitting there doing it.
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:27.560]  So you showed you know what's going on Dr. Steve Pachennick so I've kind of set the
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:32.360]  table and we're not trying to act like we're in a spy thriller it's beyond that at this
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:37.400]  point this is really happening so I know you say you've got intel on who the real fake
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.160]  op-ed pieces of the resistance of the New York Times you say you've got more intel but
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:47.000]  just a selfish question they're not just purging me it's thousands a day I mean millions total
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:53.040]  this 60 days out I think they're scared but this is so un-American what's happening then
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:58.360]  they lie about who they ban so doc what's your intel on this purge because you were right
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:02.480]  last time that it would be stopped you're saying hey this fight isn't over yet and which
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:07.080]  is strange on Twitter and YouTube we can give them the back end it's all still there usually
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:13.000]  when you get banned it's gone it's still there so doc what's going on here.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:19.240]  I think several things number one Jack Dorsey's in severe trouble number one I'm an owner
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:27.000]  of Twitter I own thousands of shares of Twitter and he has to come back as the CEO and explain
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:34.840]  why he's losing millions and millions of dollars and can't account for being an effective CEO
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:41.360]  so Twitter is in financial troubles as I said to Owen months ago Facebook is a disaster
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:48.840]  it's in financial down spiral because they found out that the model and the paradigm
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:57.320]  for Facebook viewer is a older woman married who has been divorced and that just isn't
[02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:03.760]  going to work so you have two companies that are flowing down and basically are heading
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:11.440]  towards severe financial ruin Jack Dorsey is a terrible CEO he is heading up square which
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:17.080]  fortunately is doing better but he has no idea of how to handle Twitter and how to monetize
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:24.480]  it the irony is as a stockholder I went and tried to reach Jack Dorsey before any of your
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:29.840]  problems came up and honestly I there was nowhere to get there number one he may not
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:36.600]  even exist it's a virtual reality you call up Twitter in San Francisco you get a voicemail
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:41.640]  the voicemail tells you to write on the internet and the internet tells you that this is a virtual
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:48.480]  reality and the what do we call it the quarterly reviews are not done in person they're virtual
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:55.120]  reality so Dempsey has a real problem right now as the CEO who may be thrown out of a
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:59.920]  company that he really doesn't know how to work let me ask you this we know they set
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:06.960]  up the CIA office this is admitted and Senator Warner is running it and then you've got these
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.720]  media people from the Washington Times the Washington Post the New York Times and other
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:16.680]  areas that literally tell Twitter and Google what to do I mean they brag they call and
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:23.080]  they ban whoever they say what is that nexus who's in command of that I don't know who
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:28.480]  is the particular individual who's in command but you have to remember the this type of the
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:35.160]  internet analysis of this type of internet existence is binary it's one in zero Roger
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:41.200]  Stone said something very accurate months ago and I do agree with them you guys are
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:48.720]  literally the test case of what happens in the internet world when you have dissension
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:55.240]  compromise and you begin to push the system too hard and what's happening is the system
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:01.800]  can handle it they talking about algorithms and I told one of my guys and NGA this has
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:07.800]  nothing to do with algorithms because I was demonetized I'm demonetized repeatedly for
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:14.960]  my blogs and my videos and I explained that you have that in of we call in Google they
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.880]  have over 10,000 people who evaluate what is correct not correct now to show you how
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:28.160]  incompetent Google is and Facebook is and any other of the internet companies you have
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:35.400]  to go back 10 years ago where I had a medical company nutritional company in Montana called
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:42.120]  NBI which I found it created and developed and then with my partner we had to pay $6,000
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:49.080]  a month for SEO search engine optimization because then Google was telling us that we're
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:55.920]  too commercial so what's happening is the rise of a fascist entity within these high
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:27:03.760]  tech companies and I do not think the military or the system that created it I DARPA CIA
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.880]  was very was aware what they had done and what they created so let me stop you right
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:14.200]  there because I was there the only senator that got on this was cotton and he said Google
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:19.760]  now refuses to work with the Pentagon on machine learning but is helping China in weapon systems
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:23.920]  machine learning they should be SWAT teamed immediately I mean that is treason and it's
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:28.720]  true and then they're they're moving to China helping sensor and they're doing all this
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.040]  helping shut me down saying I'm a bad bad person when they're working with China and
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.280]  other authoritarian regimes and only cotton got it you just said it Google is monstrous
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:46.800]  that's correct the irony of Google is that Brian the Soviet Jew who started this along
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:52.560]  with age came out of Stanford I told him that look had I known what you would have ended
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:58.960]  up to be you became exactly like the Soviet Union that I had to take down in order for
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:04.480]  you to come here to the United States and create Google so what you have with the leaders
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:10.200]  now is a fascist state and they're acting very much along the same lines from where they
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:16.200]  came up we call that identification with the aggressive but the reality is now that NGA
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:21.920]  National Geospatial Agency and other military units and intelligence units are going to
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:27.840]  have to correct what's happening and they're aware of it they want to know exactly to what
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:35.160]  extent this will carry on but basically the American public has to be able to retaliate
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:41.840]  by number one banning the products not using numbers let's talk about how we launch counter
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:46.040]  assaults informationally not violently they keep saying we're violent against these people
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:51.800]  I mean Google is literally in bed with China at this point I mean Google has its legs back
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:59.160]  behind it too hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried

[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:22.880]  all right I want Troy to write a shot again with me when jumping anytime down street pictures
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:27.640]  of steedpress.com bestselling author one of the founders Delta force your really smart
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:32.440]  patriot guys super accurate he's been on the show for like 17 years he came on about a
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:37.220]  6-8 months after 9-11 he's and just the more he's been on over the years the more right
[02:33:37.220 --> 02:33:42.660]  he's been the one thing he was wrong about is he was right about it to was back after
[02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:48.100]  For Valentine's Day, I got banned on YouTube over totally fake stuff I didn't say.
[02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:51.020]  Which I had a right to say if I wanted to say nobody died at Parkland, I could have,
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:52.020]  but I didn't.
[02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:55.820]  I said they picked four kids out of 3,000 that are in the school actor club.
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:58.660]  They said they were on NBC to be anti-gun PR people.
[02:33:58.660 --> 02:33:59.820]  That's totally true.
[02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:00.820]  And the police stood down.
[02:34:00.820 --> 02:34:04.740]  We were the first to report that because we had local kids on it who said it.
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.060]  Later it was confirmed.
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:09.940]  So they banned two of your videos and one of mine knocked us off and Pachennik said,
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:13.740]  you know, I've talked to people, Geospatial is involved, all these groups, they're putting
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:14.740]  pressure on it.
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:16.540]  And I know Trump's put pressure on it.
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:19.460]  And I told people Trump would come out and start moving against him, which he is.
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:24.500]  The word is executive orders this week or next week, this next week's already here.
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:25.820]  But the president can't do everything.
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:27.460]  He's totally surrounded.
[02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:32.900]  And so Pachennik said, watch, and three days later it was back up and then Bloomberg came
[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:37.420]  out and said rogue groups did it, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:40.180]  But they just keep moving forward and again, it's not about me.
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:42.580]  They're banning everybody else right now.
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:43.580]  Like they don't care.
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:44.580]  It's so criminal.
[02:34:44.580 --> 02:34:46.700]  Who's ordering them to do it?
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:51.980]  Well, Senator Warner, they said in the hearing, thank you for your memos, which say we'll
[02:34:51.980 --> 02:35:00.660]  federalize you if you don't ban all the conservatives and they make statements, Whiten, Warner, and
[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:06.260]  the guy out of Maine, Murphy says, Jones is only the tip of the iceberg, banned thousands
[02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:07.260]  of sites.
[02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:10.540]  These people are naked authoritarians.
[02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:13.460]  This is like stuff out of history books.
[02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:20.420]  And they're this weird leftist cabal with a John Warner Defense Authorization Act of
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:23.060]  2017 funding this crap.
[02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:25.220]  The president needs to go bust that up.
[02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:30.380]  They call it, you know, countering foreign propaganda Disinformation Act, but it's countering
[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:32.420]  us that are trying to make the country great again.
[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:34.980]  So Dr. Pachennik, how do you quantify this?
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:37.340]  How do we stop these groups 60 days out?
[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:38.340]  What do you think they're planning?
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:43.500]  And you said you've got the big bomb shell from your sources on who the supposed Maine
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:49.900]  author of this fable is, this, you know, this whole canard that we've seen the New York
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:54.660]  Times, the same anonymous sources, you know, we're telling us about WMDs in Iraq and the
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:36:00.060]  Tooth Fairy delivering money to children that lose their mandibles.
[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:02.660]  Let me start why I came out on the show, though.
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:05.980]  I will assure you, you will remain on the show.
[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:11.620]  There are too many elements of the intelligence community that are involved in the different
[02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:12.620]  organizations.
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:18.300]  Furthermore, all of your people, actually, your show went up in numbers, as I understand.
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:21.500]  More and more people are watching you and understanding what you're doing.
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:27.780]  And you're really acting as the 1776 patriot against the system that we're just beginning
[02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:31.420]  to understand how repressive it has become.
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:39.060]  It will eventually have to be regulated, and it will be regulated once Trump understands
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:45.220]  the severity of what's going on and the fact how many of our intelligence units are involved
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:46.980]  in the creation of these things.
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:53.420]  Of course, as you know, I was trained in DARPA 1972 by the CIA and by DARPA on the internet
[02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:54.780]  and social media.
[02:36:54.780 --> 02:37:01.380]  So Zuckerberg and Gates and all the other Bezos, all that other nonsense, was nothing
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:03.860]  more than derivative of DARPA.
[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:08.980]  So eventually, this goes back to the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and those
[02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:15.820]  in the Pentagon who will decide how much more will be tolerated in terms of your dissemination
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:16.820]  of information.
[02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:20.100]  You will not go off the air as you think you might.
[02:37:20.100 --> 02:37:24.020]  It'll take a little bit of time, but there will be repercussions.
[02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:27.860]  The people in the United States will not accept this.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:34.020]  There will be organizations and stockholders like myself who will not accept it from Jack
[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:35.100]  Dorsey.
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:41.180]  And we will demand that he be thrown out because he's not in charge of the financial elements.
[02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:44.460]  Forget the fact that he doesn't know what he's doing, and he's not very bright when
[02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:46.260]  it comes to political issues.
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:47.620]  He's not bright at all.
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:52.900]  But we're talking about a whole bunch of Silicon Valley kind of fact-idiotons, guys who are
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:57.380]  bright in one thing they do, but are not too bright in anything else, where they create
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:01.620]  algorithms that they think really are the ones that are impartial when in fact they
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:03.380]  use people.
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:05.900]  And those people will be held accountable.
[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:07.740]  So time will tell what happens.
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:13.340]  I'm not going to make you a specific prediction, but I will say that you will remain on the
[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:17.660]  air and you will be a viable alternative to what's happening in the future.
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:18.660]  Well, you're right.
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:19.940]  I mean, our core audience has gone up.
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:22.380]  It's hard to reach a lot of new people what they've done.
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:26.940]  We are exploding on commercial TV and radio, so thanks to the listeners.
[02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:27.940]  We're holding a line.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:31.100]  I've got all these Soros back suits that we can beat, but it takes money.
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:36.100]  My point is, this is flagrantly authoritarian, and so what do you think the president should
[02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:37.100]  do?
[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:44.020]  Well, the president has to first find out who in fact did that attempted coup with the
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.020]  New York Times.
[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:46.020]  Let's expand.
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:47.020]  You're absolutely right.
[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:51.020]  That was a 25th Amendment call, and you've got all the leftists on every major channel
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:54.580]  and all these intelligence ops saying, get rid of the president desperately.
[02:38:54.580 --> 02:38:56.020]  The Woodward thing fell flat.
[02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:57.020]  This is falling flat.
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:38:58.020]  But exactly.
[02:38:58.020 --> 02:38:59.860]  Who do you think's behind that from your sources?
[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:05.380]  In my analysis and what I've told my intelligence people, and they're interested in hearing
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:10.340]  what I have to say today because I said I'm specifically going on your show to explain
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:15.260]  why I think the person I'm choosing is the one who wrote it.
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:19.940]  Number one, this person went to Yale, Bob Woodward went to Yale.
[02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:25.060]  There are no accidents in intelligence and in terms of sequence of events.
[02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:29.900]  When Bob Woodward came out with his book, Fake, he's a complete sociopath.
[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:35.020]  I've known him since the 1970s and 80s when he lied about Nixon.
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:38.740]  He lied about Valerie Plain.
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:44.660]  He's basically a sociopath who's been very successful in the world of fiction.
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:49.860]  However, there's an equal sociopath who I've warned a year ago not to bring him in.
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:54.860]  I believe that the man behind the actual writing of the New York Times was none other than
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:40:00.420]  John Bolton, or as he likes to call himself, Ambassador Bolton, but he's not an ambassador.
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:01.420]  Why?
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:03.860]  Because like Bob Woodward, he went to Yale.
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:09.660]  Like Mike Pence, he was a Catholic who was very religious, and yet he was a hypocrite,
[02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:12.940]  a liar, and the deceit.
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:17.660]  Bolton's whole life has been nothing but self-aggrandizement, allying himself with
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:23.780]  Ginza, the Jewish organizations, BB Netanyahu, and he's extremely stupid.
[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:28.140]  In the world of national security, we do not listen to John Bolton.
[02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:30.780]  And the reason for that, it's very simple.
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:37.700]  We military officers or ex-military officers like Pompeo, like Mattis, like Nakasone, like
[02:40:37.700 --> 02:40:44.620]  Kelly, we would never tolerate the nonsense that he has provided and at the same time
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:51.100]  hidden behind the fact that he is a war hawk, a neocon, who in 9-11 insisted we go into
[02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:53.260]  Iraq, destroyed Iraq.
[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:55.900]  At the same time, he insisted we go to Libya.
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:57.460]  We destroyed Libya.
[02:40:57.460 --> 02:41:02.500]  And when North Korea said he's a moron, they were absolutely right because he has no idea
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:03.500]  of what he's done.
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:04.500]  So you think it's Bolton.
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:08.060]  Why did Trump let him in?
[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:11.840]  The reason I think it's Bolton is number one, he's a total sociopath.
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:16.140]  Number two, he has strong relationships with accounts on farm relations.
[02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:20.260]  He is completely accepted by the Washington establishment.
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:25.940]  Number three, two of my operatives, intelligence operatives who work with me, Carl Ford, who's
[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:32.540]  a brilliant intelligence operatives, said Bolton's history of bullying is incredible.
[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:36.900]  He bullies the people below him and he sucks up to the people above him.
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:39.300]  And this is what he's done with President Trump.
[02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:44.260]  He's basically bullied him into the corner and bullied the New York Times to say, look,
[02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:49.300]  I have information, but basically I'm going to tell you I'm working with the people, but
[02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:52.860]  at the same time, I'm going to hide behind the covers.
[02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:57.500]  And this is typical John Bolton, who said we should go into Vietnam.
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:59.300]  We should yet kill them.
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:03.740]  But I'm not going in there because I'm afraid of dying in the dugouts.
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:06.300]  I'm afraid of getting killed in the paddies.
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:12.740]  I'm afraid, and this is Bolton, who in conjunction with Pence, who is not a very brave man, and
[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:18.380]  I warn Trump not to take Pence in because he doesn't represent the evangelical right.
[02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:24.420]  I happen to live in an area where the evangelical right lives and breathes, and none of them
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:25.420]  are like Pence.
[02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:28.540]  Pence was, again, like Bolton the Catholic.
[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:34.940]  Like Bolton, they were both liars, deceptive, and they violated their code of ethics.
[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:40.780]  And Bolton was convicted for all kinds of crimes under the Taiwan Act and working with
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:41.780]  Jesse Helms.
[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:42.780]  Oh, we've got to go to break.
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:45.780]  So you're now implicating, you're saying Pence is involved in this axis.
[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:47.660]  Well, he's a coward.
[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:52.500]  Basically he is the one who will succeed if the 25th Amendment comes in.
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:53.500]  So you always ask yourself.
[02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:54.500]  That's right.
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:55.500]  He stands for 25th Amendment.
[02:42:55.500 --> 02:43:01.180]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site
[02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:06.220]  now, if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider

[02:43:14.900 --> 02:43:20.940]  here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship, in which they
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:24.300]  want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:03.700]  To demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:09.020]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:11.540]  children and Islamophobia.

[02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:38.260]  going to stop and I feel good out of CPShanks our guests CPShanks.com I want shroyer host
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:42.820]  the war room riding shotgun with me here's the paradox though from stone good on the
[02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:46.500]  economy good instincts and a lot of stuff.
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:52.060]  What man does he bring in a barrel of snakes and Bolton is a crazy neocon I want to think
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:55.420]  nice things about Ben's you know I don't want to get pins in trouble with the media
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:48:00.820]  but he said some nice things to our crew that he met with once but I do see Nikki Haley
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:06.060]  and him a lot of folks are going to run in 2020 if Trump gets in trouble Haley always
[02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:11.140]  throws one of the bus she does all this crap I see pins always stand out of it I see the
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:17.820]  media leaving pins alone and that's where I think Pachennik's right is that he's like
[02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:23.540]  the golden boy and the 25th amendment play where you've got Woodward Bernstein all the
[02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:28.620]  usual snakes of the whole deep state globalist arm saying we're moving we're moving we're
[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:32.780]  moving we're moving he's so horrible he's so horrible so a Trump's blind spot why does
[02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:36.860]  he bring him in what keeps your enemies closer I don't think so I think they say like business
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:40.820]  he thinks if I bring in other business competitors and they're all part of the table they'll
[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:45.060]  work with me but it's not about that it's about pissing on America dr. Pachennik what
[02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:51.140]  do you think all right let me go back to my real intelligence roots and get to something
[02:48:51.140 --> 02:49:01.860]  that may not be so savory John Bolton's history is really highly contrived and distorted by
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:07.660]  the way he says it but we know for a fact for example his first marriage which lasted
[02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:13.060]  for a few years was broken up because he was a swinger now it doesn't look like this man
[02:49:13.060 --> 02:49:18.780]  could be a swinger the son of a postman deep Catholic just like Mike Pence who eventually
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:26.700]  converted to Lutheran spent many of his hours and days at Plato retreat in New York swinging
[02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:33.260]  around in sex now he was accompanied by another gentleman by the name of bush jr. he does have
[02:49:33.260 --> 02:49:38.580]  a pervert mustache sorry go back to bush jr. go ahead and bush jr. was involved in this
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:44.100]  retreat and there was another gentleman when he was much much younger he can deny it if
[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:50.740]  he wants and that was Donald Trump so the alliances were talking about are not alliances
[02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:56.420]  of intellect they're not alliances of ideology they're alliances of vulnerability which is
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:02.540]  what I've said for years when I teach at the war college you choose your partners not because
[02:50:02.540 --> 02:50:07.900]  they're strong but because you can manipulate them because you see their weakness one of
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:14.340]  the reasons you all and myself are not really part of a bigger group is that we don't reveal
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:20.700]  that weakness we don't really want to be part of it and in fact you two guys have really
[02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:26.100]  disturbed the system as I have in my own way so I don't work with I agree they've offered
[02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:29.540]  me money sex everything I just want to go home and hang out with my family and they
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:36.100]  can't stand that I don't want to go have sex with underage girls well the bottom line here
[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:40.740]  is you know it doesn't help when your ex-wife goes on I don't want to get into that it doesn't
[02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:45.940]  help when you have other narratives coming in but when you have vulnerability like John
[02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:51.260]  Bolton you have vulnerability to Bob Woodward who wants to be somebody he's lied he's been
[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:57.220]  compromised he knows he's financially compromised emotionally and intellectually so is John Bolton
[02:50:57.220 --> 02:51:03.940]  they both went to Yale it's not hard to coordinate one the book and then quote the New York Times
[02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:09.420]  now the New York Times is a highly compromised paper if in fact what I say is true and I
[02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:16.020]  do believe it is true then you have two people who are attempting to make a coup directly
[02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:21.540]  that's John Bolton and the people of the New York Times and those who are with John Bolton
[02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:25.980]  and I think it's Mike Pence I said a year ago and this is not something I've come up
[02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:34.620]  recently on February 19th of 2017 I wrote a blog saying do not bring John down John Bolton
[02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:38.700]  and you said it on our show to bring this up we know there's a task force of the New
[02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:45.460]  York Times engaging in criminal activity literally offering people money lie about me and and
[02:51:45.460 --> 02:51:49.740]  they believe their quote gonna overthrow Trump because we had somebody just because a certain
[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:54.060]  person happened to be dating some of the people involved went to a party where they were openly
[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:58.100]  bring drinking and bragging how they're gonna bring down me Trump and how the New York Times
[02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:02.740]  is the heart of a coup with Obama and insiders in the Trump administration I had this two
[02:52:02.740 --> 02:52:07.260]  weeks ago from someone that was in the party so it's funny you're saying that the New York
[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:14.060]  Times at the heart of this well let's let's go back again let us talk about we know about
[02:52:14.060 --> 02:52:20.540]  Trump we know about his background so what I is it really relevant that he had intercourse
[02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:26.220]  with number of women and all that he said no that's not really relevant what is more relevant
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:33.100]  is you have a guy like Obama who lied pathologically from day one who was a CIA operative who was
[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:38.460]  not born in the United States but he is American thanks to his mother who's a brilliant CIA
[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:44.380]  operative who in fact did not go to Columbia but did go to Occidental College who had a
[02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:51.180]  history of homosexual activity with Rami Emanuel in Chicago way before he ever came in and had
[02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:57.740]  a history of cocaine addiction as did Bush Jr. as did Clinton so where exactly is the
[02:52:57.740 --> 02:53:05.260]  moral compass on Trump when I'm giving you this entire panoply of dysfunctional behavior
[02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:11.900]  I have a John F. Kennedy with Addison's disease who could not function I have an LBJ a pathological
[02:53:11.900 --> 02:53:20.140]  liar who screwed his own Diane whatever her name was the historian I have a pathological
[02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:25.660]  father Bush Sr. who might have been involved and was involved in the JFK assassination
[02:53:25.660 --> 02:53:31.820]  the Reagan assassination and I have a Woodrow Wilson who had been in coma for a year and a half
[02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:37.420]  what is the problem in the United States when they do not know the history of their presidents
[02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:43.900]  suddenly Trump is the person who's erratic not exactly is he the only one who didn't know how
[02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:49.820]  to make decisions who doesn't understand foreign policy not really did he bring in all of these
[02:53:49.820 --> 02:53:55.500]  people for what reason he's a businessman he does what he needs to do does he deny he was dealing
[02:53:55.500 --> 02:54:01.180]  with the mafia no does he act like a mafia guy yes so what he's from New York so am I
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:06.460]  we all know who does the mafia we all know who does waste management we all know who does the
[02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:14.540]  casinos but when you come forth in self-righteousness as a John Bolton or Mike Pence or Bob Woodward
[02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:20.540]  when you are self-righteous and you are coward and you are corrupt then you have a problem
[02:54:20.540 --> 02:54:26.780]  all three elements will come for self-destruction and trust me Bob Woodward will go under Mike Pence
[02:54:26.780 --> 02:54:32.300]  will have to resign because he knows very well he has done nothing his whole life has been
[02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:35.900]  but I was about to say that Woodward thing was supposed to be the take down it was out two
[02:54:35.900 --> 02:54:41.420]  days and I pulled it back completely that's correct because it was false all he had was a year ago
[02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:49.020]  Woodward makes up materials I happen to have been on the Montgomery County Sentinel in the 1970s as
[02:54:49.020 --> 02:54:54.460]  a drama critic when the head of the Montgomery County Sentinel said I have to give cover to a
[02:54:54.460 --> 02:55:00.300]  Navy intelligence officer who worked with Admiral Welland and that Navy intelligence officer was
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:06.540]  none other than Bob Woodward there was no deep throat there was no mysterious thing he was getting
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:13.180]  information as was Kissinger and Alex Hague from the intelligence reports that Admiral Welland had
[02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:19.820]  created in a soft coup so Bob Woodward was involved in what we call a soft coup and Nixon
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:24.860]  administration and of course the corrupt establishment goes back to the underlings that are still alive
[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:30.780]  of that very op hey you had success before do it again well that's the point vulnerability and
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:37.020]  sociopathy picks itself constantly so when you picked on Rubio I thought it was fantastic
[02:55:37.020 --> 02:55:42.380]  Rubio comes from north central Florida he claims he's Cuban no he's not Cuban he's American he
[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:48.220]  claims his family escaped because of communist absolute nonsense they came because they wanted
[02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:54.220]  to have a financial future which I don't blame them under the dictator Batista not under Fidel
[02:55:54.220 --> 02:56:00.460]  Castro he himself has a history of homosexual activities I want him to deny it he has a history
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:06.220]  of being not too bright having gone to Santa Fe college he has a history where his brother-in-law
[02:56:06.220 --> 02:56:10.780]  is a major drug pusher in Miami I come from why did he because I was already there with the press
[02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:14.700]  they come out the door why did he blow up immediately and start saying he didn't know who I was
[02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:21.020]  because he knows who you are and because he doesn't know how to handle you you see the beauty of
[02:56:21.020 --> 02:56:27.420]  Alex Jones and Owen shroy and info wars the reason why we appreciate your being there as well as
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:33.660]  the intelligence community is you're creating dissension in a system that is so corrupt that
[02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:39.820]  is replete with sociopaths including the ones who run the high tech that we're watching literally
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:45.340]  the oscillation of what's called the republic I'm not saying a democracy we're not a democracy we're
[02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:52.620]  a republic so when Alex Jones comes in and quote acts funny or you know you can do your rift but I

[02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:28.300]  to seek we got to come back but what we've got is a bunch of globalists that have only inside the

[02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:43.500]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support
[02:59:43.500 --> 02:59:51.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:51.820 --> 03:00:10.780]  go crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[03:00:13.900 --> 03:00:18.700]  all right rubber sepulchionic has been on fire today laying out who he thinks the main culprits
[03:00:18.700 --> 03:00:23.260]  are and you use that pole star thing which means north star guiding star but that can be planted
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:29.500]  to but i agree that you've got the whole background who stands to gain pence always staying out of it
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:34.780]  the media not going out for pence and leaving him and actually saying he's a good guy and then
[03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:39.500]  saying please 25th amendment he's got to know though as soon as he did that they turn on him as well
[03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:44.540]  but i think there is overwhelming evidence that pence is trying to form a 24th amendment move
[03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:50.780]  if he thinks the weather is right owen well and let's go back to some other clues to to
[03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:55.820]  steve's point that he thinks bolton was the author of the new york time new york times op ed
[03:00:55.820 --> 03:01:03.020]  you had them put load star in the story well that's easily planted so you can create you know a chaos
[03:01:03.020 --> 03:01:07.180]  between trump and pence so that's obvious oh it's definitely meant to make trump go crazy
[03:01:07.180 --> 03:01:12.060]  and then you've got the fact that the entire op ed is basically praising john mccain saying
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:16.860]  mccain's vision was correct well bolton is mccain mccain is bolton they were one in the same two
[03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:21.820]  peas in a pod and i think that there's another thing that's kind of sitting on the outskirts of
[03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:24.860]  this that we're kind of forgetting right now because there hasn't been too much activity there
[03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:30.540]  but get that off screen god you've got the syrian war where they're trying to get america to intervene
[03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:35.180]  in syria again and they're saying all this thing oh you have more a chemical attacks are coming
[03:01:35.180 --> 03:01:40.860]  aside meanwhile syria is doing better than it has in years syria is being liberated right now
[03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:45.100]  and they try to make up all these lies like Assad wants to to stop that from happening no Assad is
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:51.260]  behind it so i think also in another angle alex they want to re kick off us intervention in syria
[03:01:51.260 --> 03:01:55.100]  and maybe they think if they can bully trump enough and and create enough chaos in the
[03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:59.740]  administration they can kind of just go forward with syrian intervention without trump even noticing
[03:02:00.300 --> 03:02:04.380]  well oh we got to do one more statement with dr pichett because obviously the residents are like
[03:02:04.380 --> 03:02:08.780]  don't do a false flag right when they're about to get that last group of ices clearly i kind of get
[03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:13.580]  trump's point like they want to keep a spot so iran can't come in because we fully let russia win
[03:02:13.580 --> 03:02:17.340]  then that would be a whole bather's regime and then maybe iran would have some power
[03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:21.260]  but but i don't want to get into a macky of ellihan deal i mean even though i'm going to
[03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:24.460]  attack wins trump the election i mean i've gotten to the point where i want to beat the
[03:02:24.460 --> 03:02:29.740]  democrats so bad i'm just being honest i'm having evil visions here dr pichett the truth of the
[03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:35.020]  matter is what oh and it's saying number one the notion that trump has colluding with the russians
[03:02:35.020 --> 03:02:40.780]  is absurd i've said it on your show has he not been kicking a living hell out of them well in
[03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:49.980]  february 2018 he literally ordered the assassination of 500 russian operatives who worked under the
[03:02:49.980 --> 03:02:58.140]  Wagner group w a g n e r who are mercenaries for the g r u who attacked our brave special forces
[03:02:58.140 --> 03:03:06.060]  in northern syria 32 of them and mattis and kelly told them to de-conflict russia refused
[03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:14.060]  putin refused so trump ordered mattis to bring in b 52 is a patchy helicopters in hui and within
[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:22.380]  four hours we killed over 400 russian mercenaries who had t 72 tanks and artillery and howitzers
[03:03:22.380 --> 03:03:28.940]  and none of our men were touched now you're telling me that trump uh basically colludes with russians
[03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:34.620]  have to killing 500 of them and he didn't even say a word he was about to say that and somebody
[03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:40.620]  shut him off so he's much smarter than anybody realizes but pence has to go pence and his people
[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:47.500]  have to go john bolton has to go his assistant who i fired david wormser has to go who worked for
[03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:53.820]  cheney you have to remember one thing pence has spent a lot of time with bush senior to find out
[03:03:53.820 --> 03:03:59.980]  what it's like to become vice president to president pence is not an asset to this administration
[03:03:59.980 --> 03:04:08.620]  not gonna push reagan 2.0 i'm sorry it's reagan 2.0 well he's he's worse than that reagan at least
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:12.540]  no i'm saying just like they tried to take out reagan it's a repeat of that and reagan got shot
[03:04:12.540 --> 03:04:21.260]  too well i'm saying is there a repeat of that is a gunless assassination or a coup this is what we
[03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:26.380]  attempt to do and a coup that's why i'm doing a carry no that was your one of your specialties
[03:04:26.380 --> 03:04:31.900]  and it's clear that they're saying pence take over on cnn i mean it's not like you got phil mud going
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:36.780]  kill this guy pence take him out and you've got woodward and mercy get out get him out of there
[03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:41.020]  and the new york times has this scripted thing it's a hundred percent they're saying it so i don't
[03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:46.380]  think there's even a question the establishment wants pence to overthrow trump and i don't think
[03:04:46.380 --> 03:05:12.220]  and and they know trump isn't gonna shut up so well they're right back stay with us back in 60 seconds

[03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:11.660]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex john
[03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:19.660]  this country is fighting for its very existence its identity for the globalists and you know
[03:06:19.660 --> 03:06:26.300]  we're in a time of total war right now we're finishing up with dr. steve pacinic on shawyer's
[03:06:26.300 --> 03:06:30.860]  ride shotgun we've got jill gilbert always loaded for bear commitment about 10 minutes but we were
[03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:37.340]  looking at the cards or the tea leaves here and there's no way that it's not a fact that
[03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:42.540]  that the democrats the deep state the neocons are in all the major papers the news saying take
[03:06:42.540 --> 03:06:48.700]  trump out 25th amendment that's what that op-ed on monday was that totally fake piece and so who
[03:06:48.700 --> 03:06:55.500]  would under the 25th amendment takeover it would be mike pinch so i mean i really don't want to
[03:06:55.500 --> 03:07:00.060]  take away from what pacinic said i'm kind of ashamed of all of us here because it is like
[03:07:00.060 --> 03:07:06.140]  two plus two equals four but sometimes being that obvious could be wrong but i don't know how
[03:07:06.140 --> 03:07:11.820]  pence wouldn't be briefed they wouldn't be pushing this if pence hadn't given the nod at least tacitly
[03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:17.500]  and again he gets left alone by the media all the sudden as soon as they got into office the guns
[03:07:17.500 --> 03:07:22.780]  stopped the left was attacking him before but as soon as he got in everything went silent i think
[03:07:22.780 --> 03:07:27.980]  that tells you something that's them saying trust us do it do it but here's the thing
[03:07:29.100 --> 03:07:31.980]  i know the republicans aren't doing this i'll give you the next level of this
[03:07:31.980 --> 03:07:37.980]  and i'll get both your takes on this because the democrats float in atlantic monthly and at the
[03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:44.780]  pentagon and in white papers in the cfr privately we're going to end elections in this country
[03:07:44.780 --> 03:07:49.180]  federalize them get rid of the republican party except for a regional party have the democrats
[03:07:49.180 --> 03:07:54.380]  break into a communist socialist and then a kind of right wing party so one party rule with a weird
[03:07:54.380 --> 03:07:59.740]  southern you know the stigial thing of republicans and i think the republican blueblood get that their
[03:07:59.740 --> 03:08:04.860]  whole power is about to be removed and that they're not power sharing anymore and so that's why there's
[03:08:04.860 --> 03:08:09.980]  a hold up on this because the fact that the democrats are sharpening their knives for them
[03:08:09.980 --> 03:08:14.780]  i think that's the only reason this hasn't been executed and they fear the people being upset
[03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:22.940]  dr pacenic let me put it this way i'm not going to say it's a wide spectrum of a coup because i
[03:08:22.940 --> 03:08:28.300]  don't think it's there that effective that smart it's really very much focused on these sociopaths
[03:08:28.300 --> 03:08:33.500]  in particular john bolton and the reason why they're trying to get people to carry it out they're like
[03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:39.740]  giving but let me say something he said something at the end that only a diplomat would know when
[03:08:39.740 --> 03:08:45.180]  he said there's a two-track approach to the presidency there is no two-track approach to
[03:08:45.180 --> 03:08:51.900]  the presidency there's a two-track approach to foreign policy and that's where the problem came in
[03:08:51.900 --> 03:08:58.460]  pence should have been fired he has to be fired it's not it it is a coup attempt but it's easy
[03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:04.140]  to bring down our boys are just watching this they know exactly what's going on the republican
[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:10.460]  remain intact you will remain intact what has to go and what you've proven with rubio and others
[03:09:10.460 --> 03:09:17.740]  is that the sociopathy in congress in the senate in the in the political arena is going to stop in
[03:09:17.740 --> 03:09:23.500]  the age of the binary numbers one and zero now where are we going from here we're going even to a
[03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:30.460]  higher level of encryption and coding and computer work which is called quantum which means that these
[03:09:30.460 --> 03:09:36.620]  people are not going to be relevant at all what they're seeing is the relevancy of their presence
[03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:42.060]  and their institutions and these are death rows these are death rows and what you and no one have
[03:09:42.060 --> 03:09:49.260]  done is basically start to throw the sand on their grave and they don't understand how clear they are
[03:09:49.260 --> 03:09:53.260]  being well i don't want to brag about us but i was there in front of senator warren others and they
[03:09:53.260 --> 03:09:58.540]  saw me very close they were horrified and i'm not into power trips because i'm an average guy
[03:09:58.540 --> 03:10:04.140]  but i'm way better than these people were shaking in fear everyone was bowing to them it was very
[03:10:04.140 --> 03:10:09.340]  sick of panic i really made me feel sick well it's no warren i knew warren from maryland the guy is
[03:10:09.340 --> 03:10:14.540]  the sociopath i mean he made his money in the business of telecommunication he wanted to get
[03:10:14.540 --> 03:10:19.340]  elected he had nothing else to do he didn't know what to do he's like rick scott here in florida
[03:10:19.340 --> 03:10:23.820]  they don't know what to do so they figured they're gonna run for something the senate sounds nice
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:28.620]  they're there for six years they don't do so they set up there all of that powerful and they look
[03:10:28.620 --> 03:10:35.820]  like little kids power the real power my friend is what lbj said it's at the local level it's the
[03:10:35.820 --> 03:10:41.580]  commissioners it's the guy picks up your trash it's the guy provides you clean water it's the people
[03:10:41.580 --> 03:10:47.580]  who make sure that you have a business it's the police that's right the local police the fbi has
[03:10:47.580 --> 03:10:53.260]  no relevance whatsoever no one takes them seriously i couldn't take them seriously in the hanafi
[03:10:53.260 --> 03:10:59.340]  muslim they were incompetent when you have an institution created by a flamer an associate
[03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:06.060]  path like jade gohoover it breeds the murals the komi free do you know what free was before he was
[03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:11.980]  the head of the fbi he was a mobster he was in a law firm in new jersey called the walens group
[03:11:11.980 --> 03:11:16.940]  which only had one client that's the jewish- italian mob and you're talking about louis
[03:11:16.940 --> 03:11:22.940]  free who wrote the sandusky report who covered up so so there's more connections there but but
[03:11:22.940 --> 03:11:28.220]  real quick the rest of this segment dr patinik um first of all the reason why they're so scared
[03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:33.020]  of alex when he goes to congress i don't ask that as a power trip they are genuinely obsessed with
[03:11:33.020 --> 03:11:37.980]  shutting us down they are like they are why we're not well because you're real alex it doesn't matter
[03:11:37.980 --> 03:11:43.020]  what your opinion is doesn't matter if they think you're crazy you going to congress as a real person
[03:11:43.020 --> 03:11:46.940]  shocks everyone they're all fake they're all phony so now oh my gosh a real person is here
[03:11:46.940 --> 03:11:52.460]  they're totally exposed but but here's what it go ahead doc well here here's what it comes down to
[03:11:52.460 --> 03:11:56.060]  to me and i've always wondered this dr patinik and i think you kind of just said it i've wondered if
[03:11:56.060 --> 03:12:00.700]  trump and other sleeper cells behind the scenes are just waiting patiently as they continue to
[03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:05.420]  break the law and commit treason day after day after day i mean they just keep digging their
[03:12:05.420 --> 03:12:10.220]  graves and i think that that's what the mandate is in these 2018 elections it's sad that this is
[03:12:10.220 --> 03:12:16.220]  what it's come down to but basically in the 2018 midterms it's going to be the 116th congress is
[03:12:16.220 --> 03:12:21.260]  going to be elected to either remove trump from office or the 116th congress is going to be elected
[03:12:21.260 --> 03:12:26.700]  to protect america and he said that night he said if you want success you see what i've done
[03:12:26.700 --> 03:12:32.300]  me you don't they could get me i love that honestly dr patinik that's correct but remember
[03:12:32.300 --> 03:12:37.340]  what's happening now under jeff sessions and trump is a huge case of pedophilia
[03:12:37.340 --> 03:12:43.340]  all over the country pence has been accused of that in indiana that he was overseeing
[03:12:43.340 --> 03:12:49.340]  a pedophilia ring i don't know if it's true i don't really care but the reality is that the
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:55.100]  systems are breaking down you're not as owens said you're real you went up there you touched them
[03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:59.980]  they're not used to that they couldn't come on your show they would be scared to come on it even
[03:12:59.980 --> 03:13:04.780]  you offered them thousands of dollars they wouldn't dare come on your show so what do they do they
[03:13:04.780 --> 03:13:10.060]  deprecate us by saying we're conspiracy theorists really do you know any false flags are there
[03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:16.620]  any experts there who aren't false flags none of them bolton he joined the military but was afraid
[03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:22.140]  to go to vietnam because he could kill but he sends us to iraq he destroys libya and he wants to
[03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:28.380]  take down north korea kim jong-un is smarter than he is kim jong-un has more education than he does
[03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:35.420]  he went to switzerland he understands english he understands all the national issues the the end
[03:13:35.420 --> 03:13:42.060]  of bolton was when pompeo who's a brilliant military operative but his secretary of state said to
[03:13:42.060 --> 03:13:47.420]  bolton cool it you're not involved in north korea and we're not using the libya format because the
[03:13:47.420 --> 03:13:52.860]  libya format which was created didn't bolton you fell state didn't bolton show his cards when he
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:59.980]  tried to sabotage uh the the the the whole north korea deal that's correct and pompeo who's a brilliant
[03:13:59.980 --> 03:14:06.460]  number one at west point number one at harvard law school he's a brilliant brilliant individual who
[03:14:06.460 --> 03:14:13.820]  doesn't you know show it all that time is appointed by trump to be head of the cia and secretary of
[03:14:13.820 --> 03:14:19.100]  state that was a brilliant appointment and i think what you're going to see is mattis trump
[03:14:19.660 --> 03:14:27.420]  a pompeo nakasoni and kelly all military officers trump said look i didn't go into vietnam but i'm
[03:14:27.420 --> 03:14:33.500]  paying for it now i'm serving this country and that's what he's doing and i'm proud of his service
[03:14:33.500 --> 03:14:39.260]  is he crazy no anybody who thinks he's crazy i would love to be part of the suit to sue the
[03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:44.540]  hell out of him because there is nothing in there you are a psychiatrist trump trump has
[03:14:44.540 --> 03:14:48.620]  an incredible stand on a super smart and he claims that he's this bumbling idiot and that
[03:14:48.620 --> 03:14:54.460]  obama took credit today for the economy being better boy that was crazy obama couldn't have
[03:14:54.460 --> 03:15:01.420]  done anything i told you he was basically involved in eight years of warfare we never had more wars
[03:15:01.420 --> 03:15:10.460]  in syria iraq libya yemen Saudi arabia than this man who was a cia operative went to pakistan
[03:15:10.460 --> 03:15:16.060]  worked with geithner who provided him with cover on the asian society and from the day
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:23.020]  he was involved he lied he's a complete sociopath and the agency knows that and who's the one who
[03:15:23.020 --> 03:15:29.740]  covers him it's our friend john uh the cia forget i don't want to get into the names on that but
[03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:36.300]  basically this is the man who's a sociopath who else is associated bush jr who created

[03:20:27.260 --> 03:20:33.340]  censorship and evil i'm joel gilbert filmmaker hosting this hour from the people's republic of
[03:20:33.340 --> 03:20:39.740]  california you know me as a frequent guest and filmmaker i'm going to bring right on right now
[03:20:39.740 --> 03:20:47.980]  my guest is kevin jackson from the black sphere he's a radio talk show host on jenesis communications
[03:20:47.980 --> 03:20:54.140]  you see him regularly on the fox news channel as a political commentator author of the big
[03:20:54.140 --> 03:21:00.620]  black lie and race pimping the multi trillion dollar business of liberalism and kevin is in
[03:21:00.620 --> 03:21:07.420]  st louis because he's at a premiere for his new movie it's called bleeding blue he calls it the
[03:21:07.420 --> 03:21:14.460]  movie hollywood refuses to make and this film investigates the narrative that the police are
[03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:20.380]  bloodthirsty villains out for vigilante justice against minorities as barack obama taught the
[03:21:20.380 --> 03:21:26.220]  public let's take a look at uh an excerpt from the trailer and then we'll bring on kevin to talk
[03:21:26.220 --> 03:21:31.340]  about the movie let's play this trailer trigger happy policing is back to the four after an
[03:21:31.340 --> 03:21:36.940]  18 year old was shot a suspect dying at the hands of police officers two police officers accused of
[03:21:36.940 --> 03:21:41.660]  beating to death a homeless man beaten and pepper spray that their officers used excessive force
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:49.580]  the troublemakers carried pepper spray and guns and we're wearing badges
[03:21:52.780 --> 03:21:56.700]  we are not having an honest conversation around why this type of thing is occurring
[03:21:58.220 --> 03:22:03.260]  okay let's bring on kevin jackson kevin are you there i'm here good to talk to you joe
[03:22:04.220 --> 03:22:10.220]  okay thanks for being here you called this the movie that you had to do it because hollywood
[03:22:10.220 --> 03:22:16.940]  wouldn't make it why wouldn't hollywood talk about what the cops are being portrayed as across the
[03:22:16.940 --> 03:22:21.740]  country and especially in minority communities yeah well why would hollywood start telling the
[03:22:21.740 --> 03:22:27.260]  truth now i mean they've made multiple movies that have glamorized uh michael brown they've
[03:22:27.260 --> 03:22:31.740]  glamorized trevon martin there's one coming out for trevon i was just looking at the trailer
[03:22:31.740 --> 03:22:36.220]  five minutes ago so hollywood doesn't want these types of films to be made because they tell the
[03:22:36.220 --> 03:22:43.340]  truth and you know it's it's just part of the leftist agenda the spread lies and lies sell and
[03:22:43.340 --> 03:22:47.980]  you know they keep people stirred up people ask me all the time kevin what do you think why don't
[03:22:47.980 --> 03:22:52.140]  why do we still have these same issues occurring in the black community and occurring across the
[03:22:52.140 --> 03:22:57.500]  country and and i say it's a very simple thing there's no money and people getting along there's
[03:22:57.500 --> 03:23:02.540]  no money and people agreeing that the stock market is doing well that their portfolios are doing well
[03:23:02.540 --> 03:23:07.500]  that they're happy that they've got job mobility jobs are coming back that's all great news that we
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:11.820]  all should be celebrating but what does the left want to do they want to impeach trump what does
[03:23:11.820 --> 03:23:17.820]  the left want to do the cops they want to glamorize collin capronix and his pig socks and give him a
[03:23:17.820 --> 03:23:23.180]  contract a fat contract an honorary you know honorary deal with nike when he's out of the league
[03:23:24.140 --> 03:23:28.860]  essentially bet on a lie the narrative that is a lie that it's about police being you know
[03:23:28.860 --> 03:23:34.700]  hunters of black kids in the evenings or whatever and so but that's the way the world works leftism
[03:23:34.700 --> 03:23:40.060]  wants to reward the bug it rewards the illegal immigrant over the person who stands in line
[03:23:40.060 --> 03:23:47.180]  gets medically checked uh has a work visa and and waits patiently to become a citizen it rewards
[03:23:47.180 --> 03:23:53.580]  those people it it demonizes the kate stylings of the world who are killed by illegals it demonizes
[03:23:53.580 --> 03:23:58.140]  the molly tidbits of the world it demonizes the kevin jackson of the world who want to really get
[03:23:58.140 --> 03:24:05.740]  the truth out about what's going on okay well why are black people for the most part still buying
[03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:11.900]  into this they they're no fools they've experienced a lot of things over the years uh why are they
[03:24:12.540 --> 03:24:16.460]  still buying into this narrative or do you see them breaking out of it at this point
[03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:22.540]  i see i see blacks breaking out i mean if you look at the polls it's anywhere from going from
[03:24:22.540 --> 03:24:29.100]  nine percent that voted for bush and i don't know what that number was you know going forward but
[03:24:29.100 --> 03:24:34.700]  it let's say it was nine percent for trump and now we're hearing numbers that earn the 30 percent
[03:24:34.700 --> 03:24:39.980]  so yes it's starting to break out if the answer is to why did it occur it's because we've been
[03:24:39.980 --> 03:24:46.220]  living in a cocoon of ignorance if you listen to somebody like a collin cappernick who tells you
[03:24:46.220 --> 03:24:53.340]  about the atrocities of police and cop and you know police brutality on blacks ask a simple question
[03:24:53.340 --> 03:24:59.500]  collin has it happened to you no collin who do you know that it's happened to nobody he's living
[03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:07.500]  anecdotally off of the the gend up you know whatever you want to call it but it's just hysteria
[03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:13.100]  over michael brown who by the way got himself killed but that doesn't matter so in the film we
[03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:18.460]  cover this stuff we talk about when that that transition went from just being about rappers
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:24.380]  like nwa and ice tea and people like that to you know talking about cops to people like collin
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:29.660]  cappernick who have no issue at all with it in the ice cube and those guys at least have some
[03:25:29.660 --> 03:25:34.940]  flame of reference collin cappernick doesn't so we talk about that there's an overall there's an
[03:25:34.940 --> 03:25:39.500]  arc in the film that has to do with a kid named clifford and he's a big black guy and they call
[03:25:39.500 --> 03:25:44.060]  him the gentle giant and it was it sets up just like michael brown and he was killed they stood
[03:25:44.060 --> 03:25:49.740]  over him and shot him four or five times his mother is crying on film and she says and we we
[03:25:49.740 --> 03:25:54.940]  carry him throughout the film you get a little tidbits about why you don't know his name we talk
[03:25:54.940 --> 03:25:59.740]  about ferguson and probably one of the most shocking revelations you'll hear about ferguson
[03:25:59.740 --> 03:26:05.100]  in the film you know we i'm not going to divulge it on here but it will literally blow your mind
[03:26:05.100 --> 03:26:10.380]  what the obama and his justice department did to this little sleepy town that had no racial
[03:26:10.380 --> 03:26:15.740]  strife whatsoever and had a what would have been a local issue of a black thug getting
[03:26:15.740 --> 03:26:22.700]  himself killed become a monster story that gave us the ferguson effect and where did it all start
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:28.460]  the archivist of the entire thing started when barack obama talked about professor gates and
[03:26:28.460 --> 03:26:34.380]  instead of chastising that intellectual clown he said to the people of america that the cop
[03:26:34.380 --> 03:26:40.540]  acted stupidly and that's what set this whole thing off okay where is the movie bleeding blue
[03:26:40.540 --> 03:26:45.820]  showing and and where is the where can we see the trailer and what cities is it in it give us an
[03:26:45.820 --> 03:26:51.420]  overview of how we see the movie so there's six locations where the movie show going to be shown
[03:26:51.420 --> 03:26:57.500]  you can go to bleedingbluemovie.com and you can see get those six locations and it's limited release
[03:26:57.500 --> 03:27:01.980]  and joel you know how hollywood works i mean it's roughly five thousand dollars a theater for us to
[03:27:01.980 --> 03:27:07.500]  get the movie shown so we got to get some buzz going we've got probably 10 to 15 locations that
[03:27:07.500 --> 03:27:12.780]  want to show it again so we'll come out again later but right now it's opening in six locations
[03:27:12.780 --> 03:27:19.500]  i happen to be one of the bigger premieres in st louis um if you can't go to a one of the theaters
[03:27:19.500 --> 03:27:24.300]  right now here's what we'd like people to do give a cop a ticket we have a thing on there
[03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:28.300]  uh you know it's a kind of a joke you can give a cop a ticket but it's a ticket to the show we want
[03:27:28.300 --> 03:27:32.620]  all law enforcement to see this movie because it's amazing and here's what i'll tell you
[03:27:32.620 --> 03:27:37.660]  it is a thrill ride and and it'll make a lot of people cry including some guys because
[03:27:37.660 --> 03:27:42.460]  you're going to see these cops telling you they're horrible stories having to go to suicides
[03:27:42.460 --> 03:27:47.100]  picking up the bodies of dead kids you're gonna hear you're gonna see cop cam footage that'll
[03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:52.700]  have you ducking in your seat i mean we tell stories about why do people become police officer
[03:27:52.700 --> 03:27:58.860]  in one spoiler alert there's a guy that left at the age of early on from becoming the uh
[03:27:58.860 --> 03:28:05.420]  the drummer for uh sammy davis jr and he tells his story these cops believe in what they're doing
[03:28:05.420 --> 03:28:10.300]  we have a dirty cop on there we talk about dirty cops and show footage of dirty cops doing bad
[03:28:10.300 --> 03:28:15.820]  things and one of them was called the mafia cop and he point blank tells you man you did not want
[03:28:15.820 --> 03:28:21.180]  me to be the cop that showed up to your scene because you know he's a bad cop so it's a triple
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:28.140]  story of policing in america that at least sets the record straight and it certainly defies the
[03:28:28.140 --> 03:28:32.860]  notion that cops are out you know these bloodthirsty villains that are out there doing bad things for
[03:28:32.860 --> 03:28:37.420]  bad for all the reasons and we we are gonna okay kevin let me uh let me break in because we're

[03:33:57.420 --> 03:34:03.260]  all over the country want to talk about several things first of all the john mccain funeral
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:10.620]  this past week weekend mccain was given a very elaborate funeral including a horse drawn carriage
[03:34:10.620 --> 03:34:17.900]  almost non-stop celebration of his life by cnn and other outlets and of course we found out
[03:34:17.900 --> 03:34:23.740]  that mccain took his time in his last days to actually disinvite sarah palin and president
[03:34:23.740 --> 03:34:29.580]  trump uh from his funeral that was his dying wish apparently to exclude the most successful
[03:34:29.580 --> 03:34:36.940]  conservative and republican president and his own running mate uh and uh i want to talk about
[03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:42.460]  why this happened let's revisit the mccain trump issue by looking at an excerpt from my film
[03:34:43.260 --> 03:34:48.540]  trump the art of the insult in the info war store let's take a look at this clip from the movie
[03:34:49.900 --> 03:34:57.580]  i backed mccain and i backed romney mccain lost romney lost i said dammit the next time i'm just
[03:34:57.580 --> 03:35:04.860]  gonna do it myself right john mccain goes oh boy trump makes my life difficult he had 15 000
[03:35:04.860 --> 03:35:13.180]  crazies still what he did was that he fired up the crazies they weren't crazy they were great americans
[03:35:13.180 --> 03:35:17.740]  he insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room i supported him he lost he let us down
[03:35:17.740 --> 03:35:22.940]  so i never liked him as much after that because i don't like this he's not a war hero he's a war
[03:35:22.940 --> 03:35:27.500]  hero five and a half years he's a war hero because he was captured i like people that weren't captured
[03:35:27.500 --> 03:35:34.460]  okay i hate to tell you okay so that's a that's a clip from the art of the insult you got to get
[03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:40.460]  the movie in the info war store so you know this was a little dust up but it was really mccain
[03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:46.300]  who attacked not even attack trump he attacked the trump supporters he attacked his own constituents
[03:35:47.260 --> 03:35:53.980]  and you saw this behavior by mccain that it was pretty petty and disgraceful that he excluded
[03:35:53.980 --> 03:36:00.780]  the president from his funeral which he made sure was a funeral as if he was the president himself
[03:36:00.780 --> 03:36:09.340]  horse-drawn carriage flyovers let's revisit some of john mccain's highlights he was deeply involved
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:15.260]  in the dirty dossier the russian dossier that the clinton campaign colluded with the russians to
[03:36:15.260 --> 03:36:21.340]  create mccain was a dupe maybe a willing dupe because it was mccain who gave it to the fbi
[03:36:21.340 --> 03:36:26.940]  director comey and that's what gave it some legitimacy to move it forward back in december
[03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:36.620]  of 2016 so don't forget the mccain was heavily into this issue of the entire fiasco of the russian
[03:36:36.620 --> 03:36:43.900]  interference through the clinton campaign secondly mccain was also quite the fool when it came to
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:51.020]  isis let's look at a tweet that he put out he went and met with isis and he wrote on his tweet if
[03:36:51.020 --> 03:36:55.900]  we can put that up he said it's important that i visited with the brave fighters in syria who are
[03:36:55.900 --> 03:37:02.060]  risking their lives for freedom and need our help he didn't realize that was isis that was that was
[03:37:02.060 --> 03:37:10.300]  elbagdadi the head of isis and again he was being taken for a fool so conservatives remember this
[03:37:10.300 --> 03:37:15.900]  they also remember how mccain lost to obama he didn't put up much of a fight and of course mccain
[03:37:15.900 --> 03:37:22.940]  campaigned for defeating obama care he raised money over and over claiming he would vote against
[03:37:22.940 --> 03:37:30.140]  obama care then what did mccain do he voted for obama care and saved it uh creating a very big
[03:37:30.140 --> 03:37:36.780]  problem for trump so why did mccain vote for obama care clearly because he only cared about himself
[03:37:36.780 --> 03:37:44.540]  he wanted obama and his democrat buddies at his funeral and he should have resigned if he couldn't
[03:37:44.540 --> 03:37:49.580]  follow through on his promises he shouldn't resigned a long time ago because the representation
[03:37:49.580 --> 03:37:55.580]  by mccain became all about him and not about the people he represented so this was the man who got
[03:37:55.580 --> 03:38:03.580]  a horse-drawn carriage lied in state in two capitals non-stop coverage someone who was uh
[03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:11.020]  behaving in a in a way that was being really being taken advantage of uh and it's not surprising that
[03:38:12.300 --> 03:38:18.060]  trump was critical of him but very petty in the end that mccain disinvited him from his own funeral
[03:38:18.060 --> 03:38:23.580]  as well as sarah palin i thought it was a great embarrassment uh look regarding alex jones being
[03:38:23.580 --> 03:38:30.780]  kicked off twitter i call it the iron curtain of censorship is descending on america uh because
[03:38:30.780 --> 03:38:35.740]  they claim that alex jones did something abusive on twitter which no one really can figure out uh
[03:38:35.740 --> 03:38:40.780]  they don't talk about what about maxine waters who told everyone to harass government officials
[03:38:41.580 --> 03:38:47.260]  resulting in sarah sanders and others being kicked out of restaurants and harassed uh don't
[03:38:47.260 --> 03:38:53.020]  forget that same type of rhetoric led to james hoshkinson who had a screw loose decided he would
[03:38:53.020 --> 03:38:59.020]  try to murder the entire republican leadership in their baseball team so this is incitement of
[03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:04.060]  violence by maxine waters and the rest of the resistance crowd and you have to remember if
[03:39:04.060 --> 03:39:11.820]  they can come for alex jones and silence him anybody can be next uh even bill marr understood
[03:39:11.820 --> 03:39:16.620]  this let's take a quick look at that video bill marr and i want you to look at jennifer
[03:39:16.620 --> 03:39:23.020]  granholm she's the former governor of michigan an attorney general and she actually says thank god
[03:39:23.820 --> 03:39:28.780]  when it said that alex jones was banned let's look at that video so i wanted to my free speech for
[03:39:28.780 --> 03:39:35.980]  a minute because alex jones uh who is not my friend and who tells crazy lies about me uh is uh
[03:39:35.980 --> 03:39:40.940]  thrown off twitter i think and facebook and a few other platforms i think he's gonna thank god
[03:39:40.940 --> 03:39:48.220]  uh well if you're a liberal you're supposed to be for free speech that's free speech for the
[03:39:48.220 --> 03:39:53.900]  speech you hate that's what free speech means we're losing the thread of the concepts that
[03:39:53.900 --> 03:39:58.860]  are important to this country if you care about the real american shit or you don't and if you do
[03:39:58.860 --> 03:40:05.260]  it goes for every side i don't like alex jones but so that's uh even bill marr got it you know that
[03:40:05.260 --> 03:40:11.020]  you first amendment is the first amendment but you even saw this former governor of michigan
[03:40:11.020 --> 03:40:16.540]  jennifer granholm said thank god she was so excited and happy to hear that that alex jones
[03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:22.620]  had been banned from youtube or social media uh she was thrilled even though bill marr was making
[03:40:22.620 --> 03:40:28.140]  the opposite point you have to be for free speech so look trump could be next everyone can be next
[03:40:28.140 --> 03:40:33.820]  to be kicked off twitter to be kicked off the public discourse this is how the left operates
[03:40:33.820 --> 03:40:39.500]  they use the tools of state now the tools of big tech to destroy the opposition because their
[03:40:39.500 --> 03:40:46.060]  arguments in favor of socialism are so bankrupt and without any basis in economics whatsoever
[03:40:46.780 --> 03:40:51.820]  don't forget obama did it with the irs people forget about that obama used the irs to destroy
[03:40:51.820 --> 03:40:58.460]  the tea party movement in 2012 so he could get reelected the left was allowed to organize for
[03:40:58.460 --> 03:41:04.540]  the election he didn't break up the soros groups only the conservative back tea party groups and
[03:41:04.540 --> 03:41:09.820]  there was no punishment there was no result the media didn't care and the republicans eventually
[03:41:09.820 --> 03:41:16.300]  moved on so what do we get in 2016 a repeat of the same abuse of power the fbi department of
[03:41:16.300 --> 03:41:22.060]  justice even the cia and state department all hands on deck exonerate hillary and frame trump
[03:41:22.700 --> 03:41:26.460]  so that's what's happening now with big tech they're taking the on the role of government
[03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:33.660]  since they're out of government and if they pull alex jones off social media fox news is next
[03:41:33.660 --> 03:41:39.740]  conservatives are next trump is next remember according to the left conservative ideas are
[03:41:39.740 --> 03:41:45.980]  racist american values are racist the constitution is racist so literally they're going to de-platform
[03:41:45.980 --> 03:41:52.220]  america and anything american and that's the direction we're heading so everyone needs to
[03:41:52.220 --> 03:41:59.580]  understand how great the stakes are i would like to see trump declassify all the uh all the russia
[03:41:59.580 --> 03:42:06.460]  material all the faiza material and fire these guys and and finish the job that we elected him
[03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:11.660]  to do if not we're going to continue to see the erosion of free speech and the great iron curtain
[03:42:11.660 --> 03:42:17.820]  that was once on the soviet union will continue to descend across america of all places where our
[03:42:17.820 --> 03:42:24.700]  free speech is is outlawed our free speech is deemed racist or abusive while they can continue on the

[03:47:36.060 --> 03:47:40.220]  uh we're going to talk all about ted cruz i'm going to give you a lot of insights about his
[03:47:40.220 --> 03:47:46.140]  senate race in texas which uh is going to be a problem for him uh let's first take our caller
[03:47:46.140 --> 03:47:53.580]  is alex in montana you're on the alex jones show go ahead okay alex is no longer with us
[03:47:53.580 --> 03:48:00.220]  look uh ted cruz gave a great speech in the cavanaugh hearing yesterday and uh he correctly
[03:48:00.220 --> 03:48:06.460]  accused the democrats of relitigating the 2016 elections this was the ted cruz that takes a
[03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:13.020]  bold stand that everyone remembers from it's actually been 2010 since people can remember
[03:48:13.020 --> 03:48:19.500]  cruz really standing up strong uh for something he hasn't done much that's very memorable uh
[03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:25.580]  people remember the ted cruz really from a video even that i produced called uh green eggs and ham
[03:48:25.580 --> 03:48:30.940]  where ted is reading green eggs and ham on the senate floor let's revisit that that great moment
[03:48:30.940 --> 03:48:40.300]  when he's filibustering obama care i am sam i am sam i am sam i am sam do you like green eggs and
[03:48:40.300 --> 03:48:45.820]  ham do you like green eggs and ham i do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them
[03:48:46.700 --> 03:48:52.940]  sam i am would you like them here or there would you like them here or there i do not like them
[03:48:52.940 --> 03:49:01.180]  here or there, I do not like them anywhere. I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not
[03:49:01.180 --> 03:49:08.820]  like them, Sam, I am. I do not like them, Sam, I am. Would you eat them in a box? Okay,
[03:49:08.820 --> 03:49:13.780]  that's the, uh, we were, remember, uh, Ted, being the only person that stood up against
[03:49:13.780 --> 03:49:20.700]  Obama and Obamacare, he had 100% support in the grassroots. Then he ran for president
[03:49:20.700 --> 03:49:26.340]  and lost. And I'll tell you why he lost in a minute, but he is in some trouble in Texas
[03:49:26.340 --> 03:49:31.900]  and Donald Trump is going to have to go bail him out at a big rally in October. So what
[03:49:31.900 --> 03:49:36.500]  is wrong with the Ted Cruz Senate campaign? It's actually the same thing that was wrong
[03:49:36.500 --> 03:49:41.820]  with the presidential campaign. Uh, Cruz just goes through the motions of fundraising and
[03:49:41.820 --> 03:49:47.540]  giving a standard speech. It's the same campaign team. There is no understanding of the Ted
[03:49:47.540 --> 03:49:54.420]  Cruz brand that conservatives fell in love with. Now, Ted Cruz is a good guy. He's in
[03:49:54.420 --> 03:49:59.340]  politics for the principles. He's in politics because he believes in liberty. He's a special
[03:49:59.340 --> 03:50:06.700]  person on a special mission to make sure that the Constitution is preserved. Uh, the problem
[03:50:06.700 --> 03:50:11.620]  that Ted has is like a lot of lawyers is that they're marketing guys. They don't have to
[03:50:11.620 --> 03:50:19.020]  be, uh, marketing guys. But the difference between, uh, Ted Cruz and Obama, for instance,
[03:50:19.020 --> 03:50:26.140]  is Obama was a lawyer and he said, get me David Axelrod. Get me David Axelrod. I need
[03:50:26.140 --> 03:50:32.620]  a marketing guru to, to, to market me. And David Axelrod put together a story. The story
[03:50:32.620 --> 03:50:37.580]  was, okay, Barack, you're a, your father's a go-herter from Kenya. You're going to bring
[03:50:37.580 --> 03:50:42.540]  this all together because of your unique background. And we won't mention that your real father,
[03:50:42.540 --> 03:50:47.780]  Frank Marshall Davis was a Russian spy and indoctrinated you and radicalized you and
[03:50:47.780 --> 03:50:54.140]  your youth into being a communist sympathizer. We won't talk about that. Uh, Ted Cruz didn't
[03:50:54.140 --> 03:50:58.340]  do that. He could have done that, but he didn't. Now, I spent a lot of time with Republican
[03:50:58.340 --> 03:51:02.580]  base voters around the country screening my films. Most people have seen dreams from
[03:51:02.580 --> 03:51:07.540]  my real father, of course, and there's no place like utopia. All these are in the Alex
[03:51:07.540 --> 03:51:14.620]  Jones store. And the conservative grassroots had moved far to the right of the Republican
[03:51:14.620 --> 03:51:20.220]  establishment. In fact, Ted Cruz had played a big part. He actually conditioned the electorate
[03:51:20.220 --> 03:51:26.900]  to want an outsider candidate. And they love Ted Cruz, Green Eggs and Ham, Cicero. Cruz
[03:51:26.900 --> 03:51:32.540]  was the anti-establishment hero and the election was, was his to lose. I told Cruz this personally,
[03:51:32.540 --> 03:51:39.420]  he just needed to be Ted Cruz, the outsider. Mr. Cruz goes to Washington, but instead Cruz
[03:51:39.420 --> 03:51:45.580]  chose this, this old school establishment campaign workers, old school establishment
[03:51:45.580 --> 03:51:49.980]  strategy. He had worked on the George Bush campaign. So it was just an establishment
[03:51:49.980 --> 03:51:55.900]  campaign. He raised money and gave a speech without taking any strong stands. It was as
[03:51:55.900 --> 03:52:00.740]  though Cruz wanted to be Jeb Bush. So Donald Trump came along and said, okay, Ted, if you
[03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:06.260]  don't want to be Ted Cruz, I'll be Ted Cruz. I'll be the guy who's the outsider who comes
[03:52:06.260 --> 03:52:13.260]  in to drain the swamp. So that's how Ted lost the presidential election. And my concern
[03:52:13.260 --> 03:52:18.820]  is that he's doing the same thing in the Senate race. It's the same campaign team. He runs
[03:52:18.820 --> 03:52:24.460]  around raising money and giving a standard speech. There's no mission. There's no excitement.
[03:52:24.460 --> 03:52:31.020]  There's no new reason to vote for Ted. So hopefully Trump can go in and bail him out.
[03:52:31.020 --> 03:52:37.220]  Ted surprisingly actually has great instincts, but he doesn't carry them through. I want
[03:52:37.220 --> 03:52:42.900]  to show you a book cover that I actually designed and gave to Ted Cruz for his book. His book
[03:52:42.900 --> 03:52:48.380]  was coming out to kind of reintroduce him to the public. It was called a time for truth.
[03:52:48.380 --> 03:52:54.100]  And let's show that book cover that I designed where you see Ted sitting on a, on a dock
[03:52:54.100 --> 03:53:03.420]  with his family showing off his young family and fishing. We put that one up there. A time
[03:53:03.420 --> 03:53:07.900]  for truth. There it is. So reigniting the promise of America. Ted looks like a young
[03:53:07.900 --> 03:53:13.140]  Ronald Reagan here with a beautiful wife and kids with a nature background. This I thought
[03:53:13.140 --> 03:53:19.740]  was perfect. Now Ted Cruz loved this. He told me it was fantastic. He emailed it to everybody.
[03:53:19.740 --> 03:53:24.020]  He loved this camp. He loved this cover for his book, which was going to tell his entire
[03:53:24.020 --> 03:53:28.900]  story, why I'm running, who I am, what my vision is for the country. Six weeks later,
[03:53:28.900 --> 03:53:36.460]  the book came out and they had the original cover, which I had seen and was just terrible.
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:41.940]  Ted Cruz looking kind of sweaty, looking kind of like Joe McCarthy. Not, you know, he doesn't
[03:53:41.940 --> 03:53:46.380]  have the nicest looking mug in the world to begin with, but this was the book cover that
[03:53:46.380 --> 03:53:52.180]  did not tell a story of any kind. And this is the kind of book cover you, you know, you
[03:53:52.180 --> 03:53:57.500]  come up with a few of, you know, you made a movie and you're telling a life story after
[03:53:57.500 --> 03:54:01.780]  the fact, not that you're going to go ahead and do something in the future. So of course,
[03:54:01.780 --> 03:54:09.180]  this book completely tanked. Nobody bought it. Nobody read it. Even the audio book that
[03:54:09.180 --> 03:54:13.940]  Ted was supposed to record, he only recorded like part of the audio book and he had to
[03:54:13.940 --> 03:54:19.140]  have someone else stand in and read his own audio book. So when you look at the story
[03:54:19.140 --> 03:54:24.620]  of these two book covers, you know everything you need to understand about Ted Cruz. He
[03:54:24.620 --> 03:54:32.100]  has good instincts and he has a great story to tell, but he hesitates to, to do the marketing
[03:54:32.100 --> 03:54:37.300]  aspect to execute. And that's why Ted Cruz is not president. And I think that's why
[03:54:37.300 --> 03:54:43.140]  he's in some trouble today in Texas. He's repeating the same mistakes as he did in the
[03:54:43.140 --> 03:54:51.500]  presidential race. Raise money, give a standard speech with no special mission. And hopefully
[03:54:51.500 --> 03:54:57.260]  Trump will come into Texas and help him define the mission and reinvigorate because Ted is
[03:54:57.260 --> 03:55:01.340]  very hesitant to do that for some reason. Want to make, what are the comment about the
[03:55:01.340 --> 03:55:09.100]  Kaepernick ads with Nike that Kevin Jackson brought up? Don't forget, go to see the website.
[03:55:09.100 --> 03:55:17.940]  Go to the movie, if it's in your city, bleedingbluemovie.com about the war on cops. Look, Colin
[03:55:17.940 --> 03:55:23.540]  Kaepernick simply has it all wrong and Nike has it all wrong. Football games are about
[03:55:23.540 --> 03:55:29.540]  a celebration of America. It's America's pastime. People are there to celebrate America. No
[03:55:29.540 --> 03:55:36.900]  one wants to see anti-American demonstrators start off the football game and say, F you
[03:55:36.900 --> 03:55:44.940]  America. Who wants to see that? Nobody. So Colin Kaepernick, as Kevin Jackson said, just
[03:55:44.940 --> 03:55:50.820]  does not understand. He's never had any experience of racism or anything of that nature. He doesn't
[03:55:50.820 --> 03:55:55.260]  understand that Barack Obama was no friend of black people. When you see my movie, there's
[03:55:55.260 --> 03:56:01.700]  no place like Utopia. I go to South Side Chicago and they talk about everything got worse.
[03:56:01.700 --> 03:56:07.100]  Businesses went out, businesses went away, more violence, thousands dead during Obama's
[03:56:07.100 --> 03:56:13.380]  presidency. He didn't lift one finger for the inner cities. It was all about this radical
[03:56:13.380 --> 03:56:19.100]  agenda that he was put there to execute. Bring in, he figures they got the black people in
[03:56:19.100 --> 03:56:24.700]  their pocket to vote for Democrats. Now they'll try to get Hispanics. They'll bring in illegals
[03:56:24.700 --> 03:56:32.380]  to take jobs from black people to fill up the schools to drive down wages. Even though
[03:56:32.380 --> 03:56:36.860]  the Democrats put up front men that are black, like they did with Frank Marshall Davis in
[03:56:36.860 --> 03:56:42.300]  the 30s, Obama's real father was a Russian agent. Frank Marshall Davis was hired by white
[03:56:42.300 --> 03:56:47.580]  communists to try to trick black people to come into the communist movement. Barack Obama's
[03:56:47.580 --> 03:56:54.420]  same thing went back to Chicago. Organizer trying to fool black people that the Democrat
[03:56:54.420 --> 03:56:59.860]  party is acting in your interest and they're not. Only Donald Trump has executed an economic
[03:56:59.860 --> 03:57:05.580]  program and an opportunity program to allow everybody, including black Americans, to get
[03:57:05.580 --> 03:57:11.700]  off any kind of welfare, food stamps and have jobs. That's a thousand times more in two
[03:57:11.700 --> 03:57:17.780]  years than Obama did for black people in eight years. I think Nike has it very wrong. Kaepernick
