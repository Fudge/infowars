[00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:25.094]  But this morning we come together as one nation blessed to live in freedom and grateful to worship in peace.
[00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.535]  As everybody knows, my family
[00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:41.878]  Our great country and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people.
[00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:53.527]  They have done everything possible to destroy us and by so doing very badly hurt our nation.
[00:00:53.527 --> 00:00:55.109]  They know what they are doing is wrong.
[00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:04.610]  But they put themselves far ahead of our great country.
[00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:20.940]  Weeks ago and again yesterday, courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, fortitude, and strength to do what everyone knows was right.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.222]  I don't like people who use their faith
[00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:32.365]  As justification for doing what they know is wrong.
[00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:41.450]  Nor do I like people who say, I pray for you, when they know that that's not so.
[00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.152]  So many people have been hurt.
[00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:49.334]  And we can't let that go on.
[00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:53.917]  And I'll be discussing that a little bit later at the White House.
[00:01:55.745 --> 00:02:01.606]  We're joined today by two people whose faith inspires us all.
[00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:11.109]  Our amazing, wonderful friend, Vice President Mike Pence, and his wonderful wife, Karen.
[00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:19.031]  Thank you, Karen.
[00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:23.752]  Thank you to all of our great political leaders out there.
[00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:29.688]  That I've been working with so hard over the last three years, and we've accomplished so much.
[00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:52.886]  I hand to members of my cabinet in attendance, Secretary Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, David Bernhardt, Gene Scalia, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Dan Broilette, Betsy DeVos, Robert Wilkie, and Administrator Jovita Carranza.
[00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:53.487]  Joining us
[00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:06.237]  For this cherished tradition are a lot of friends in the audience.
[00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:09.900]  Many really have become friends.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.181]  They are political leaders.
[00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.342]  They've become great friends.
[00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.204]  That's all I get to meet anymore.
[00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:18.767]  That and the enemies and the allies, and we have them all.
[00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:20.709]  We have allies, we have enemies.
[00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.073]  Sometimes the allies are enemies, but we just don't know it.
[00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:27.254]  But we're changing all that.
[00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:31.453]  But thank you all, and thank you all for being here.
[00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:35.694]  I also want to welcome foreign dignitaries from more than 140 countries.
[00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:36.874]  That's something.
[00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:45.476]  Something.
[00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:48.797]  Everyone here today is united by a shared conviction.
[00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:58.480]  We know that our nation is stronger, our future is brighter, and our joy is greater when we turn to God and ask him to shed his grace on our lives.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.965]  On Tuesday, I addressed Congress on the State of the Union and the great American comeback.
[00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:13.290]  That's what it is.
[00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.434]  Our country has never done better than it is doing right now.
[00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:22.397]  Our economy is the strongest it has ever been.
[00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:29.102]  And for those of you that are interested in stocks, it looks like the stock market will be way up again today.
[00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:43.576]  According to... And ladies and gentlemen, you are watching a live feed of where the president is about to speak.
[00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:45.257]  That was from the prayer breakfast earlier.
[00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:47.378]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:47.378 --> 00:04:50.060]  It is February 6th on this Thursday Transmission 2020.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.223]  We are live, we are broadcasting worldwide, and we are back in T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:03.819]  There's a new way to show your support for the InfoWars crew at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:05:24.314 --> 00:05:26.195]  Remember, we're all part of the fight.
[00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.537]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:32.758]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[00:05:32.758 --> 00:05:37.600]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.502]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, Methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[00:05:46.502 --> 00:05:53.704]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:58.246]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:11.739]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:13.560]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.421]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:17.142]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.803]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:23.485]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:32.378]  And we are live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Thursday, February 6, 2020 transmission.
[00:06:32.378 --> 00:06:46.924]  At any minute, the President of the United States is going to walk through those doors, and he is going to address the people of the United States, people of the world, about the attempted deep state takedown for the third time of President Trump.
[00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:55.711]  They have failed and failed miserably, but they are only fighting harder now because they're puppets of the globalists.
[00:06:55.711 --> 00:07:05.923]  Puppets of the globalists that are being ordered to do this because it further divides and hurts the nation and its very soul and its productivity.
[00:07:06.872 --> 00:07:08.053]  That's all this is.
[00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:11.775]  The globalists had puppet presidents in the last 30 years.
[00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:13.235]  They don't know what to do now.
[00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:18.218]  They've got not just a president that's the president, but a president that understands the new world order.
[00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:27.843]  And at the last minutes of the American century setting, the new American century has begun.
[00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:35.928]  And that's what even mainline Financial Times of London and others are saying is, the Qaikom century, the century of the dragon that was to be this century, is gone.
[00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:38.880]  It's not happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:48.249]  And it's not that we're putting down the Chinese people, but the communist Chinese and their model, no human rights, no environmental standards, no nothing.
[00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:56.036]  And then all the leftist and globalist groups shutting down all of our industry here and not letting us operate in any ways.
[00:07:56.036 --> 00:08:01.261]  And the race baiting and the racial division, everything that's been going on to sabotage
[00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:03.784]  I don't know.
[00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:35.558]  On the Internet, as well, that is commercial-free, basically, except for breaks at the start and end of each hour, at the bottom of the hour, so that at times like this, we can go commercial-free for stations.
[00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:39.939]  I know a lot of stations will probably skip this next break coming up, and that's their decision.
[00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:41.440]  I think they probably should.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:48.822]  Some stations don't want us to do that, so we'll go to break here in seven minutes, but we'll come back and play whatever we missed, as we have at DVR as well.
[00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:50.703]  But that's a live satellite feed we have.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.346]  You know, Infowars pays for right there out of the White House.
[00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:03.831]  And again, I just want to explain to listeners, that's where your money goes is this infrastructure.
[00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:09.777]  Nobody else has built an infrastructure that's independent of the globalists that will do something like we're doing right now.
[00:09:09.777 --> 00:09:11.478]  And that's why Infowars has been the model.
[00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:17.618]  Of countering big corporate monopoly media and bringing you the people's populist media.
[00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:19.719]  And that's why they're so hell-bent on shutting us down.
[00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:24.582]  And that's why I'm so blessed and honored to be here with you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:24.582 --> 00:09:29.865]  The quickening right now is so intense that I haven't had a vacation in over a year.
[00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:30.586]  I'm not complaining.
[00:09:30.586 --> 00:09:33.267]  My wife said, damn it, we're going to have one.
[00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:35.809]  And so we went ahead and took one, but I was working the whole time.
[00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:41.585]  Well, I walked in here a few minutes ago, it was 24,000.
[00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:15.927]  The internal Chinese numbers that leaked and were actually published in China by the People's Daily said 24,000 dead yesterday.
[00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:22.471]  So what we think they're doing is they're just putting the number of dead as the number of infected.
[00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:24.072]  Think about that.
[00:10:24.072 --> 00:10:29.355]  We'll continue to track all of that as it unfolds and as we wait for the President to come out and speak.
[00:10:29.355 --> 00:10:33.198]  So what we'll do is we'll take the satellite feed, but we've got to break guys, just DVR it in there.
[00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:34.659]  We'll start from the beginning of the President's speech.
[00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:38.613]  We're obviously going to carry all of this, this entire press conference.
[00:10:38.613 --> 00:10:40.934]  And then, it's the people.
[00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:47.638]  We're going to open the phones up for the balance of the transmission here today to get your response to all of this.
[00:10:47.638 --> 00:10:53.922]  But you talk about building up on the suspense.
[00:10:53.922 --> 00:11:00.346]  The information is, GOP on offensive, party pushes for Hunter Biden records, ethics complaint against Pelosi.
[00:11:01.647 --> 00:11:07.870]  Well, Pelosi's son is even deeper into scams in Ukraine than Hunter.
[00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.272]  And that's what I tell the President every time I've had a chance to talk to him.
[00:11:10.272 --> 00:11:11.532]  Please, sir, don't thank me.
[00:11:11.532 --> 00:11:12.753]  I don't need a pat on the head.
[00:11:12.753 --> 00:11:15.774]  I need you to go on the offensive against these people.
[00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:20.037]  Because I promoted you, and I believe in what you're doing, and they're going to destroy me.
[00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:22.078]  So you have to succeed now.
[00:11:23.837 --> 00:11:26.579]  Not just for myself, but the whole country and our listeners, everybody.
[00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:27.700]  You must go on the offense.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:33.844]  You can't just sit here and beat their attacks over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:11:33.844 --> 00:11:36.245]  You have to actually go after them.
[00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:39.287]  And I understand he's surrounded by a bunch of cowardly lawyers.
[00:11:39.287 --> 00:11:41.049]  It's truly disgusting.
[00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:46.852]  But we're gonna be opening the phones up as soon as his speech is done here on this live Thursday worldwide transmission.
[00:11:46.852 --> 00:11:50.855]  I'm gonna say something else here right now on air.
[00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:52.976]  I have not gotten a fever.
[00:11:54.738 --> 00:11:58.280]  In over four years.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.721]  And boy, you get on the airplanes today and all the rest of it.
[00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:02.522]  I kept knocking on wood telling you that.
[00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:03.482]  Boom!
[00:12:03.482 --> 00:12:05.123]  Got a fever.
[00:12:05.123 --> 00:12:06.824]  Flying back.
[00:12:06.824 --> 00:12:08.365]  Got something.
[00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:11.507]  And my fever's gone now.
[00:12:11.507 --> 00:12:12.167]  And I feel great.
[00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:18.251]  Even though everybody else I know has pretty much been sick with whatever this respiratory stuff is.
[00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:19.572]  Probably is some type of coronavirus.
[00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.692]  This stuff's everywhere.
[00:12:20.692 --> 00:12:21.973]  But boy, I got home last night.
[00:12:24.537 --> 00:12:27.258]  And I sucked down some immune gargle.
[00:12:27.258 --> 00:12:28.959]  Tastes like mint.
[00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:35.381]  And I've been a drinking man before, so it tastes like it actually has some delicious chinops.
[00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:40.423]  But what it's got is, is 15 parts per million nano silver.
[00:12:40.423 --> 00:12:43.804]  And that's what CNN recognizes is safe for you to ingest.
[00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:44.785]  And it coats
[00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.733]  The mouth, the mucous membrane, the throat, goes down the stomach and does incredible things.
[00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:55.395]  So, I got home last night and said, my wife said, you're hot!
[00:12:55.395 --> 00:13:05.281]  Stuck a thermometer in my mouth, had about a hundred and a half temperature, banged back some of this good stuff right here, super blue silver.
[00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:08.503]  Went over and got my colloil silver, silver bullet, took some of that.
[00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:16.026]  Took a couple Advil, climbed into bed and slept from 7 until 7 a.m.
[00:13:16.026 --> 00:13:17.827]  this morning and the fever was gone.
[00:13:17.827 --> 00:13:31.158]  I put on a couple shirts, put on a coat, put on two pairs of sweatpants, got in that bed in the guest bedroom, wrapped my ass up and cooked like a turkey and got up this morning and boom baby it's gone!
[00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:31.519]  Yes!
[00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:41.231]  There's something about when you talk, the Greeks noticed it, the Romans noticed it, there's African sayings about it, they go back thousands of years.
[00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:47.233]  When you talk about how you've been successful and how things haven't happened to you that are happening to others, just like clockwork, everybody knows.
[00:13:47.233 --> 00:13:49.713]  You talk about, I haven't been sick in a long time, you get sick.
[00:13:49.713 --> 00:13:56.415]  I just like, so I was like, I'm trying to tell you I haven't had a fever in over four years, maybe longer, but I just, knock on wood, I don't, boom.
[00:13:58.109 --> 00:13:59.311]  Boom, you get on an airplane.
[00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:01.894]  Hell, I probably got it four days ago when I flew out on Saturday.
[00:14:01.894 --> 00:14:02.455]  Five days ago.
[00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:08.222]  I probably didn't get it flying back, but as soon as I got out of the airport and it was cold, I was like, man, I'm shivering.
[00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.964]  So, that's what happened.
[00:14:09.964 --> 00:14:12.908]  By the way, this immune gargle will sell out by tomorrow, the big 16-ouncer.
[00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.729]  I think?
[00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:41.242]  Is the only thing found by the Pentagon to take out the SARS family, which is the coronavirus family, and that the Pentagon actually buys it from them.
[00:14:41.242 --> 00:15:00.454]  Again, they probably label it to us, they probably label the whole family, but the toothpaste is original, immune gargle is original, this super wound gel is what the Pentagon gets, and the military that's going into different operations, they'll take it with them to put a coating on their hands and face and things, so that if you do get little micro cuts and abrasions, like in a swamp,
[00:15:01.014 --> 00:15:03.515]  They found that it really cuts back on infections massively.
[00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:04.815]  And I showed you those secret documents.
[00:15:04.815 --> 00:15:07.976]  Well, they said, they said, was it restricted?
[00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:11.076]  What was the word they used when I showed those documents the other day?
[00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:14.057]  It was, they'll pop my head in a moment.
[00:15:14.057 --> 00:15:17.318]  The point is, is that it's selling out.
[00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:20.298]  And then if you look right over here, storable food.
[00:15:20.298 --> 00:15:24.279]  I had a note here from Matt Redhawk that I think I left in the conference room in there.
[00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:24.959]  I forgot to get that.
[00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.580]  Guys will bring that to me.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.960]  And he gave us a call this morning.
[00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:38.410]  And he said, well, we are still able to ship food out, but now it's 10 to 14 days and everybody else is totally sold out.
[00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.691]  Anybody else telling you they've got storable foods is lying to you or it's crap.
[00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:45.193]  They've got high quality, new, fresh food or packaging food 24 hours a day.
[00:15:45.193 --> 00:15:47.314]  But now it'll take 10 to 14 days for you to get it.
[00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:56.018]  If you get your order in now, and it may go up to two or three weeks by next week, and soon they may be sold out, but they have the food right now to take your order and get it out to you.
[00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:56.959]  Info or store.com.

[00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:28.718]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:17:28.718 --> 00:17:32.640]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.181]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:37.142]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:37.142 --> 00:17:42.704]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:17:42.704 --> 00:17:43.904]  I can help you, too.
[00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:46.845]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:49.066]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:53.508]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:17:53.508 --> 00:17:55.789]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:17:59.062 --> 00:18:10.775]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:18:10.775 --> 00:18:19.564]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[00:18:20.245 --> 00:18:24.810]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.033]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side.
[00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:30.736]  And they do what they do because they're slaves.
[00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:35.801]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:46.230]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.973]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[00:18:48.973 --> 00:18:51.555]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[00:18:51.555 --> 00:18:54.658]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[00:18:54.658 --> 00:18:58.081]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[00:19:00.253 --> 00:19:03.494]  This should really be easier than it is.
[00:19:03.494 --> 00:19:05.634]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[00:19:05.634 --> 00:19:08.115]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:21.559]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:22.499]  I hope
[00:19:38.664 --> 00:19:43.668]  Eight years ago I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[00:19:43.668 --> 00:19:51.354]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[00:19:51.354 --> 00:19:52.515]  It's amazing.
[00:19:52.515 --> 00:19:56.098]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[00:19:56.098 --> 00:20:02.464]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:05.086]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.333 --> 00:20:20.195]  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
[00:20:20.195 --> 00:20:25.016]  By the way, this is live.
[00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:28.978]  We came out of break and that perfectly happened to the second.
[00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:30.358]  Wow.
[00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:36.941]  So, the third time they tried to remove him was fraud versus a Russian agent.
[00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:37.421]  Wow, here we go.
[00:20:39.585 --> 00:20:41.867]  Of course, before that, they tried to say his election wasn't legitimate.
[00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:46.651]  Tried to unseat him in the electoral process.
[00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:47.391]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:20:47.391 --> 00:20:47.992]  This is a big victory.
[00:20:47.992 --> 00:20:55.938]  Listen to this.
[00:20:55.938 --> 00:20:56.159]  Thank you.
[00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:57.800]  This is fairytale, folks.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.681]  This is the real world.
[00:20:58.681 --> 00:20:59.381]  Truth, strength and affection.
[00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.883]  Thank you.
[00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:06.827]  He's in real danger now, though.
[00:21:06.827 --> 00:21:08.629]  Now they're gonna make a physical move on him.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.982]  He better start defending his supporters, though.
[00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:32.335]  That's a soft underbelly.
[00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:34.477]  This will be a day you won't remember.
[00:21:34.477 --> 00:21:36.678]  Pelosi's in so much trouble now.
[00:21:36.678 --> 00:21:38.260]  Well, thank you very much, everybody.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.480]  Wow.
[00:21:40.646 --> 00:21:50.534]  We've all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation.
[00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:56.719]  I invited some of our very good friends, and we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come.
[00:21:56.719 --> 00:22:01.163]  We kept it down to a minimum, and believe it or not, this is a minimum.
[00:22:01.163 --> 00:22:05.206]  But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months.
[00:22:05.206 --> 00:22:07.088]  But really, if you go back to it, over the last
[00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:09.032]  Number of years.
[00:22:09.032 --> 00:22:10.033]  We had the witch hunt.
[00:22:10.033 --> 00:22:16.175]  It started from the day we came down the elevator.
[00:22:16.175 --> 00:22:19.037]  Myself and our future First Lady, who's with us right now.
[00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:19.537]  Thank you, Melania.
[00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:40.536]  And it never really stopped.
[00:22:40.536 --> 00:22:45.597]  We've been going through this now for over three years.
[00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:46.897]  It was evil.
[00:22:46.897 --> 00:22:47.998]  It was corrupt.
[00:22:47.998 --> 00:22:50.718]  It was dirty cops.
[00:22:50.718 --> 00:22:53.579]  It was leakers and liars.
[00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:56.360]  And this should never, ever happen to another president.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.500]  Ever.
[00:22:57.856 --> 00:23:01.298]  I don't know that other presidents would have been able to take it.
[00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:03.659]  Some people said no, they wouldn't have.
[00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:09.543]  But I can tell you at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly.
[00:23:09.543 --> 00:23:13.645]  No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly.
[00:23:13.645 --> 00:23:16.327]  It was a disgrace.
[00:23:16.327 --> 00:23:18.148]  Had I not fired
[00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:23.530]  James Comey, who was a disaster, by the way.
[00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.671]  It's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now.
[00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:29.392]  We caught him in the act.
[00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:30.753]  Dirty cops.
[00:23:30.753 --> 00:23:32.613]  Bad people.
[00:23:32.613 --> 00:23:39.016]  If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already.
[00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:39.756]  Many, many years.
[00:23:41.396 --> 00:23:51.352]  I want to start by thanking some of, and I call them friends, because you know you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, gee, let's have a normal
[00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:56.357]  Situation with all that we've gone through we've done.
[00:23:56.357 --> 00:24:03.980]  I think more than any president and administration Wow, Trump almost crammed there really I say for the most part.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:09.162]  We only did that one more time We almost heard a crying right there and we take action now.
[00:24:09.162 --> 00:24:15.105]  We've done more than any Administration in the first few years you look at all of the things we've done.
[00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:15.125]  I
[00:24:16.966 --> 00:24:24.789]  I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from, from, think of that.
[00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:27.870]  Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed.
[00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.090]  100%.
[00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:35.492]  And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking like we had a good chance to win.
[00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:40.474]  And then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election till the time we took office.
[00:24:40.474 --> 00:24:42.414]  Because America was closed for business under globalism.
[00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:43.995]  Which was November 8th to January 20th.
[00:24:45.327 --> 00:24:46.849]  It's not taking credit away from Trump.
[00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:47.790]  That's all our credit.
[00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.192]  He literally just untied the boat from the dock.
[00:24:50.192 --> 00:24:52.274]  There was hope.
[00:24:52.274 --> 00:24:57.299]  And one of the reasons the stock market's gone up so much in the last few days is people think we're doing so well.
[00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:59.922]  They liked the State of the Union speech.
[00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:16.399]  It really is.
[00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:19.120]  It's a true honor to give it.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.301]  Mikey, in the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around.
[00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.462]  They've been all over the world.
[00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:32.664]  And one of them said, highly sophisticated person said, you know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference.
[00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:36.565]  There is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.
[00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:45.268]  The beauty, the majesty of the chamber, the power of the United States, the power of the people in this room.
[00:25:46.298 --> 00:25:47.659]  Really an amazing.
[00:25:47.659 --> 00:25:49.800]  I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.940]  You can go to any other country.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.042]  You can go to any other location, any other place.
[00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:55.422]  It's the beauty of everything.
[00:25:55.422 --> 00:25:59.985]  It's what it represents and how it represents our country.
[00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:02.986]  I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here.
[00:26:02.986 --> 00:26:08.368]  I know some are going to be left out, but they work so hard.
[00:26:08.368 --> 00:26:10.549]  And this is really not a news conference.
[00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:11.310]  It's not a speech.
[00:26:12.444 --> 00:26:17.726]  It's not anything, it's just we're sort of... It's a celebration.
[00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:22.048]  Because we have something that just worked out.
[00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:22.869]  I mean, it worked out.
[00:26:22.869 --> 00:26:24.709]  We went through hell.
[00:26:24.709 --> 00:26:25.550]  Unfairly.
[00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.651]  Did nothing wrong.
[00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:29.892]  Did nothing wrong.
[00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:32.813]  I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit.
[00:26:32.813 --> 00:26:35.954]  Not purposely, but I've done things wrong.
[00:26:35.954 --> 00:26:37.575]  But this is what the end result is.
[00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:11.378]  You can take that home, honey.
[00:27:11.378 --> 00:27:12.198]  Maybe we'll frame it.
[00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:17.843]  It's the only good headline I've ever had in the Washington Post.
[00:27:17.843 --> 00:27:19.085]  But every paper is the same.
[00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:20.486]  Does anybody have those papers?
[00:27:20.486 --> 00:27:21.447]  Does anybody have them?
[00:27:21.447 --> 00:27:26.631]  Because they're really like that, so I appreciate that.
[00:27:26.631 --> 00:27:29.574]  But some of the people here have been incredible warriors.
[00:27:29.574 --> 00:27:30.135]  They're warriors.
[00:27:31.363 --> 00:27:36.186]  And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint, this is a political thing.
[00:27:36.186 --> 00:27:40.669]  And every time I say, this is unfair, let's go to court, they say, sir, you can't go to court.
[00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:42.710]  This is politics.
[00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.393]  And we were treated unbelievably unfairly.
[00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:53.757]  And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:57.319]  It was all bullshit.
[00:27:57.319 --> 00:27:57.580]  Wow.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.321]  We then went through the Mueller report.
[00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:03.529]  And they should have come back one day later.
[00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.989]  They didn't.
[00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:12.077]  They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money.
[00:28:12.077 --> 00:28:19.003]  People came to Washington to help other people.
[00:28:19.003 --> 00:28:22.706]  Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I say, they came.
[00:28:22.706 --> 00:28:25.149]  One or two or three people in particular, but many people.
[00:28:26.482 --> 00:28:27.542]  We had a rough campaign.
[00:28:27.542 --> 00:28:28.623]  It was nasty.
[00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:30.123]  This is a live feed.
[00:28:30.123 --> 00:28:31.604]  We're going to end live now.
[00:28:31.604 --> 00:28:33.304]  We're going to hit pause on the satellite feed.
[00:28:33.304 --> 00:28:36.625]  When we come back, we'll catch up right where he says BS.
[00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:37.065]  And you know what?
[00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:37.766]  I'm going to air it.
[00:28:37.766 --> 00:28:39.366]  The Democrats can cuss on broadcast.
[00:28:39.366 --> 00:28:40.406]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:28:40.406 --> 00:28:40.987]  Patriots do it.
[00:28:40.987 --> 00:28:41.447]  We get in trouble.
[00:28:41.447 --> 00:28:42.447]  I don't want to cuss on air.
[00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:44.007]  The president just did.
[00:28:44.007 --> 00:28:46.788]  We can say that word, OK?
[00:28:46.788 --> 00:28:49.809]  And nobody at the FCC that Trump runs is going to get anybody in trouble.
[00:28:49.809 --> 00:28:51.770]  I'm sick of the Democrats doing what we can't do.
[00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:56.650]  Because he's noting, this is the first time in history, cussing to show people how serious this is.
[00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:56.992]  We'll be back.
[00:28:57.842 --> 00:29:02.384]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:02.384 --> 00:29:04.485]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:04.485 --> 00:29:06.206]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:06.206 --> 00:29:12.770]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.832]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:17.832 --> 00:29:22.535]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:22.975 --> 00:29:26.097]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:33.100]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:38.282]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[00:29:38.282 --> 00:29:41.584]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[00:29:41.584 --> 00:29:42.544]  Get clean.

[00:29:48.647 --> 00:29:48.868]  That's 800-506-6740.
[00:30:08.714 --> 00:30:10.075]  33% off.
[00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:10.896]  It's amazing.

[00:30:12.457 --> 00:30:20.902]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:23.103]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[00:30:23.103 --> 00:30:27.986]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[00:30:27.986 --> 00:30:30.367]  So just check it out for yourself.
[00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:30.808]  40% off.
[00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:32.188]  MFulwarestore.com.
[00:30:32.188 --> 00:30:33.109]  And it funds the MFulwar.
[00:30:33.109 --> 00:30:34.310]  And then Vitamin
[00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.751]  D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:40.072]  Super high quality, winter sun.
[00:30:40.072 --> 00:30:41.873]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:44.494]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[00:30:44.494 --> 00:30:45.775]  That's why people get so sick.
[00:30:45.775 --> 00:30:46.575]  That's the main reason.
[00:30:46.575 --> 00:30:49.676]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption.
[00:30:49.676 --> 00:30:50.557]  It's amazing.
[00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:55.319]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:55.319 --> 00:30:58.980]  Protect yourself and fund the InfoWars 360 win.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.122]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[00:31:03.157 --> 00:31:13.522]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[00:31:13.522 --> 00:31:20.285]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[00:31:21.065 --> 00:31:30.811]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[00:31:30.811 --> 00:31:33.493]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:39.525]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[00:31:39.525 --> 00:31:44.490]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.872]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:52.638]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[00:31:52.638 --> 00:31:54.640]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.743]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[00:31:59.235 --> 00:32:09.322]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[00:32:09.322 --> 00:32:15.306]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[00:32:15.306 --> 00:32:19.669]  But, it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:31.974]  That's why COBRA is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[00:32:31.974 --> 00:32:38.577]  Anyone, once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by COBRA.
[00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:47.076]  False flags and fake media.
[00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:52.997]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones.
[00:32:52.997 --> 00:32:56.999]  Blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[00:32:56.999 --> 00:32:57.339]  Ha ha!
[00:32:57.339 --> 00:33:01.940]  Hail Cobra!
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.601]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.968 --> 00:33:18.310]  First, they tried to steal the election.
[00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:28.796]  Then they tried to not seat the delegates saying that Trump was a criminal when it came to his inauguration on January 20th, 2017.
[00:33:28.796 --> 00:33:34.899]  Then they began the whole Russiagate fraud in earnest that had already been operating in the background.
[00:33:34.899 --> 00:33:39.982]  When that didn't work, they went to impeachment and removal in the Senate.
[00:33:39.982 --> 00:33:42.664]  That has now failed, but narrowly.
[00:33:44.437 --> 00:33:49.298]  They will try again because the process hurts the nation and they work for globalist forces.
[00:33:49.298 --> 00:33:51.779]  This is what the president's currently saying live.
[00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:57.501]  We paused it when we went to break when he came out and Fox News carried it as well.
[00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:59.901]  It was all bullshit.
[00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:13.445]  And again, I don't even like to use cuss words on air, but I'm sick of how on broadcast TV Democrats do it on The View, they do it on Good Morning America, they do it on their sitcoms at night, they do it during the family hour, and then
[00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:22.452]  They do it all over CNN, they do it everywhere, but then, if we do it, and we're conservatives, we get in trouble.
[00:34:22.452 --> 00:34:27.854]  But the President just did it, and notice Fox News, MSNBC, they didn't cut it out as well.
[00:34:27.854 --> 00:34:31.915]  Because the President did that to note how serious things are.
[00:34:31.915 --> 00:34:34.195]  Let's go to part of the live feed, then we'll go back to where we paused it.
[00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:39.831]  Fantastic job.
[00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:40.912]  And he understood rightfully.
[00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:42.253]  This was crooked politics.
[00:34:42.253 --> 00:34:44.155]  This was crooked politics.
[00:34:44.155 --> 00:34:45.636]  How about all these people?
[00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:48.518]  They're running for office.
[00:34:48.518 --> 00:34:53.762]  They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side.
[00:34:53.762 --> 00:34:54.963]  Most of them got wiped out.
[00:34:54.963 --> 00:34:57.225]  You know, they got their 1% or less.
[00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.646]  Most of them got less.
[00:34:58.646 --> 00:35:00.148]  They decided to go home.
[00:35:00.148 --> 00:35:01.369]  Let's go back to California.
[00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:04.371]  Let's go back to wherever they came from.
[00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:05.292]  Let's go back to New York.
[00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:06.713]  How about that one?
[00:35:06.713 --> 00:35:09.976]  Our New York Senator, Gillibrand.
[00:35:09.976 --> 00:35:14.660]  Let's go back to New York, after they get nothing.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:20.144]  And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reasonable, all of the different things that they had to say.
[00:35:20.144 --> 00:35:25.949]  We're going to go back to the feed where we cut it and just play it uninterrupted now, but I just want to point something out.
[00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:28.812]  Mitt Romney, after trying to stab Trump in the back,
[00:35:31.138 --> 00:35:38.783]  In the election, Trump still endorsed him, helped get him elected in Utah, and now he's done this again.
[00:35:38.783 --> 00:35:41.785]  But he said he did it for the Lord because of his conscience.
[00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:42.645]  Give me a break.
[00:35:42.645 --> 00:35:43.866]  What a Pharisee.
[00:35:43.866 --> 00:35:44.607]  What a hypocrite.
[00:35:44.607 --> 00:35:45.307]  What a fraud.
[00:35:45.307 --> 00:35:48.569]  What a liar.
[00:35:48.569 --> 00:35:57.535]  Now let's go back to the President and what he had to say just a little while ago.
[00:35:58.988 --> 00:36:01.269]  And then we will continue on from there.
[00:36:01.269 --> 00:36:02.010]  Here it is.
[00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:06.372]  Every time I say, this is unfair, let's go to court, they say, sir, you can't go to court.
[00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:08.414]  This is politics.
[00:36:08.414 --> 00:36:12.076]  And we were treated unbelievably unfairly.
[00:36:12.076 --> 00:36:19.440]  And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.203]  It was all bullshit.
[00:36:23.203 --> 00:36:25.064]  We then went through the Mueller report.
[00:36:27.358 --> 00:36:29.219]  And they should have come back one day later.
[00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:29.679]  They didn't.
[00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:37.761]  They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money.
[00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:44.683]  People came to Washington to help other people.
[00:36:44.683 --> 00:36:46.704]  Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I say.
[00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:50.825]  They came, one or two or three people in particular, but many people.
[00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:53.303]  We had a rough campaign.
[00:36:53.303 --> 00:36:54.004]  It was nasty.
[00:36:54.004 --> 00:36:56.506]  It was one of the nastiest, they say.
[00:36:56.506 --> 00:37:00.809]  They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign.
[00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:02.230]  They actually said we topped it.
[00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:08.095]  It was a nasty, it was a nasty both in the primaries and in the election.
[00:37:08.095 --> 00:37:11.358]  But you see, we thought after the election it would stop, but it didn't stop.
[00:37:11.358 --> 00:37:12.078]  It just started.
[00:37:13.508 --> 00:37:17.030]  And tremendous corruption.
[00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.151]  Tremendous corruption.
[00:37:19.151 --> 00:37:20.252]  So we had a campaign.
[00:37:20.252 --> 00:37:27.455]  Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers.
[00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:34.539]  With all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things.
[00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:35.459]  They knew all about it.
[00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:38.081]  The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:37:40.227 --> 00:37:42.008]  It's a very tough thing.
[00:37:42.008 --> 00:37:46.051]  And then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:51.575]  It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years.
[00:37:51.575 --> 00:37:55.357]  Then Bob Mueller testified.
[00:37:55.357 --> 00:37:57.379]  That didn't work out so well for the other side.
[00:37:59.485 --> 00:38:02.688]  But they should have said that first week, because it came out.
[00:38:02.688 --> 00:38:04.629]  Is that right, Jim Jordan?
[00:38:04.629 --> 00:38:08.513]  They knew in the first two days, actually.
[00:38:08.513 --> 00:38:09.634]  Devin, is that right?
[00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:12.836]  Two days, they knew that we were totally innocent.
[00:38:12.836 --> 00:38:16.119]  But they kept it going, Mark.
[00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:18.101]  They kept it going forever.
[00:38:19.781 --> 00:38:29.024]  Because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to a lot of people, was a surprise.
[00:38:29.024 --> 00:38:30.824]  I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win.
[00:38:30.824 --> 00:38:37.926]  We had Los Angeles Times and a few papers that said we were going to win.
[00:38:37.926 --> 00:38:40.507]  But it was going to be close.
[00:38:40.507 --> 00:38:41.867]  And we did win.
[00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:44.248]  It was one of the greatest wins of all time.
[00:38:44.248 --> 00:38:46.388]  And they said, OK, he won.
[00:38:46.388 --> 00:38:47.789]  And, you know, I wrote this down because
[00:38:48.888 --> 00:38:58.915]  That was where a thing called the insurance policy, to me, when I saw the insurance policy, and that was done long before the election.
[00:38:58.915 --> 00:39:03.059]  That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.
[00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:10.544]  And by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions, millions of dollars.
[00:39:10.544 --> 00:39:11.645]  $45 million.
[00:39:11.645 --> 00:39:12.606]  The fake dossier.
[00:39:13.843 --> 00:39:22.131]  And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people.
[00:39:22.131 --> 00:39:26.695]  I should have sued him too, but when you're president, people don't like suing.
[00:39:26.695 --> 00:39:31.739]  I want to thank my legal team, by the way, not for that advice, but for other advice.
[00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:35.483]  No, when you sue them at that level, they get to sue you back and find out your information and twist it.
[00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:37.544]  They can't.
[00:39:37.544 --> 00:39:39.867]  Jay, Pat, you guys stand up.
[00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:52.432]  Trump better go on the offense now.
[00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:53.294]  Right at the beginning.
[00:39:54.508 --> 00:39:56.889]  They said, sir, you have nothing to worry about.
[00:39:56.889 --> 00:39:59.409]  All of the facts are on your side.
[00:39:59.409 --> 00:40:01.770]  I said, you don't understand.
[00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.750]  That doesn't matter.
[00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:04.711]  That doesn't matter.
[00:40:04.711 --> 00:40:06.691]  And that was really true.
[00:40:06.691 --> 00:40:08.452]  They made up facts.
[00:40:08.452 --> 00:40:13.113]  A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president.
[00:40:13.113 --> 00:40:13.513]  That's criminal.
[00:40:13.513 --> 00:40:14.813]  He brought it out of thin air.
[00:40:14.813 --> 00:40:16.193]  Just made it up.
[00:40:16.193 --> 00:40:18.414]  They say he's a screenwriter, a failed screenwriter.
[00:40:18.414 --> 00:40:19.754]  He tried to go in.
[00:40:19.754 --> 00:40:21.715]  Unfortunately, he went into politics after that.
[00:40:22.631 --> 00:40:23.451]  That's actually true.
[00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:27.213]  Remember, he said the statement, which is a mob statement.
[00:40:27.213 --> 00:40:28.793]  Don't call me, I'll call you.
[00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.554]  I didn't say that.
[00:40:30.554 --> 00:40:36.696]  Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts.
[00:40:36.696 --> 00:40:39.156]  We had transcribers, professional transcribers.
[00:40:39.156 --> 00:40:44.718]  Then they said, oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.
[00:40:44.718 --> 00:40:49.480]  But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right?
[00:40:50.678 --> 00:40:54.119]  We had some people that, really amazing, but we did everything.
[00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:55.379]  We said, what's wrong with it?
[00:40:55.379 --> 00:40:56.719]  Well, they didn't add this word or that.
[00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:57.300]  It didn't matter.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.140]  I said, add it.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.681]  They're probably wrong, but add it.
[00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:05.121]  So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate.
[00:41:05.121 --> 00:41:15.464]  When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott, I don't know if Tim's here, but he said, sir, he's the first one to call me, sir, I read the transcript.
[00:41:15.464 --> 00:41:17.364]  You did nothing wrong.
[00:41:17.364 --> 00:41:19.185]  And Mitch, he stayed there right from the beginning.
[00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:19.985]  Let's stop right here.
[00:41:20.615 --> 00:41:22.556]  Again, we're now about 10 minutes behind on the speech.
[00:41:22.556 --> 00:41:23.477]  We're going to air the whole thing.
[00:41:23.477 --> 00:41:26.119]  I'm sure questions are probably going to come up.
[00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:30.202]  And then after that, we're going to your phone calls here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:30.202 --> 00:41:32.804]  I just have to say, this is historic.
[00:41:32.804 --> 00:41:34.685]  But notice, it's still got Trump on the defense.
[00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:38.348]  He's still explaining how he did nothing wrong.
[00:41:38.348 --> 00:41:43.752]  He needs to be going after them, and Nancy Pelosi's son, and the Ukrainians, and all the rest of this.
[00:41:45.131 --> 00:41:48.052]  Because they're not going to stop until they're dealt with.
[00:41:48.052 --> 00:41:48.772]  They're criminals.
[00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.173]  They've committed massive crimes.
[00:41:50.173 --> 00:41:53.694]  The dossier itself could send all of them to prison.
[00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:55.815]  Hillary contributed money to it.
[00:41:55.815 --> 00:41:57.015]  The DNC did.
[00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:59.916]  Mitt Romney connected groups did.
[00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:06.878]  And they passed this research around paying their minions up to a million apiece.
[00:42:06.878 --> 00:42:13.741]  FBI agents, wives and husbands are getting a half million, three hundred thousand, a million dollars to just contribute horse manure.
[00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:18.843]  That was a payoff venue.
[00:42:18.843 --> 00:42:19.283]  Vehicle.
[00:42:19.283 --> 00:42:27.309]  I mean, there's so many crimes here that you could just throw a dart with your eyes closed and hit bullseye.
[00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:29.891]  They'll be like, Mr. President, you've really won now.
[00:42:29.891 --> 00:42:32.213]  They're not going to stop.
[00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:34.335]  They're not going to stop.
[00:42:34.335 --> 00:42:36.236]  They're not going to stop.
[00:42:36.236 --> 00:42:39.138]  Because they're just like degenerate gamblers.
[00:42:39.138 --> 00:42:43.322]  They just keep doubling down, doubling down, doubling down because they're mentally ill.
[00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:45.790]  Look at Pelosi.
[00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.652]  The president has been acquitted, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:48.652 --> 00:42:49.433]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.714]  On the other side, the Democrats have already fired it back up.
[00:42:51.714 --> 00:42:55.317]  They say they're getting new impeachment articles ready.
[00:42:55.317 --> 00:42:55.957]  Unbelievable.
[00:42:55.957 --> 00:42:57.919]  Stay with us.
[00:42:57.919 --> 00:43:02.042]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war, but I know you're like me.
[00:43:02.042 --> 00:43:03.343]  You don't want my thanks.
[00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:07.718]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters.
[00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.899]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[00:43:09.899 --> 00:43:11.100]  And you know what?
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.382]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[00:43:14.382 --> 00:43:18.724]  And it's why M4's has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to...
[00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:29.074]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[00:43:29.074 --> 00:43:37.178]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[00:43:37.178 --> 00:43:45.862]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[00:43:46.917 --> 00:43:48.538]  You have made history.
[00:43:48.538 --> 00:43:50.419]  We have made history together.
[00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:54.981]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:57.642]  And I suggest you use it.
[00:43:57.642 --> 00:44:05.926]  It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the morning and said, son, you've got to see this.
[00:44:05.926 --> 00:44:13.950]  The company that holds the patents on the nanosilver that's in our toothpaste, that's in our immune gargle, and that's in some of the other great products like the super silver wound shell.
[00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:32.807]  Had reports from back in 2007 with the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security, with the Director of Homeland Security, certifying in a restricted document, confidential document of course, noted as, that this had been proven in their secret test to be knocking out SARS.
[00:44:32.807 --> 00:44:36.270]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless, now they authorized us.
[00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.850]  Thank you.
[00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:03.932]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[00:45:03.932 --> 00:45:07.476]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:45:07.476 --> 00:45:09.799]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[00:45:09.799 --> 00:45:11.621]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:13.223]  So here I am telling people.
[00:45:13.943 --> 00:45:24.110]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:35.638]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[00:45:35.638 --> 00:45:37.879]  It feels so good.
[00:45:37.879 --> 00:45:41.081]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[00:45:41.081 --> 00:45:43.383]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[00:45:44.125 --> 00:45:47.275]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[00:45:47.275 --> 00:45:48.960]  Because I like the way it feels.
[00:45:58.112 --> 00:46:05.816]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[00:46:05.816 --> 00:46:15.240]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States west coast.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:20.323]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out
[00:46:20.623 --> 00:46:21.884]  That's right.
[00:46:21.884 --> 00:46:30.189]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[00:46:30.189 --> 00:46:35.972]  Infowars, private labels from MyPatriotSupply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[00:46:35.972 --> 00:46:43.256]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks, and that people need to order now.
[00:46:43.256 --> 00:46:44.637]  They want to be able to get it within 7 to 10 days.
[00:46:46.718 --> 00:46:49.021]  If people wait, it may end up being longer.
[00:46:49.021 --> 00:47:01.914]  But if you get your order in now at Infowarsstore.com, you will be secured to get the food within 7 to 10 days.
[00:47:01.914 --> 00:47:04.557]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:41.967]  Fantastic job.
[00:47:41.967 --> 00:47:44.368]  The Deep State has failed severely.
[00:47:44.368 --> 00:47:45.368]  The Liberty Patriot
[00:47:46.032 --> 00:47:49.433]  This movement is taking over the Republican Party and the Republic.
[00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:51.933]  It's ours!
[00:47:51.933 --> 00:47:55.034]  Ha ha ha!
[00:47:55.034 --> 00:47:58.355]  America is falling back into our hands.
[00:47:58.355 --> 00:48:01.335]  The enemy can feel it.
[00:48:01.335 --> 00:48:03.216]  Isn't it smart?
[00:48:03.216 --> 00:48:06.116]  I said, well let's put it this way.
[00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:13.878]  For many, many years, a lot of very smart, bad in many cases, sometimes good, but people
[00:48:14.966 --> 00:48:25.250]  Have been trying to take his place, and to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the subject come up, because they've been wiped out so fast.
[00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.591]  This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch.
[00:48:27.591 --> 00:48:28.912]  And he's also given us 191 now.
[00:48:28.912 --> 00:48:29.512]  191 federal judges.
[00:48:34.952 --> 00:48:37.534]  Two Supreme Court judges, huh?
[00:48:37.534 --> 00:48:37.954]  Up to 191.
[00:48:37.954 --> 00:48:43.218]  The globalists have almost finished America off, but the Republic is back from the dead.
[00:48:43.218 --> 00:48:54.046]  As von Bismarck said, God loves children, drunks, and the United States of America.
[00:48:54.046 --> 00:48:57.508]  I don't know.
[00:48:57.508 --> 00:48:59.930]  That's what makes them good, when you can read somebody.
[00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:03.591]  Fantastic job.
[00:49:03.591 --> 00:49:04.672]  And he understood rightfully.
[00:49:04.672 --> 00:49:06.013]  This was crooked politics.
[00:49:06.013 --> 00:49:07.914]  This was crooked politics.
[00:49:07.914 --> 00:49:09.395]  How about all these people?
[00:49:09.395 --> 00:49:12.257]  They're running for office.
[00:49:12.257 --> 00:49:17.521]  They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side.
[00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.722]  Most of them got wiped out.
[00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:21.003]  You know, they got their 1% or less.
[00:49:21.003 --> 00:49:22.404]  Most of them got less.
[00:49:22.404 --> 00:49:23.906]  They decided to go home.
[00:49:23.906 --> 00:49:25.126]  Let's go back to California.
[00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:28.129]  Let's go back to wherever they came from.
[00:49:28.129 --> 00:49:29.050]  Let's go back to New York.
[00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.670]  How about that one?
[00:49:36.187 --> 00:49:37.207]  After they get nothing.
[00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.208]  And guys, keep rolling this.
[00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:40.869]  Don't pause the DVR, because those people have already seen us for two minutes or so.
[00:49:40.869 --> 00:49:45.331]  I'm going to talk and we'll come back to the recorded feed.
[00:49:45.331 --> 00:49:49.433]  We're going to give the number out and have callers respond to this.
[00:49:49.433 --> 00:49:54.615]  I want to hear what the President has to say, but he's still going live, so we have 20 more minutes of this.
[00:49:54.615 --> 00:50:01.298]  But I do want to take your phone call specifically on this, historically, and on the coronavirus, because there have been giant developments on that front.
[00:50:02.498 --> 00:50:08.702]  It's going to be a big challenge for the United States, and it is deadly to some, and it is spreading very, very fast, and it is engineered.
[00:50:08.702 --> 00:50:09.903]  That's now confirmed.
[00:50:09.903 --> 00:50:13.106]  So I want to take your calls on these subjects.
[00:50:13.106 --> 00:50:14.126]  877-789-2539.
[00:50:14.126 --> 00:50:15.868]  First-time callers today.
[00:50:15.868 --> 00:50:18.930]  We're taking first-time callers.
[00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:19.550]  877-789-2539.
[00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:27.416]  First-time callers, give us your take on Trump and what he needs to do to go on the offense against the deep state, what you make of the speech he's giving right now.
[00:50:27.416 --> 00:50:27.476]  877-789-2539.
[00:50:27.476 --> 00:50:27.676]  877-789-Alex.
[00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:36.954]  And then just remember, I've got this statement here from My Patriot Supply.
[00:50:36.954 --> 00:50:40.757]  When you order at InfoWareStore.com, we get part of the money to fund our operation.
[00:50:40.757 --> 00:50:42.999]  It's shipped out the very same time they're in our computer system.
[00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:45.782]  We're partners with them for over a decade.
[00:50:45.782 --> 00:50:47.423]  And so it goes right out.
[00:50:47.423 --> 00:50:49.385]  They work 7 to 10 days.
[00:50:49.385 --> 00:50:50.707]  They have the food on hand.
[00:50:50.707 --> 00:50:51.948]  They just got to package it.
[00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:52.949]  Now it's 10 to 14.
[00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:55.531]  Right now they're at 7 days.
[00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:58.193]  But the orders are so high and everything's going so crazy.
[00:50:59.674 --> 00:51:05.036]  Just to be safe, they're saying, if you get your order in today, it's 10 to 14 days.
[00:51:05.036 --> 00:51:06.796]  But they have super high quality, swearable food.
[00:51:06.796 --> 00:51:08.717]  The four-week is great to get.
[00:51:08.717 --> 00:51:10.797]  The four-month is great to get.
[00:51:10.797 --> 00:51:11.697]  They have a one-week.
[00:51:11.697 --> 00:51:12.898]  They have year-longs.
[00:51:12.898 --> 00:51:13.778]  They have two-years.
[00:51:13.778 --> 00:51:14.678]  They have special diets.
[00:51:14.678 --> 00:51:15.899]  It's really high quality.
[00:51:15.899 --> 00:51:19.040]  It's packaged in the best packaging you're going to find.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.680]  And it funds the information war.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.821]  And I only partner with folks that have quality food and that deliver when they say.
[00:51:24.821 --> 00:51:27.442]  Everybody else, I'm telling you, it's a bad industry.
[00:51:29.659 --> 00:51:31.439]  And I'm sad to have to say that, but that's just the truth.
[00:51:31.439 --> 00:51:33.220]  So we only partner with folks.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.320]  They make the Alexa Pure.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.201]  It's the highest rated out there gravity-fed filter you're going to find.
[00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:39.821]  Okay?
[00:51:39.821 --> 00:51:42.761]  You can find some that are almost as good or right up there with it, like Pro-Pure.
[00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:43.642]  We sell it too.
[00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:44.642]  Great folks.
[00:51:44.642 --> 00:51:48.122]  But I just go with whoever's the best, who's going to be there long term.
[00:51:48.122 --> 00:51:49.283]  I want to form a relationship.
[00:51:49.283 --> 00:51:52.023]  It's like if I get married, I'm not trying to get married for two years.
[00:51:52.023 --> 00:51:53.543]  I'm trying to find a life partner.
[00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:54.944]  Sometimes it doesn't always work out.
[00:51:54.944 --> 00:51:56.244]  I've been divorced, married again.
[00:51:56.704 --> 00:52:00.447]  But I mean, I try to have relationships because I want you to be treated like I want to be treated.
[00:52:00.447 --> 00:52:03.370]  Last thing I want is one of our awesome listeners to have a problem.
[00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.272]  They're great and they're selling out of food.
[00:52:05.272 --> 00:52:12.918]  And with this coronavirus and the 2020 and all the craziness, if they're able to pop the stock market, which the globalists are trying right now, then it is going to be very, very serious.
[00:52:12.918 --> 00:52:15.941]  So I suggest you get high quality, storable food before it all sells out.
[00:52:15.941 --> 00:52:21.165]  And then separately, the big bottle of immune gargle that has the patented nano silver in it.
[00:52:22.047 --> 00:52:22.889]  Let me just say this.
[00:52:22.889 --> 00:52:24.173]  Let me show TV viewers.
[00:52:24.173 --> 00:52:26.841]  This is from Texas A&M University Confidential.
[00:52:28.285 --> 00:52:36.087]  And then right here, you've got Department of the Army, Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command, from the Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration.
[00:52:36.087 --> 00:52:50.870]  And then you've also got the Head of Homeland Security in here, all saying in confidential documents of the NanoSilver that we have in SuperSilver and in the SuperSilver whitening toothpaste and in the SuperSilver wound gel.
[00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:51.671]  That's their main product.
[00:52:51.671 --> 00:52:52.631]  We probably label it.
[00:52:52.631 --> 00:52:55.692]  We have original products with them because they're big listeners and big fans.
[00:52:55.692 --> 00:52:57.072]  And again, that is the Nanotech.
[00:52:57.692 --> 00:53:00.034]  Uh, company, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:00.034 --> 00:53:01.556]  So be sure and check all that out.
[00:53:01.556 --> 00:53:04.599]  And again, that's American Biotech Labs LLC.
[00:53:04.599 --> 00:53:05.880]  Very, very respected.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.401]  And they're not cowards, so they don't care.
[00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:08.902]  We even tell you who they are.
[00:53:08.902 --> 00:53:10.764]  So only the best for you.
[00:53:10.764 --> 00:53:12.746]  This will sell out within days.
[00:53:12.746 --> 00:53:15.609]  The one ounce will sell out by early next week.
[00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:16.870]  And then this middle-sized bottle...
[00:53:17.824 --> 00:53:21.567]  We've still got quite a bit of it, but it will sell out very, very quickly as well.
[00:53:21.567 --> 00:53:26.771]  And you're not going to get this high-quality product, these prices, this product anywhere else, period.
[00:53:26.771 --> 00:53:28.372]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:29.873]  That also helps fund our operation.
[00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.295]  A total complete 360 win.
[00:53:32.295 --> 00:53:38.039]  Okay, let's go back to the President's speech that, again, is still ongoing.
[00:53:38.039 --> 00:53:41.121]  Here it is.
[00:53:41.121 --> 00:53:46.085]  After about 10 minutes I said to the people, don't show me anybody else.
[00:53:46.085 --> 00:53:46.665]  This is the guy.
[00:53:47.628 --> 00:53:51.151]  He was the Attorney General, did a phenomenal job in the state.
[00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:53.272]  Highly respected.
[00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:56.074]  And, Claire McCaskill.
[00:53:56.074 --> 00:53:59.116]  So, the theory was you couldn't beat her.
[00:53:59.116 --> 00:53:59.837]  Great campaigner.
[00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:00.918]  Remember the last campaign?
[00:54:00.918 --> 00:54:05.781]  She was always going to be taken out, and she wins, and people say, how did that happen?
[00:54:05.781 --> 00:54:07.743]  Didn't happen with him.
[00:54:07.743 --> 00:54:09.444]  But she got so friendly toward me.
[00:54:09.444 --> 00:54:14.528]  In fact, one of the ads I still have, I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made.
[00:54:16.089 --> 00:54:19.413]  And she tried to convince people that we were best friends.
[00:54:19.413 --> 00:54:22.377]  But Josh ended up winning by five or six points.
[00:54:22.377 --> 00:54:23.378]  You were unbelievable.
[00:54:23.378 --> 00:54:25.020]  You were tough.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.161]  And you are something.
[00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:30.266]  And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley.
[00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:31.467]  He was incensed, actually.
[00:54:31.467 --> 00:54:32.709]  I watched him.
[00:54:32.709 --> 00:54:33.670]  He was incensed.
[00:54:34.617 --> 00:54:37.257]  At what they were doing and what they were saying.
[00:54:37.257 --> 00:54:38.058]  And those were the ones.
[00:54:38.058 --> 00:54:41.178]  You know I had some that said... You know why you're incensed?
[00:54:41.178 --> 00:54:47.379]  Because the Democrats work for foreign multinational governments and are totally ruthless criminals and we're all in great danger.
[00:54:47.379 --> 00:54:49.459]  Their party has to end.
[00:54:49.459 --> 00:54:51.840]  The Republican Party has to break in too.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:55:01.742]  Two-party system is much better than the European model of 10 different parties, 20 parties, because the party in power can always parlay and buy off the other parties to stay in power or just change their name.
[00:55:01.742 --> 00:55:03.902]  Two-party system is the best and it's not perfect.
[00:55:04.582 --> 00:55:06.444]  We don't have a two-party system.
[00:55:06.444 --> 00:55:09.906]  We have the Democrats that work for globalists and want to destroy the country and create a race war.
[00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:11.107]  That's all they say.
[00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.068]  That's their mission.
[00:55:12.068 --> 00:55:14.930]  You've got the Republicans that are blue bloods that don't know what the hell is going on.
[00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.272]  We are taking the Republican Party over.
[00:55:17.272 --> 00:55:21.155]  We do need a two-party system, but the Democrats are only in blue cities through fraud.
[00:55:21.155 --> 00:55:21.735]  They are criminals.
[00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:22.856]  Look at the Iowa caucuses.
[00:55:22.856 --> 00:55:24.137]  All fraud.
[00:55:24.137 --> 00:55:27.700]  There's a siren on drudge right now that they're announcing they're going to re-caucus it.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:31.583]  They say enough is enough, DNC chair, because everyone sees through their crap!
[00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.571]  Democrats or an organized crime group?
[00:55:36.571 --> 00:55:37.431]  Back to the president.
[00:55:37.431 --> 00:55:38.971]  Went down big.
[00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:40.432]  You saw that?
[00:55:40.432 --> 00:55:42.532]  You saw that, Mike?
[00:55:42.532 --> 00:55:44.032]  But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy.
[00:55:44.032 --> 00:55:49.353]  He's difficult.
[00:55:49.353 --> 00:55:57.335]  Whenever I sign bills, you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's, it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it.
[00:55:57.335 --> 00:55:57.995]  And I see 99 to 1.
[00:55:57.995 --> 00:55:58.155]  99 to 1.
[00:56:03.581 --> 00:56:07.084]  Don't tell me who's the one.
[00:56:07.084 --> 00:56:07.864]  Is it Mike?
[00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:11.667]  Yes.
[00:56:11.667 --> 00:56:14.269]  And he always has a good reason for it, too, by the way.
[00:56:14.269 --> 00:56:16.671]  But he is, he's incredible.
[00:56:16.671 --> 00:56:18.992]  And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike.
[00:56:18.992 --> 00:56:20.313]  And I appreciate you very much.
[00:56:20.313 --> 00:56:21.554]  You're just fantastic.
[00:56:21.554 --> 00:56:23.856]  And say hello to the people of Utah.
[00:56:23.856 --> 00:56:27.759]  And tell them, I'm sorry about Mitt Romney.
[00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:28.880]  I'm sorry.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:29.120]  Okay?
[00:56:33.726 --> 00:56:37.967]  We can say that Mike Lee is by far the most popular senator from this state.
[00:56:37.967 --> 00:56:41.227]  But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways.
[00:56:41.227 --> 00:56:43.368]  In many ways.
[00:56:43.368 --> 00:56:51.029]  A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive, and I've had great support from other people in that state.
[00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.989]  Mike, we've got to go to break.
[00:56:51.989 --> 00:56:53.530]  We're going to come back with a little more of this.
[00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:58.510]  Maybe skip to the end when he was closing statements, but this is still ongoing live speech.
[00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.871]  We just backed it up so we could have commentary.
[00:57:02.065 --> 00:57:04.668]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:57:04.668 --> 00:57:07.210]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:08.391]  But they're not going to stop.
[00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:10.954]  So we should talk about how Trump must go on the offensive.
[00:57:12.335 --> 00:57:22.958]  With only 270 days left to the election, and now what we're going to demand of the Republican Party, because there's going to be other forces coming in the Republican Party trying to control Trump and the populist movements.
[00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:31.620]  Just because we've gotten beachheads all across the world and come back from the dead and the New World Order's in trouble, doesn't mean now in this power vacuum that we're out of the woods.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:34.121]  We started to fight back and suddenly started to win.
[00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:36.361]  But we're not out of the woods yet.
[00:57:36.361 --> 00:57:37.762]  There's a lot more fighting to do.
[00:57:39.086 --> 00:57:41.674]  There's always a fight between good and evil, but it's an amazing time to be here.
[00:57:41.674 --> 00:57:45.445]  Make no mistake, Trump would not have won and been in this position to fight back without you.
[00:57:48.683 --> 00:57:51.124]  The demand for food has not let up.
[00:57:51.124 --> 00:57:53.545]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[00:57:53.545 --> 00:57:58.266]  Everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[00:57:58.266 --> 00:58:00.067]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[00:58:00.067 --> 00:58:04.189]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver because, again, they have to package it.
[00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:06.229]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[00:58:06.229 --> 00:58:10.431]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[00:58:11.031 --> 00:58:12.152]  So I wouldn't procrastinate.
[00:58:12.152 --> 00:58:14.214]  We wanted this virus to be petering out.
[00:58:14.214 --> 00:58:15.696]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[00:58:15.696 --> 00:58:18.819]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[00:58:18.819 --> 00:58:21.441]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts.
[00:58:21.441 --> 00:58:24.725]  So get your storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:24.725 --> 00:58:25.806]  That helps fund our operation.
[00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:28.668]  It's insurance you can eat a total 360 win.
[00:58:28.668 --> 00:58:31.791]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:32.492 --> 00:58:32.952]  Thank you.
[00:58:48.547 --> 00:58:49.307]  Well, it's here.
[00:58:49.307 --> 00:58:49.948]  The year 2020.
[00:58:49.948 --> 00:58:52.228]  World governments out in the open.
[00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:56.670]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[00:58:56.670 --> 00:59:10.535]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[00:59:10.535 --> 00:59:10.735]  Wow.
[00:59:11.295 --> 00:59:12.796]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[00:59:12.796 --> 00:59:14.096]  The New World Order's real.
[00:59:14.096 --> 00:59:15.156]  Satanism's real.
[00:59:15.156 --> 00:59:16.517]  The pedophile elite are real.
[00:59:16.517 --> 00:59:20.358]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[00:59:20.358 --> 00:59:25.080]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.641]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:32.963]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[00:59:33.263 --> 00:59:35.625]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.006]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:39.947]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[00:59:39.947 --> 00:59:47.092]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of MFORESTORE.com is critical.
[00:59:47.092 --> 00:59:51.935]  So please take action.
[00:59:51.935 --> 00:59:55.558]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:55.558 --> 01:00:01.922]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[01:00:09.353 --> 01:00:11.234]  He never gives up.
[01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:13.615]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.615 --> 01:00:17.997]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[01:00:17.997 --> 01:00:20.998]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:20.998 --> 01:00:22.959]  I appreciate it very much.
[01:00:22.959 --> 01:00:27.561]  Thank you.
[01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:29.122]  You saw it very early on.
[01:00:31.115 --> 01:00:36.100]  And we have, uh, I don't know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot of congressmen.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:42.526]  I'll go over them quickly, but they have, they have also been, uh, you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing.
[01:00:45.165 --> 01:00:46.747]  That's got to be a first, Kevin, right?
[01:00:46.747 --> 01:00:48.328]  Is that like a first?
[01:00:48.328 --> 01:00:51.151]  The Republicans have this image.
[01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:56.877]  See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy.
[01:00:56.877 --> 01:00:59.139]  Open borders, sanctuary cities.
[01:00:59.139 --> 01:01:00.480]  They have horrible policy.
[01:01:01.414 --> 01:01:02.374]  Who the hell can win?
[01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:04.775]  Oh, their new policy is raise taxes.
[01:01:04.775 --> 01:01:06.176]  They want to raise taxes.
[01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:13.138]  You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, we're going to lower taxes.
[01:01:13.138 --> 01:01:14.078]  They want to raise taxes.
[01:01:14.078 --> 01:01:16.359]  So they have open borders, sanctuaries, cities.
[01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:18.940]  Raise everybody's taxes.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.380]  Get rid of everybody's health care.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.621]  180 million people in the United States, and they're really happy.
[01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:29.603]  And we're going to give you a health care that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.
[01:01:30.455 --> 01:01:32.416]  That's one year.
[01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:37.720]  So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.421]  They're vicious and mean.
[01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:40.342]  Vicious.
[01:01:40.342 --> 01:01:42.443]  These people are vicious.
[01:01:42.443 --> 01:01:45.905]  Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person.
[01:01:45.905 --> 01:01:48.987]  Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person.
[01:01:48.987 --> 01:01:53.510]  And she wanted to impeach a long time ago when she said, I pray for the president.
[01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:54.451]  I pray for the president.
[01:01:54.451 --> 01:01:55.252]  She doesn't pray.
[01:01:55.252 --> 01:01:57.913]  She may pray, but she prays for the opposite.
[01:01:57.913 --> 01:01:59.034]  But I doubt she prays at all.
[01:02:01.274 --> 01:02:03.235]  These are vicious people.
[01:02:03.235 --> 01:02:04.296]  But they do two things.
[01:02:04.296 --> 01:02:06.398]  They stick together.
[01:02:06.398 --> 01:02:07.178]  Historically.
[01:02:07.178 --> 01:02:09.100]  I'm not talking now.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.662]  They stick together like glue.
[01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.103]  That's how they impeached.
[01:02:14.103 --> 01:02:18.666]  Because they had, whatever the number is, 220 people.
[01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:21.628]  So if they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody.
[01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:23.850]  You could be George Washington.
[01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:25.171]  You could have just won the war.
[01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:28.213]  And they say, let's get him out of office.
[01:02:28.213 --> 01:02:30.475]  And they stuck together.
[01:02:31.297 --> 01:02:33.420]  And they're vicious as hell.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:45.657]  And they'll probably come back for more, but maybe not, because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then?
[01:02:49.179 --> 01:02:52.381]  But in normal times, decades, you would call it.
[01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:53.902]  That was a little unusual time.
[01:02:53.902 --> 01:02:57.025]  It was for a very short period.
[01:02:57.025 --> 01:03:03.669]  The Republican Party's poll numbers, and Donald Trump's poll numbers, are the highest I've ever had that.
[01:03:03.669 --> 01:03:04.990]  And that's obscured numbers, though.
[01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.932]  It's much higher.
[01:03:06.932 --> 01:03:12.156]  Donald Trump must deal with the political death blow, start indicting people, and he'll... It's too late to get your poll numbers up.
[01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:13.336]  ...in the Democratic Party.
[01:03:13.336 --> 01:03:15.078]  Because from my family's standpoint,
[01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:16.629]  It's been very unfair.
[01:03:16.629 --> 01:03:17.609]  It's got to be disbanded.
[01:03:17.609 --> 01:03:19.210]  It's a criminal organization.
[01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:19.991]  It's a mafia.
[01:03:19.991 --> 01:03:21.792]  Disband it!
[01:03:21.792 --> 01:03:23.133]  That's not a radical statement.
[01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.253]  It works for CHICOMS.
[01:03:24.253 --> 01:03:25.154]  It's globalist.
[01:03:25.154 --> 01:03:26.035]  No borders, no walls.
[01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.155]  The USA at all.
[01:03:27.155 --> 01:03:28.736]  End the Democratic Party.
[01:03:28.736 --> 01:03:30.377]  Outlaw it!
[01:03:30.377 --> 01:03:33.359]  Mike Pompeo was on the call.
[01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:34.700]  Many people were on the call.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.841]  I know that many people.
[01:03:35.841 --> 01:03:37.582]  They even have a print tie.
[01:03:37.582 --> 01:03:39.603]  Bringing up an old favorite word of mine.
[01:03:39.603 --> 01:03:41.865]  You know, the Republican Party splits in two.
[01:03:41.865 --> 01:03:43.586]  One libertarian or kind of like that style.
[01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.047]  The other super conservative.
[01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.426]  It'll end the Democratic Party.
[01:03:48.426 --> 01:03:50.547]  There's got to be a path.
[01:03:50.547 --> 01:03:53.868]  In the case of Ukraine, he's a new president.
[01:03:53.868 --> 01:03:55.848]  Seems like a very nice person, by the way.
[01:03:55.848 --> 01:03:58.089]  His whole thing was corruption.
[01:03:58.089 --> 01:03:59.989]  He's going to stop corruption.
[01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:02.850]  We even have a treaty.
[01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:03.070]  2001, 1999.
[01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:09.992]  It's a treaty, signed treaty, that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine.
[01:04:09.992 --> 01:04:14.833]  I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption.
[01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:31.482]  But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month, and that's only Ukraine.
[01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:33.862]  Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion.
[01:04:33.862 --> 01:04:37.204]  Yeah, we're going to go to break right here and come back, and then I'm going to start going to your phone calls.
[01:04:37.204 --> 01:04:41.145]  And then we'll, throughout the next hour, play clips of the President.
[01:04:41.145 --> 01:04:42.646]  He's still speaking on the satellite, right?
[01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:43.366]  He's still live?
[01:04:44.977 --> 01:04:46.818]  He's still going.
[01:04:46.818 --> 01:04:47.718]  So how about we do this?
[01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:52.780]  We'll pause where we were, come back and play some of what he's saying live right after this break in 60 seconds.

[01:05:21.188 --> 01:05:26.071]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.

[01:05:37.078 --> 01:05:38.159]  Winter sun.
[01:05:38.159 --> 01:05:39.960]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.602]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[01:05:42.602 --> 01:05:43.863]  That's why people get so sick.
[01:05:43.863 --> 01:05:44.664]  That's the main reason.
[01:05:44.664 --> 01:05:46.926]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.

[01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:13.191]  Biden has been speaking for about 45 minutes.
[01:06:13.191 --> 01:06:18.735]  Let's go to what he's currently saying, then we'll back it up for parts that we've not gotten to.
[01:06:18.735 --> 01:06:22.278]  Then we're going to your phone calls to respond to this historic event.
[01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:29.084]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and the Democratic Party is a criminal mafia that must be disbanded.
[01:06:29.084 --> 01:06:30.385]  We need a real two-party system.
[01:06:30.385 --> 01:06:34.908]  The Republican Party should become the totally dominant party and split into two.
[01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:35.389]  That is the
[01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:37.350]  Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing.
[01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:37.991]  The man and the woman.
[01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:39.572]  And they came and they didn't have rifles.
[01:06:39.572 --> 01:06:43.294]  They were against a supposedly pretty good sharpshooter with rifles, good equipment, and all they had was a gun.
[01:07:01.972 --> 01:07:05.714]  And they started coming in from the outfield shooting.
[01:07:05.714 --> 01:07:10.817]  And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred.
[01:07:10.817 --> 01:07:15.180]  This guy has the rifle and he's hitting people.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.401]  And he was going to move up and there was no out.
[01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.543]  I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out.
[01:07:20.543 --> 01:07:24.706]  The entrance was a single entrance way on the other side where he was.
[01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:27.107]  So everyone went into the dugout, ran into the dugout.
[01:07:27.107 --> 01:07:28.028]  It was definitely a setup.
[01:07:28.028 --> 01:07:29.929]  Steve was really hit badly in the stomach.
[01:07:31.291 --> 01:07:32.952]  And with a bullet that rips you apart.
[01:07:32.952 --> 01:07:34.413]  It's supposed to do that.
[01:07:34.413 --> 01:07:37.514]  It rips you apart.
[01:07:37.514 --> 01:07:40.576]  And these two people came charging forward.
[01:07:40.576 --> 01:07:43.117]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:07:43.117 --> 01:07:46.039]  And one of them, you know who?
[01:07:46.039 --> 01:07:49.501]  One of them, him, got the shooter.
[01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:50.921]  Hit him.
[01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:51.722]  And then got him.
[01:07:52.537 --> 01:07:53.637]  Killed him.
[01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:54.677]  From long distance.
[01:07:54.677 --> 01:07:55.958]  It was amazing.
[01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:59.899]  If you didn't have those two people, you could imagine, right?
[01:07:59.899 --> 01:08:01.259]  You could imagine what would happen.
[01:08:01.259 --> 01:08:09.681]  So, Melanie and I went to the hospital that night, and he was in such bad shape, and he's been working ever since so hard.
[01:08:09.681 --> 01:08:15.302]  But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the National Spark, and I'm watching.
[01:08:15.302 --> 01:08:18.382]  And it's on television.
[01:08:18.382 --> 01:08:21.163]  And it's just, you know, game, people, you want to win it, right?
[01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.243]  And Steve's at second base.
[01:08:24.243 --> 01:08:26.763]  The poor guy can't even walk.
[01:08:26.763 --> 01:08:29.784]  Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees?
[01:08:29.784 --> 01:08:32.405]  He was known for range, Louie.
[01:08:32.405 --> 01:08:32.745]  Range.
[01:08:32.745 --> 01:08:33.746]  He had the greatest range.
[01:08:33.746 --> 01:08:37.367]  If a ball's hit the shortstop, Bobby Richardson's the second player.
[01:08:37.367 --> 01:08:38.447]  Second baseman.
[01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:40.808]  Bobby Richardson would field the ball.
[01:08:40.808 --> 01:08:43.509]  If it's hit the first base, he'll throw it to the first baseman.
[01:08:43.509 --> 01:08:45.869]  He had unbelievable range.
[01:08:45.869 --> 01:08:49.991]  This was not Steve Scully's.
[01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:50.971]  Steve had no range.
[01:08:53.951 --> 01:08:56.111]  One foot, and he has to fall down, right?
[01:08:56.111 --> 01:08:58.052]  Because, you know, he was trying to get better.
[01:08:58.052 --> 01:09:01.513]  I don't know who the hell put you on the field.
[01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:03.373]  And this is a true story.
[01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:11.135]  So, the game starts, and the first pitch, Steve Sin is second base, and the guy is really in bad shape.
[01:09:11.135 --> 01:09:13.115]  And I said, this is terrible.
[01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:17.556]  A shot, round ball shot, is hit to second.
[01:09:19.016 --> 01:09:24.820]  And Steve, I say, I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, this is not good.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.002]  That ball is going toward him.
[01:09:27.002 --> 01:09:31.325]  And this guy stopped that ball, caught the ball.
[01:09:31.325 --> 01:09:33.046]  He's now laying down.
[01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:35.908]  He throws the ball the first base he gets about.
[01:09:35.908 --> 01:09:37.630]  I said, it's the most incredible thing.
[01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:40.512]  I've never seen that play.
[01:09:40.512 --> 01:09:41.733]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:09:43.422 --> 01:09:51.625]  What Trump does is, he humanizes everybody, and he shows the world he's human, not this demonized creature, this straw man they built.
[01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:55.306]  Because you could never do that again in a million years.
[01:09:55.306 --> 01:09:57.726]  But you weren't going to let that ball go through.
[01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:01.688]  I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right?
[01:10:01.688 --> 01:10:04.648]  That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior.
[01:10:04.648 --> 01:10:07.089]  Steve, he is fantastic.
[01:10:07.089 --> 01:10:08.330]  You are fantastic.
[01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.210]  You and Liz.
[01:10:10.543 --> 01:10:11.964]  Kevin, what a group.
[01:10:11.964 --> 01:10:12.785]  I mean, what a group.
[01:10:12.785 --> 01:10:13.426]  I got lucky.
[01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:15.087]  I got lucky because you need the right people.
[01:10:15.087 --> 01:10:17.009]  I had the wrong people there.
[01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:18.090]  Maybe a different story.
[01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:22.254]  Maybe we'd be celebrating something else.
[01:10:22.254 --> 01:10:24.876]  But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise.
[01:10:24.876 --> 01:10:29.341]  And Elise, you
[01:10:30.646 --> 01:10:33.449]  I just read the story, she's the most incredible.
[01:10:33.449 --> 01:10:35.731]  What's going on with you, Elise?
[01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:42.337]  So I even said, you know, I was up campaigning for helping her, but I thought, she looks good, she looks like good talent.
[01:10:42.337 --> 01:10:46.301]  But did I not realize when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise?
[01:10:47.642 --> 01:10:51.085]  All right, again, we're analyzing what the President said.
[01:10:51.085 --> 01:10:54.707]  I get he's being friendly and trying to be human, which he is, everybody.
[01:10:54.707 --> 01:10:59.271]  I'd like to see more attacks on the deep state and the globalists and how there's going to be criminal action against him.
[01:10:59.271 --> 01:11:01.132]  He's already said some of that.
[01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:03.333]  And you can go to DrudgeReport.com, there's a nice boil down of that.
[01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:06.496]  We have a boil down on Infowars.com and Newswars.com as well.
[01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:09.097]  He said it's total BS.
[01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:11.299]  Caught coming in the act, it was all BS.
[01:11:11.299 --> 01:11:13.320]  Evil, dirty cops, leakers.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.921]  Live, high noon, Trump triumphant.
[01:11:16.371 --> 01:11:21.135]  Calls for Iowa to recanvass and other Democrats are saying they're basically probably going to do that.
[01:11:21.135 --> 01:11:30.283]  There's so much going on, but I want to open the phones up and ask you specifically, what do you think President Trump needs to do on the offense?
[01:11:30.283 --> 01:11:31.684]  How will the deep states fight back?
[01:11:31.684 --> 01:11:36.469]  Because I can tell you here at the ground level, it is directed by Hillary.
[01:11:38.231 --> 01:11:38.471]  I don't
[01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:58.405]  And they still keep believing they're going to remove him.
[01:11:58.405 --> 01:12:04.048]  And that's why they've got to keep their actions going against everybody to make it look like they're still on the offense and can't be beat.
[01:12:04.048 --> 01:12:09.731]  So all their minions stay in place and keep obstructing and blocking an American recovery.
[01:12:09.731 --> 01:12:11.372]  And that's why they'll go for another impeachment.
[01:12:11.372 --> 01:12:20.716]  They've said they will, probably even before the election, is to take all the oxygen out of the room and to dominate things and to make Trump go on the defensive instead of going on the offensive.
[01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:21.417]  But it's being reported.
[01:12:22.688 --> 01:12:36.258]  We'll see if that indeed happens, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:36.258 --> 01:12:42.402]  But there is so much more that we're going to be breaking down here today, and I have not gotten into the latest on the virus.
[01:12:42.402 --> 01:12:44.003]  I should do that right now and then go to break.
[01:12:44.003 --> 01:12:45.244]  Come back with your calls.
[01:12:45.244 --> 01:12:48.766]  Bioweapons expert exposes coronavirus as a weapon of war.
[01:12:49.967 --> 01:12:54.470]  The coronavirus outbreak could derail Xi Jinping's dreams of a Chinese century.
[01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.012]  That's time.
[01:12:56.012 --> 01:13:01.676]  Coronavirus, Chinese media, giant list death toll at 24,000 but quickly changes.
[01:13:01.676 --> 01:13:04.958]  So again, that matches yesterday the number of infected they were saying.
[01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:09.462]  Now they're saying it's the number that died, then they changed it back.
[01:13:09.462 --> 01:13:10.663]  Interesting.
[01:13:10.663 --> 01:13:13.645]  China deploys thermal drones to scan villagers for coronavirus.
[01:13:15.168 --> 01:13:19.992]  From the sky, so it's all part of the robot takeover by the state, because the robots will follow orders.
[01:13:19.992 --> 01:13:25.296]  China scrambles to find beds for virus patients as death hits 563.
[01:13:25.296 --> 01:13:32.942]  A floating prison, crews of Asian, ends in virus quarantine.
[01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:36.565]  It was a constant coronavirus case, brings total in the US to 12.
[01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:39.296]  There's so much more.
[01:13:39.296 --> 01:13:43.518]  10 more diagnosed with coronavirus aboard quarantine ship off Japan.
[01:13:43.518 --> 01:13:49.341]  We've got eerie drone footage of Wuhan reveal city that really is a ghost city.
[01:13:49.341 --> 01:13:54.003]  That is all coming up here today.
[01:13:54.003 --> 01:13:57.664]  We have so much other news going on.
[01:13:57.664 --> 01:14:00.286]  Known al-Qaeda operatives that have been able to get into the U.S.
[01:14:00.286 --> 01:14:00.706]  caught in
[01:14:01.943 --> 01:14:20.486]  The United States YouTube pledges to remove manipulated election-related videos, so anybody that they call manipulative... I mean, even if they're being totally truthful, like, come to our restaurant, we have the most delicious, juicy food, and, you know, a half-off on burgers on Tuesdays.
[01:14:20.486 --> 01:14:21.947]  That's manipulative.
[01:14:21.947 --> 01:14:24.107]  The word propaganda just means to propagate.
[01:14:24.107 --> 01:14:25.387]  We think of propaganda as a bad thing.
[01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:29.208]  No, there's black propaganda, gray propaganda, and white propaganda in those terms.
[01:14:30.776 --> 01:14:33.600]  Can I tell you, hey this is a really great product, you need it.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.682]  That's manipulative, but it's the truth.
[01:14:35.682 --> 01:14:39.788]  And the best manipulation is the truth, and just treating people like you want to be treated.
[01:14:39.788 --> 01:14:47.939]  But again, now they're saying YouTube pledges to remove manipulated election related videos, and if someone flags it and says it's manipulative,
[01:14:49.025 --> 01:14:53.086]  Then they take it down because the community, oh we didn't lynch you!
[01:14:53.086 --> 01:15:01.329]  Just like under the Maoist system, if the students wanted an adult arrested or killed, then it happened because the community guidelines said do it.
[01:15:01.329 --> 01:15:04.490]  That's all coming up as well today.
[01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:07.711]  Huawei pledges 5G network for EU market.
[01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:18.609]  German paper admits that most boat migrants are not real refugees, but are military-age men invading to get free welfare and quote, engage in jihad.
[01:15:18.609 --> 01:15:21.591]  French police clear rat-infested migrant camp in Paris.
[01:15:21.591 --> 01:15:22.252]  All over the U.S.
[01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:28.537]  they're admitting that migrant camps are causing the poisoning of the water supplies, homeless camps, polluting local water supplies.
[01:15:28.537 --> 01:15:30.078]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:15:31.775 --> 01:15:34.558]  This is how you make us a third world country, how you sabotage us.
[01:15:34.558 --> 01:15:37.180]  Every policy is to sabotage us.
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:42.905]  China shoots people in the head that try to run past quarantine and the UN says they're doing a great job.
[01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:49.792]  The same UN official then said, as you know, on Monday, that the US shouldn't block any flights and it's xenophobic from China.
[01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:53.295]  So nobody else will take the flights, that's fine, but when we don't take the flights, we're banned.
[01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:59.250]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:02.152]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[01:17:03.962 --> 01:17:10.347]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[01:17:10.347 --> 01:17:15.731]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[01:17:15.811 --> 01:17:18.252]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[01:17:18.252 --> 01:17:19.692]  Oh, can I ever?
[01:17:19.692 --> 01:17:24.833]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:25.614]  Guess what?
[01:17:25.614 --> 01:17:30.655]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:40.938]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[01:17:56.892 --> 01:17:59.873]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[01:17:59.873 --> 01:18:02.674]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[01:18:02.674 --> 01:18:04.454]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[01:18:04.454 --> 01:18:05.215]  I hope it doesn't.
[01:18:05.215 --> 01:18:09.936]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause, well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:13.177]  So I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[01:18:13.177 --> 01:18:14.378]  It's insurance you can eat.
[01:18:14.378 --> 01:18:15.578]  It lasts 25 years.
[01:18:15.578 --> 01:18:19.959]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:21.440]  And that's my Patriot supply.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.401]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label
[01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:33.320]  They're still able within 7 to 10 days to ship it to you.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:41.144]  If you get your orders in on their small orders, their big orders 7 to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you if you get your order in now.
[01:18:41.144 --> 01:18:44.906]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.

[01:20:10.381 --> 01:20:12.882]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.882 --> 01:20:16.223]  President Trump's wrapping up his hour-plus long press conference right now.
[01:20:16.223 --> 01:20:18.183]  Let's go to the end of it.
[01:20:18.183 --> 01:20:26.766]  A guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency.
[01:20:27.694 --> 01:20:34.920]  But she said, there's something so compelling, has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.403]  I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country.
[01:20:39.403 --> 01:20:41.825]  She was right about that.
[01:20:41.825 --> 01:20:43.306]  And it's just not worth it.
[01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:45.068]  That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago.
[01:20:45.068 --> 01:20:47.209]  Right.
[01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.511]  And I think it's a shame.
[01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.233]  I think it's a shame.
[01:20:51.233 --> 01:20:56.677]  But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and
[01:20:57.808 --> 01:20:59.152]  All of the things we can do.
[01:20:59.152 --> 01:21:00.054]  Prescription drugs.
[01:21:00.054 --> 01:21:04.746]  You know, we had Secretary Azar's here and I want to thank him for this, but we had...
[01:21:05.788 --> 01:21:10.550]  First time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year.
[01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:12.611]  First time in 51 years.
[01:21:12.611 --> 01:21:16.953]  But what we can do working with both parties in Congress would be unbelievable.
[01:21:16.953 --> 01:21:18.093]  It would be unbelievable.
[01:21:18.093 --> 01:21:26.096]  All we can do, and I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it, but what we can do is... Alright folks, again I call this a press conference.
[01:21:26.096 --> 01:21:27.557]  I don't know if he's going to take questions or not.
[01:21:27.557 --> 01:21:28.217]  Probably not.
[01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:31.679]  It's just his statement, his high-end statement on
[01:21:32.932 --> 01:21:34.553]  The whole fiasco that's been ongoing.
[01:21:34.553 --> 01:21:37.834]  I'm just saying, how are the Democrats going to be punished for this?
[01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:41.656]  How are they going to be held responsible when it turns out the President was innocent, is what he asked.
[01:21:41.656 --> 01:21:44.458]  They said that was intimidation while they were attacking him at every level.
[01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:46.218]  Saying he should be put in prison, that he should die.
[01:21:46.218 --> 01:21:50.521]  That's what Maxine Waters said.
[01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:53.662]  What was the quote?
[01:21:53.662 --> 01:21:55.283]  Indict, convict, imprison.
[01:21:58.816 --> 01:22:14.886]  I'm gonna have to decide that if Trump doesn't do anything about this, that he's a masochist and likes pain.
[01:22:14.886 --> 01:22:17.948]  Because I'm getting sick of it.
[01:22:17.948 --> 01:22:20.310]  I get treated like hell in the streets, and that's okay.
[01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.072]  I don't mind having most people shake my hand, but having some attack me.
[01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:47.705]  But I don't want to sit there and take it forever and watch them, like a bunch of damn peacocks, strut around and piss on me and my family constantly, and try to overthrow the country, and tell me, Democrats come up to me and they say, they said at the gun rally, they were a tiny minority there, they were totally freaked out seeing probably 10% of the crowd being black, another 15% or so Hispanic, a lot of Asians out with their guns, over 30,000, 40,000, the media said 25,000, it's way more than that.
[01:22:51.035 --> 01:22:59.324]  The left was all freaked out, white college types, with their cameras and all their stuff out there working for different law firms, we later confirmed.
[01:22:59.324 --> 01:23:02.268]  They'd say, you're going to effin' President Jones!
[01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:05.351]  We're gonna kill you!
[01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:11.598]  Because these are authoritarians, that's why you get all the, now it's like seven or eight Bernie Sanders campaign members.
[01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:16.572]  Saying we're going to put conservatives in concentration camps and kill them.
[01:23:16.572 --> 01:23:19.314]  But not before we work them to death.
[01:23:19.314 --> 01:23:23.396]  And you learn it's some, you know, drug addict criminal living in his mother's basement.
[01:23:23.396 --> 01:23:30.020]  But that's the type of person that wants to be a concentration camp guard.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.321]  So we've got cancer.
[01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:34.863]  With Trump and the rest of us, we're, you know, discovering it.
[01:23:39.175 --> 01:23:49.283]  I mean, these people are so weak, that's why they seek radical power, because they don't think about the other side of using that power.
[01:23:49.283 --> 01:23:51.325]  But I can tell you, I don't want to put them in concentration camps.
[01:23:51.325 --> 01:23:53.266]  I want these people to be investigated.
[01:23:53.266 --> 01:24:03.155]  I want them to be indicted and exposed as a criminal group and removed off our back, because they're going to keep attacking like a mindless zombie.
[01:24:03.155 --> 01:24:06.978]  Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, like old, decrepit zombies,
[01:24:08.055 --> 01:24:10.801]  Are emblematic of this.
[01:24:10.801 --> 01:24:14.690]  And it's like in The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price.
[01:24:16.203 --> 01:24:19.225]  They're just wandering around his door every night.
[01:24:19.225 --> 01:24:22.326]  They're slow and they're stupid, but you can't ever not be on your guard.
[01:24:22.326 --> 01:24:24.247]  Because they do not stop.
[01:24:24.247 --> 01:24:25.808]  They never go away.
[01:24:25.808 --> 01:24:27.789]  They never back down.
[01:24:27.789 --> 01:24:33.532]  They just attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[01:24:33.532 --> 01:24:38.774]  And anything good, anything strong, they attack because they see that as strength.
[01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:40.916]  They don't want fences around your houses.
[01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:41.796]  But they have walls.
[01:24:41.796 --> 01:24:43.337]  They don't want walls, but they have walls.
[01:24:44.175 --> 01:24:45.256]  They attack the family.
[01:24:45.256 --> 01:24:48.117]  They try to give known pedophiles access to your children.
[01:24:48.117 --> 01:24:50.938]  Because they are turned over to evil.
[01:24:50.938 --> 01:24:53.059]  They've been given over to great delusion.
[01:24:53.059 --> 01:24:56.561]  Let's see where the president is now on the live feed.
[01:24:56.561 --> 01:25:02.724]  That act of community gave me the strength to keep going.
[01:25:02.724 --> 01:25:07.606]  It saved me in a time when I didn't even realize how much I was struggling.
[01:25:08.877 --> 01:25:16.918]  You know, and in a way... Alright, so the President has finished and we're getting footage of Pelosi, who I was just talking about, hodling around.
[01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:22.699]  And nothing against old people or people that, you know, look like a cryptkeeper.
[01:25:22.699 --> 01:25:29.381]  Except a lot of people that know her, or have been, let's just say, around her up close, they say that she literally is scary as hell.
[01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:31.821]  And doesn't even know who she is half the time.
[01:25:31.821 --> 01:25:34.742]  And again, that's who the globalists have, is people like that.
[01:25:34.742 --> 01:25:36.282]  That are tool bags.
[01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:42.760]  And they're all investing in the idea that Trump's going to get removed and everything's going to go back the way it was.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.882]  Regardless of what happens to Trump, America's awake to your New World Order.
[01:25:45.882 --> 01:25:47.043]  We understand your operation.
[01:25:47.043 --> 01:25:48.425]  It's never going back that way.
[01:25:48.425 --> 01:25:59.954]  Nathan, Johnny, John, Tim, Aaron, Robert, Michael, Justin, Kevin, Mike, we're going to all of your calls.
[01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:02.777]  Let's go ahead and go to Kevin in Florida first.
[01:26:02.777 --> 01:26:03.878]  Kevin, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:26:06.021 --> 01:26:07.382]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:26:07.382 --> 01:26:18.746]  I just want to spend a moment or two talking about this coronavirus, and I want to be very clear to people and your listeners, and you are very smart, that this is a game that we've seen played.
[01:26:18.746 --> 01:26:21.628]  This is no different than the anthrax vaccine.
[01:26:21.628 --> 01:26:23.208]  This is no different than SARS.
[01:26:23.208 --> 01:26:24.809]  This is no different than the swine flu.
[01:26:25.549 --> 01:26:38.198]  This is another push to try and get these forced vaccinations on people with these psychotic people in labs cooking up these viruses that they claim kill everyone in their sight.
[01:26:38.198 --> 01:26:44.723]  And I just find it very hilarious that there's in excess of 28 to 30,000 cases and there's only 500 potential deaths.
[01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:52.049]  Of this deadly, deadly outbreak vaccine.
[01:26:52.049 --> 01:27:04.537]  If you go on and you even Google, if you Google any of these supposed deadly chill viruses and the symptoms, they all say extremely rare from anthrax to SARS to swine flu.
[01:27:04.537 --> 01:27:10.160]  And I think people just need to wake up because this is the plan of what they're going to do going forward.
[01:27:10.979 --> 01:27:17.000]  Specifically, obviously, the globalists want to use outbreaks to bring in world government to answer the global crisis.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.861]  But how can the U.N.
[01:27:17.861 --> 01:27:24.662]  tell China, you're doing a great job shooting people that run checkpoints and locking people up in their houses and burning bodies in mass graves?
[01:27:24.662 --> 01:27:26.563]  It's obviously much bigger than they're saying.
[01:27:26.563 --> 01:27:27.783]  But then the same U.N.
[01:27:27.783 --> 01:27:29.323]  officials say the U.S.
[01:27:29.323 --> 01:27:31.764]  is xenophobic and bad for not allowing flights from China.
[01:27:32.978 --> 01:27:36.540]  Russia's closed its border to China and blocked all flights.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:38.242]  The other countries before we did.
[01:27:38.242 --> 01:27:48.388]  So how is it that America's xenophobic and bad, that we've done the exact same thing other countries have done, it just shows the UN is completely out of control?
[01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:49.669]  I completely agree.
[01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:55.493]  I look at it like the situation where the old Twilight Zone episode with the obsolete man.
[01:27:55.493 --> 01:27:59.356]  I really believe that they're trying to make America the obsolete man because
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:08.384]  It's just a form of hypocrisy that you could do something and get mad, but when we do the exact same thing, like you said, it's total anarchy.
[01:28:08.384 --> 01:28:11.166]  Well, what it is, is it's a war on logic.
[01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:17.149]  So, I think what you're trying to say is, all this virus hype is going to push force inoculations and drone surveillance.
[01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.929]  We're now seeing it.
[01:28:17.929 --> 01:28:21.151]  Lockdown cities, robots controlling us and watching us.
[01:28:21.151 --> 01:28:26.574]  The perfect control for an authoritarian state like China to use that against their population that's been rebelling against them.
[01:28:28.659 --> 01:28:29.399]  Absolutely.
[01:28:29.399 --> 01:28:31.100]  I think it too, it goes a little bit further.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:37.342]  I think that, you know, they've done a wonderful job of dumbing down the population with the chemicals they put in the food.
[01:28:37.342 --> 01:28:43.964]  Because you've seen it, like you said about these, anytime they have any sort of these rallies, these people are soulless.
[01:28:43.964 --> 01:28:45.925]  You know, they can't form complete sentences.
[01:28:45.925 --> 01:28:48.986]  Yeah, the folks that are on the enemy's side are hypnotized.
[01:28:48.986 --> 01:28:50.466]  They're not as bad off as you think.
[01:28:50.466 --> 01:28:52.467]  They're in a sleep state medically.
[01:28:56.069 --> 01:28:57.290]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.290 --> 01:29:01.213]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.213 --> 01:29:02.754]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:05.716]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:11.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.481]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:15.423]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.423 --> 01:29:17.624]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.624 --> 01:29:22.068]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.068 --> 01:29:24.369]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.996 --> 01:29:27.257]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:27.257 --> 01:29:28.557]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:28.557 --> 01:29:32.280]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.380]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.201]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:35.201 --> 01:29:36.902]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:29:36.902 --> 01:29:44.706]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:44.706 --> 01:29:45.727]  Bold statement?
[01:29:45.727 --> 01:29:46.707]  You bet.
[01:29:46.707 --> 01:29:49.189]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:51.410]  That's survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:54.552]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:00.066]  The demand for food has not let up.
[01:30:00.066 --> 01:30:02.486]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[01:30:02.486 --> 01:30:07.207]  Everybody else has basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[01:30:07.207 --> 01:30:09.008]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[01:30:09.008 --> 01:30:13.129]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver because, again, they have to package it.
[01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:15.169]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:19.350]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:21.092]  So I wouldn't procrastinate.
[01:30:21.092 --> 01:30:23.154]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[01:30:23.154 --> 01:30:24.656]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[01:30:24.656 --> 01:30:27.759]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[01:30:27.759 --> 01:30:30.382]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts.
[01:30:30.382 --> 01:30:33.025]  So get your storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:33.025 --> 01:30:34.787]  That helps fund our operation.
[01:30:34.787 --> 01:30:37.610]  It's insurance you can eat a total 360 win.
[01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:40.673]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:41.434 --> 01:30:41.895]  Thank you.
[01:30:56.815 --> 01:31:03.684]  Alex Jones here reporting from the road on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus.
[01:31:03.684 --> 01:31:08.130]  It has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:14.138]  It has now spread across the entire planet and of course we've now discovered that indeed it is man-made
[01:31:14.178 --> 01:31:15.199]  We're good to go.
[01:31:32.031 --> 01:31:33.372]  That's what it comes out of.
[01:31:33.372 --> 01:31:45.062]  We have that at 40% off despite the fact it's selling out in three different sizes at InfoWarsStore.com and that's what I'm using, what my family's using as a frontline defense.
[01:31:45.062 --> 01:31:56.091]  Nothing's perfect except, you know, prayer and God's intervention and we hope this thing isn't as bad as it looks but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because this is certainly a bizarre virus.
[01:31:58.237 --> 01:32:01.498]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:32:01.498 --> 01:32:03.639]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:32:03.639 --> 01:32:06.100]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:19.565]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[01:32:20.205 --> 01:32:20.305]  Yes.
[01:32:36.667 --> 01:32:41.671]  Eight years ago I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:32:41.671 --> 01:32:49.358]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[01:32:49.358 --> 01:32:50.519]  It's amazing.
[01:32:50.519 --> 01:32:54.102]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:32:54.102 --> 01:33:00.387]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[01:33:00.387 --> 01:33:03.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:14.772]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[01:33:14.772 --> 01:33:18.213]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:33:18.213 --> 01:33:20.474]  This is not a new world.
[01:33:20.474 --> 01:33:24.875]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:32.317]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:33:33.297 --> 01:33:41.342]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:33:41.342 --> 01:33:47.085]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:33:47.085 --> 01:33:54.670]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:57.412]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:33:57.412 --> 01:33:58.452]  In his last 48 hours on Earth,
[01:34:00.106 --> 01:34:04.072]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:34:04.072 --> 01:34:06.536]  Because he's built out of flesh.
[01:34:06.536 --> 01:34:08.839]  And because he has a mind.
[01:34:08.839 --> 01:34:13.466]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:34:36.519 --> 01:34:37.681]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[01:34:37.681 --> 01:34:39.703]  I intend to take every one of these calls.
[01:34:39.703 --> 01:34:42.087]  We're going to John Idaho here in a moment.
[01:34:42.087 --> 01:34:44.530]  Owen Troyer is going to ride shotgun with us.
[01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:45.191]  I drug him in here.
[01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:46.633]  I said I'm going to get his take on things.
[01:34:46.633 --> 01:34:48.535]  We're going to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:34:48.535 --> 01:34:49.817]  He's again going to ride shotgun.
[01:34:50.754 --> 01:34:59.957]  Owen, you want to tackle the latest virus developments, or President acquitted in what you predict comes next, and how do we punish the deep state and not take this lying down again?
[01:34:59.957 --> 01:35:03.098]  If I don't see offensive action from the President, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:35:03.098 --> 01:35:04.119]  This is BS.
[01:35:04.119 --> 01:35:09.000]  I don't want to just sit here and keep beating them while they sabotage and hold up the restoration of the Republic.
[01:35:11.442 --> 01:35:13.983]  Kind of do a quick recap of what we've seen this week.
[01:35:13.983 --> 01:35:16.944]  It's been pretty historic, I think, Alex.
[01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.044]  Very significant.
[01:35:18.044 --> 01:35:26.547]  On Monday, the Democrats are now just publicly rigging their own caucuses and just telling the voters, eh, screw what you vote for, screw what you think.
[01:35:26.547 --> 01:35:30.809]  We're just going to do this out in public and we're going to give it to Buttigieg even though Sanders won.
[01:35:31.209 --> 01:35:35.871]  We're going to allow you to watch us do this, and that's just how it's going to go.
[01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:42.354]  And that got exposed, and so I think a lot of people were awake to that, not to mention the fact Democrat turnout way down.
[01:35:42.354 --> 01:35:47.016]  Even Sanders as the leader had less votes in this caucus than he had in 2016.
[01:35:47.016 --> 01:35:53.739]  And by the way, just like in England and other areas, socialist and communist and globalist parties are dead.
[01:35:53.739 --> 01:35:54.520]  Labor's gone.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:36:01.583]  You've got over 10 major parties in England, and you had the Conservatives winning with over 50-something percent.
[01:36:01.583 --> 01:36:03.304]  It's over for Labour.
[01:36:03.304 --> 01:36:06.985]  So the same thing, we can kill this party now.
[01:36:06.985 --> 01:36:07.626]  How do we do that?
[01:36:07.626 --> 01:36:11.547]  Because they are a criminal, anti-American group that says the country shouldn't exist.
[01:36:11.547 --> 01:36:13.408]  Well, that's not a political party.
[01:36:13.408 --> 01:36:15.469]  That's a foreign enemy operation.
[01:36:15.609 --> 01:36:17.210]  Well, it's death from within.
[01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:21.033]  And so Monday's headline was Democrat Party in total panic and disarray.
[01:36:21.033 --> 01:36:32.560]  Then Tuesday, we had what to me will go down, at least so far for me, the greatest State of the Union speech in America's history, at least in modern history, from my experience.
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.181]  Powerful.
[01:36:33.181 --> 01:36:38.264]  Still reverberating, I think, still resonating, still drawing emotion.
[01:36:38.264 --> 01:36:42.527]  And then you had Wednesday, the acquittal of President Trump on both.
[01:36:43.442 --> 01:36:46.164]  The false articles of impeachment.
[01:36:46.164 --> 01:36:48.966]  That was a major victory for Trump politically.
[01:36:48.966 --> 01:36:53.049]  They had it all tied to have him already impeached and gone by the time of the State of the Union.
[01:36:53.049 --> 01:36:56.051]  But everything these devils wanted is now turning against them.
[01:36:56.051 --> 01:37:02.675]  And so now here we are today, I think kind of looking at the last three days, President Trump just did that.
[01:37:02.675 --> 01:37:04.136]  I mean, you could call it a press conference.
[01:37:04.136 --> 01:37:09.560]  He just says it was a celebratory speech for the fact that he was acquitted and again still
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:13.862]  Reverberating the state of the union.
[01:37:13.862 --> 01:37:18.284]  And so I think we're all waiting and I've talked about this with you before Alex.
[01:37:18.284 --> 01:37:19.265]  We're all waiting.
[01:37:19.265 --> 01:37:20.605]  It's like the 4th of July.
[01:37:20.605 --> 01:37:22.266]  The sun just went down.
[01:37:22.266 --> 01:37:25.028]  Got our popcorn and our drinks and we're ready for the fireworks.
[01:37:25.028 --> 01:37:27.089]  Trump isn't George Washington until he takes out the enemy.
[01:37:27.089 --> 01:37:27.849]  He does that.
[01:37:27.849 --> 01:37:29.430]  He'll be the greatest president since George Washington.
[01:37:30.012 --> 01:37:38.255]  And I don't know if Trump is measuring things to say, I'm going to wait and wait on the Democrats to continue to eat themselves alive and expose themselves.
[01:37:38.255 --> 01:37:43.016]  They start indicting a few of them, they're all going to turn on each other like a pack of piranhas.
[01:37:43.016 --> 01:37:45.037]  They're so easy to defeat.
[01:37:45.037 --> 01:37:53.580]  President Obama, well actually President Trump said it today, that if what happened to him happened to President Obama, people would be in jail.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.740]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.861]  That means time for people to go to jail.
[01:37:56.861 --> 01:37:59.342]  Well that was definitely, that's what he was saying as we're going after him.
[01:37:59.562 --> 01:38:06.563]  And you have, right now, with Matt Gaetz and other Republicans, they have filed a motion to actually remove Nancy Pelosi from office.
[01:38:06.563 --> 01:38:07.724]  She violated U.S.
[01:38:07.724 --> 01:38:16.625]  Code, I believe, 18, subsection 270, when she ripped up the State of the Union speech, which is a historic document.
[01:38:16.625 --> 01:38:19.386]  When she ripped that up, she actually violated the U.S.
[01:38:19.386 --> 01:38:21.707]  Code and is subject to fine and removal.
[01:38:21.707 --> 01:38:24.147]  Well, that's because she's literally under CHICOM control.
[01:38:24.147 --> 01:38:27.568]  Her and Dianne Feinstein, on record, have CHICOM operatives inside.
[01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:28.568]  I told people three years ago,
[01:38:29.088 --> 01:38:39.558]  You'll start seeing all these Confucius, Chai Com centers, universities busted because they literally have the data hack that Obama allowed of the Office of Personnel Management of all U.S.
[01:38:39.558 --> 01:38:43.201]  government employees, operatives, former agents.
[01:38:43.201 --> 01:38:45.544]  That was given and they were so dumb.
[01:38:45.544 --> 01:38:47.025]  The Chai Coms were so arrogant.
[01:38:47.025 --> 01:38:47.826]  Anyone that had worked
[01:38:48.266 --> 01:39:01.646]  In the Pentagon, anyone that was a Republican, anyone that had been in the CIA, anyone that could not get a job in academia or scholarships or PhDs, and they would tell them at UT, sorry, and then of course they had their phones tapped.
[01:39:03.903 --> 01:39:09.769]  They were sending these guys in, they had their phones tapped, they were like, they would run the check and they would get back the database, don't hire them.
[01:39:09.769 --> 01:39:13.173]  The Chi-Coms were literally loading up the universities with their people.
[01:39:13.173 --> 01:39:14.955]  I mean, that's how far gone we are.
[01:39:14.955 --> 01:39:24.544]  And so, these people have all committed crime, they're like, we've got to win, we've got to get rid of Trump, we're going to have this big holy time, and the Chi-Coms are going to give us all the power, and we're going to put the conservatives in death camps.
[01:39:25.425 --> 01:39:27.306]  But it didn't go the way they thought!
[01:39:27.306 --> 01:39:30.248]  But you can't leave piranha-like cancers like that operating.
[01:39:30.248 --> 01:39:31.988]  We gotta go to one call, but just go ahead, Owen.
[01:39:31.988 --> 01:39:38.452]  Well, I would just say, in closing, what we're seeing right now is a window of opportunity and the momentum on our side.
[01:39:38.452 --> 01:39:43.034]  It's kind of like, you know, in sports, when you get momentum, you want to step on the opponent's neck.
[01:39:43.034 --> 01:39:45.375]  You want to drive it down their throat.
[01:39:45.375 --> 01:39:46.476]  And you want to have that victory.
[01:39:46.476 --> 01:39:47.376]  You want to seize that moment.
[01:39:47.376 --> 01:39:49.137]  So they have 30, 40 years of kicking our ass.
[01:39:49.137 --> 01:39:50.158]  We have to finish it.
[01:39:50.158 --> 01:39:50.938]  You don't, you know...
[01:39:51.058 --> 01:39:52.099]  And there's just so much momentum.
[01:39:52.099 --> 01:39:54.480]  Super criminals always gloat over when they're winning.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.121]  We don't gloat.
[01:39:55.121 --> 01:39:56.602]  We go in for the attack and we finish it.
[01:39:56.602 --> 01:40:03.346]  I just don't know if there'll be this much momentum behind Trump to finally act for justice and arrest some of these deep staters as there is right now.
[01:40:03.346 --> 01:40:06.288]  I think it's up to us to light a fire under his ass.
[01:40:06.288 --> 01:40:07.069]  Let's talk about that.
[01:40:07.069 --> 01:40:08.590]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:40:08.590 --> 01:40:09.551]  Let's go to John in Idaho.
[01:40:09.551 --> 01:40:10.291]  John, thanks for holding.
[01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:11.472]  What do you think is going on here?
[01:40:12.564 --> 01:40:13.925]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:15.806]  I appreciate it very much.
[01:40:15.806 --> 01:40:17.246]  Love your products, first of all.
[01:40:17.246 --> 01:40:20.047]  We have just about everything you sell, so thank you for all the great stuff.
[01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:20.588]  Thank you, sir.
[01:40:20.588 --> 01:40:23.189]  Says you're a retired operations officer on the coronavirus.
[01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.869]  Quantify that.
[01:40:23.869 --> 01:40:26.870]  California just recently moved to Idaho.
[01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:30.052]  A couple observations, because that's what we were trained to do.
[01:40:30.052 --> 01:40:34.794]  Here in Boise, there is nothing being talked about, but you go to the local Home Depot, there's no N95 masks.
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:47.269]  Back in the Bay Area, they're holding an emergency job fair in the East Bay for liquid O2 drivers and CO2, which is used in the hospitals for respiratory distress.
[01:40:47.947 --> 01:40:52.409]  And they're also opening up Travis Air Force Base for a quarantine area.
[01:40:52.409 --> 01:40:58.653]  So there's some things going on behind the scenes that if people didn't pay attention, you wouldn't really know.
[01:40:58.653 --> 01:41:03.095]  So I think they think this is coming or they know it's coming, but yet they're not telling the public.
[01:41:03.095 --> 01:41:04.716]  What you're saying is totally confirmed.
[01:41:04.716 --> 01:41:04.996]  I don't know.
[01:41:04.996 --> 01:41:06.257]  Did you hear me about a week and a half ago?
[01:41:07.017 --> 01:41:12.926]  I guess last Monday, not this Monday, but last Monday, about 12 days ago, say that we have big news.
[01:41:12.926 --> 01:41:16.411]  They're establishing emergency centers on the West Coast.
[01:41:16.411 --> 01:41:20.317]  They see Seattle as the main epicenter and they know it's already broken quarantine.
[01:41:20.317 --> 01:41:22.701]  They know it's already in the population and they believe it's going to, I mean.
[01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:30.572]  I was told that high level, so was Mike Adams' separate sources, and we just decided to not be absolutely specific just because we didn't want to be people scaring folks.
[01:41:30.572 --> 01:41:31.713]  But yes, that's what's going on.
[01:41:31.713 --> 01:41:36.119]  And you're just saying at ground level, the best intelligence is ground level observation.
[01:41:36.119 --> 01:41:38.403]  You're saying you're seeing action that shows they're gearing up.
[01:41:38.923 --> 01:41:39.864]  They are.
[01:41:39.864 --> 01:41:50.769]  To hold the specific job fair for the Liquid O2 and CO2, just literally right on KFBK Radio and KCBS, they need these drivers right away.
[01:41:50.769 --> 01:41:57.973]  Which, if you just needed drivers, you can get drivers, but for those two specific things they're asking for, that's due to respiratory distress.
[01:41:58.993 --> 01:42:04.677]  And then through my buddies at Cal OES, they're saying that Travis is getting ready, like I said, for a big quarantine area.
[01:42:04.677 --> 01:42:10.540]  So it's just things that we're seeing and the people that I know behind the scenes that they're getting ready for.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:13.442]  But yet again, they're not telling the public anything.
[01:42:13.442 --> 01:42:18.725]  And it's thanks to folks like you and Mike Adams who go, hey, you know, you guys need to get ready for this.
[01:42:18.725 --> 01:42:19.606]  It's coming.
[01:42:19.606 --> 01:42:21.567]  It's very hard to get through to people.
[01:42:21.567 --> 01:42:26.290]  You try to tell them this, they look at you like you're an idiot sometimes, but you just do the best you can do.
[01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:29.643]  John, I don't want you to hang up, because you only got like a minute and a half.
[01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:40.573]  I want you to quantify what you were saying, because I understand it, but barely, about they're trying to get the systems to deliver things for people that aren't able to breathe, and how that's being prepared so folks can look at that for themselves.
[01:42:40.573 --> 01:42:45.817]  Because they're doing a public call, but they're not pointing out why they need it, but it does show that's what they're gearing up for.
[01:42:45.817 --> 01:42:50.822]  I was told by people at Homeland Security that they know it's going to get bad.
[01:42:50.822 --> 01:42:52.804]  They don't want to say how bad.
[01:42:52.804 --> 01:42:54.005]  Well, I'll tell you when we come back.
[01:42:56.121 --> 01:43:02.624]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[01:43:02.624 --> 01:43:09.368]  Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.

[01:43:59.609 --> 01:44:01.390]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:12.656]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:44:13.436 --> 01:44:22.599]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:44:22.599 --> 01:44:33.142]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:44:33.662 --> 01:44:36.284]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:44:36.284 --> 01:44:38.005]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:48.010]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:50.651]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:55.354]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:44:57.734 --> 01:45:08.428]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland Security to take out SARS, which is the same family as the corona virus.
[01:45:08.428 --> 01:45:11.593]  We have it in our super silver toothpaste.
[01:45:11.593 --> 01:45:12.554]  We have it in our
[01:45:12.654 --> 01:45:13.534]  Super blue toothpaste.
[01:45:13.534 --> 01:45:20.476]  We have it in the Immune Gargle products, and of course it's in the Super Silver Wound Gel that is sold nationally.
[01:45:20.476 --> 01:45:26.358]  We just private label it from the people that produce it, the nanotech company out of Colorado.
[01:45:26.358 --> 01:45:32.240]  And we have a stockpile of it, but we've already sold half of the stockpile of it.
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:44.811]  And I'm still offering the products at 40 to 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com until they sell out, which most of these products are set to sell out within days or then about another week.
[01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:50.977]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com to get your Immune Gargle, to get the toothpaste, and to get the Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:56.322]  But the Immune Gargle is what is so important because you gargle with it and can also drink at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:57.483 --> 01:45:58.103]  The year 2020.
[01:45:58.103 --> 01:46:00.404]  World governments out in the open.
[01:46:00.404 --> 01:46:04.825]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:18.689]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[01:46:18.689 --> 01:46:18.889]  Wow.
[01:46:19.449 --> 01:46:20.951]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[01:46:20.951 --> 01:46:22.272]  The New World Order's real.
[01:46:22.272 --> 01:46:23.313]  Satanism's real.
[01:46:23.313 --> 01:46:24.674]  The pedophile elite are real.
[01:46:24.674 --> 01:46:28.518]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[01:46:28.518 --> 01:46:33.243]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[01:46:33.243 --> 01:46:36.806]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[01:46:36.806 --> 01:46:41.151]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[01:46:41.411 --> 01:46:43.833]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[01:46:43.833 --> 01:46:45.154]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:46:45.154 --> 01:46:48.116]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[01:46:48.116 --> 01:46:55.261]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of importrestore.com is critical.
[01:46:55.261 --> 01:46:59.904]  So please take action.
[01:46:59.904 --> 01:47:02.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:08.061 --> 01:47:13.024]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:13.024 --> 01:47:15.145]  Watch me!
[01:47:15.145 --> 01:47:17.147]  Watch me!
[01:47:17.147 --> 01:47:18.347]  I got it!
[01:47:18.347 --> 01:47:20.949]  Watch me!
[01:47:20.949 --> 01:47:22.290]  I got it!
[01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:23.851]  Hey!
[01:47:23.851 --> 01:47:26.212]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[01:47:26.212 --> 01:47:27.393]  I sure do!
[01:47:27.393 --> 01:47:30.355]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[01:47:30.355 --> 01:47:30.715]  I got soul!
[01:47:30.715 --> 01:47:32.236]  And I'm super bad!
[01:47:32.236 --> 01:47:32.376]  Yeah!
[01:47:46.015 --> 01:47:46.816]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:46.816 --> 01:47:47.596]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:47.596 --> 01:47:48.357]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:48.357 --> 01:47:49.178]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:49.178 --> 01:47:50.058]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:50.058 --> 01:47:50.859]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:50.859 --> 01:47:52.040]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.061]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:53.061 --> 01:47:53.902]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:53.902 --> 01:47:54.742]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:54.742 --> 01:47:55.563]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:55.563 --> 01:47:56.404]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:56.404 --> 01:47:57.165]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:57.165 --> 01:47:57.945]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:57.945 --> 01:47:58.746]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:58.746 --> 01:47:59.707]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:00.547]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:48:00.547 --> 01:48:01.408]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:02.369]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:48:02.369 --> 01:48:03.150]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[01:48:03.150 --> 01:48:03.490]  I got a move
[01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:09.093]  The fact that we put up with this so long is really a crime.
[01:48:09.093 --> 01:48:10.353]  These people are hurting a lot of folks.
[01:48:10.353 --> 01:48:12.194]  The blue cities they have are collapsing.
[01:48:12.194 --> 01:48:14.815]  Homeless camps are polluting local water supplies all over the U.S.
[01:48:14.815 --> 01:48:17.236]  Diseases that are only in the worst third world countries are now here.
[01:48:17.236 --> 01:48:18.997]  They're trying to collapse society.
[01:48:18.997 --> 01:48:20.398]  They admit in their own documents.
[01:48:20.398 --> 01:48:26.440]  George Soros funded Extinction Rebellion says, we want to destroy civilization and take down humanity.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.461]  Humanity is a cancer.
[01:48:28.461 --> 01:48:30.882]  They just want to have an excuse to rule over everybody, folks.
[01:48:30.882 --> 01:48:32.743]  They have a totally separate population.
[01:48:32.743 --> 01:48:34.284]  It's Malthusianism.
[01:48:35.168 --> 01:48:38.229]  That was 300 years ago.
[01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:44.470]  Malthus was a British scientist and he wanted to cram the poor together to exterminate them, not let them have sewage treatment.
[01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:45.591]  He had all these plans.
[01:48:45.591 --> 01:48:47.691]  It's called Malthusianism.
[01:48:47.691 --> 01:48:49.312]  Search engine that definition.
[01:48:49.312 --> 01:48:50.252]  Malthusianism.
[01:48:50.252 --> 01:48:51.352]  Let's pull that up.
[01:48:51.352 --> 01:48:54.993]  We're fighting Malthusianism.
[01:48:54.993 --> 01:48:57.314]  Owen Schroeder, let's go back to John in Idaho.
[01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:00.954]  Big prep for incoming outbreak.
[01:49:00.954 --> 01:49:07.910]  Repeat what you were saying that they have, you're watching this around the country, not just in Idaho, but the group's prepping for what again?
[01:49:09.122 --> 01:49:21.964]  Well, basically, I still have connections back in the Bay Area and California, and so they're doing an emergency job fair for commercial truck drivers for liquid O2 and CO2.
[01:49:21.964 --> 01:49:25.465]  Normally, you wouldn't think anything of that, but you're like, why so specific?
[01:49:25.465 --> 01:49:32.886]  But because of what's going on with the coronavirus, you know, they know what's coming, and so this is what they're getting ready for.
[01:49:32.886 --> 01:49:36.367]  They've got to be able to dispatch those to other points around the U.S.
[01:49:36.367 --> 01:49:37.047]  and bring them back quickly.
[01:49:37.443 --> 01:49:46.749]  So we will basically, so what happens is, is you go to all the private contractors, you know, that are on the list for certain items, generators, you know, O2, things of that nature.
[01:49:46.749 --> 01:49:48.490]  You tell them, hey, we're getting ready to gear up.
[01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:54.274]  Well, these guys obviously don't have the drivers that they need for what's being asked for.
[01:49:54.274 --> 01:49:58.437]  They're also activating Travis Air Force Base as a quarantine area.
[01:49:59.017 --> 01:50:04.520]  So it's just things that you observe throughout your career like, hey, this is not the norm.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:08.762]  But then again, folks aren't being told to get ready for this.
[01:50:08.762 --> 01:50:16.565]  And anyone you tell, most folks, they have this normalcy bias where they just think it's never happened, it's not going to happen here, we're fine.
[01:50:16.565 --> 01:50:20.687]  I don't think they realize how fragile the EMS system is.
[01:50:20.687 --> 01:50:22.048]  A couple things, great.
[01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:27.170]  A whole bunch of things, it's completely overwhelmed and it starts to break down and people need to be able to take care of themselves.
[01:50:28.367 --> 01:50:30.154]  Well that's right, and let's quantify that.
[01:50:31.943 --> 01:50:38.246]  This isn't normal, because they're not hyping it, but the real ground-level action is for a crisis.
[01:50:38.246 --> 01:50:39.146]  Same thing in China.
[01:50:39.146 --> 01:50:41.467]  Not hyping it, but acting like it's the end of the world.
[01:50:41.467 --> 01:50:49.511]  Clearly, thousands of videos coming out showing all sorts of mayhem, shooting people at checkpoints, people being locked in homes, piles of dead bodies in body bags.
[01:50:49.511 --> 01:50:51.632]  Clearly, this is much bigger.
[01:50:51.632 --> 01:50:56.655]  As an individual that works in emergency management, as you were saying, what do you gut-level think this is?
[01:50:56.655 --> 01:51:01.497]  The evidence shows it's an engineered bioweapon, and that it leaked out somehow.
[01:51:02.607 --> 01:51:10.195]  Uh, what I think it is or what I hope it is, I hope it's something that burns out over there and doesn't really get, you know, its claws in over here.
[01:51:10.195 --> 01:51:15.601]  For folks that don't know, things usually mutate out into a more harmless form.
[01:51:15.601 --> 01:51:16.942]  Sometimes.
[01:51:16.942 --> 01:51:24.891]  Or they're bringing people in continually and, you know, 14 days from now we're going to see things just explode and they're going to try to keep things under wraps.
[01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:28.711]  And then they won't be able to because the systems will be overwhelmed.
[01:51:28.711 --> 01:51:35.634]  And that's the fear is that the actions will have been put in place too late and we'll get overwhelmed.
[01:51:35.634 --> 01:51:37.394]  Exactly, and that will hurt the economy.
[01:51:37.394 --> 01:51:38.795]  Alright, you're really smart.
[01:51:38.795 --> 01:51:39.695]  That's a smart caller.
[01:51:39.695 --> 01:51:41.076]  I love these callers.
[01:51:41.076 --> 01:51:43.137]  Owen, I'm going to pull the articles back up.
[01:51:43.137 --> 01:51:45.157]  I covered it like on the Sunday show that had bad audio.
[01:51:45.157 --> 01:51:46.998]  So if I apologize, it's my fault.
[01:51:46.998 --> 01:51:48.139]  But the first hour of it.
[01:51:48.139 --> 01:51:54.381]  But I had like where the head of the UN response to the WHO, World Health Organization, was saying
[01:51:55.905 --> 01:51:59.991]  Oh, China's doing a great job locking these cities down and doing all this.
[01:51:59.991 --> 01:52:01.212]  We really commend it.
[01:52:01.212 --> 01:52:03.415]  Total quarantines, everything.
[01:52:03.415 --> 01:52:04.437]  Locked people up in their houses.
[01:52:04.437 --> 01:52:05.138]  But then the U.S.
[01:52:05.138 --> 01:52:06.900]  said, well, we're going to block flights now.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.542]  One of the last big countries to do it.
[01:52:08.542 --> 01:52:10.144]  China said, that's xenophobic and bad.
[01:52:11.286 --> 01:52:13.869]  And so did the U.N.
[01:52:13.869 --> 01:52:14.950]  Very same people.
[01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:16.211]  That's crazy.
[01:52:16.211 --> 01:52:20.196]  Shoot people in the head, that's fine, in your country, but let them into the U.S.
[01:52:20.196 --> 01:52:21.818]  What the hell?
[01:52:21.818 --> 01:52:22.298]  And the U.N.
[01:52:22.298 --> 01:52:27.965]  didn't criticize Russia or Japan or South Korea or the Philippines or anybody else.
[01:52:27.965 --> 01:52:31.068]  Anything self-preservation is just, you know, considered.
[01:52:31.989 --> 01:52:33.790]  Somehow xenophobic these days.
[01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:35.810]  That's just pretty standard.
[01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:41.812]  I think that it's amazing the human rights violations happening in China right now that will go ignored.
[01:52:41.812 --> 01:52:48.534]  Obviously, long before the coronavirus outbreak, but people are, you know, this isn't just a quarantine situation.
[01:52:48.534 --> 01:52:50.855]  This is essentially a full-on lockdown.
[01:52:50.855 --> 01:52:53.096]  They're boarding people's doors up.
[01:52:53.096 --> 01:52:57.037]  They're boarding entire apartment complexes up.
[01:52:57.037 --> 01:53:00.678]  If you go into one of these roadblocks they have set up and you approach
[01:53:01.218 --> 01:53:06.961]  The troops or the government that is stationed there, you get shot many times to death.
[01:53:06.961 --> 01:53:08.902]  But, we've got to let them all fly here.
[01:53:08.902 --> 01:53:10.363]  This is insane.
[01:53:10.363 --> 01:53:11.223]  Let's go to calls here.
[01:53:11.223 --> 01:53:13.524]  I want to go to Johnny in Connecticut.
[01:53:13.524 --> 01:53:17.347]  Then I'm going to go to... What's up next?
[01:53:17.347 --> 01:53:19.668]  Steven Main has some points he wants to make.
[01:53:19.668 --> 01:53:21.309]  Johnny in Connecticut, thanks for holding on the air.
[01:53:21.309 --> 01:53:23.410]  We're going to go to Alex Jones.
[01:53:23.410 --> 01:53:25.491]  Hey Alex and Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[01:53:25.491 --> 01:53:29.233]  Just really quickly, I just wanted to thank you for the amazing products.
[01:53:30.051 --> 01:53:33.794]  Silver Bullet, Alpha Power, and specifically Lung Cleanse Plus.
[01:53:33.794 --> 01:53:37.717]  Very appropriate for, I think, what we're talking about with the coronavirus.
[01:53:37.717 --> 01:53:49.147]  I work in a dirty, filthy, disgusting warehouse during the day before I go to school at night, and the Lung Cleanse, a couple sprays and inhale, helps get all that black garbage out of my body.
[01:53:49.147 --> 01:53:50.648]  Just a terrific product.
[01:53:50.648 --> 01:53:53.070]  People should really try that.
[01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:55.512]  I do it all the time, and I forget, why aren't I doing this more?
[01:53:55.512 --> 01:53:57.974]  It makes my voice, you hear my voice just get a lot smoother?
[01:54:00.037 --> 01:54:00.998]  Lung Cleanse is amazing.
[01:54:00.998 --> 01:54:02.519]  Sorry, keep going.
[01:54:02.519 --> 01:54:03.940]  No, it's a terrific product.
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:06.042]  People really need to try that.
[01:54:06.042 --> 01:54:19.431]  You know, I was going to call and talk about the President's victory here, but, you know, the amazing callers that you've had today, you know, very quickly, Trump, big victory with his speech the other night.
[01:54:19.431 --> 01:54:25.416]  Today, I think it sort of cheapens it when he comes out, like you said, on the defense.
[01:54:25.416 --> 01:54:26.897]  This is a time for offense.
[01:54:26.897 --> 01:54:28.358]  We've been saying this for a long time.
[01:54:30.851 --> 01:54:44.862]  It's almost, with the acquittal yesterday after his State of the Union, he just looked a little weak today, especially when he blathers on such a long speech like he did today.
[01:54:44.862 --> 01:54:50.346]  He's saying all good things and he's thanking the right people, but he ran on putting these people in prison.
[01:54:50.951 --> 01:54:51.892]  And he hasn't done that.
[01:54:51.892 --> 01:54:56.854]  So, part of me is saying, well, maybe he's waiting until closer to November to pull out the big... Well, let me say this.
[01:54:56.854 --> 01:54:58.495]  People ask why Matt Drudge is pissed.
[01:54:58.495 --> 01:54:59.435]  I know why.
[01:54:59.435 --> 01:55:00.696]  And not because I've talked to Drudge.
[01:55:00.696 --> 01:55:01.936]  I see what he posts.
[01:55:01.936 --> 01:55:04.298]  I say, why is Trump committing political suicide?
[01:55:04.298 --> 01:55:05.318]  He posts the video.
[01:55:05.318 --> 01:55:06.399]  Why is Trump for red flags?
[01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:07.159]  I'm going to turn against him.
[01:55:07.159 --> 01:55:07.999]  He puts it up.
[01:55:07.999 --> 01:55:11.921]  Why is Trump not doing anything to save Assange, who he told released it?
[01:55:11.921 --> 01:55:17.604]  And Drudge is pissed because he cares about journalists, and he's saying to Trump, what are you doing?
[01:55:17.604 --> 01:55:18.645]  And I'm not against Trump.
[01:55:21.058 --> 01:55:21.839]  I'm kind of pig-headed.
[01:55:21.839 --> 01:55:25.000]  I've been persecuted so much for supporting Trump, I'm behind Trump.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.484]  But I can't look at Drudge, who I know has been persecuted for supporting him, and get pissed at him, because Trump is dropping the ball.
[01:55:30.484 --> 01:55:32.325]  We better see offensive action.
[01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:48.715]  Well, and I would just say, you know, the average, or I shouldn't say the average, the most informed, the citizen elite Trump supporter sees that the most ardent Trump supporters, Alex Jones, totally censored off the internet, Roger Stone, facing life in jail, Owen Shroyer is going to prison.
[01:55:48.715 --> 01:55:50.116]  They're now banning James O'Keefe off Twitter.
[01:55:50.216 --> 01:55:58.025]  Yeah, okay, so I think the frustration here is like, look, we are the organic citizen power structure.
[01:55:58.025 --> 01:56:03.712]  And it's okay if we get destroyed in a war, but you better care about us and at least put up some air defense.
[01:56:03.712 --> 01:56:07.036]  You know, we just don't hang our ass out there while we get chewed up.
[01:56:07.717 --> 01:56:11.361]  Or, you know, the quote we have is, I'm monitoring the situation.
[01:56:11.361 --> 01:56:16.207]  Well, I can sit here and monitor somebody getting beaten to death in the street.
[01:56:16.207 --> 01:56:19.390]  If I don't step, if I don't step in and stop it, they're going to get beaten to death.
[01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:20.191]  Oh, I monitored that!
[01:56:20.191 --> 01:56:21.532]  And so I think that's how it's going.
[01:56:21.532 --> 01:56:26.097]  It's not that we're not willing, and I'm not telling this story to get the President in any issues, whatever, but...
[01:56:26.798 --> 01:56:28.919]  I mean, I'm not gonna even get to it.
[01:56:28.919 --> 01:56:32.240]  But one time the president said, they're going, man, you're a real man, Alex, all the hell you've gone through.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:32.980]  I really appreciate you.
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:34.081]  I got him on speakerphone.
[01:56:34.081 --> 01:56:35.361]  My wife's sitting there listening to this.
[01:56:35.361 --> 01:56:36.061]  She heard it.
[01:56:36.061 --> 01:56:36.842]  You're a real man.
[01:56:36.842 --> 01:56:37.582]  You're really awesome.
[01:56:37.582 --> 01:56:38.462]  We really appreciate you up here.
[01:56:38.462 --> 01:56:39.402]  You know, we love your points.
[01:56:39.402 --> 01:56:41.143]  We research your information, all this stuff.
[01:56:41.143 --> 01:56:41.803]  Never told the story.
[01:56:41.803 --> 01:56:44.064]  I said, sir, I don't need you to tell me I'm a real man.
[01:56:44.324 --> 01:56:46.245]  They're going to try to kill you and kill me.
[01:56:46.245 --> 01:56:47.506]  You need to go to war with them now.
[01:56:47.506 --> 01:56:48.267]  They're criminals.
[01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:49.067]  You need to find people.
[01:56:49.067 --> 01:56:50.949]  You need to get rid of the neocons.
[01:56:50.949 --> 01:56:52.710]  Get rid of anybody that worked for Soros.
[01:56:52.710 --> 01:56:57.993]  You need to bring in people, preferably from the military, that have good records and aren't cowards, and aren't afraid.
[01:56:57.993 --> 01:56:59.574]  You've got a bunch of lawyers that are your enemies.
[01:56:59.574 --> 01:57:00.455]  You need to do it now.
[01:57:00.455 --> 01:57:03.537]  He's like, uh, well, hold on one moment, because I just told Trump.
[01:57:03.537 --> 01:57:06.859]  He quit calling me, because I'm like, hey, I don't want to be told I'm a real man, bro.
[01:57:06.859 --> 01:57:08.160]  I'm not trying to be mean here.
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.561]  I want war on these people.
[01:57:09.561 --> 01:57:13.884]  Look, Alex, the same people, and this isn't to point a finger at Fox News or whatever,
[01:57:14.184 --> 01:57:17.767]  But Fox News was anti-Trump until he got the nomination.
[01:57:17.767 --> 01:57:21.450]  Fox News will probably end up being anti-Trump before the next re-election cycle.
[01:57:21.450 --> 01:57:23.072]  We're already seeing some signs of that.
[01:57:23.072 --> 01:57:26.455]  It's time for Trump, with his power of presence... To engage in real leadership.
[01:57:26.455 --> 01:57:31.259]  And to just go on to some of these alternative platforms that are getting banned, getting the censorship, give them some love.
[01:57:31.259 --> 01:57:32.881]  Oh my God, that's a great plan.
[01:57:32.881 --> 01:57:34.182]  He did a whole ban tour.
[01:57:34.582 --> 01:57:34.702]  Yeah.
[01:57:34.702 --> 01:57:35.983]  And it's not about us.
[01:57:35.983 --> 01:57:39.245]  A whole band toured to boost all that and show how they censored that.
[01:57:39.245 --> 01:57:40.626]  And look, look, look.
[01:57:40.626 --> 01:57:41.667]  It's a love-hate relationship.
[01:57:41.667 --> 01:57:42.728]  I love Trump overall.
[01:57:42.728 --> 01:57:44.789]  I just am telling you he needs to be more aggressive.
[01:57:46.977 --> 01:57:52.201]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[01:57:52.201 --> 01:57:56.484]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[01:57:56.484 --> 01:58:00.927]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[01:58:00.927 --> 01:58:09.333]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[01:58:16.978 --> 01:58:20.580]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.

[01:58:25.903 --> 01:58:33.968]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.

[01:58:51.104 --> 01:58:53.126]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:53.126 --> 01:59:02.397]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of InfoWarsTore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[01:59:03.038 --> 01:59:04.799]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[01:59:04.799 --> 01:59:08.502]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[01:59:08.502 --> 01:59:13.365]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[01:59:13.365 --> 01:59:16.267]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[01:59:16.267 --> 01:59:17.188]  It's incredible.
[01:59:17.188 --> 01:59:18.849]  So do yourself a favor.
[01:59:18.849 --> 01:59:21.351]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[01:59:21.351 --> 01:59:24.233]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[01:59:24.233 --> 01:59:31.198]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[01:59:31.758 --> 01:59:33.059]  But you need these products.
[01:59:33.059 --> 01:59:36.120]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.042]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[01:59:40.042 --> 01:59:43.863]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[01:59:43.863 --> 01:59:49.906]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[01:59:49.906 --> 01:59:52.527]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:02.206]  Trump knows the average person.
[02:00:02.206 --> 02:00:04.567]  Trump knows.
[02:00:04.567 --> 02:00:07.909]  Trump knows the average person just wants recognition.
[02:00:07.909 --> 02:00:08.589]  And that's great.
[02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:11.410]  People will get their arms and legs blown off for medals.
[02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:14.131]  Or at least that's what Trump thinks, but that's not why they really did it.
[02:00:14.131 --> 02:00:17.192]  That's why for most people it's embarrassing to get those medals.
[02:00:17.192 --> 02:00:23.755]  I want victory over these people because I know they're evil, they're trying to dominate my soul and my will, and I'm fighting against that.
[02:00:23.755 --> 02:00:27.937]  If I didn't tell that Trump story earlier to like, act cool, or talk about conversations with the President,
[02:00:28.877 --> 02:00:30.197]  All I've said is this is a war.
[02:00:30.197 --> 02:00:31.017]  Take the gloves off.
[02:00:31.017 --> 02:00:31.998]  Don't believe your lawyers.
[02:00:31.998 --> 02:00:33.718]  Don't believe the candy asses.
[02:00:33.718 --> 02:00:35.118]  Get rid of these people around you.
[02:00:35.118 --> 02:00:36.979]  Anybody that's worked for Soros, get rid of them.
[02:00:36.979 --> 02:00:39.599]  That's why they're all over the news at that time going, get rid of Jones!
[02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.419]  Take him off air!
[02:00:40.419 --> 02:00:40.779]  Sue him!
[02:00:40.779 --> 02:00:41.540]  Destroy him!
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.280]  Don't let the President see any Alex Jones!
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.040]  Don't let him talk to Alex Jones!
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.301]  Because I'm like, you cannot trust the people you brought in.
[02:00:49.301 --> 02:00:51.622]  And I had conversations with other folks who were talking to the President at the time.
[02:00:51.622 --> 02:00:55.762]  They're like, well, don't talk bad about John Bolton.
[02:00:55.762 --> 02:00:58.343]  You know, I've had a lot of drinks with him and played poker with him.
[02:00:59.130 --> 02:01:01.172]  And I said, listen, he's against everybody.
[02:01:01.172 --> 02:01:01.932]  Stop thinking that.
[02:01:01.932 --> 02:01:03.394]  And later it's been proven right.
[02:01:03.394 --> 02:01:08.338]  So, yes, that's all I've told the president to do is remove all these enemies around him.
[02:01:08.338 --> 02:01:10.319]  And I've never asked for something I want.
[02:01:10.319 --> 02:01:11.820]  I've asked for action.
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:14.663]  And I think now that's where we're going with this, Owen.
[02:01:14.663 --> 02:01:16.084]  Owen Troyer riding shotgun with us.
[02:01:16.084 --> 02:01:17.825]  We're taking calls right now.
[02:01:17.825 --> 02:01:22.329]  Let's go ahead and go to Stephen in Maine.
[02:01:22.329 --> 02:01:22.850]  You're on the air.
[02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:27.093]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:27.093 --> 02:01:27.774]  Hello?
[02:01:27.774 --> 02:01:28.054]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:29.093 --> 02:01:31.294]  Hello Alex, how's it going?
[02:01:31.294 --> 02:01:32.015]  Long time listener.
[02:01:32.015 --> 02:01:39.979]  I just wanted to say, basically, thanks for your philanthropy and putting your neck on the line out there every single day.
[02:01:39.979 --> 02:01:41.079]  It's not philanthropy.
[02:01:41.079 --> 02:01:42.620]  We're all in the damn ship together.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:43.481]  This is survival.
[02:01:43.481 --> 02:01:47.563]  And I appreciate you saying that, brother, but everybody thinks of fighting tyranny as philanthropy.
[02:01:47.563 --> 02:01:52.766]  It's called America and freedom and real power is not putting up with crap.
[02:01:52.766 --> 02:01:56.127]  We have not done our jobs while we've gotten so behind the eight ball.
[02:01:56.127 --> 02:01:56.768]  Does that make sense?
[02:01:57.443 --> 02:01:58.764]  Oh, that makes complete sense.
[02:01:58.764 --> 02:02:08.168]  I mean, I'm from Boston, so I really know what it's like to live under basically an oppressive regime, but I was blessed by the grace of God.
[02:02:08.168 --> 02:02:15.631]  Now I actually moved up to Maine and I get to live off-grid in a log cabin really deep out here in the woods off a hundred acres.
[02:02:15.631 --> 02:02:15.831]  Wow!
[02:02:15.831 --> 02:02:17.612]  I envy you!
[02:02:17.612 --> 02:02:24.535]  But I mean, all I wanted to say was that people, if they can get more in touch with, you know, their
[02:02:26.656 --> 02:02:28.678]  Yeah, they're blissfully ignorant.
[02:02:28.678 --> 02:02:29.158]  Exactly.
[02:02:56.121 --> 02:02:59.182]  We sleep while our beds are burning.
[02:02:59.182 --> 02:02:59.603]  Exactly.
[02:02:59.603 --> 02:03:02.504]  And also, I'm actually a graphic designer.
[02:03:02.504 --> 02:03:03.604]  I'm living off-grid.
[02:03:03.604 --> 02:03:07.006]  I have a degree, and I'd love to help out the operation in some way.
[02:03:07.006 --> 02:03:10.367]  Give us your name and number, and I'll hand you over to Kit Daniels, who's a go-getter around here.
[02:03:10.367 --> 02:03:13.869]  And if you'd like to help us with some stuff, that's great, and we might be able to pay you down the road.
[02:03:13.869 --> 02:03:15.889]  We're maxed out right now, but God bless you.
[02:03:15.889 --> 02:03:17.510]  That's all the volunteerism we need.
[02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:18.531]  We need your help, folks.
[02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:19.971]  We're in this together.
[02:03:19.971 --> 02:03:21.352]  Owen, you want to comment on what he was just saying?
[02:03:22.947 --> 02:03:26.050]  Well, we know there's an attack on masculinity.
[02:03:26.050 --> 02:03:33.135]  We know that's why Hollywood and the entertainment industry is promoting men wearing dresses and thongs and all this garbage.
[02:03:33.135 --> 02:03:36.598]  And you kind of just sit here and you open your eyes and you're just like, well, what is this?
[02:03:36.598 --> 02:03:37.599]  Nobody likes this.
[02:03:37.599 --> 02:03:38.660]  Well, of course nobody likes it.
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:40.501]  It's not about giving you what you want.
[02:03:40.501 --> 02:03:40.821]  It's about
[02:03:41.522 --> 02:03:44.785]  Yeah, and graining that into children's minds, too.
[02:03:44.785 --> 02:03:46.667]  So children think that, and they think, oh, that's normal.
[02:03:46.667 --> 02:03:49.249]  So, you know, children aren't growing up seeing the Clint Eastwoods.
[02:03:49.249 --> 02:03:50.971]  They're not growing up seeing the Elvis Presleys.
[02:03:50.971 --> 02:03:53.213]  They're not growing up seeing the John Waynes.
[02:03:53.213 --> 02:03:57.637]  They're growing up seeing Nas in a female cowboy outfit.
[02:03:57.637 --> 02:04:02.302]  They're growing up seeing Gucci shows where malnourished twigs
[02:04:02.842 --> 02:04:04.704]  Get back in touch with your masculinity.
[02:04:17.455 --> 02:04:29.301]  And it's so obvious, and the white papers admit it's a scientific attack, because the Carnegie Foundation was tasked by the president back in the 30s after World War I, back in the 20s, to create a system of no more war.
[02:04:29.301 --> 02:04:32.323]  And they said, end human systems as we know it, there'll be no more war.
[02:04:33.550 --> 02:04:37.391]  You can't get rich and famous on that level unless you agree to put on the dress.
[02:04:37.391 --> 02:04:38.732]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:04:38.732 --> 02:04:39.732]  You gotta get on your knees.
[02:04:39.732 --> 02:04:41.073]  It's kind of like the gay mafia.
[02:04:41.073 --> 02:04:43.094]  People think it's cool to be rich and powerful.
[02:04:43.094 --> 02:04:44.694]  It's not.
[02:04:44.694 --> 02:04:47.995]  Instead of just not caring, it's so uncool.
[02:04:47.995 --> 02:04:49.596]  It's not real.
[02:04:49.596 --> 02:04:50.896]  Bonafides.
[02:04:50.896 --> 02:04:51.637]  Being real.
[02:04:51.637 --> 02:04:52.217]  That's what it's about.
[02:04:54.966 --> 02:04:59.728]  There's a new way to show your support for the InfoWars crew at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:24.461]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[02:05:24.821 --> 02:05:28.664]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[02:05:28.664 --> 02:05:33.507]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[02:05:33.507 --> 02:05:42.413]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, Methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[02:05:42.413 --> 02:05:49.618]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[02:05:49.618 --> 02:05:54.141]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[02:05:56.142 --> 02:06:01.187]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:06:04.352 --> 02:06:08.934]  I was talking to Owen during that one-minute break, Alex Jones here back live, and I said, did I even plug last hour?
[02:06:08.934 --> 02:06:09.634]  And he said, no.
[02:06:09.634 --> 02:06:13.735]  So before I go back to your calls, we have a special guest popping in.
[02:06:13.735 --> 02:06:26.679]  We cover the out-of-control coronavirus, Trump's State of the Union that was five-star, this long thing today that I just didn't see as him on the offensive, but we're taking your calls on that subject and others.
[02:06:26.679 --> 02:06:27.680]  But just briefly here,
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:31.363]  I want to show TV viewers something, and radio listeners, I'll tell you about it.
[02:06:31.363 --> 02:06:33.405]  This is Super Silver Wound Gel.
[02:06:33.405 --> 02:06:44.017]  This is private-labeled by a very respected top nanotech company that is the only company that has had the Pentagon come out and, on a restricted basis,
[02:06:46.021 --> 02:06:50.824]  Classify what they're doing and actually use it for the military, special operations, and the troops.
[02:06:50.824 --> 02:06:51.804]  So we private label this.
[02:06:51.804 --> 02:06:52.965]  This is in stores.
[02:06:52.965 --> 02:06:54.125]  This is our private label.
[02:06:54.125 --> 02:06:56.547]  This is the strongest silver you can get.
[02:06:56.547 --> 02:06:57.527]  Nanotech over the counter.
[02:06:59.198 --> 02:07:03.502]  We have it at a lower level because this stuff at high levels can be toxic.
[02:07:03.502 --> 02:07:10.308]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste with Above Sea Coral Calcium for re-mineralization of the teeth.
[02:07:10.308 --> 02:07:15.392]  And then it's got, obviously, the Nano Silver in it and so much more.
[02:07:15.392 --> 02:07:17.454]  That is still available, though it's selling out.
[02:07:20.623 --> 02:07:24.644]  All of these products have this patented company's Nano Silver.
[02:07:24.644 --> 02:07:26.045]  Super Silver Immune Gargle.
[02:07:26.045 --> 02:07:31.346]  This will sell out the 16 ounces probably today or tomorrow.
[02:07:31.346 --> 02:07:33.527]  This will sell out by early next week.
[02:07:33.527 --> 02:07:36.227]  Super Silver Immune Gargle with a little spray bottle.
[02:07:36.227 --> 02:07:37.788]  You can spray it on your hands, also spray it in your mouth.
[02:07:37.788 --> 02:07:39.168]  You can ingest this.
[02:07:39.168 --> 02:07:39.949]  You can swallow this.
[02:07:39.949 --> 02:07:42.849]  And then of course the 3-ounce bottle.
[02:07:42.849 --> 02:07:44.930]  This will take a week or two at current sales rates.
[02:07:47.588 --> 02:07:47.828]  The show.
[02:08:05.885 --> 02:08:08.926]  And it's 15 parts per million, but don't let that deceive you.
[02:08:08.926 --> 02:08:13.788]  You could have something that claims way more, but it's not nano silver, it's not patented.
[02:08:13.788 --> 02:08:16.009]  And then look, I don't make claims without showing you.
[02:08:16.009 --> 02:08:21.232]  I was only authorized to do this about a week and a half ago.
[02:08:21.232 --> 02:08:23.693]  And I'll show TV viewers an over cam of this.
[02:08:23.693 --> 02:08:27.034]  The Texas A&M University Health System Center.
[02:08:27.034 --> 02:08:31.056]  This is, again, confidential.
[02:08:31.056 --> 02:08:31.716]  And it's the U.S.
[02:08:31.716 --> 02:08:32.837]  Department of Homeland Security.
[02:08:34.929 --> 02:08:37.651]  Tom Ridge.
[02:08:37.651 --> 02:08:40.613]  And it goes over the fact that they're looking at this U.S.
[02:08:40.613 --> 02:08:44.556]  Department of Army Headquarters United States Operations Command.
[02:08:44.556 --> 02:08:46.317]  That's out of Florida.
[02:08:46.317 --> 02:08:50.801]  And Andrew C. von Eckenbach, MD, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:08:51.870 --> 02:09:06.520]  And they go on to say that the Pentagon and A&M and others have found that the American biotech labs LLC patented nanosilver has been found to knock out the SARS at levels better than anything else they've found at that time.
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:10.842]  It's 2007 and of course the coronavirus is in the whole SARS family.
[02:09:10.842 --> 02:09:12.083]  It's the antecedent of it.
[02:09:12.083 --> 02:09:13.124]  It comes with a progenitor.
[02:09:14.805 --> 02:09:17.528]  So, that's the type of stuff we sell, what we bring to you.
[02:09:17.528 --> 02:09:20.750]  The truth is, any silver from our research helps with this stuff.
[02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:23.873]  This is just the very best stuff you're going to find out there.
[02:09:23.873 --> 02:09:26.355]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[02:09:26.355 --> 02:09:28.657]  And again, I have the letter here, but I want to go to your calls.
[02:09:32.261 --> 02:09:37.264]  From my Patriot Supply, my Patriot Supply is experiencing a 12 times normal demand of food.
[02:09:37.264 --> 02:09:40.746]  It has not let up storage, water filtration, emergency preparedness products.
[02:09:40.746 --> 02:09:44.769]  This is causing a shipping delay for a majority of customers.
[02:09:44.769 --> 02:09:46.390]  Orders may take 10 to 14 days.
[02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:49.372]  None of you already ordered, that's starting today, before shipping.
[02:09:49.372 --> 02:09:54.435]  Rest assured, they are working around the clock on producing their shelf storable food products.
[02:09:54.435 --> 02:09:56.917]  All shipping and all orders are as quickly as possible.
[02:09:56.917 --> 02:09:58.738]  And you order, it's locked in.
[02:09:58.738 --> 02:10:00.359]  They have the food, they just gotta package it.
[02:10:00.919 --> 02:10:03.160]  The best strategy remains in place.
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.601]  New orders right away, without delay, to reserve your spot in the queue.
[02:10:07.601 --> 02:10:10.942]  It's possible that delays may increase slightly as time goes on.
[02:10:10.942 --> 02:10:16.924]  Our partners at MyPaperSupply are confident they can still be the fastest shipping emergency preparedness company in the industry.
[02:10:16.924 --> 02:10:18.505]  They're being very nice saying that.
[02:10:18.505 --> 02:10:19.885]  Most of them don't even have it.
[02:10:19.885 --> 02:10:27.288]  Due to their multiple warehouse infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities, they have deployed all their emergency protocols and spent all the money they have, by the way, to buy more.
[02:10:27.768 --> 02:10:31.149]  I'll just be telling you, I talked to the CEO, I talked to the founder a week and a half ago.
[02:10:31.149 --> 02:10:31.909]  They said, what do you think?
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:53.883]  They're like, should we sell everything we've got to buy more food?
[02:10:53.883 --> 02:10:55.045]  You think this is going to be really bad?
[02:10:55.045 --> 02:10:57.007]  And I said, gut level, I think it's bad.
[02:10:57.007 --> 02:11:00.031]  I think this is a real response because they don't know how bad it's going to be.
[02:11:00.031 --> 02:11:02.334]  And I said, just like you pointed out, it's already been sold out everywhere.
[02:11:03.607 --> 02:11:06.989]  And I said, if I was you, I would just buy everything you can get right now.
[02:11:06.989 --> 02:11:09.170]  And they said, that's exactly what we think we're doing that.
[02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:10.310]  So they've gone.
[02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:12.432]  See, other companies don't gamble like that.
[02:11:12.432 --> 02:11:15.853]  They'll just take your money and then get the food if they can after that.
[02:11:15.853 --> 02:11:17.374]  My Patriot doesn't gamble.
[02:11:17.374 --> 02:11:18.214]  They're like me.
[02:11:18.214 --> 02:11:20.276]  They just do what they go with their gut.
[02:11:20.276 --> 02:11:21.056]  They sign on to it.
[02:11:21.056 --> 02:11:22.176]  And that's the end of it.
[02:11:22.176 --> 02:11:24.258]  And boy, are they glad they bought that food.
[02:11:24.258 --> 02:11:25.198]  Well, we can have two weeks ago.
[02:11:25.198 --> 02:11:26.419]  This is two weeks ago now because
[02:11:27.299 --> 02:11:30.427]  That's all being packaged and shipped out, and then they went ahead and bought more.
[02:11:30.427 --> 02:11:35.600]  That's coming in, and they're buying more food with the money they get, and they're like, God, we hope...
[02:11:36.667 --> 02:11:37.727]  We're not right about this.
[02:11:37.727 --> 02:11:39.528]  We hope this is people need preparedness.
[02:11:39.528 --> 02:11:40.488]  Anyways, it's insurance.
[02:11:40.488 --> 02:11:43.189]  You can eat, but it's really deteriorating quickly.
[02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:45.449]  And you should get your orders in and in for short.com.
[02:11:45.449 --> 02:11:47.750]  They're in our system for many, many years.
[02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:48.590]  We're partners with them.
[02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:51.251]  So as it comes in, it goes right to the head of the line.
[02:11:51.251 --> 02:11:52.752]  They're full spectrum of food.
[02:11:52.752 --> 02:11:54.872]  You just drop ship it right out of in for worse.
[02:11:54.872 --> 02:12:00.434]  And then that funds are operation in for store dot com or triple eight to five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:12:00.434 --> 02:12:04.055]  Oh, and I want to go to these loaded phone lines here, but just.
[02:12:05.055 --> 02:12:08.860]  I'm just telling folks that whatever's going on behind the scenes, that's our policy.
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:11.563]  Some people say, man, that's kind of weak and weird.
[02:12:11.563 --> 02:12:13.966]  Most people hold back info because info can be used against you.
[02:12:13.966 --> 02:12:18.792]  Well, even our big nanotech supplier, Silversol, wanted their name to be known.
[02:12:18.792 --> 02:12:20.994]  I think it's about telling people what's going on.
[02:12:21.855 --> 02:12:25.157]  At a certain point, so people just know where you're at for real.
[02:12:25.157 --> 02:12:27.618]  It's not opening yourself up for attack.
[02:12:27.618 --> 02:12:32.620]  If people want to join us publicly, I think that kind of shatters the fear that goes on out there.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:37.983]  Well, I think more than that, Alex, it's just... I mean, we're literally in battle mode.
[02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:50.549]  I mean, we're... So, it's like you imagine being out on the battlefield in the midst of like an epic battle that's been going on for three days and it's just non-stop explosions and gunpowder and just, you know, death and blood and gore.
[02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.789]  It's like...
[02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:54.070]  You know, someone comes up to you trying to micromanage, you're like, what the hell?
[02:12:54.070 --> 02:12:55.631]  Like, I don't have time to think about this.
[02:12:55.631 --> 02:12:56.311]  Do it!
[02:12:56.311 --> 02:12:57.172]  Go!
[02:12:57.172 --> 02:13:03.114]  And so that's just kind of our entire, like, operation status is just constant go, constant on the gas.
[02:13:03.114 --> 02:13:08.537]  We don't have time to sit here and micromanage and decide, oh, we need to measure this here or measure this over there.
[02:13:08.537 --> 02:13:09.617]  We don't have teleprompters.
[02:13:09.617 --> 02:13:11.698]  That's what they do at all the other news organizations.
[02:13:11.698 --> 02:13:13.439]  It's all psychotically OCD controlled.
[02:13:13.439 --> 02:13:16.400]  That's why they're not next year's news today as we are.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.381]  But I will just say this.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:30.125]  The crew is probably going to hate me for this, but I'm just saying I would hate to see Alex Jones literally come while driving through that wall of emergency food supply for an ad.
[02:13:30.125 --> 02:13:30.786]  I'm just saying.
[02:13:30.786 --> 02:13:34.828]  I don't think that that would be entertaining at all, and I don't think that would sell emergency food.
[02:13:34.828 --> 02:13:40.050]  I feel really good about promoting this, and I hope folks don't need it, but all the craziness
[02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:41.270]  Well, I just doubled down.
[02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:48.373]  I had a supply of emergency food, and I just doubled it, too, with the supplies that we have here.
[02:13:48.373 --> 02:13:50.954]  And it's so convenient, too, with the storage container it comes in.
[02:13:50.954 --> 02:13:56.436]  I mean, I just have a tiny little closet in my house that I have for a bug-out bag and medical supplies.
[02:13:56.436 --> 02:13:57.356]  Let's jam one call in.
[02:13:57.356 --> 02:13:59.257]  I don't mean to interrupt you, but these people have been on too long.
[02:13:59.257 --> 02:14:00.137]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:00.137 --> 02:14:01.798]  Who's been on the longest here?
[02:14:01.798 --> 02:14:03.138]  Let's go to Mike in New Mexico.
[02:14:03.138 --> 02:14:04.219]  Mike, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:14:05.285 --> 02:14:08.046]  Hey Alex, hey Owen, I'm glad I got the call in.
[02:14:08.046 --> 02:14:09.027]  Thank you.
[02:14:09.027 --> 02:14:15.389]  I want to talk about Ukraine, the Deep State, Uranium One money.
[02:14:15.389 --> 02:14:20.211]  Right before the last election, there was an article that came out that had no traction.
[02:14:20.211 --> 02:14:26.334]  And the guy had tracked the Uranium One money down to Crimea into numbered accounts.
[02:14:26.334 --> 02:14:33.677]  There's a reason why the Deep State was using Ukraine, and it was to have access to numbered accounts to launder that money.
[02:14:34.309 --> 02:14:37.470]  And this falls into Trump's speech this morning.
[02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:39.371]  These people are broke.
[02:14:39.371 --> 02:14:46.794]  Russia moved into the Crimea and seized it, seized banks, seized money, and broke the deep state.
[02:14:46.794 --> 02:14:51.695]  Right now, Trump mortally wounded the Democrat Party.
[02:14:51.695 --> 02:14:59.018]  And what I want to see President Trump do is step up like any self-respecting big-game hunter and finish off the Democrat Party.
[02:15:00.472 --> 02:15:03.293]  You know what you just said this morning, I swore I'd do it.
[02:15:03.293 --> 02:15:07.514]  I even wrote a note and put it in my pocket to talk about Trump did the right thing.
[02:15:07.514 --> 02:15:09.074]  Because you know, your mind goes back and forth.
[02:15:09.074 --> 02:15:14.675]  But he has to finish off the CHICOM and globalist funding, deep state funding, into the deep state.
[02:15:14.675 --> 02:15:21.277]  And that's why he's taking them out first, defeating China first, defeating the globalists first, until he cleans up their minions.
[02:15:21.277 --> 02:15:22.617]  He knows to cut the head off.
[02:15:22.617 --> 02:15:23.518]  You're absolutely right.
[02:15:23.518 --> 02:15:26.298]  So we should, I think, give Trump the benefit of the doubt.
[02:15:26.298 --> 02:15:28.599]  Because that's why they're so pissed he's cut their money off.
[02:15:28.599 --> 02:15:29.299]  That's why they're crazy.
[02:15:30.442 --> 02:15:33.105]  Oh gosh, they're scared to death.
[02:15:33.105 --> 02:15:34.626]  They can't defend themselves.
[02:15:34.626 --> 02:15:38.570]  All they can do is throw whatever they've got on the wall and hope it sticks.
[02:15:38.570 --> 02:15:41.273]  And they've run out of stuff to throw at the wall.
[02:15:41.273 --> 02:15:41.713]  You're right.
[02:15:41.713 --> 02:15:43.575]  What we're seeing is total desperation.
[02:15:43.575 --> 02:15:44.075]  Stay there.
[02:15:44.075 --> 02:15:44.696]  Don't go away.
[02:15:44.696 --> 02:15:45.617]  I want Mike to finish up.
[02:15:45.617 --> 02:15:47.058]  We have a special guest popping in.
[02:15:47.058 --> 02:15:47.619]  She's running.
[02:15:47.619 --> 02:15:48.440]  It's Nancy Pelosi.
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:49.981]  We'll get to all your calls that are on the board.
[02:15:49.981 --> 02:15:51.242]  We'll get to all these calls.
[02:15:51.242 --> 02:15:51.623]  Stay with us.
[02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:59.689]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[02:15:59.689 --> 02:16:04.792]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[02:16:04.792 --> 02:16:12.518]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:16:12.518 --> 02:16:20.403]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:20.563 --> 02:16:22.364]  Not a security IPO or note.
[02:16:22.364 --> 02:16:31.869]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[02:16:31.869 --> 02:16:32.709]  Don't miss this one.
[02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:34.010]  Stake your claim today.
[02:16:34.010 --> 02:16:34.470]  Call 800-600-3388.
[02:16:34.470 --> 02:16:34.810]  That's 800-600-3388.
[02:16:34.810 --> 02:16:36.711]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[02:16:36.711 --> 02:16:37.011]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[02:16:37.011 --> 02:16:37.051]  800-600-3388.
[02:16:47.237 --> 02:16:48.903]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners.
[02:16:48.903 --> 02:16:50.610]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[02:16:50.610 --> 02:16:53.120]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[02:16:53.877 --> 02:16:58.960]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:04.303]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[02:17:04.303 --> 02:17:12.367]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:17.501]  I just can't
[02:18:37.862 --> 02:18:39.983]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[02:18:39.983 --> 02:18:41.943]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[02:18:41.943 --> 02:18:44.364]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal
[02:19:06.670 --> 02:19:13.958]  A handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[02:19:13.958 --> 02:19:17.301]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:17.301 --> 02:19:21.225]  So right now, Humanity's Awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[02:19:22.006 --> 02:19:31.332]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game, like InfoWars is, to the spirit, is your financial support.
[02:19:31.332 --> 02:19:34.194]  We make it really easy at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:34.194 --> 02:19:38.777]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our report
[02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.277]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:20.350 --> 02:20:24.693]  Well, Deanna Lorraine is going to be riding shotgun with us for the next hour.
[02:20:24.693 --> 02:20:33.020]  She's running against Nancy Pelosi and has been pulling off some really great stunts, if you want to call it that, to expose that monster.
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:36.463]  We're going to her in just a moment with Owen Schroer riding shotgun.
[02:20:36.463 --> 02:20:42.848]  Right now, Mike in New Mexico was holding over, talking about Dem's total desperation because one side of him wants to see total offense.
[02:20:43.851 --> 02:20:50.273]  But then, Trump has been cutting off their CHICOM funding, cleaning out the universities with CHICOM funding.
[02:20:50.273 --> 02:20:55.995]  The Pentagon's been indicting Harvard science heads and others that have been selling us out.
[02:20:55.995 --> 02:20:58.016]  They've been indicting a lot of people.
[02:20:58.016 --> 02:21:02.998]  And so, cutting off their minions, scaring the rest of them, I think that's a big thing.
[02:21:02.998 --> 02:21:03.878]  Is that what you're saying, Mike?
[02:21:05.051 --> 02:21:05.972]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:05.972 --> 02:21:07.813]  You know, he's cut the money off.
[02:21:07.813 --> 02:21:11.335]  He started at the bottom of the pyramid, and he's working his way up.
[02:21:11.335 --> 02:21:21.040]  He's given all these people more than enough time to quit harassing him, to step back, take a deep breath, and get on with, you know, bipartisan politics.
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:21.581]  No, you're right.
[02:21:21.581 --> 02:21:24.242]  He gave him a lot of chances, didn't he?
[02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:28.825]  He gave him three years to step up and quit and help the American people, and they haven't done it.
[02:21:30.697 --> 02:21:32.658]  Because they're slaves of corrupt globalists.
[02:21:32.658 --> 02:21:33.358]  They can't help it.
[02:21:33.358 --> 02:21:38.819]  They're all being blackmailed behind the scenes if they don't do what the establishment says.
[02:21:38.819 --> 02:21:42.320]  And that leads me right to the coronavirus.
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:47.322]  China was taking between 3 to 5 million unemployment people a month.
[02:21:47.322 --> 02:21:52.283]  They were losing 3 to 5 million jobs a month for over a year and a half.
[02:21:52.283 --> 02:21:56.304]  The coronavirus is nothing but a population reset for pain.
[02:21:57.228 --> 02:21:59.850]  And he doesn't care who gets hurt in the outcome.
[02:21:59.850 --> 02:22:00.410]  And you're right.
[02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:08.476]  And the globalists, going back to when we were threatening nuclear war with them in the 60s and 70s, they'd say, good, we have three people, please hit us.
[02:22:08.476 --> 02:22:11.739]  Those are famous statements by Mao Zedong and his adjunct.
[02:22:11.739 --> 02:22:12.580]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:13.320]  They release it.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:14.921]  It hits us, hurts us too.
[02:22:14.921 --> 02:22:17.563]  It's a face saving for the reason their economy is imploding.
[02:22:17.563 --> 02:22:20.886]  And it's a martial law takeover drill for the shy comms over their people.
[02:22:22.045 --> 02:22:31.674]  They don't care where anybody else ends up, population-wise, as long as they can get their population in line with their economy, they're going to be happy.
[02:22:31.674 --> 02:22:39.001]  And right now they need to shed about two to three hundred million people to get their economy back on track.
[02:22:39.001 --> 02:22:41.243]  This is why we have the show, callers like you.
[02:22:41.243 --> 02:22:44.285]  Mike, I don't want to kiss your ass here, but what's your background?
[02:22:44.285 --> 02:22:45.647]  Is everything you said is just dead on?
[02:22:47.259 --> 02:22:52.643]  Alex, I grew up, my father was in broadcasting, you and I made the talk.
[02:22:52.643 --> 02:22:59.888]  And then I've got a master's degree in international safety and I was a big game hunter and guide and a hotshot for years.
[02:23:00.663 --> 02:23:03.825]  So, yeah, I can help you, bro, and I'm not going to charge you time.
[02:23:03.825 --> 02:23:06.027]  No, I just don't know how to organize all these great listeners.
[02:23:06.027 --> 02:23:07.408]  These listeners are better than I am on air.
[02:23:07.408 --> 02:23:08.228]  They all need shows.
[02:23:08.228 --> 02:23:09.709]  I mean, we need more people to run these shows.
[02:23:09.709 --> 02:23:12.772]  I'm going to start a whole thing with nothing but podcasts with all these great patrons.
[02:23:12.772 --> 02:23:15.473]  Sure, put Mike in the hopper for that new show we're going to do with all the listeners.
[02:23:15.473 --> 02:23:17.015]  We're going to launch that soon.
[02:23:17.015 --> 02:23:17.675]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:17.675 --> 02:23:19.516]  God bless you.
[02:23:19.516 --> 02:23:22.698]  Speaking of another smart person, she joins us right now.
[02:23:24.437 --> 02:23:24.637]  Ms.
[02:23:24.637 --> 02:23:28.220]  Lorraine, thank you for coming on to the broadcast today.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:31.563]  What do you make of this whole situation and what's happened with Trump?
[02:23:31.563 --> 02:23:35.686]  Then we'll get into Pelosi, who you're running against, tearing up the speech.
[02:23:35.686 --> 02:23:36.547]  What did you make of that?
[02:23:36.547 --> 02:23:39.549]  I mean, it's being reported that Democrats are turning against her.
[02:23:39.549 --> 02:23:45.534]  A lot of members, state reps, others, are now leaving the Democratic Party over the woman you're running against.
[02:23:47.028 --> 02:23:49.109]  First of all, hi, Alex and Owen.
[02:23:49.109 --> 02:23:49.970]  It's great to see you.
[02:23:49.970 --> 02:23:51.151]  It's great to be back.
[02:23:51.151 --> 02:23:52.371]  You know, this is disgusting.
[02:23:52.371 --> 02:23:53.852]  I'm right in San Francisco.
[02:23:53.852 --> 02:23:54.693]  I'm in the thick of it.
[02:23:54.693 --> 02:23:55.773]  I'm in her district.
[02:23:55.773 --> 02:23:58.175]  And I am so outraged right now.
[02:23:58.175 --> 02:24:06.460]  I was, I didn't, I didn't think that Nancy could hit a new low, you know, but every time she does, she really surprises me still.
[02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:10.122]  But she is tearing up the president's speech.
[02:24:10.122 --> 02:24:11.663]  It is so disrespectful.
[02:24:11.983 --> 02:24:12.743]  What's he saying?
[02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:43.163]  I'm tearing up America.
[02:24:43.163 --> 02:24:44.445]  I'm tearing up your vote.
[02:24:44.445 --> 02:24:45.447]  I'm tearing up your election.
[02:24:45.447 --> 02:24:47.390]  I'm tearing up the State of the Union.
[02:24:47.390 --> 02:24:48.913]  I'm saying piss on America.
[02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:52.418]  If she gets squatted and pissed on the President, it'd be the same thing.
[02:24:53.206 --> 02:24:53.806]  That's how I felt.
[02:24:53.806 --> 02:24:55.687]  It was a big F-U.
[02:24:55.687 --> 02:25:02.410]  It was a huge F-U to me, to Americans, to veterans, and over 60 million people that voted for Trump.
[02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:06.272]  It's as if she thinks that we don't exist in her eyes.
[02:25:06.272 --> 02:25:10.493]  That's why I'm so outraged that I'm so excited that I'm running against her.
[02:25:10.493 --> 02:25:15.496]  My Spanish and Italian blood is literally boiling right now, as if it wasn't boiling already enough.
[02:25:15.496 --> 02:25:18.537]  And I'm that much more motivated to defeat her at the ballot box.
[02:25:18.957 --> 02:25:26.443]  And it's why I'm also doing my Pelosi for prison campaign because she needs to be called out and she can't get away with this anymore.
[02:25:26.443 --> 02:25:26.903]  It's disgusting.
[02:25:26.903 --> 02:25:34.788]  Well that's why people have pointed out that she should be removed as the speaker, that she violated, oh and you were saying US law and a bunch of codes tearing that up.
[02:25:34.788 --> 02:25:40.893]  Well yeah, it was, I believe, you guys can correct me, but I think it was US Code 18, Subjection 270.
[02:25:40.893 --> 02:25:44.956]  And by the way, Representative Gosar, I've just seen this, he tweeted this out.
[02:25:46.069 --> 02:25:54.941]  He went and found the trash bin that Nancy Pelosi threw the tore up State of the Union in and recovered it and taped it back together.
[02:25:54.941 --> 02:25:56.423]  So I mean, just think about that.
[02:25:56.423 --> 02:25:57.204]  Guys, pull that up.
[02:25:57.204 --> 02:26:00.388]  Representative recovers a speech torn up by Pelosi.
[02:26:00.388 --> 02:26:00.829]  Pull that up.
[02:26:01.049 --> 02:26:04.112]  But how about this, I mean, it's not even that hard to investigate a Nancy Pelosi.
[02:26:04.112 --> 02:26:09.317]  And I will say this, and I don't know how much Deanna Lorraine knows about this, she's busy on the campaign.
[02:26:09.317 --> 02:26:15.584]  The FBI is now running an investigation over two public officials right now in San Francisco.
[02:26:15.584 --> 02:26:20.028]  Mohamed Monu, I think is the guy's name, and then another contractor he was working with.
[02:26:20.028 --> 02:26:23.472]  Oh yeah, running the homeless scams and skimming money off the top of Nancy Pelosi.
[02:26:23.632 --> 02:26:27.435]  This is not interior in California, so they can't run this thing into the ground.
[02:26:27.435 --> 02:26:28.435]  They can't rig this thing up.
[02:26:28.435 --> 02:26:29.716]  This is Trump's FBI.
[02:26:29.716 --> 02:26:30.957]  This is Wray's FBI.
[02:26:30.957 --> 02:26:32.538]  They're investigating these crimes.
[02:26:32.538 --> 02:26:34.900]  It could make it all the way up to Nancy Pelosi.
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:41.524]  I wouldn't be shocked if it did, but it wouldn't be too hard to investigate Nancy Pelosi, allegedly worth $200 million.
[02:26:41.524 --> 02:26:45.086]  This is on a federal salary of $200,000 per year.
[02:26:45.086 --> 02:26:49.029]  Even though she has been in Congress for three decades, the math still doesn't add up.
[02:26:49.029 --> 02:26:51.391]  It's time for an investigation of Nancy Pelosi.
[02:26:51.391 --> 02:26:53.592]  And I think if she were any other American, she'd have a
[02:26:53.652 --> 02:26:55.433]  That's a life sentence right now.
[02:26:55.433 --> 02:26:57.255]  In fact, I saw that you're working on that.
[02:26:57.255 --> 02:26:59.957]  Tell us the details of that.
[02:26:59.957 --> 02:27:00.818]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:27:00.818 --> 02:27:13.908]  Well, I don't know if you guys heard the news, but in San Francisco right now as we speak, there is a plane flying around with a huge 80 foot by 25 foot banner that reads, Pelosi for prison.
[02:27:13.908 --> 02:27:18.131]  And it's flying around right now in San Francisco making liberal heads explode.
[02:27:18.131 --> 02:27:21.574]  It is raining liberal tears here in San Francisco in her district.
[02:27:22.494 --> 02:27:24.895]  And, you know, we're going to start this campaign.
[02:27:24.895 --> 02:27:26.396]  You guys had Hillary for prison.
[02:27:26.396 --> 02:27:28.157]  It's time for Pelosi for prison.
[02:27:28.157 --> 02:27:32.519]  She needs to be investigated and prosecuted for her crimes against America.
[02:27:32.519 --> 02:27:40.642]  And if you go to my website, Pelosiforprison.co, somehow .com was taken, but .co, it has a petition.
[02:27:40.642 --> 02:27:41.503]  Sign the petition.
[02:27:41.943 --> 02:27:43.904]  To get this campaign started.
[02:27:43.904 --> 02:27:44.865]  Trump has been acquitted.
[02:27:44.865 --> 02:27:46.286]  He's been exonerated.
[02:27:46.286 --> 02:27:48.287]  Obviously, this was all just a big cover-up.
[02:27:48.287 --> 02:27:52.409]  As usual, it's projection for Nancy Pelosi's crimes.
[02:27:52.409 --> 02:27:53.410]  I am tired of it.
[02:27:53.410 --> 02:27:55.211]  The American people are tired of it.
[02:27:55.211 --> 02:27:56.972]  We're tired of being lied to every day.
[02:27:56.972 --> 02:27:57.893]  I totally agree with you.
[02:27:57.893 --> 02:28:04.476]  She looks completely mentally ill when she's tearing up the speech.
[02:28:04.476 --> 02:28:07.498]  I mean, what was she... Oh, yeah.
[02:28:07.498 --> 02:28:08.419]  What was going through her head?
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.000]  Well, what is this?
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.442]  It looks like demonic possession to me.
[02:28:14.442 --> 02:28:15.403]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:15.403 --> 02:28:19.845]  But you know, some people are actually looking at the sign and they're excited about it.
[02:28:19.845 --> 02:28:20.845]  I was actually surprised.
[02:28:20.845 --> 02:28:22.966]  I thought there would be bias stuff breaking.
[02:28:22.966 --> 02:28:27.028]  So far, there isn't.
[02:28:27.028 --> 02:28:31.250]  Let's take calls when we come back with our guest, Deanna Lorraine.
[02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:33.091]  Deanna4Congress.com.
[02:28:36.288 --> 02:28:39.089]  I'll tell you, this is one hell of a time to be alive, for sure.
[02:28:39.089 --> 02:28:40.169]  Nobody should be bored.
[02:28:40.169 --> 02:28:46.331]  There is no slow news days now at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:28:46.331 --> 02:28:49.172]  So we'll take your calls with Ms.
[02:28:49.172 --> 02:28:52.133]  Lorraine Straight Ahead and with Mr. Schroeder.
[02:28:54.195 --> 02:28:57.217]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[02:28:57.217 --> 02:29:00.118]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[02:29:00.118 --> 02:29:07.342]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[02:30:01.678 --> 02:30:04.160]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:07.743]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work.
[02:30:07.743 --> 02:30:13.188]  That if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[02:30:13.188 --> 02:30:20.514]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[02:30:20.874 --> 02:30:25.895]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen.
[02:30:25.895 --> 02:30:27.536]  Fluoride's the bad halogen.
[02:30:27.536 --> 02:30:30.457]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[02:30:30.457 --> 02:30:39.379]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[02:30:39.699 --> 02:30:47.382]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[02:30:55.182 --> 02:31:03.466]  It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the morning and said, son, you've got to see this.
[02:31:03.466 --> 02:31:13.791]  The company that holds the patents on the nanosilver that's in our toothpaste, that's in our immune gargle, that's in some of the other great products like the super silver wound gel, had reports from back in 2007
[02:31:15.772 --> 02:31:30.368]  With the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security, with the Director of Homeland Security, certifying in a restricted document, confidential document of course, noted as, that this had been proven in their secret test to be knocking out SARS.
[02:31:30.368 --> 02:31:33.832]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless, now they authorized us.
[02:31:34.492 --> 02:31:34.852]  Thank you.
[02:31:55.421 --> 02:31:57.882]  The demand for food has not let up.
[02:31:57.882 --> 02:32:00.283]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[02:32:00.283 --> 02:32:05.005]  Everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[02:32:05.005 --> 02:32:06.826]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[02:32:06.826 --> 02:32:10.708]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver because, again, they have to package
[02:32:10.928 --> 02:32:12.969]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[02:32:12.969 --> 02:32:17.412]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[02:32:17.412 --> 02:32:18.913]  So I wouldn't procrastinate.
[02:32:18.913 --> 02:32:20.954]  We wanted this virus to be petering out.
[02:32:20.954 --> 02:32:22.455]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[02:32:22.455 --> 02:32:25.576]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[02:32:25.576 --> 02:32:28.198]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts.
[02:32:28.198 --> 02:32:31.460]  So get your storable food at InfoWarshipStore.com.
[02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:32.580]  That helps fund our operation.
[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:33.141]  It's insurance.
[02:32:33.141 --> 02:32:35.402]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[02:32:35.402 --> 02:32:37.163]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered.
[02:32:37.723 --> 02:32:40.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:18.665 --> 02:33:23.567]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:23.567 --> 02:33:32.431]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:33:36.007 --> 02:33:41.700]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen tearing up her copy of President Trump's State of the Union address last night.
[02:33:44.246 --> 02:33:49.788]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of the President's State of the Union speech.
[02:33:49.788 --> 02:33:50.929]  Well, he will not be acquitted.
[02:33:50.929 --> 02:33:54.350]  The impeachment trial of President Donald John Trump is officially over.
[02:33:54.350 --> 02:33:59.212]  The Senate, as anticipated, did vote to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment against him.
[02:33:59.212 --> 02:34:01.153]  That's not how a democracy works.
[02:34:01.153 --> 02:34:02.933]  That's not how it works.
[02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.974]  That's not how any of this works.
[02:34:04.974 --> 02:34:05.214]  Bulls**t.
[02:34:14.923 --> 02:34:16.144]  Remember that Chinese spy?
[02:34:16.144 --> 02:34:20.688]  Remember that Chinese spy that worked for Dianne Feinstein for what, 30 years, was it?
[02:34:20.688 --> 02:34:23.431]  She, she was, she ran, runs it, yeah.
[02:34:23.431 --> 02:34:25.433]  Interesting.
[02:34:25.433 --> 02:34:26.994]  What goes on out there in California?
[02:34:26.994 --> 02:34:30.377]  Crank this part up right here!
[02:34:30.377 --> 02:34:32.459]  Sworn to advance.
[02:34:32.459 --> 02:34:36.122]  I'm down to hell.
[02:34:36.122 --> 02:34:36.723]  Sent him out!
[02:34:40.049 --> 02:34:44.353]  Alright, let's go back to our guest, Deanna Lorraine.
[02:34:44.353 --> 02:34:47.496]  Deanna4Congress.com on Twitter.
[02:34:47.496 --> 02:34:48.858]  Deanna4Congress.
[02:34:48.858 --> 02:34:50.700]  We've got loaded phone lines here.
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:54.644]  We've got a race of these where I'll never get to them.
[02:34:54.644 --> 02:35:03.713]  You're running against Pelosi, but it's emblematic that it's a power structure of corruption, like royalty, or like the Dark Crystal Skeksis that
[02:35:05.683 --> 02:35:11.225]  Biden's kissing little girls on the lips and grabbing their butts and going completely insane on TV.
[02:35:11.225 --> 02:35:15.406]  Hillary doesn't know who she is half the time.
[02:35:15.406 --> 02:35:17.007]  Feinstein's gone crazy.
[02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:19.128]  Pelosi's gone crazy.
[02:35:19.128 --> 02:35:21.568]  Maxine Waters went crazy a long time ago.
[02:35:21.568 --> 02:35:26.290]  They're totally disconnected from reality, sitting on top of these districts they control that have election fraud.
[02:35:27.995 --> 02:35:39.043]  But even, but the fact that there's not survival of the fittest and no real political fights going on just leaves these dead cicadas, I'd call them, hanging on.
[02:35:39.043 --> 02:35:40.685]  What do you expect to happen next?
[02:35:40.685 --> 02:35:50.152]  Because she could easily have a stroke or just die any time it looks like whatever drug she's messed up on while you're running against her.
[02:35:50.152 --> 02:35:50.892]  Well, absolutely.
[02:35:50.892 --> 02:35:56.677]  You know, look, I never want to wish ill will upon anyone, of course, but, you know,
[02:35:57.369 --> 02:35:58.370]  Things happen, right?
[02:35:58.370 --> 02:36:02.412]  God works in mysterious ways and I do believe miracles happen, for sure.
[02:36:02.412 --> 02:36:07.875]  If we didn't have miracles happen, if we didn't have faith, then Trump would not be in office, right?
[02:36:07.875 --> 02:36:17.101]  So, stranger things have happened and, you know, the biggest thing is I believe that there is an awakening right now and I think that there is a cleaning up of corruption that's happening.
[02:36:17.101 --> 02:36:24.906]  She may very well, who knows, you know, break her leg or get sick or something like that or get too senile that she can no longer be in Congress.
[02:36:25.566 --> 02:36:31.973]  So anything can happen and that's why that's so important for Republicans to run in tough blue districts.
[02:36:31.973 --> 02:36:36.198]  I am so tired of people telling me, oh that's impossible, you're never going to defeat her.
[02:36:36.198 --> 02:36:37.900]  You know, why even do that?
[02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:38.301]  You know what?
[02:36:39.045 --> 02:36:42.469]  Again, if we didn't have that, we would just be waving the white flag of surrender.
[02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:44.672]  And we absolutely need to run in tough districts.
[02:36:44.672 --> 02:36:46.114]  You don't know what's going to happen.
[02:36:46.114 --> 02:36:47.535]  We can't foresee the future.
[02:36:47.535 --> 02:36:50.279]  But we're getting a groundswell of support right now.
[02:36:50.279 --> 02:36:54.224]  There are a lot of conservatives in those tough blue places that feel like they're hiding.
[02:36:54.224 --> 02:36:55.745]  And you're energizing them and giving them hope.
[02:36:55.745 --> 02:36:57.247]  But let's expand on that.
[02:36:57.247 --> 02:36:58.509]  Sanders, who I don't like.
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:00.700]  Wow, she's really fired up.
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:01.280]  That's great.
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:03.161]  I'm up down here in Los Angeles, California, and she's
[02:37:26.975 --> 02:37:28.577]  Right on the money.
[02:37:28.577 --> 02:37:34.542]  There are conservatives that are in the blue areas that, you know, we're not represented.
[02:37:34.542 --> 02:37:39.166]  And that's the kind of turn the media, we all know, doesn't want to show.
[02:37:39.166 --> 02:37:44.830]  They don't want to take that and they don't want to allow us to have a voice.
[02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:51.476]  So I just wanted to say there was kind of an analogy I wanted to give that I was, you know, we're witnessing.
[02:37:51.909 --> 02:37:59.552]  We witnessed Donald Trump, you know, he's kind of being double-teamed right now, or has been double-teamed by the globalists, kind of in a basketball reference.
[02:37:59.552 --> 02:38:02.013]  And us people, we're in the paint.
[02:38:02.013 --> 02:38:03.073]  We need to finish this up.
[02:38:03.073 --> 02:38:06.355]  We need to dunk this right on these globalists, you know.
[02:38:06.355 --> 02:38:10.336]  We should be at all their events shouting them down, Adam Schiff.
[02:38:10.336 --> 02:38:10.756]  All of them.
[02:38:10.756 --> 02:38:12.117]  We should get up, exactly.
[02:38:12.117 --> 02:38:14.938]  You can't sit here and hope for Trump to do it all.
[02:38:14.938 --> 02:38:15.298]  No, sir.
[02:38:16.041 --> 02:38:17.662]  No sir, we're the people.
[02:38:17.662 --> 02:38:18.603]  We put them there.
[02:38:18.603 --> 02:38:19.844]  We gotta finish this thing up.
[02:38:19.844 --> 02:38:21.625]  So you're saying Trump and we the people.
[02:38:21.625 --> 02:38:22.666]  That's what's gotta come together.
[02:38:22.666 --> 02:38:24.247]  But you know, just let me say this.
[02:38:24.247 --> 02:38:26.449]  This is actually already happening.
[02:38:26.449 --> 02:38:27.470]  Okay?
[02:38:27.470 --> 02:38:29.031]  Schiff got shouted down the other day.
[02:38:29.031 --> 02:38:29.572]  Everywhere.
[02:38:29.572 --> 02:38:31.833]  In front of dozens of politicians.
[02:38:31.833 --> 02:38:38.979]  After I did the obstruction of Congress with, that's what they're trying to accuse me of, with the Nadler crimes, calling him out for all this criminal treason.
[02:38:38.979 --> 02:38:39.699]  You helped trigger that.
[02:38:39.699 --> 02:38:41.341]  It was, it was, here's the problem.
[02:38:42.324 --> 02:38:43.445]  No one will cover it!
[02:38:43.445 --> 02:38:44.826]  Fox News covers it up!
[02:38:44.826 --> 02:38:46.768]  Fox News doesn't want to cover it!
[02:38:46.768 --> 02:38:48.489]  The whole world saw it and loved it.
[02:38:48.489 --> 02:38:52.993]  Of course they did, but my point is that... You're pointing out that the establishment is Fox News as well.
[02:38:52.993 --> 02:39:03.523]  And the only way to pile drive through this, it's being censored on social media, it's being censored on mainstream media, it's just pile driving through it, never relenting, continuing to shout them down.
[02:39:03.523 --> 02:39:04.904]  Don't let them walk around.
[02:39:04.904 --> 02:39:08.387]  You may be the person that asks the questions that gets out that triggers the total defeat.
[02:39:08.587 --> 02:39:09.628]  And it's so simple.
[02:39:09.628 --> 02:39:15.114]  I mean, I remember when Ben Berkman went to Schiff and read him his Miranda rights.
[02:39:15.114 --> 02:39:17.376]  Because yeah, that guy belongs in prison!
[02:39:17.376 --> 02:39:20.899]  Adam Schiff is a treasonous scumbag who belongs in prison.
[02:39:20.899 --> 02:39:24.263]  And Trump can sit here and have press conferences all day long saying this.
[02:39:24.263 --> 02:39:26.685]  Put his ass in jail!
[02:39:26.685 --> 02:39:28.187]  That's right, because they're always saying harass us.
[02:39:28.187 --> 02:39:28.907]  We're going to harass them.
[02:39:28.907 --> 02:39:31.150]  We're going to get in their face with the information.
[02:39:31.150 --> 02:39:31.370]  Michael?
[02:39:32.267 --> 02:39:37.973]  We're all Alex Jones, we're all Owen Shroyer, we're all Project Veritas, and now we're all Miss Deanna now.
[02:39:37.973 --> 02:39:39.955]  So we take up this fight.
[02:39:39.955 --> 02:39:42.237]  We're going to finish on strong.
[02:39:42.237 --> 02:39:44.038]  We have a future to work for.
[02:39:44.038 --> 02:39:45.220]  That's all I have to say.
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.141]  I appreciate your time.
[02:39:46.141 --> 02:39:47.141]  God bless you, brother.
[02:39:47.141 --> 02:39:47.742]  God bless you.
[02:39:47.742 --> 02:39:48.042]  Thank you.
[02:39:48.042 --> 02:39:48.723]  We're going to the order.
[02:39:48.723 --> 02:39:50.084]  We receive these calls.
[02:39:50.084 --> 02:39:50.845]  Aaron in Virginia.
[02:39:50.845 --> 02:39:51.486]  You're on the air.
[02:39:51.486 --> 02:39:52.286]  Coronavirus.
[02:39:52.286 --> 02:39:53.648]  Give us your take on it.
[02:39:55.567 --> 02:39:56.408]  Yes, Alex.
[02:39:56.408 --> 02:40:03.774]  I just wanted to call in with a little bit of a different perspective and put a thought out there on the coronavirus.
[02:40:03.774 --> 02:40:07.757]  About four years ago, I got a virus.
[02:40:07.757 --> 02:40:11.160]  And the virus that I got left me disabled.
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.402]  It totally destroyed my life.
[02:40:14.402 --> 02:40:25.011]  And I was just thinking when I saw these people dropping on TV with the coronavirus, that was one of the strange symptoms that I and several other people that got the same virus
[02:40:25.512 --> 02:40:26.373]  Had.
[02:40:26.373 --> 02:40:36.139]  And it made me think that maybe the virus has been here already for quite some time and the people who have been getting it and surviving it, it's been crippling those.
[02:40:36.139 --> 02:40:42.764]  And that's kind of why the global cooperation and the quarantine measures really don't match up with each other.
[02:40:43.496 --> 02:40:44.896]  Because they know it's... Oh, I know.
[02:40:44.896 --> 02:40:47.057]  There's been a bunch of weird respiratory stuff going around.
[02:40:47.057 --> 02:40:50.077]  It killed three of my family six years ago in two weeks.
[02:40:50.077 --> 02:40:51.258]  They all got it within a few weeks.
[02:40:51.258 --> 02:40:52.798]  They all died within a month.
[02:40:52.798 --> 02:40:53.698]  So you don't have to tell me.
[02:40:53.698 --> 02:40:54.658]  I absolutely agree with you.
[02:40:54.658 --> 02:40:58.339]  And that's... Ellen got really sick, respiratory, when he got locked up in the D.C.
[02:40:58.339 --> 02:40:58.519]  jail.
[02:40:58.519 --> 02:41:00.880]  There's a lot of stuff going on out there.
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:02.380]  Yeah.
[02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:03.440]  Thank you, Erin.
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:03.760]  Go ahead.
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:04.120]  Sorry.
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:05.021]  Oops, she's gone.
[02:41:05.021 --> 02:41:05.761]  Got to move quick now.
[02:41:05.761 --> 02:41:06.861]  I don't want to get to all these people.
[02:41:06.861 --> 02:41:08.261]  Do you want to comment?
[02:41:08.261 --> 02:41:09.461]  Coronavirus, that's for sure.
[02:41:09.461 --> 02:41:10.022]  Yeah.
[02:41:10.022 --> 02:41:10.242]  Ms.
[02:41:10.242 --> 02:41:11.882]  Lorraine, please comment on the coronavirus.
[02:41:12.629 --> 02:41:13.189]  Oh, gosh.
[02:41:13.189 --> 02:41:15.370]  I mean, you know, they are so not telling us the truth about it.
[02:41:15.370 --> 02:41:16.390]  There's so many lies.
[02:41:16.390 --> 02:41:18.930]  I feel like there's absolutely some manufacturing going on.
[02:41:18.930 --> 02:41:23.411]  I think that it probably was a manufactured virus.
[02:41:23.411 --> 02:41:30.192]  And, you know, I mean, look, it's just very convenient that it happens to come out right at this time.
[02:41:30.192 --> 02:41:33.093]  And it happens to influence these areas.
[02:41:33.093 --> 02:41:33.873]  It's very odd.
[02:41:33.873 --> 02:41:37.514]  So I have I don't think anything is coincidental.
[02:41:37.514 --> 02:41:39.634]  And I think it's probably manufactured.
[02:41:42.253 --> 02:41:56.597]  Well, I don't regularly be conclusive, but I can tell you, decisively, major universities that do this studied it and said it's got the HIV delivery system on it, it's been manufactured, and then the U.S.
[02:41:56.597 --> 02:42:02.519]  Biological Weapons Treaty author comes out and says it, and then all this other evidence mounts.
[02:42:02.519 --> 02:42:04.800]  This is something else.
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:05.940]  And that's all I'm saying.
[02:42:07.705 --> 02:42:08.146]  Absolutely.
[02:42:08.146 --> 02:42:11.789]  I never put it past the globalists.
[02:42:11.789 --> 02:42:22.180]  They're just so insidious and, you know, so intentional about the things that they do that I never put things like this past them.
[02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:24.302]  And we got to look out for their next plans for us, really.
[02:42:25.336 --> 02:42:27.998]  Well, the videos are flooding in too fast to even cover.
[02:42:27.998 --> 02:42:30.440]  It's just body bags, dead bodies everywhere.
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:39.928]  It's definitely way bigger than we're being told, and it's being used as a martial law drill for control in Communist China, but something is killing a lot of people over there.
[02:42:39.928 --> 02:42:51.557]  And we know the receptor sites on it hit Asian military-age men a lot higher than others, which leans toward it being a Western bioweapon, but I'm not saying that's what it is.
[02:42:51.557 --> 02:42:52.018]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:53.834 --> 02:42:57.996]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[02:42:57.996 --> 02:43:08.359]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[02:43:08.359 --> 02:43:15.122]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[02:43:15.902 --> 02:43:25.660]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:28.345]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[02:43:29.209 --> 02:43:34.374]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[02:43:34.374 --> 02:43:39.319]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[02:43:39.319 --> 02:43:41.701]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[02:43:41.701 --> 02:43:47.487]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[02:43:47.487 --> 02:43:49.469]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[02:43:49.469 --> 02:43:52.572]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[02:43:54.013 --> 02:44:04.078]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[02:44:04.078 --> 02:44:10.080]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:11.901]  But it's true.
[02:44:11.901 --> 02:44:15.082]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[02:44:15.082 --> 02:44:18.524]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to
[02:44:18.544 --> 02:44:19.104]  I don't know.
[02:44:37.113 --> 02:44:50.858]  See, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks, and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[02:44:50.858 --> 02:44:51.998]  Ha ha!
[02:44:51.998 --> 02:44:52.659]  Hail Cobra!
[02:44:54.713 --> 02:44:56.294]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:44:56.294 --> 02:45:02.580]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're gonna sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:13.449]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.142]  The adult or the children's.
[02:45:16.142 --> 02:45:19.705]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[02:45:19.705 --> 02:45:20.606]  People love it.
[02:45:20.606 --> 02:45:28.733]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[02:45:29.474 --> 02:45:32.256]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[02:45:32.256 --> 02:45:34.978]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[02:45:34.978 --> 02:45:35.778]  This is all proven.
[02:45:35.778 --> 02:45:37.339]  You can make claims with this.
[02:45:37.339 --> 02:45:48.527]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[02:45:48.527 --> 02:45:49.887]  So, we're really proud of it.
[02:45:49.887 --> 02:45:50.808]  It funds the operation.
[02:45:50.808 --> 02:45:51.949]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:45:52.509 --> 02:45:54.752]  That's why we're still on air thanks to you!
[02:45:54.752 --> 02:46:02.982]  We've got three big sales going right now and one of them has to end within a week and that's Ultimate Fish Oil for
[02:46:04.599 --> 02:46:05.980]  33% off.
[02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:06.781]  It's amazing.
[02:46:06.781 --> 02:46:08.341]  Go check it out for yourself.
[02:46:08.341 --> 02:46:16.786]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[02:46:16.786 --> 02:46:18.987]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[02:46:18.987 --> 02:46:23.870]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:26.252]  So just check it out for yourself.
[02:46:26.252 --> 02:46:28.993]  40% off, mfullworldstore.com, and it funds the M4.
[02:46:28.993 --> 02:46:30.194]  And then Vitamin
[02:46:30.774 --> 02:46:33.636]  D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[02:46:33.636 --> 02:46:34.878]  Super high quality.
[02:46:34.878 --> 02:46:35.938]  Winter sun.
[02:46:35.938 --> 02:46:37.760]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:40.402]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[02:46:40.402 --> 02:46:41.663]  That's why people get so sick.
[02:46:41.663 --> 02:46:42.464]  That's the main reason.
[02:46:42.464 --> 02:46:44.706]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[02:46:44.706 --> 02:46:45.587]  Get higher absorption.
[02:46:45.587 --> 02:46:46.447]  It's amazing.
[02:46:46.447 --> 02:46:51.211]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfowarStore.com.
[02:46:51.211 --> 02:46:53.153]  Protect yourself and fund the Infowar.
[02:46:53.153 --> 02:46:53.253]  360WIN.
[02:46:58.368 --> 02:47:07.373]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:07.373 --> 02:47:10.794]  InfoWars.com.
[02:47:10.794 --> 02:47:17.117]  Brought to you by the American people and the enemy of Cobra.
[02:47:17.117 --> 02:47:23.080]  Speaking of Cobra, we have a good servant named Nancy Pelosi.
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:23.941]  This isn't a joke.
[02:47:23.941 --> 02:47:26.162]  This is an InfoWars.com article just went up.
[02:47:27.486 --> 02:47:32.517]  Bitter Pelosi claims Trump was drugged during State of the Union.
[02:47:32.517 --> 02:47:34.682]  It looked to me like he was a little sedated.
[02:47:34.682 --> 02:47:35.123]  Here it is.
[02:47:37.307 --> 02:47:38.588]  I don't know.
[02:48:04.926 --> 02:48:05.686]  That's a lie.
[02:48:05.686 --> 02:48:06.886]  She practiced ripping it up.
[02:48:06.886 --> 02:48:08.407]  She got caught on camera.
[02:48:08.407 --> 02:48:11.708]  And she actually did not do a proper introduction of the President.
[02:48:11.708 --> 02:48:13.408]  She actually failed in her duties.
[02:48:13.408 --> 02:48:16.229]  The point is, he's the one on a bunch of drugs.
[02:48:16.229 --> 02:48:21.630]  Well, everybody knows Nancy Pelosi's drunker than a sailor on a bender.
[02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:22.670]  That's not even a debate.
[02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:24.930]  Do we really have to even point that out?
[02:48:24.930 --> 02:48:27.211]  Who just got back from Vietnam.
[02:48:28.626 --> 02:48:31.791]  I mean, I went to a bar in D.C.
[02:48:31.791 --> 02:48:35.156]  I walked into the bar and I asked for a drink.
[02:48:35.156 --> 02:48:36.799]  They said, sorry, we're all out.
[02:48:36.799 --> 02:48:37.780]  I said, all out?
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:39.904]  They said, yeah, well, Pelosi just left.
[02:48:42.281 --> 02:48:43.442]  Yeah, Alex won't let me go.
[02:48:43.442 --> 02:48:46.304]  I'm supposed to host the War Room for three hours from three to six and Alex is like,
[02:48:59.155 --> 02:49:00.776]  No, you stay with Cobra!
[02:49:00.776 --> 02:49:03.619]  You stay with Cobra, Destro!
[02:49:03.619 --> 02:49:07.823]  And Baroness Jones-ass Deanna has done well.
[02:49:07.823 --> 02:49:09.384]  Deanna has done well.
[02:49:09.384 --> 02:49:12.687]  You got a lot of good stuff coming up on The War Room today.
[02:49:12.687 --> 02:49:16.470]  Great guests, great video clips, CNN, OUTS itself is fake news.
[02:49:16.470 --> 02:49:17.751]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:49:17.751 --> 02:49:20.294]  And as always, Hail Cobra!
[02:49:21.204 --> 02:49:23.725]  I will see you.
[02:49:23.725 --> 02:49:25.686]  Like I said, we got great guest video clips.
[02:49:25.686 --> 02:49:30.389]  We're going to show how CNN is basically reporting its own fake news on itself.
[02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:32.830]  You know, I see a microaggression.
[02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:35.051]  Well, you're you're.
[02:49:35.051 --> 02:49:37.612]  I'm going to put a tie on to none of your little.
[02:49:37.612 --> 02:49:40.293]  Oh, my American flag.
[02:49:40.293 --> 02:49:41.374]  No, not the American flag.
[02:49:41.374 --> 02:49:42.775]  That's bad.
[02:49:42.775 --> 02:49:45.496]  That is a KKK hat.
[02:49:45.496 --> 02:49:47.297]  Oh, oh, my pockets where.
[02:49:48.564 --> 02:49:49.605]  Well, it is white.
[02:49:49.605 --> 02:49:50.406]  I'm getting senile.
[02:49:50.406 --> 02:49:52.227]  What do they call those that pop out of the top?
[02:49:52.227 --> 02:49:53.548]  The pocket square.
[02:49:53.548 --> 02:49:54.309]  It's not a pocket square.
[02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:55.250]  There's another name for it.
[02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:55.830]  A handkerchief?
[02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:56.891]  A handkerchief.
[02:49:56.891 --> 02:49:58.532]  What do you call it in a suit?
[02:49:58.532 --> 02:49:59.673]  A pocket square.
[02:49:59.673 --> 02:50:02.195]  Okay, well that's a cake, cake, cake, round dragon.
[02:50:02.195 --> 02:50:03.356]  You're caught.
[02:50:03.356 --> 02:50:04.497]  I'm offended.
[02:50:04.497 --> 02:50:05.298]  You're fired.
[02:50:05.298 --> 02:50:07.480]  No, I'm not a Democrat, actually.
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:08.120]  Get out of here!
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:08.901]  Thank you very much.
[02:50:08.901 --> 02:50:09.962]  Grand wizard.
[02:50:09.962 --> 02:50:11.103]  No, I'm not a Democrat.
[02:50:11.103 --> 02:50:12.304]  I want to correct a record.
[02:50:12.304 --> 02:50:13.945]  Alright, I'm going to stop right now.
[02:50:13.945 --> 02:50:15.707]  I'm so upset and triggered.
[02:50:16.872 --> 02:50:19.955]  Cobra Commander will shut you down, Alex Jones.
[02:50:19.955 --> 02:50:21.776]  Baroness will serve me well.
[02:50:21.776 --> 02:50:23.698]  All right, let's just stop.
[02:50:23.698 --> 02:50:25.059]  All right, there goes Owen.
[02:50:25.059 --> 02:50:28.562]  I made him stay here to tell you what's coming up in the lower room.
[02:50:28.562 --> 02:50:30.664]  So, um, I want to get through these calls.
[02:50:30.664 --> 02:50:31.325]  Been holding the longest.
[02:50:31.325 --> 02:50:36.950]  We'll go 15 minutes to the next hour with our guest here that's running against Nancy Pelosi.
[02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:39.592]  But first, let's go to those phone calls as promised.
[02:50:39.592 --> 02:50:40.733]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:50:42.423 --> 02:50:42.623]  Ms.
[02:50:42.623 --> 02:50:44.604]  Lorraine, jump in anytime you want to comment.
[02:50:44.604 --> 02:50:46.205]  This is teleprompter free, as you know.
[02:50:46.205 --> 02:50:48.947]  Oh, great.
[02:50:48.947 --> 02:50:53.769]  Let's go ahead and talk to Justin.
[02:50:53.769 --> 02:51:01.214]  Someone was saying that the banner in my sky was a white supremacist banner, some sort of like fascism floating through the air.
[02:51:01.214 --> 02:51:03.455]  I want to try to find who that person was, because that's hilarious.
[02:51:03.933 --> 02:51:06.535]  Well that's why I was making the joke, it's in his handkerchief.
[02:51:06.535 --> 02:51:12.238]  Sticking out his little, it's white, so it's like, ah, Cobra fights racism.
[02:51:12.238 --> 02:51:13.779]  Join Cobra.
[02:51:13.779 --> 02:51:15.360]  I'm gonna stop being silly.
[02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:16.761]  Okay, who's been on the longest here?
[02:51:16.761 --> 02:51:18.482]  That would be Justin in Tennessee.
[02:51:18.482 --> 02:51:19.623]  Justin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:51:20.922 --> 02:51:21.362]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:21.362 --> 02:51:24.044]  Just want to say I like your show, love it.
[02:51:24.044 --> 02:51:29.147]  Even been using your Super Blue Silver for my family for the past few days.
[02:51:29.147 --> 02:51:31.689]  Hopefully, you know, that'll help our immune system.
[02:51:31.689 --> 02:51:38.173]  But first thing I want to do is I just wanted to jump right into it because I know there's a lot of people still on hold.
[02:51:38.173 --> 02:51:49.501]  About last week, I was told by my sister, her co-worker's brother actually supposedly got quarantined for a possible virus in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:51:51.331 --> 02:51:54.713]  That I haven't seen anything on the news about it yet.
[02:51:54.713 --> 02:51:56.955]  Oh, obviously the virus is all over the U.S.
[02:51:56.955 --> 02:51:58.076]  and they're covering it up.
[02:51:58.076 --> 02:52:01.078]  We had a guy that was involved in emergency management earlier call in last hour.
[02:52:01.078 --> 02:52:07.462]  I don't know if you heard him, but he said, no, no, they're covering up and they're afraid that it's going to get so bad that it breaks down.
[02:52:07.462 --> 02:52:09.904]  So the coverup gets exposed.
[02:52:09.904 --> 02:52:11.245]  Oh yeah.
[02:52:11.245 --> 02:52:16.729]  But, um, and then also that last night, uh, I was staying up all night digging through the internet and now they're.
[02:52:16.729 --> 02:52:19.991]  Oops.
[02:52:20.370 --> 02:52:21.831]  We did not hang up on that caller.
[02:52:21.831 --> 02:52:24.053]  It just boom, went to hang up.
[02:52:24.053 --> 02:52:26.275]  Was that a CNN hang up?
[02:52:26.275 --> 02:52:28.557]  Yeah, that's not us.
[02:52:28.557 --> 02:52:30.758]  Let's go to Tim in Illinois.
[02:52:30.758 --> 02:52:31.319]  You're on the air.
[02:52:31.319 --> 02:52:33.461]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:52:33.461 --> 02:52:34.982]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:34.982 --> 02:52:35.742]  Welcome, sir.
[02:52:35.742 --> 02:52:36.503]  Can you hear me?
[02:52:36.503 --> 02:52:38.084]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:38.084 --> 02:52:45.670]  Hey, I just want to say, Deanna, you're like a 69 Camaro next to a 79 Mercury Marquis.
[02:52:49.893 --> 02:52:50.593]  On the drag strip.
[02:52:50.593 --> 02:52:51.094]  I'll take it.
[02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:55.015]  So, Nancy Pelosi, she don't have a chance.
[02:52:55.015 --> 02:53:02.779]  Yeah, no, Nancy Pelosi's like a broken 1974 Gremlin next to a 2000 Ferrari.
[02:53:02.779 --> 02:53:04.640]  That's right.
[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:05.360]  I'll take it.
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:06.460]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:06.821]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:06.821 --> 02:53:08.521]  How are you?
[02:53:08.521 --> 02:53:14.644]  My thoughts, you know, we're all like five-year-olds waiting on Christmas for Trump to do something to these guys.
[02:53:18.470 --> 02:53:25.176]  What I was going to say is I just think that he's waiting until his second term.
[02:53:25.176 --> 02:53:27.497]  I don't think they were going to let him.
[02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:31.881]  He knows if he did something, it could go against him on that second term.
[02:53:31.881 --> 02:53:36.024]  So I think he's holding out.
[02:53:36.024 --> 02:53:38.366]  There's too many people on the fence.
[02:53:38.366 --> 02:53:40.408]  So what's your thoughts on that?
[02:53:40.408 --> 02:53:41.409]  No, I totally agree.
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:50.922]  And he better go on the offensive in the second term 270 days out or I'm going to go completely ape because he needs to end the globalist deep state.
[02:53:50.922 --> 02:53:52.743]  Then we won't have problems and some corruption.
[02:53:52.743 --> 02:53:59.725]  I'm not a dreamer who thinks everything's perfect, but I don't want people in the government that want to destroy the country and tell me America sucks.
[02:53:59.725 --> 02:54:00.505]  That's a litmus test.
[02:54:02.116 --> 02:54:03.677]  I'm so tired of him going soft.
[02:54:03.677 --> 02:54:10.421]  To be honest with you, I really hope that he's holding all that wrath and justice for a second term because I can't take it anymore.
[02:54:10.421 --> 02:54:12.142]  I'm getting really impatient here.
[02:54:12.142 --> 02:54:13.323]  And we need justice.
[02:54:13.323 --> 02:54:21.568]  I mean, that's why we elected him into office, so that we can actually get justice and get these bad people in Gitmo or behind bars where they belong.
[02:54:21.568 --> 02:54:22.469]  That's right, Tim.
[02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:25.270]  Tim, what do you want to see when Trump gets re-elected?
[02:54:25.270 --> 02:54:26.891]  What do you want to see day one?
[02:54:26.891 --> 02:54:30.834]  I want to see him unleash the Kraken.
[02:54:30.834 --> 02:54:31.034]  Yes.
[02:54:33.089 --> 02:54:37.271]  And I think Kraken's coming.
[02:54:37.271 --> 02:54:41.992]  I think the American people have been waiting on this too long.
[02:54:41.992 --> 02:54:48.415]  And I think he's going to... I think he'll do what's right.
[02:54:48.415 --> 02:54:50.116]  I have faith in him.
[02:54:50.116 --> 02:54:52.817]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[02:54:52.817 --> 02:54:53.257]  Because...
[02:54:54.781 --> 02:54:59.363]  That's exactly what I was told, that Trump intends to release the Kraken once he's re-elected.
[02:54:59.363 --> 02:55:01.804]  I was told that by somebody very close to the President.
[02:55:01.804 --> 02:55:04.205]  So, we'll see what happens.
[02:55:04.205 --> 02:55:07.907]  And of course, the Kraken brings destruction on evil cities.
[02:55:07.907 --> 02:55:11.369]  So, notice all these diseases are breaking out in these evil cities.
[02:55:11.369 --> 02:55:13.470]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:55:13.470 --> 02:55:15.511]  Let's take another call here.
[02:55:15.511 --> 02:55:19.793]  We had a caller saying he wants to talk about Democrat cities that are infected, but I guess he hung up.
[02:55:20.795 --> 02:55:23.137]  Let's talk to Jeff in Tennessee.
[02:55:23.137 --> 02:55:24.678]  He's been holding along us next.
[02:55:24.678 --> 02:55:25.619]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:55:25.619 --> 02:55:29.181]  In the two minutes we have in this hour, what do you want to say?
[02:55:29.181 --> 02:55:34.265]  I want to say that Deanna, beat that bitch out.
[02:55:34.265 --> 02:55:38.688]  Get that win, win, win, win.
[02:55:38.688 --> 02:55:44.333]  Well listen, if America leverages and gives Deanna word of mouth, Deanna Lorraine,
[02:55:46.704 --> 02:55:47.925]  Please.
[02:55:47.925 --> 02:55:49.027]  For Congress?
[02:55:49.027 --> 02:55:52.550]  If you do that, we can overpower Pelosi if people just decide to win.
[02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:56.755]  But as you were saying, the Democrats just aren't the problem.
[02:55:56.755 --> 02:56:01.640]  The Republicans refuse to run people against Pelosi.
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:04.203]  Well, I need you to report warriors.
[02:56:05.290 --> 02:56:06.330]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:06.330 --> 02:56:07.811]  I mean, I love you guys.
[02:56:07.811 --> 02:56:09.451]  I need you in for warriors.
[02:56:09.451 --> 02:56:11.611]  I'm a true patriot and conservative.
[02:56:11.611 --> 02:56:14.052]  I'm so tired of these rhinos in office.
[02:56:14.052 --> 02:56:16.052]  You know, get these rhinos out of here.
[02:56:16.052 --> 02:56:17.473]  Get these socialists out of here.
[02:56:17.473 --> 02:56:19.853]  But I need your help and I appreciate your help.
[02:56:19.853 --> 02:56:20.813]  We can do it.
[02:56:20.813 --> 02:56:23.474]  What else you want to add?
[02:56:23.474 --> 02:56:29.695]  Well, the impeachment and the way they done the impeachment in Kavanaugh.
[02:56:29.695 --> 02:56:33.056]  I'm going back on Kavanaugh because of this, too.
[02:56:33.056 --> 02:56:33.776]  My opinion.
[02:56:35.021 --> 02:56:44.887]  We need to hold the Democrats' feet to the fire because of all of the lies, all of the deceit.
[02:56:44.887 --> 02:56:49.049]  They need to be brought up on perjury charges, number one.
[02:56:49.049 --> 02:57:03.117]  Number two, they need to pay back their salaries for the last three years because they have done nothing.
[02:57:03.117 --> 02:57:03.557]  Nothing.
[02:57:04.110 --> 02:57:06.051]  For this country.
[02:57:06.051 --> 02:57:06.792]  That's not true.
[02:57:06.792 --> 02:57:09.834]  They've obstructed the country and tried to destroy it.
[02:57:09.834 --> 02:57:12.136]  Well, you know, I'm talking about... No, I know, I know.
[02:57:12.136 --> 02:57:13.396]  No, I mean, I agree with you.
[02:57:13.396 --> 02:57:15.378]  They should go to prison.
[02:57:15.378 --> 02:57:16.218]  Yes.
[02:57:16.218 --> 02:57:18.840]  Yes, they need to go to prison.
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:23.583]  And I've got a few other things that I've got some questions about.
[02:57:23.583 --> 02:57:26.846]  And Owen left and had to go for the war room.
[02:57:26.846 --> 02:57:29.848]  But I've got some questions that I would like to ask him.
[02:57:31.107 --> 02:57:36.908]  Jeff, I got a sneaking suspicion that if we give your name and number to Owen, he will call you as the first caller on The War Room.
[02:57:36.908 --> 02:57:42.289]  So guys, give Jeff's name and number to Owen, make sure they call him when they take calls, and he's the first caller they take.
[02:57:42.289 --> 02:57:43.489]  Please make sure it happens.
[02:57:43.489 --> 02:57:44.649]  All right, we're going to come right back.

[02:58:45.083 --> 02:58:51.927]  Alex Jones here reporting from the road on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus.
[02:58:51.927 --> 02:58:56.390]  It has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:58:56.390 --> 02:59:03.394]  It has now spread across the entire planet and of course we've now discovered that indeed it is man-made and engineered.
[02:59:03.394 --> 02:59:08.797]  We're covering it live all with our team at InfoWars.com, Ford's Live Show and Band.Video.
[02:59:08.797 --> 02:59:10.018]  On top of that we have
[02:59:10.578 --> 02:59:11.439]  We're good to go.
[02:59:26.326 --> 02:59:28.748]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:59.072 --> 03:00:00.754]  He didn't find Jesus.
[03:00:00.754 --> 03:00:04.276]  Not unless you're born again, brother.
[03:00:28.490 --> 03:00:30.712]  Believe me, I've seen a lot of stuff.
[03:00:30.712 --> 03:00:34.875]  I've even been on the dark side for a little while.
[03:00:34.875 --> 03:00:39.459]  The power of Christ is a trillion times of the devil.
[03:00:39.459 --> 03:00:42.141]  And that's only from human perspective.
[03:00:42.141 --> 03:00:46.785]  Got a few final calls to take.
[03:00:51.505 --> 03:00:59.052]  We have the woman who's running against Nancy Pelosi as a Republican with no Republican backing, but she's showing up in the polls and doing a great job.
[03:00:59.052 --> 03:01:01.934]  Deanna Lorraine joins us right now.
[03:01:01.934 --> 03:01:07.700]  We've got a few final calls to take before Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:12.003]  What else do you have to get off your chest that people need to know watching this historic battle happen?
[03:01:12.003 --> 03:01:15.667]  How can anybody not be inspired by this and realize we're at a critical crossroads?
[03:01:16.926 --> 03:01:30.177]  Right, well I just want to make it very clear that what happened with Mitt Romney, Mittens Romney, you know, betraying the president the way he did, okay, that's just one example, right, that just happened to be a very public display of rhinoism.
[03:01:30.177 --> 03:01:34.360]  There are people like that everywhere, all over the country, and we're not quite aware of them.
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:36.662]  They're embedded in the local GOPs.
[03:01:36.662 --> 03:01:41.646]  They're everywhere, and they're blocking true conservative candidates, true patriots like myself,
[03:01:42.006 --> 03:01:49.732]  From getting elected and they're doing lots of dirty tricks to block them and to smear them and to make it almost impossible for them to win.
[03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:53.535]  So I just want to make that clear that, you know, they really are everywhere.
[03:01:53.535 --> 03:01:54.656]  The Rhino is real.
[03:01:54.656 --> 03:01:57.017]  The Rhino is strong and we've got to defeat them.
[03:01:57.017 --> 03:02:00.260]  And I love this public execution of Mitt Romney right now.
[03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:02.380]  We need to stand strong as patriots.
[03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:05.801]  We cannot let Nancy Pelosi and the rest of them continue to win.
[03:02:05.801 --> 03:02:14.143]  And again, whether your bold way of being a patriot and fighting this culture war is running for office, go for it.
[03:02:14.143 --> 03:02:15.423]  Or support a candidate.
[03:02:15.423 --> 03:02:16.824]  Donate to a candidate.
[03:02:16.824 --> 03:02:21.845]  Do something that's going to get you off your butt and actually fight for this country because we have one shot at it left.
[03:02:22.205 --> 03:02:23.247]  We really do.
[03:02:23.247 --> 03:02:28.578]  We're at a crossroads right now, and God willing, we're going to get another chance, and we're going to save America.
[03:02:28.578 --> 03:02:32.185]  But we truly have to fight right now, and we've got to work together and not be silent.
[03:02:33.797 --> 03:02:34.677]  Well, absolutely.
[03:02:34.677 --> 03:02:37.219]  The globalists had won so long because we were asleep.
[03:02:37.219 --> 03:02:39.640]  Now that people are partially awake, they're like, why aren't we winning?
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:41.181]  Just do the same thing we did before.
[03:02:41.181 --> 03:02:46.604]  People see this incredible evil in the WikiLeaks saying, let's cause race war.
[03:02:46.604 --> 03:02:48.785]  And I'm not kissing minorities' asses, OK?
[03:02:48.785 --> 03:02:51.466]  Because there's some that are racist and have problems, just like whites.
[03:02:51.466 --> 03:02:54.528]  But it's not brown people and black people I find that...
[03:02:55.728 --> 03:03:02.811]  It's a bunch of weird whites that want to be the rulers, who are trying to have a corporate takeover, a social takeover.
[03:03:02.811 --> 03:03:04.912]  And I think people are just rejecting it.
[03:03:04.912 --> 03:03:08.774]  They're like, America ain't perfect, but it's not as bad as you're saying.
[03:03:08.774 --> 03:03:14.357]  And then it gets so more intense, and then we're going to sexualize your children.
[03:03:14.357 --> 03:03:16.998]  And people are just like, man, I don't want to be part of this.
[03:03:16.998 --> 03:03:19.279]  So I think things have really blown up in their face.
[03:03:20.290 --> 03:03:22.291]  Yeah, they're totally overplaying their hand here.
[03:03:22.291 --> 03:03:24.733]  This is Marxism, though, at full display.
[03:03:24.733 --> 03:03:26.474]  This is the full manifestation of the plan.
[03:03:26.474 --> 03:03:27.795]  Social Marxism.
[03:03:27.795 --> 03:03:29.116]  Of the Marxist agenda, right?
[03:03:29.116 --> 03:03:31.677]  They're dividing the men and women, right?
[03:03:31.677 --> 03:03:35.280]  They're dividing us by races, by gender, now by sexuality.
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:37.461]  They're breaking up the family unit.
[03:03:37.461 --> 03:03:40.403]  They're causing people to no longer even reproduce anymore and get married.
[03:03:40.403 --> 03:03:42.905]  So we can't unify around prosperity and decency.
[03:03:43.752 --> 03:03:45.113]  Yep, exactly.
[03:03:45.113 --> 03:03:48.134]  And we can't let the Marxists take over.
[03:03:48.134 --> 03:03:59.481]  There's going to be a whole new flood of AOCs going around that are going to be elected into office if we're not careful and we don't fight and we don't have true patriots be courageous enough to put themselves in the fire.
[03:04:00.001 --> 03:04:01.923]  America must awaken.
[03:04:01.923 --> 03:04:03.924]  Alright, one final segment out of Matt Bracken.
[03:04:03.924 --> 03:04:07.627]  We're going to talk to Nathan, Eric, and James in 60 seconds.
[03:04:07.627 --> 03:04:11.130]  When we come back, what is the best place for people to visit?
[03:04:11.130 --> 03:04:15.253]  DeannaForCongress.com or Twitter, DeannaForCongress.
[03:04:15.253 --> 03:04:15.914]  What's the best place?
[03:04:17.042 --> 03:04:17.563]  Go to both.
[03:04:17.563 --> 03:04:19.144]  Go to diana4congress.com.
[03:04:19.144 --> 03:04:20.005]  Please donate.
[03:04:20.005 --> 03:04:23.309]  We need lots of funds to beat this Goliath, but we can do it.
[03:04:23.309 --> 03:04:24.290]  We just need it.
[03:04:24.290 --> 03:04:26.693]  And then go to my Twitter, of course, where all the action is.
[03:04:26.693 --> 03:04:28.295]  Diana4Congress.
[03:04:28.295 --> 03:04:29.176]  Lots of action.
[03:04:29.176 --> 03:04:31.098]  Follow all the campaign updates.
[03:04:31.098 --> 03:04:34.962]  And I love you guys, and I appreciate you guys so much.
[03:04:34.962 --> 03:04:35.883]  And I want to expand on that.
[03:04:36.789 --> 03:04:42.993]  Trust in God, but type your camels, the old Bedouin saying, God wants us to take action and dial to the rest.
[03:04:42.993 --> 03:04:47.115]  But God wants to see everybody join together and take action.
[03:04:47.115 --> 03:04:50.958]  Back in 60 seconds as humanity begins to awaken and fight back.
[03:04:52.961 --> 03:04:57.084]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[03:04:57.084 --> 03:04:59.005]  You don't want my thanks.
[03:04:59.005 --> 03:05:02.767]  You want victory over the Globalists and these devil worship and child molesters.
[03:05:02.767 --> 03:05:04.949]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[03:05:04.949 --> 03:05:06.150]  And you know what?
[03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:09.432]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[03:05:09.432 --> 03:05:18.758]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the Globalists.
[03:05:18.758 --> 03:05:20.159]  Because I'm committed to a future
[03:05:21.192 --> 03:05:22.473]  For humanity.
[03:05:22.473 --> 03:05:24.114]  And I know you are as well.
[03:05:24.114 --> 03:05:32.221]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Infowar and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[03:05:32.221 --> 03:05:40.908]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[03:05:41.949 --> 03:05:43.590]  You have made history.
[03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:45.452]  We have made history together.
[03:05:45.452 --> 03:05:50.036]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you.
[03:05:50.036 --> 03:06:03.287]  And I suggest you use it.
[03:06:03.287 --> 03:06:08.232]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.640 --> 03:06:34.462]  We are live broadcasting worldwide.
[03:06:34.462 --> 03:06:37.604]  We're going to finish up with your calls and our guests here in a moment.
[03:06:37.604 --> 03:06:39.765]  Matt Bracken is about to take over.
[03:06:39.765 --> 03:06:44.748]  But I wanted to point this out to everybody right now because it's really, really important.
[03:06:44.748 --> 03:06:52.213]  A bellwether of how serious the coronavirus is, is the fact that storable food all over the United States has sold out.
[03:06:53.095 --> 03:07:03.000]  Other than My Patriot Supply, which is now the biggest food distributor in the country after 12 years because they're trusted, they keep a massive stockpile on hand, and they deliver when they say they will.
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.582]  That's why they're my sponsor.
[03:07:05.582 --> 03:07:11.865]  And they have told you 7 to 10 days the last 10 weeks, guaranteed you order, you get it, 7 to 10 days.
[03:07:11.865 --> 03:07:16.868]  Now they called this morning, I have their statement right here, and they said, we've got to say
[03:07:18.184 --> 03:07:31.893]  10 to 14 now, even though it's like 9 to 12 because the orders are intensifying and we said no to institutional buyers, big corporations and the government actually bought up everywhere else.
[03:07:31.893 --> 03:07:35.055]  But we're having to hire even more people and trying to buy forward to get the food.
[03:07:36.052 --> 03:07:45.695]  They have the food for everybody now who gets orders in to make sure that you get it within the 10 to 14 days now, but now it's been extended out.
[03:07:45.695 --> 03:07:50.296]  You put your order in before, it's 7 to 10 is taken care of.
[03:07:50.296 --> 03:07:54.838]  They have high quality, affordable food that is being packaged as we speak.
[03:07:54.838 --> 03:08:01.480]  They have plenty of food for another couple weeks right now, but it's the packaging, it's the preparing, and it's that whole process that takes place.
[03:08:02.611 --> 03:08:06.232]  So again, InfoWarsTore.com will take you right there.
[03:08:06.232 --> 03:08:07.092]  They're in our system.
[03:08:07.092 --> 03:08:08.932]  We're partnered with them for more than a decade.
[03:08:08.932 --> 03:08:10.773]  The orders go right out as they come in.
[03:08:10.773 --> 03:08:14.373]  You get the best deals from my Patriot at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:08:14.373 --> 03:08:17.514]  Because they have a lot of distributors as well that they're also supplying.
[03:08:17.514 --> 03:08:25.736]  But I can tell you there's been big shakeups and big fights over the fact that I've got deals where my listeners get the very best deals from a group that already gives you the best deals that are out there.
[03:08:25.736 --> 03:08:27.216]  So this is the best of the best.
[03:08:27.216 --> 03:08:28.616]  You should get prepared.
[03:08:28.616 --> 03:08:30.957]  Regardless, it's good to have swearable food you can eat.
[03:08:30.957 --> 03:08:31.757]  It's insurance you can eat.
[03:08:32.077 --> 03:08:32.638]  We're good to go.
[03:08:32.638 --> 03:08:33.258]  We're good to go.
[03:08:33.258 --> 03:08:34.760]  We're good to go.
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:35.340]  We're good to go.
[03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:35.861]  We're good to go.
[03:08:35.861 --> 03:08:36.261]  We're good to go.
[03:08:36.261 --> 03:08:36.802]  We're good to go.
[03:08:36.802 --> 03:08:37.322]  We're good to go.
[03:08:37.322 --> 03:08:38.043]  We're good to go.
[03:08:38.043 --> 03:08:38.443]  We're good to go.
[03:08:38.443 --> 03:08:38.944]  We're good to go.
[03:08:38.944 --> 03:08:39.284]  We're good to go.
[03:08:39.284 --> 03:08:39.684]  We're good to go.
[03:08:39.684 --> 03:08:40.345]  We're good to go.
[03:08:40.345 --> 03:08:41.046]  We're good to go.
[03:08:41.046 --> 03:08:41.506]  We're good to go.
[03:08:41.506 --> 03:08:42.387]  We're good to go.
[03:08:42.387 --> 03:08:42.867]  We're good to go.
[03:08:42.867 --> 03:08:43.228]  We're good to go.
[03:08:43.228 --> 03:08:43.608]  We're good to go.
[03:08:43.608 --> 03:08:44.429]  We're good to go.
[03:08:44.429 --> 03:08:44.989]  We're good to go.
[03:08:44.989 --> 03:08:45.450]  We're good to go.
[03:08:45.450 --> 03:08:45.830]  We're good to go.
[03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:46.270]  We're good to go.
[03:08:46.270 --> 03:08:46.671]  We're good to go.
[03:08:46.671 --> 03:08:47.011]  We're good to go.
[03:08:47.011 --> 03:08:47.632]  We're good to go.
[03:08:47.632 --> 03:08:47.992]  We're good to go.
[03:08:47.992 --> 03:08:48.833]  We're good to go.
[03:08:48.833 --> 03:08:49.273]  We're good to go.
[03:08:49.273 --> 03:08:49.934]  We're good to go.
[03:08:49.934 --> 03:08:50.454]  We're good to go.
[03:08:50.454 --> 03:08:51.335]  We're good to go.
[03:08:51.335 --> 03:08:51.796]  We're good to go.
[03:08:51.796 --> 03:08:52.296]  We're good to go.
[03:08:52.296 --> 03:08:52.917]  We're good to go.
[03:08:52.917 --> 03:08:53.017]  We're
[03:08:53.976 --> 03:08:58.459]  All right, let's take three final calls with our guest who's running against Nancy Pelosi.
[03:08:58.459 --> 03:09:00.860]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathan in Michigan.
[03:09:00.860 --> 03:09:02.962]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:09:02.962 --> 03:09:03.662]  Hello?
[03:09:03.662 --> 03:09:05.503]  Yes, sir.
[03:09:05.503 --> 03:09:07.464]  Alex, good to talk to you.
[03:09:07.464 --> 03:09:12.247]  I wanted to say about Trump, what's going on with him rolling out 5G?
[03:09:14.321 --> 03:09:18.044]  I totally agree that it's toxic, it's bad, it spies on you.
[03:09:18.044 --> 03:09:23.527]  The shycom shouldn't have it and Israel who invented it have banned it and other European countries are banning it.
[03:09:23.527 --> 03:09:26.469]  What the hell are we doing?
[03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:34.474]  Yeah, the one positive thing, other thing I wanted to say about Trump is everyone says he's literally Hitler.
[03:09:34.474 --> 03:09:39.498]  He's the only person right now standing up against anti-Semitism with the
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:42.342]  I'm right now going to Henry Ford Community College.
[03:09:42.342 --> 03:09:45.324]  I know you know Henry Ford received a medal from Adolf Hitler.
[03:09:45.324 --> 03:09:49.347]  And I'm actually, I claim, I wasn't able to present and turn in my work in a class here
[03:10:08.760 --> 03:10:19.174]  Because it was about how, you know, Jews were prosecuted by Hitler and how racism, you know, people with white skin still were victims of Nazism.
[03:10:19.853 --> 03:10:23.334]  And I actually think I might be part Jewish.
[03:10:23.334 --> 03:10:25.995]  I told them that, and they actually didn't follow me.
[03:10:25.995 --> 03:10:27.075]  There's a dialectic.
[03:10:27.075 --> 03:10:35.477]  You have powerful Jews, like the Rothschilds, funding anti-Semitism to create a dialectic where the Jews go, then work for the left.
[03:10:35.477 --> 03:10:36.538]  It's very sophisticated.
[03:10:36.538 --> 03:10:38.358]  That's why the Rothschilds are so powerful.
[03:10:38.358 --> 03:10:39.919]  It's very evil.
[03:10:39.919 --> 03:10:42.119]  But you're absolutely right, and I'm glad you raised that.
[03:10:42.119 --> 03:10:43.380]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:10:43.380 --> 03:10:44.700]  You want to comment on that?
[03:10:45.911 --> 03:10:48.014]  Oh, it's just, it is very, very sophisticated.
[03:10:48.014 --> 03:10:52.619]  It's actually crazy how intelligent these people are, how intelligent the elites are.
[03:10:52.619 --> 03:10:53.721]  They're not dumb.
[03:10:53.721 --> 03:11:02.932]  They believe that we're dumb, but they're very sophisticated in their indoctrination methods, in their social engineering methods, and in the way they roll things out.
[03:11:03.653 --> 03:11:08.698]  Well, and I also think that, you know, this is something that I think that we need to do as conservatives.
[03:11:08.698 --> 03:11:23.133]  If President Trump goes against something that raises an eyebrow with us, or he's pro something like 5G, right, or red flag laws or something like that, you know, I think that we should be okay to speak out about that and critique him.
[03:11:23.133 --> 03:11:27.217]  I think that he needs to know that his base does not like that, that that's not right.
[03:11:28.177 --> 03:11:32.879]  And we can't just always be a 24-7 cheerleader, and our patriot friends need to understand... I totally agree.
[03:11:32.879 --> 03:11:34.300]  We're not a Democrat cult.
[03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:36.000]  Eric in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.061]  Go ahead.
[03:11:38.061 --> 03:11:38.741]  Hi, Alex.
[03:11:38.741 --> 03:11:40.922]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:11:40.922 --> 03:11:47.385]  I tuned into the President's speech this morning, and in the back of my mind I was thinking, you know, there were a lot of surprises in the State of the Union.
[03:11:47.385 --> 03:11:53.347]  Maybe we'd get a surprise this morning and hear about a pardon for Roger Stone, General Flynn, Paul Manafort.
[03:11:54.028 --> 03:11:57.351]  Um, obviously we didn't get that, but what do you think?
[03:11:57.351 --> 03:12:03.876]  Do you think that it's possible that now impeachment is concluded, we might possibly get some action there?
[03:12:03.876 --> 03:12:05.057]  My answer is we better.
[03:12:05.057 --> 03:12:05.677]  And I agree.
[03:12:05.677 --> 03:12:06.978]  The San Diego was so powerful.
[03:12:06.978 --> 03:12:09.760]  I'm going to re-air clip seven tomorrow on the Friday show.
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:12.843]  That was like a hundred percent a plus.
[03:12:12.843 --> 03:12:14.124]  And this was kind of like, yeah.
[03:12:14.564 --> 03:12:14.905]  I think so.
[03:12:29.957 --> 03:12:33.898]  I don't want to collapse on the side getting some Gatorades.
[03:12:33.898 --> 03:12:36.459]  I don't want to say, you know, put the President down.
[03:12:36.459 --> 03:12:38.640]  He's 73 years old, folks.
[03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:42.501]  I'm 45 and I work hard and I have to like gut up and come in here and do this show sometimes.
[03:12:42.501 --> 03:12:45.182]  So, I don't want to 100% judge the President.
[03:12:45.182 --> 03:12:46.863]  You want to comment on that, Ms.
[03:12:46.863 --> 03:12:47.183]  Lorraine?
[03:12:48.024 --> 03:12:50.205]  Yeah, you know, I've seen better performances by him.
[03:12:50.205 --> 03:12:55.967]  Obviously, it took a lot of energy to do the State of the Union, and he takes so many slings and arrows every single day.
[03:12:55.967 --> 03:12:58.248]  I can't imagine what he goes through with the whole impeachment process.
[03:12:58.248 --> 03:13:00.909]  Oh yeah, the average person couldn't do a State of the Union in their life.
[03:13:00.909 --> 03:13:02.730]  I mean, this guy's done a lot.
[03:13:02.730 --> 03:13:07.552]  We can't just expect our heavyweight champion to just have bouts every week.
[03:13:07.552 --> 03:13:08.212]  I mean, every day.
[03:13:09.412 --> 03:13:14.994]  Yeah, I think that we just have such high expectations of him because he's like this miracle man, this work of art.
[03:13:14.994 --> 03:13:17.015]  How does he stay so energetic?
[03:13:17.015 --> 03:13:21.657]  How does he stay so energetic and just so able to bounce off these attacks like this?
[03:13:21.657 --> 03:13:25.518]  So if he's a little lower energy sometimes, I'm going to give him a pass for that.
[03:13:25.518 --> 03:13:27.759]  Exactly, Eric, thank you and we love you.
[03:13:27.759 --> 03:13:31.340]  James in Canada, last caller, go ahead.
[03:13:31.340 --> 03:13:33.141]  Hey, Alex.
[03:13:33.141 --> 03:13:33.781]  Hello?
[03:13:33.781 --> 03:13:34.041]  Yes, sir.
[03:13:35.086 --> 03:13:57.520]  Yeah, um, yeah, now this coronavirus, I kind of gotten a little worried up here because, well, as you know, we've got No Brains Trudeau, and they're actually bringing Canadians back from China that are stuck in where this outbreak started.
[03:14:00.365 --> 03:14:01.806]  No, I stocked up.
[03:14:01.806 --> 03:14:08.149]  Thankfully, listening to you, I stocked up on the silver toothpaste, the immune gargle and the wound gel.
[03:14:08.149 --> 03:14:15.713]  And well, your hand cream works wonders for my wife and her psoriasis, but definitely trying to keep the immune system up.
[03:14:16.752 --> 03:14:17.813]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[03:14:17.813 --> 03:14:34.128]  I didn't get to this Mike Adams article, naturalnews.com, and I'm going to let our guest go, then I'm going to come back and finish up with you, James, and I'm going to hit this article, China launches biological warfare agenda, covertly infiltrates Wuhan, evacuation plane with Trojan horse carrier, the coronavirus infects all passengers headed to Taiwan.
[03:14:34.128 --> 03:14:35.169]  This is confirmed stuff.
[03:14:35.169 --> 03:14:39.574]  So we're going to come back to you and finish up with that as Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:14:40.174 --> 03:14:44.758]  I want to thank our guest Deanna Lorraine for coming on the broadcast.
[03:14:44.758 --> 03:14:47.441]  You should check her out with DeannaForCongress.com.
[03:14:47.441 --> 03:14:49.323]  Thank you so much for all you do and we love you.
[03:14:49.323 --> 03:14:51.445]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:14:51.445 --> 03:14:52.165]  I love you back.
[03:14:52.165 --> 03:14:54.527]  You guys are amazing and thank you, InfoWarriors.
[03:14:54.527 --> 03:14:55.728]  Let's fight.
[03:14:55.728 --> 03:14:57.470]  Let's win in the primary.
[03:14:57.470 --> 03:14:57.991]  Absolutely.
[03:14:57.991 --> 03:14:59.031]  God bless you.
[03:14:59.031 --> 03:15:00.493]  Real quick, we've got 30 seconds.
[03:15:00.493 --> 03:15:02.635]  I'm hearing you're about to pull some big stunts on Pelosi.
[03:15:02.635 --> 03:15:04.897]  You've got the airplane in the air, but you've got a lot more you're doing.
[03:15:05.788 --> 03:15:08.990]  Yeah, I got the airplane in the air right now as we speak.
[03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:10.631]  Pelosi for prison.
[03:15:10.631 --> 03:15:12.773]  It's triggering liberals right now.
[03:15:12.773 --> 03:15:14.274]  It's making liberals' head explode.
[03:15:14.274 --> 03:15:20.859]  So go to my website at pelosi4prison.co, sign the petition, and get a t-shirt, Pelosi for prison.
[03:15:20.859 --> 03:15:24.601]  Rock it, it's awesome, and show your support to get her the hell out of there.
[03:15:24.601 --> 03:15:25.282]  Let's do this.
[03:15:26.118 --> 03:15:27.179]  All right, thank you very much.
[03:15:27.179 --> 03:15:28.200]  Pelosi4Prison.co.
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:33.466]  All right, we're going to come back, hit these final stories, finish the caller, and Matt Bracken will take over.
[03:15:33.466 --> 03:15:34.807]  Then, the War Room.
[03:15:34.807 --> 03:15:35.368]  He's ready.
[03:15:35.368 --> 03:15:37.070]  He's fired up.
[03:15:37.070 --> 03:15:38.972]  He's a political prisoner set free.
[03:15:38.972 --> 03:15:46.580]  Owen Schroeder and the War Room, coming up in T-minus 45 minutes from now.
[03:15:46.580 --> 03:15:47.120]  Stay with us.
[03:15:47.120 --> 03:15:47.581]  We'll be back.

[03:16:02.795 --> 03:16:10.521]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[03:16:10.521 --> 03:16:18.407]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[03:16:18.547 --> 03:16:20.348]  Not a security IPO or note.
[03:16:20.348 --> 03:16:29.874]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[03:16:51.408 --> 03:16:55.271]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:16:55.271 --> 03:17:00.275]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:17:00.275 --> 03:17:05.098]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[03:17:05.098 --> 03:17:06.439]  Don't just take my word for it.

[03:17:18.848 --> 03:17:21.410]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:21.410 --> 03:17:22.631]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:22.631 --> 03:17:26.553]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:26.553 --> 03:17:28.094]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:28.094 --> 03:17:30.596]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:31.036 --> 03:17:36.597]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:36.597 --> 03:17:37.797]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:37.797 --> 03:17:40.738]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:40.738 --> 03:17:42.959]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:42.959 --> 03:17:47.399]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:47.399 --> 03:17:52.701]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:52.701 --> 03:17:54.421]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[03:17:54.421 --> 03:17:56.541]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[03:17:56.541 --> 03:17:58.302]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[03:17:58.302 --> 03:17:59.182]  But I'll be honest with you.
[03:18:00.017 --> 03:18:05.367]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[03:18:05.367 --> 03:18:07.250]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[03:18:07.250 --> 03:18:08.553]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[03:18:08.553 --> 03:18:09.294]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:18:10.307 --> 03:18:11.768]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[03:18:11.768 --> 03:18:14.469]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:15.629]  I don't want them to win.
[03:18:15.629 --> 03:18:18.551]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[03:18:18.551 --> 03:18:21.652]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[03:18:21.652 --> 03:18:24.813]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[03:18:24.813 --> 03:18:28.615]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[03:18:28.615 --> 03:18:30.176]  These will change your life.
[03:18:30.176 --> 03:18:31.596]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[03:18:31.596 --> 03:18:33.597]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[03:18:33.597 --> 03:18:34.278]  Check it all out.
[03:18:34.278 --> 03:18:36.239]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[03:18:36.239 --> 03:18:38.019]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[03:18:38.019 --> 03:18:39.220]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:40.961]  Get great products at the same time.
[03:18:40.961 --> 03:18:43.443]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[03:18:43.443 --> 03:18:45.624]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements.
[03:18:45.624 --> 03:18:52.629]  Take action now and fund the InfoWars for your own future.
[03:18:52.629 --> 03:18:58.473]  I wanted to talk about SuperSilver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[03:18:58.473 --> 03:19:02.016]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[03:19:02.016 --> 03:19:04.317]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[03:19:04.317 --> 03:19:06.159]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[03:19:06.159 --> 03:19:07.740]  So here I am telling people.
[03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:13.724]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[03:19:13.724 --> 03:19:14.965]  And I'm 45 years old.
[03:19:14.965 --> 03:19:16.926]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[03:19:16.926 --> 03:19:18.647]  And it's fluoride-free.
[03:19:18.647 --> 03:19:21.889]  I think the big difference, the game-changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[03:19:21.889 --> 03:19:25.492]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[03:19:25.492 --> 03:19:30.175]  And the toothpaste, I don't even rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[03:19:30.175 --> 03:19:32.556]  It feels so good.
[03:19:32.556 --> 03:19:35.618]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[03:19:35.618 --> 03:19:37.920]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:41.801]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[03:19:41.801 --> 03:19:55.824]  Because I like the way it feels.
[03:19:55.824 --> 03:19:58.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.766 --> 03:20:20.312]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with an emergency alert from naturalnews.com posted up on infowars.com.
[03:20:20.312 --> 03:20:30.442]  China launches biological warfare agenda, covertly infiltrates Wuhan evacuation plane with Trojan horse carrier of the coronavirus to infect all passengers headed to Taiwan.
[03:20:30.442 --> 03:20:31.443]  Why is that so important?
[03:20:31.443 --> 03:20:35.467]  China has always said they have too many people, they don't care if they're in a nuclear war.
[03:20:35.467 --> 03:20:36.708]  So they infect their own people.
[03:20:36.708 --> 03:20:37.448]  Why would they do that?
[03:20:37.448 --> 03:20:38.710]  Use them as carriers then.
[03:20:40.248 --> 03:20:42.074]  In a 12 monkey scenario.
[03:20:42.074 --> 03:20:47.830]  Tall national security personnel reading this from Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Canada, the US, Russia, and other nations.
[03:20:48.493 --> 03:20:51.134]  You will want to urgently forward this to your commanding officers.
[03:20:51.134 --> 03:21:09.339]  This story is verified and true, confirmed through our Taiwan investigators to indicate a dangerous global escalation of the warfare tactics by a lawless authoritarian regime that you already know has been dispatching spies to your countries, stealing intellectual property and infiltrating your universities, governments and military weapons research institutions.
[03:21:09.339 --> 03:21:13.540]  China's endgame goal is world domination and there is no weaponry they won't deploy to achieve it.
[03:21:15.253 --> 03:21:40.668]  On the heels of the bombshell revelation that China has been engineering an offensive biological warfare weapon, the accidental escape of BSL-4 facilities and launching a global pandemic, we are now getting confirmation from our investigators in Taiwan that China, his wife from Taiwan, he speaks fluent Chinese, has deployed a biological warfare attack against Taiwan by seeding an evacuation flight from Taiwan's citizens with an infected Trojan horse human weapon.
[03:21:41.488 --> 03:21:44.590]  Was contaminated the entire evacuation flight.
[03:21:44.590 --> 03:21:49.553]  This is a damning escalation of the tensions between the Communist China and the Taiwanese coronavirus pandemic.
[03:21:49.553 --> 03:21:51.395]  And it goes on for page after page.
[03:21:51.395 --> 03:21:52.075]  It's dead on.
[03:21:52.075 --> 03:21:54.357]  Let me explain something right now.
[03:21:54.357 --> 03:22:02.902]  The head of the UN World Health Organization program said China's done a great job killing people at checkpoints, locking them up, mass graves, burning bodies.
[03:22:02.902 --> 03:22:03.623]  But if the U.S.
[03:22:03.623 --> 03:22:06.605]  says no flights, that's xenophobic and evil and bad.
[03:22:06.605 --> 03:22:08.766]  We should take flights from China.
[03:22:08.766 --> 03:22:09.507]  This is unbelievable.
[03:22:11.892 --> 03:22:14.294]  The NCOV coronavirus is out of control.
[03:22:14.294 --> 03:22:18.058]  Mainstream media, experts warn, world prepare for global spread.
[03:22:18.058 --> 03:22:20.560]  Everything we told you weeks ago is now being confirmed.
[03:22:20.560 --> 03:22:25.565]  The WHO sends out 250,000 test kits for pandemic that its own leaders now say isn't real.
[03:22:26.937 --> 03:22:28.438]  That is just some of the news we've got.
[03:22:28.438 --> 03:22:32.661]  Matt Bracken is about to take over, but this is very, very serious information.
[03:22:32.661 --> 03:22:36.163]  We'll be covering it more tomorrow on the Friday Show.
[03:22:36.163 --> 03:22:38.784]  James in Canada wanted to point this out.
[03:22:38.784 --> 03:22:43.087]  The lack of government response on the surface, but behind the scenes, there's a major response.
[03:22:43.087 --> 03:22:45.108]  What do you think's happening?
[03:22:45.108 --> 03:22:53.593]  Well, honestly, Alex, I honestly think that they're trying to set up chaos up here in Canada, to be perfectly honest.
[03:22:53.593 --> 03:22:54.834]  They're flying these people in.
[03:22:56.211 --> 03:23:09.638]  Apparently they're even taking a jet from you guys, too, and they're going to be dropping people off in Vancouver and then bringing them here to Ontario, to our largest Air Force base in Trenton, Ontario, and they're going to quarantine them there.
[03:23:09.638 --> 03:23:16.261]  But from there, like Trenton's about maybe 50 miles from our largest
[03:23:20.038 --> 03:23:23.759]  Sorry, I'm having a little bit of a brain fart going on here.
[03:23:23.759 --> 03:23:30.020]  The point is, why the hell are we flying people in from all over the world to Canada and the U.S.?
[03:23:30.020 --> 03:23:48.645]  Well, exactly, and 50 miles from our quarantine and 50 miles from our largest population center, which is Toronto, and I live 30 miles outside of that, and I'm wondering, you know, do I kind of bug out to my parents' farm now, or what am I going to do?
[03:23:49.127 --> 03:23:53.012]  Well, I think if it starts spreading, which it already is, that's something people got to think about.
[03:23:53.012 --> 03:23:54.453]  We're sheltering in place.
[03:23:54.453 --> 03:23:55.014]  God bless you.
[03:23:55.014 --> 03:23:55.775]  I appreciate your call.
[03:23:55.775 --> 03:23:57.336]  That's why I wanted to cover that article.
[03:23:57.336 --> 03:23:58.438]  I meant to lead with this.
[03:23:58.438 --> 03:24:00.660]  Mike Adams sent this to me at like 2 a.m.
[03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:02.502]  I woke up at like 4 a.m.
[03:24:02.502 --> 03:24:03.063]  and read this.
[03:24:03.063 --> 03:24:04.144]  I meant to lead the show with it.
[03:24:04.144 --> 03:24:06.127]  I just didn't, but it's on InfoWars.com.
[03:24:06.627 --> 03:24:09.969]  Hopefully the War Room will lead with that because it is big news.
[03:24:09.969 --> 03:24:13.871]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, bestselling author, researcher, takes over right now.
[03:24:13.871 --> 03:24:15.172]  We appreciate Matt Bracken.
[03:24:15.172 --> 03:24:16.032]  We got to all the calls.
[03:24:16.032 --> 03:24:17.473]  I want to say the crew did a great job.
[03:24:17.473 --> 03:24:19.634]  War Room is 35 minutes away.
[03:24:19.634 --> 03:24:22.856]  Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:24:22.856 --> 03:24:24.737]  Okay, Alex, thanks a lot.
[03:24:24.737 --> 03:24:26.198]  Jeez, where do you start today?
[03:24:26.198 --> 03:24:32.461]  Do you start with the impeachment drama or the coming pandemic drama?
[03:24:32.461 --> 03:24:35.343]  It's one of those weeks and we've been having a lot of them.
[03:24:36.344 --> 03:24:40.787]  I think I'm going to start with impeachment because it's fresh in everybody's mind.
[03:24:40.787 --> 03:24:46.590]  Everybody saw Nancy Pelosi and then followed by President Trump.
[03:24:46.590 --> 03:24:58.378]  And my wife, who's an RN, she thought he might have been, he's pretty subdued, possibly medicated, as even Nancy Pelosi, I think, noted.
[03:24:58.378 --> 03:24:59.618]  He has been going through a lot.
[03:24:59.618 --> 03:25:00.119]  The man is 75.
[03:25:03.223 --> 03:25:07.667]  We can only imagine what kind of pressure he's under and the medical consequences.
[03:25:07.667 --> 03:25:20.257]  He actually said in his speech in the East Room that what he's been through in the last three years would have broken any other president, and I pretty much have to believe that.
[03:25:20.257 --> 03:25:23.720]  And I have kind of a different take on this.
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:32.707]  As soon as the speech was over, I flipped to CNN and MSNBC, and their take on it was completely different, you know, logically, than ours.
[03:25:33.709 --> 03:25:37.452]  They consider it a declaration of war.
[03:25:37.452 --> 03:25:40.934]  Chris Matthews called it a war cry.
[03:25:40.934 --> 03:25:43.816]  And I kind of saw it that way, too.
[03:25:43.816 --> 03:25:52.702]  This wasn't the day where he was going to come out and pardon General Flynn, which is warranted, or Roger Stone, which is warranted.
[03:25:52.702 --> 03:26:00.167]  He did mention offhandedly, he did say that people that came to help after his election had their lives ruined.
[03:26:00.831 --> 03:26:01.131]  I think?
[03:26:19.858 --> 03:26:25.402]  And today was the day when he was, he was recognizing his key warriors.
[03:26:25.402 --> 03:26:31.087]  And the reason for that is, I liken this to a halftime locker room speech.
[03:26:31.087 --> 03:26:32.408]  The fight's not over.
[03:26:32.408 --> 03:26:36.931]  You know, he has to get reelected in order to keep draining the swamp.
[03:26:36.931 --> 03:26:42.596]  If he's not reelected, if something happens between now and November, you know, pandemic, market crash,
[03:26:43.228 --> 03:26:44.729]  And he's blamed for it.
[03:26:44.729 --> 03:26:48.070]  We could wind up with a President Bernie Sanders.
[03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:55.092]  It seems impossible, but maybe people thought that Trump being elected was impossible.
[03:26:55.092 --> 03:26:59.874]  Remember how they all laughed on the Bill Maher Show, except for Ann Coulter.
[03:27:00.470 --> 03:27:03.933]  So crazy things have been happening in this era and nothing can be ruled out.
[03:27:03.933 --> 03:27:05.454]  He needs to be reelected.
[03:27:05.454 --> 03:27:11.919]  So this is like the halftime locker room speech to his troops to go out there and keep fighting.
[03:27:11.919 --> 03:27:17.884]  And by recognizing his key warriors, he's bucking them up for the fight to come.
[03:27:17.884 --> 03:27:26.451]  And he's also, I think, trying to motivate the players that might be hanging back still.
[03:27:26.451 --> 03:27:29.974]  You know, he's got a much stronger team going into the second half.
[03:27:30.495 --> 03:27:38.179]  Because the first half, he had to weed out all of the moles and backstabbers that were sent in on him.
[03:27:38.179 --> 03:27:41.121]  Because, you know, the word was out, nobody should work for Trump.
[03:27:41.121 --> 03:27:45.323]  He wound up taking people like Bolton, McMaster, Tillerson.
[03:27:45.323 --> 03:27:48.325]  You know, these people were not on his side.
[03:27:48.325 --> 03:27:50.626]  And now he's got a much stronger team.
[03:27:50.626 --> 03:27:59.271]  Well, on MSNBC, Chris Matthews was looking, looked shaken because he said he not only was recognizing his troops,
[03:27:59.864 --> 03:28:04.139]  But he repeatedly called the other side, you know, enemies.
[03:28:04.750 --> 03:28:08.112]  And dirty cops, and evil.
[03:28:08.112 --> 03:28:09.413]  He called them geniuses.
[03:28:09.413 --> 03:28:13.275]  He said, imagine what they could have done if they'd been working constructively.
[03:28:13.275 --> 03:28:17.597]  He said, they're geniuses, but they're evil, and something has to be done.
[03:28:17.597 --> 03:28:20.979]  You know, he briefly mentioned Barr.
[03:28:20.979 --> 03:28:23.361]  He never mentioned Ciaramella.
[03:28:23.361 --> 03:28:28.804]  He did mention, in a disparaging way, Lieutenant Colonel Vindeman.
[03:28:28.804 --> 03:28:32.666]  And he could see he was leading towards the Misko and Ciaramella connection.
[03:28:33.286 --> 03:28:38.870]  But he didn't go there and he did mention and give kudos to Barr, but he didn't mention Durham.
[03:28:38.870 --> 03:28:43.894]  But several times he said this can't be allowed to happen again and something's got to be done.
[03:28:43.894 --> 03:28:47.376]  And we're going to explore this a little bit more on the other side of the break.
[03:28:47.376 --> 03:28:50.679]  You know, what I think Trump knows is coming that's going to be done.
[03:28:52.202 --> 03:28:55.223]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:55.223 --> 03:28:58.124]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:29:53.542 --> 03:30:04.229]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland Security to take out SARS, which is the same family as the corona virus.
[03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:07.391]  We have it in our super silver toothpaste.
[03:30:07.391 --> 03:30:09.353]  We have it in our super blue toothpaste.
[03:30:09.353 --> 03:30:12.355]  We have it in the immune gargle products.
[03:30:12.355 --> 03:30:16.297]  And of course, it's in the super silver wound gel that is sold nationally.
[03:30:16.297 --> 03:30:20.500]  We just private label it from the people that produce it, the nanotech company.
[03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:21.081]  I think so.
[03:30:40.504 --> 03:30:42.045]  This should really be easier than it is.
[03:30:42.045 --> 03:30:43.566]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[03:30:43.566 --> 03:30:44.826]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[03:30:44.826 --> 03:30:49.568]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see
[03:31:09.418 --> 03:31:09.658]  I hope so.
[03:31:32.501 --> 03:31:37.504]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[03:31:37.504 --> 03:31:45.189]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[03:31:45.189 --> 03:31:46.370]  It's amazing.
[03:31:46.370 --> 03:31:49.952]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[03:31:49.952 --> 03:31:51.353]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[03:31:52.708 --> 03:31:53.508]  Well, it's here.
[03:31:53.508 --> 03:31:54.448]  The year 2020.
[03:31:54.448 --> 03:31:56.429]  World governments out in the open.
[03:31:56.429 --> 03:32:00.870]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[03:32:00.870 --> 03:32:14.713]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[03:32:14.713 --> 03:32:14.913]  Wow.
[03:32:15.493 --> 03:32:16.994]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[03:32:16.994 --> 03:32:18.294]  The New World Order's real.
[03:32:18.294 --> 03:32:19.354]  Satanism's real.
[03:32:19.354 --> 03:32:20.695]  The pedophile elite are real.
[03:32:20.695 --> 03:32:24.556]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[03:32:24.556 --> 03:32:29.278]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[03:32:29.278 --> 03:32:32.839]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[03:32:32.839 --> 03:32:37.141]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[03:32:37.441 --> 03:32:39.782]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[03:32:39.782 --> 03:32:41.203]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:32:41.203 --> 03:32:44.144]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[03:32:44.144 --> 03:32:51.288]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of importrestore.com is critical.
[03:32:51.288 --> 03:32:55.850]  So please take action.
[03:32:55.850 --> 03:32:58.512]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.033 --> 03:33:17.375]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:33:17.375 --> 03:33:24.880]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:24.880 --> 03:33:33.966]  I see the old Animus Farm and Domestic website up and just a reminder, you know, you don't have to go to Amazon to get my books.
[03:33:33.966 --> 03:33:40.531]  You can get them directly from me and cut Jeff Bezos out of the formula, which I'd appreciate.
[03:33:41.198 --> 03:33:46.079]  But if you want them on audio or if you want them on Kindle, then Amazon is the way to go.
[03:33:46.079 --> 03:33:50.661]  Now, talking about Trump, my wife thought he looked sedated.
[03:33:50.661 --> 03:33:52.901]  I think he looked tired.
[03:33:52.901 --> 03:33:53.942]  I can't imagine.
[03:33:53.942 --> 03:34:00.243]  I mean, I'm a dozen or so years younger than him, and I can't imagine the week that he's had.
[03:34:00.243 --> 03:34:06.105]  You know, he's a guy who already is famous for getting by on almost no sleep.
[03:34:06.105 --> 03:34:09.026]  He's constantly calling people at, you know, one or two in the morning.
[03:34:09.699 --> 03:34:16.962]  He hasn't gone to bed, and he's the last one to go to bed, the first one up, so it's got to be taking a toll.
[03:34:16.962 --> 03:34:25.785]  And maybe now he's going to get some R&R while his warriors go out and carry the battle forward for a while.
[03:34:25.785 --> 03:34:30.807]  Hopefully he'll get something of a break, because I think that he needs it.
[03:34:31.693 --> 03:34:39.402]  But that said, now that he's been acquitted, I think in a great sense he's been inoculated against further attacks.
[03:34:39.402 --> 03:34:48.813]  He's going to be, once he recovers his energy, I think he's going to be a little bit more off the chain than he even has been because this inoculation effect
[03:34:49.551 --> 03:34:52.512]  Means that the Democrats are on their heels.
[03:34:52.512 --> 03:34:53.933]  They can't impeach him now.
[03:34:53.933 --> 03:34:55.113]  He made jokes about it.
[03:34:55.113 --> 03:34:59.415]  If he crosses, you know, if he crosses against the light, they're going to try to impeach him.
[03:34:59.415 --> 03:35:06.257]  So he's making it into a joke using the Olinsky, you know, ridicule is one of your best weapons.
[03:35:06.257 --> 03:35:13.260]  And at the same time, you have to look at the Democrat National Committee, the Democrat elites.
[03:35:13.260 --> 03:35:15.221]  They're in the middle of their own civil war.
[03:35:15.802 --> 03:35:22.027]  They can't put all of their attention against Trump, where they've just suffered a defeat with his acquittal.
[03:35:22.027 --> 03:35:35.017]  They're in the middle of their own internecine civil war between the AOC communist faction, and then they've got Trump on the right.
[03:35:35.017 --> 03:35:38.379]  They've got the communists on the left and Trump on the right.
[03:35:38.379 --> 03:35:40.280]  What we're watching from coming out of Iowa,
[03:35:41.528 --> 03:35:43.790]  Is a real joke.
[03:35:43.790 --> 03:35:56.199]  I mean, they took over that caucus counting because I think it's clear Bernie probably would have, you know, for sure he would have won over Pete Buttigieg.
[03:35:56.199 --> 03:36:02.603]  He would have won and it might have been like 30 to 20 with Biden in single digits.
[03:36:02.603 --> 03:36:08.588]  And this would have been a complete disaster going into New Hampshire where Bernie is expected to do very well.
[03:36:09.238 --> 03:36:12.843]  The key for Iowa was Bernie cannot win.
[03:36:12.843 --> 03:36:19.251]  No matter what, we have to calculate these numbers and count and recount.
[03:36:19.251 --> 03:36:23.577]  Like Stalin said, it doesn't matter who votes, it's who counts the votes.
[03:36:23.577 --> 03:36:27.522]  Well, the DNC swept in and took over the voting from the Iowans.
[03:36:28.180 --> 03:36:45.465]  So that no matter what, they did not want to headline Bernie wins, because their nightmare scenario is the Bernie Sanders wing of the party sweeping into the convention and winning, and just suffering a McGovern-Nixon kind of a defeat.
[03:36:45.465 --> 03:36:54.427]  It'll be, you know, a 40 or 45 state wipeout if it's a communist who honeymooned in the Soviet Union during the Gulag era.
[03:36:55.020 --> 03:37:01.542]  You know, who vacationed in Nicaragua during the Ortega communist era.
[03:37:01.542 --> 03:37:09.745]  The guy who sang the praises of Hugo Chavez and the Cuban socialism in Venezuela.
[03:37:09.745 --> 03:37:22.209]  That guy cannot possibly win because he has too much video that's going to be played and played and played of him, you know, dancing and hugging with the communists.
[03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:27.573]  During the hardcore Iron Curtain era, the guy cannot win.
[03:37:27.573 --> 03:37:32.676]  So this is the spot that Pelosi and Schumer are in.
[03:37:32.676 --> 03:37:38.419]  They've just been, you know, they've wasted all of this energy fighting a fruitless battle against Trump.
[03:37:38.419 --> 03:37:43.742]  He's weak, but they're far weaker, and he'll regain his strength quickly, whereas they now have to
[03:37:44.282 --> 03:37:44.962]  We're good to go.
[03:38:11.327 --> 03:38:16.389]  So, I think that Bernie is going to be a clear winner coming out of New Hampshire.
[03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:37.118]  Going to South Carolina, Pete Buttigieg, he cannot get elected in South Carolina because socially, in many respects, blacks are religious and southern blacks are conservative and religious, and they're not going to vote for a gay guy to bring his male husband into the White House.
[03:38:37.118 --> 03:38:40.320]  I mean, in Manhattan and in Berkeley,
[03:38:40.916 --> 03:38:46.837]  It might seem completely normal, but in rural South Carolina, it does not.
[03:38:46.837 --> 03:38:57.820]  And it's not going to, you know, he is not going to win in South Carolina because conservative religious, you know, Southerners, black or white, are never going to vote for him.
[03:38:57.820 --> 03:38:58.960]  Period.
[03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:07.662]  You know, that might fly in New Hampshire and it might fly in, you know, in the college towns of Iowa, minus the Trump vote, the Republican vote.
[03:39:07.662 --> 03:39:10.443]  It's not going to fly in any part of South Carolina.
[03:39:11.178 --> 03:39:18.776]  So, what I see going into the convention is, with the machinery of the DNC arrayed against Sanders,
[03:39:21.491 --> 03:39:23.772]  And nobody getting a majority.
[03:39:23.772 --> 03:39:29.013]  I think that what the DNC is going to be angling toward is a brokered convention.
[03:39:29.013 --> 03:39:33.535]  And that means that they're going to have a white knight sweep in.
[03:39:33.535 --> 03:39:38.156]  And, you know, people like Hillary are probably thinking that's my possibility.
[03:39:38.156 --> 03:39:42.858]  You know, I'll be the that I'll be after after I think it's one or two rounds of votes.
[03:39:42.858 --> 03:39:48.860]  If there's no majority in the Democratic Convention, then it's just open to anybody.
[03:39:48.860 --> 03:39:49.820]  It's like all comers.
[03:39:50.447 --> 03:39:55.131]  And they might be looking for a white knight, a retired general type, or a retired admiral.
[03:39:55.131 --> 03:40:04.219]  You know, somebody that can come in and just, out of exhaustion, the Democrats say, yes, that's the guy we have to put up against Trump.
[03:40:04.219 --> 03:40:11.526]  Some, you know, ex-military that they can, you know, even if he's a socialist now, they'll make him out to be the war hero.
[03:40:11.526 --> 03:40:14.349]  I mean, this is a pattern they've been running to find some
[03:40:17.523 --> 03:40:38.039]  Liberal, Socialist, Democrat, whoever wore the uniform, which would include Pete Buttigieg, and then play up his heroic uniform service, supposedly I'm being sarcastic, and then run him to try to trick the social moderates and conservatives into voting for him.
[03:40:38.039 --> 03:40:45.545]  So I think that's the only chance that the Democrats have going into the election, is to find some way to torpedo
[03:40:46.780 --> 03:40:56.567]  The present field, none of which can win, and arrange a brokered convention and then bring in a white knight to rescue them.
[03:40:56.567 --> 03:40:58.829]  That's the only thing that's going to happen.
[03:40:58.829 --> 03:41:13.839]  So right now is a great time for Trump to reorient, to rest and recuperate, while the Democrats are completely flummoxed with their own dilemma.
[03:41:14.417 --> 03:41:17.341]  You know, Iowa was a disaster on many levels.
[03:41:17.341 --> 03:41:27.755]  I mean, it's like a gold mine for memes and jokes that they couldn't even run a caucus in a tiny state, a small population state.
[03:41:28.334 --> 03:41:53.571]  And they think that they can, you know, nationalize health care and run health care for, you know, turn it into socialist American health care, or that they can, you know, if we just elect the Democrats, they'll make a Green New Deal and they're going to turn the temperature of the earth down by, you know, banning the internal combustion engine in the United States of America, not to mention China or India or anywhere else.
[03:41:54.176 --> 03:42:00.741]  So their incompetence is on full display.
[03:42:00.741 --> 03:42:15.410]  And I've been, you know, I don't have the exact numbers, but it's constantly repeated that at Trump rallies, they do a lot of metrics and demographic and other metrics going in because they're signing people up.
[03:42:15.410 --> 03:42:20.634]  Something like a quarter of the people in the Trump rallies are registered Democrats.
[03:42:21.300 --> 03:42:26.704]  So this is lining up to be McGovern-Nixon.
[03:42:26.704 --> 03:42:32.689]  You know, before Watergate fully blew up, Nixon blew McGovern out of the water.
[03:42:32.689 --> 03:42:37.613]  I think McGovern only won, like, Minnesota and Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.
[03:42:37.613 --> 03:42:38.654]  That was it.
[03:42:38.654 --> 03:42:46.119]  And that's what we're lining up to see in November, you know, if there's no market crash and if there's no big pandemic.
[03:42:46.119 --> 03:42:49.322]  And coronavirus will be the next topic in the next segment.
[03:42:51.727 --> 03:42:54.749]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.

[03:45:53.220 --> 03:45:55.662]  The demand for food has not let up.
[03:45:55.662 --> 03:45:58.065]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[03:45:58.065 --> 03:46:02.809]  Everybody else has basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[03:46:02.809 --> 03:46:04.611]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[03:46:04.611 --> 03:46:08.114]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver because, again, they have to
[03:46:08.274 --> 03:46:08.914]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[03:46:37.031 --> 03:46:38.811]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:12.592 --> 03:47:19.418]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:19.418 --> 03:47:26.584]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:47:26.584 --> 03:47:35.372]  Yeah, before I get to my main subject, which is going to be the coronavirus, I'm going to walk right back into the InfoWars store because
[03:47:36.149 --> 03:47:47.517]  Even though things might be getting slightly delayed because of the unbelievable demand brought about by this looming pandemic, you know, your orders are going to be filled.
[03:47:47.517 --> 03:47:49.818]  This has not hit us yet.
[03:47:49.818 --> 03:47:59.985]  So don't be, you know, don't give up in looking for your preparations, your long-term storage food, your filtration systems.
[03:48:00.740 --> 03:48:07.287]  And your nutraceuticals, because there is no cure for this virus.
[03:48:07.287 --> 03:48:08.108]  It's a virus.
[03:48:08.108 --> 03:48:11.932]  It's not a bacterial infection.
[03:48:11.932 --> 03:48:18.579]  So until there's a vaccine, there's nothing to do except be as healthy as you can be.
[03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:23.551]  Go into it as strong as you can possibly be.
[03:48:23.551 --> 03:48:34.516]  These kinds of diseases, they pick off the people who are weak, that are old, that have comorbid conditions, that are already dealing with emphysema, things like that.
[03:48:34.516 --> 03:48:38.218]  So you need to go into it as strong as you can be.
[03:48:38.218 --> 03:48:42.720]  So get your orders in now because we still have lots of time.
[03:48:42.720 --> 03:48:47.623]  This is not even barely out of China now.
[03:48:47.623 --> 03:48:47.943]  It's just
[03:48:48.402 --> 03:48:51.723]  It's maybe getting embedded in some states.
[03:48:51.723 --> 03:48:54.444]  We don't know yet, but there is still time.
[03:48:54.444 --> 03:48:59.465]  So, the best on the market can be found right in the InfoWars store.
[03:48:59.465 --> 03:49:02.966]  It's what you need, so you need to stock up while you can.
[03:49:02.966 --> 03:49:12.449]  Now, we need to keep our eye on a couple of numbers, and it's hard because you can't believe anything coming out of China.
[03:49:12.449 --> 03:49:16.450]  But the R0 number, which is how many people it affects,
[03:49:17.265 --> 03:49:21.750]  Seems everybody is saying it's between two and three and that is bad enough.
[03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:23.992]  That is about like the Spanish flu.
[03:49:23.992 --> 03:49:29.718]  That means everybody infected will infect two to three people.
[03:49:29.718 --> 03:49:33.322]  But then there's a concept of something called a super spreader.
[03:49:34.252 --> 03:49:38.116]  A super spreader is no different than anybody else with the virus.
[03:49:38.116 --> 03:49:45.383]  It just means that that infected person landed in just the right fertile soil for spreading.
[03:49:45.383 --> 03:49:52.050]  Like somebody sick who winds up in the prison, in the barracks, or on the cruise ship.
[03:49:52.050 --> 03:49:55.073]  You know, with the ventilation system going from room to room.
[03:49:55.754 --> 03:50:03.399]  So a super spreader can infect 20 or 30 people and spike an outbreak locally.
[03:50:03.399 --> 03:50:13.425]  So even when we know the R0 number, the fatality rate number is much harder to pin down.
[03:50:13.425 --> 03:50:15.867]  During the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, the fatality rate was put at 10-20%.
[03:50:21.505 --> 03:50:28.329]  And in China, they're still saying it's around 2%, but nobody really knows because it's China.
[03:50:28.329 --> 03:50:41.838]  But there's a cruise ship tied up in Yokohama, Japan right now called the Diamond Princess, and it's got 3,700 people on board, one locked down in their rooms, essentially.
[03:50:41.838 --> 03:50:44.880]  They're not doing shuffleboard, and the swimming pool is closed.
[03:50:46.428 --> 03:50:50.170]  You know, just feeding these people without spreading contamination.
[03:50:50.170 --> 03:51:01.638]  When you've got a shared ventilation system, you know, there's no way they've got like HEPA type, you know, high efficiency filters throughout the entire ventilation system.
[03:51:01.638 --> 03:51:04.840]  So you've got people breathing common air.
[03:51:04.840 --> 03:51:11.464]  Every time a door opens and people walk in, walk down these narrow passageways on a cruise ship,
[03:51:11.844 --> 03:51:25.049]  They're pulling along, you know, their vacuum is pulling along a trail of the air they've been breathing so that people that come out of their door later can breathe that same air or even just touch the same surfaces.
[03:51:25.049 --> 03:51:37.713]  So, it'll be very interesting as a lab experiment to keep an eye on the cruise ships because if there are outbreaks because of this super spreader method of concept
[03:51:38.519 --> 03:51:43.200]  An outbreak can be sort of supercharged in an environment like a cruise ship.
[03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:53.662]  You know, it happened in the Spanish Flu era with troop ships where, you know, a few were sick before the voyage and many people are sick and dead by the end of the voyage.
[03:51:53.662 --> 03:51:56.983]  So, we'll have to keep an eye on those cruise ships.
[03:51:56.983 --> 03:52:06.805]  Now, in terms of the Wuhan quarantine, it's a huge social experiment that maybe only the Communist Chinese could pull off to try to
[03:52:07.389 --> 03:52:20.457]  To wall in 50 or 60 million people and the way that the Chinese are looking at it is that we're taking one for the global team and we're going to sacrifice an entire region
[03:52:21.283 --> 03:52:23.565]  That would be like an area like Texas.
[03:52:23.565 --> 03:52:28.691]  We're going to sacrifice it so that, and it'll just burn itself out inside.
[03:52:28.691 --> 03:52:30.613]  We can't get all the medical care in there.
[03:52:30.613 --> 03:52:33.836]  There's no way to send enough doctors and nurses in there.
[03:52:33.836 --> 03:52:37.940]  They're literally locking people inside of their houses that are coughing.
[03:52:37.940 --> 03:52:40.563]  You know, if you're alive in two weeks, good luck.
[03:52:40.563 --> 03:52:44.567]  Otherwise, don't infect anybody else to make sure we're locking you in.
[03:52:45.495 --> 03:52:46.135]  But that's it.
[03:52:46.135 --> 03:52:48.636]  That is a reactive quarantine.
[03:52:48.636 --> 03:52:54.318]  When you put a perimeter around an outbreak, that's a reactive quarantine.
[03:52:54.318 --> 03:53:08.702]  But there is a type of quarantine that does work in history, and it is a defensive quarantine where a city or a town or a ship will quarantine itself while there are no infections.
[03:53:09.463 --> 03:53:11.665]  And this actually works in history.
[03:53:11.665 --> 03:53:25.677]  In the Spanish flu, San Francisco got out ahead of the Spanish flu outbreaks and basically, you know, put all their military bases on a lockdown so that the sailors and soldiers weren't wandering through San Francisco.
[03:53:25.677 --> 03:53:30.741]  Because by then they knew that the military bases were hit the worst and the first.
[03:53:30.741 --> 03:53:33.824]  So they prevented the sailors and soldiers from leaving base.
[03:53:34.404 --> 03:53:43.248]  They restricted travel in and out of San Francisco, and as a result, their fatality rate was a fraction of what cities like Philadelphia were.
[03:53:43.248 --> 03:53:51.292]  So, when you look for fatality rate, you're never going to find that the Spanish Flu was 10% everywhere.
[03:53:51.292 --> 03:53:55.834]  There were islands that had like, you know, 25% mortality rate.
[03:53:55.834 --> 03:53:58.976]  We're talking Black Death mortality rates.
[03:53:58.976 --> 03:54:01.017]  And there were places that had
[03:54:01.377 --> 03:54:06.561]  Like, less than 1% because they threw up defensive quarantines.
[03:54:06.561 --> 03:54:11.564]  You know, you're going to take a hit to your economy, but you're going to keep the infection out.
[03:54:11.564 --> 03:54:19.870]  And by preventing air travel into the USA, this is in effect a defensive quarantine, and they work.
[03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:21.771]  You know, this is nothing new in history.
[03:54:21.771 --> 03:54:30.938]  This type of a social reaction to a pandemic is as old as history.
[03:54:31.848 --> 03:54:39.932]  Albert Camus wrote a book about it, it's really just a novella, you can get it at the library or PDF online, called The Plague.
[03:54:39.932 --> 03:54:45.555]  And it's about a bubonic plague outbreak in North Africa in the early 20th century.
[03:54:45.555 --> 03:54:49.177]  And it reminds me of the movie Jaws.
[03:54:51.737 --> 03:55:06.649]  The Chamber of Commerce does not want to hear that we need to put up a quarantine, that we need to keep people from one part of the port from moving to the other part of the port, or that we have to close the market.
[03:55:07.279 --> 03:55:13.982]  You know, the Chamber of Commerce types always want to get the business to continue to the last minute.
[03:55:13.982 --> 03:55:16.803]  Oh, we've had 20 deaths of bubonic plague?
[03:55:16.803 --> 03:55:19.444]  That's no reason to close the food market.
[03:55:19.444 --> 03:55:27.567]  Yeah, no, it is a reason, because the people going to the food market are going to spread it, and next week it'll be 100 and then 1,000.
[03:55:27.567 --> 03:55:31.469]  So, we can learn a lot from history.
[03:55:31.469 --> 03:55:33.609]  It's not really time to panic.
[03:55:33.609 --> 03:55:34.990]  It's still time just to watch.
[03:55:35.666 --> 03:55:38.689]  You know, there is a lot of panic buying going on.
[03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:41.772]  I mean, food markets in Asia, for example.
[03:55:41.772 --> 03:55:53.963]  But there's another aspect of this that I need to touch on, which is, we're all focused on coronavirus, but China is really in the midst of a terrible, almost apocalyptic situation.
[03:55:53.963 --> 03:55:59.849]  Because it's not only this coronavirus outbreak, there's already, going back a couple years,
[03:56:00.751 --> 03:56:03.352]  There's two different swine flus.
[03:56:03.352 --> 03:56:12.355]  There's an African swine fever and an H1N1 swine flu that have decimated their pork industry.
[03:56:12.355 --> 03:56:18.877]  Well, this is one of the main protein sources for the 1.5 or whatever it is billion Chinese.
[03:56:18.877 --> 03:56:26.239]  There's also an H5N1 bird flu, which is decimating their poultry industry, chickens, ducks, geese.
[03:56:27.023 --> 03:56:34.011]  So they've got a food problem as well as a coronavirus problem.
[03:56:34.011 --> 03:56:36.474]  Their industry is folding up.
[03:56:36.474 --> 03:56:40.779]  Their stock market is practically at a standstill.
[03:56:40.779 --> 03:56:43.142]  This is going to hit their economy and then
[03:56:43.940 --> 03:57:04.853]  This economic downturn in China, with the shutdown of everybody around the world that relies on Chinese parts or products that they're building that are basically being assembled with Chinese parts, those Chinese parts, the containers that are underway are it, and they're going to be shutting down.
[03:57:04.853 --> 03:57:04.893]  So
[03:57:06.744 --> 03:57:17.829]  The pandemic effect of this, even if the death rate remains low, might be really just the ripple that triggers a tsunami of an economic global downturn.
[03:57:17.829 --> 03:57:30.434]  So next year, we might be looking at this not as a human mortality question, but what triggered an economic collapse, market crashes and so forth.
[03:57:30.434 --> 03:57:32.115]  So we're just in early innings and
[03:57:32.967 --> 03:57:40.467]  Hopefully we get past November and Trump is re-elected because at least if he's in charge, we got something.
[03:57:40.467 --> 03:57:40.949]  Next week.
