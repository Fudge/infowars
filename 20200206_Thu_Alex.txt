[00:00.000 --> 00:22.060]  But this morning we come together as one nation blessed to live in freedom and grateful to
[00:22.060 --> 00:33.100]  worship and peace. As everybody knows, my family, our great country, and your president have been
[00:33.100 --> 00:42.320]  put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people. They have done
[00:42.320 --> 00:53.960]  everything possible to destroy us, and by so doing, very badly hurt our nation. They know what
[00:53.960 --> 01:05.340]  they are doing is wrong, but they put themselves far ahead of our great country. Weeks ago and
[01:05.340 --> 01:13.240]  again yesterday, courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, fortitude, and strength
[01:13.240 --> 01:28.400]  to do what everyone knows was right. I don't like people who use their faith as justification for
[01:28.400 --> 01:37.900]  doing what they know is wrong, nor do I like people who say, I pray for you when they know
[01:37.900 --> 01:49.680]  that that's not so. So many people have been hurt, and we can't let that go on. And I'll be
[01:49.680 --> 01:57.780]  discussing that a little bit later at the White House. We're joined today by two people whose
[01:57.780 --> 02:08.380]  faith inspires us all, our amazing wonderful friend, Vice President Mike Pence, and his
[02:08.380 --> 02:23.980]  wonderful wife Karen. Thank you. Thank you to all of our great political leaders out there, so
[02:23.980 --> 02:29.300]  many that I've been working with so hard over the last three years, and we've accomplished so
[02:29.300 --> 02:37.700]  much. And to members of my cabinet, in attendance, Secretary Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, David
[02:37.700 --> 02:47.420]  Bernhardt, Gene Scalia, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Dan Bruilette, Betsy DeVos, Robert Wilkie, and
[02:47.420 --> 03:04.620]  Administrator Jovita Carranza. Joining us for this cherished tradition are a lot of friends in
[03:04.620 --> 03:11.820]  the audience. Many really have become friends. They are political leaders. They become great
[03:11.820 --> 03:18.500]  friends. That's all I get to meet anymore. That and the enemies and the allies, and we have them
[03:18.500 --> 03:24.020]  all. We have allies. We have enemies. Sometimes the allies are enemies, but we just don't know it.
[03:24.020 --> 03:32.100]  But we're changing all that. But thank you all, and thank you all for being here. I also want to
[03:32.100 --> 03:46.460]  welcome foreign dignitaries from more than 140 countries. That's something. Everyone here today
[03:46.460 --> 03:53.020]  is united by a shared conviction. We know that our nation is stronger, our future is brighter,
[03:53.020 --> 04:00.580]  and our joy is greater. When we turn to God and ask Him to shed His grace on our lives, on Tuesday,
[04:00.580 --> 04:07.620]  I address Congress, on the State of the Union and the great American comeback. That's what it is.
[04:07.620 --> 04:20.500]  Our country has never done better than it is doing right now. Our economy is the strongest it has
[04:20.500 --> 04:27.580]  ever been. And for those of you that are interested in stocks, it looks like the stock market will
[04:27.580 --> 04:42.180]  be way up again today. According to. And ladies and gentlemen, you are watching a live feed of
[04:42.180 --> 04:46.340]  where the president is about to speak. That was from the prayer breakfast earlier. I'm Alex Jones,

[06:17.980 --> 06:28.300]  he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. And we are live ladies and gentlemen on
[06:28.300 --> 06:34.940]  this Thursday, February 6 2020 transmission. And any minute the president of the United States is
[06:34.940 --> 06:40.860]  going to walk through those doors. And he is going to address the people of the United States,
[06:40.860 --> 06:46.860]  people of the world about the attempted deep state takedown for the third time of President Trump.
[06:46.860 --> 06:53.260]  They have failed and failed miserably, but they are only fighting harder now because they're puppets
[06:53.260 --> 07:01.540]  of the globalist puppets of the globalist that are being ordered to do this because it further
[07:01.540 --> 07:08.100]  divides and hurts the nation and its very soul and its productivity. That's all this is. The
[07:08.100 --> 07:13.380]  globalist had puppet presidents in the last 30 years. They don't know what to do now. They've
[07:13.380 --> 07:17.580]  got not just a president that's the president, but a president that understands the new world order.
[07:17.580 --> 07:27.060]  And at the last minutes of the American century, setting the new American century has begun.
[07:27.060 --> 07:31.740]  And that's what even mainline financial times of London and others are saying is the chai
[07:31.740 --> 07:37.460]  comm century, the century of the dragon that was to be the century is gone. It's not happening,
[07:37.460 --> 07:42.420]  ladies and gentlemen. And it's not that we're putting down the Chinese people, but the communist
[07:42.420 --> 07:48.420]  Chinese and their model, no human rights, no environmental standards, no nothing. And then
[07:48.420 --> 07:53.180]  all the leftist and globalist groups shutting down all of our industry here and not letting
[07:53.180 --> 07:59.460]  us operate in any ways. And the race baiting and the racial division, everything that's been
[07:59.460 --> 08:06.860]  going on to sabotage our culture and our society. So the president usually speaks about 10 minutes
[08:06.860 --> 08:13.380]  after he says he will let all the cameras dial in and stations break away. But I would imagine
[08:13.380 --> 08:17.980]  the few minutes those doors are going to open a little note for radio and TV stations. By
[08:17.980 --> 08:22.740]  next week, we're going to have it set up where on the satellite as well, we're going to have
[08:22.740 --> 08:29.660]  a feed on the internet as well. That is commercial free basically, except for breaks at the start
[08:29.660 --> 08:33.460]  and end of each hour at the bottom of the hour. So that at times like this, we can go
[08:33.460 --> 08:37.900]  commercial free for stations. I know a lot of stations will probably skip this next
[08:37.900 --> 08:41.940]  break coming up. And that's their decision. I think they probably should. Some stations
[08:41.940 --> 08:45.820]  don't want us to do that. So we'll go to break here in seven minutes, but when we'll come
[08:45.820 --> 08:50.260]  back and play whatever we missed, as we have a DVR as well, that's a live satellite feed
[08:50.260 --> 08:58.460]  we have that, you know, import pays for right there out of the White House. And again, I
[08:58.460 --> 09:04.100]  just want to explain to listeners, that's where your money goes is this infrastructure.
[09:04.100 --> 09:07.340]  Nobody else has built an infrastructure that's independent of the globalist that'll do something
[09:07.340 --> 09:13.580]  like we're doing right now. And that's why info wars have been the model of countering
[09:13.580 --> 09:17.780]  big corporate monopoly media and bringing you the people's populist media. And that's
[09:17.780 --> 09:21.820]  why they're so hell bent on shutting us down. And that's why I'm so blessed and honored
[09:21.820 --> 09:26.540]  to be here with you, ladies and gentlemen, the quickening right now is so intense that
[09:26.540 --> 09:31.860]  I haven't had a vacation in over a year. I'm not complaining. My wife said, damn it, we're
[09:31.860 --> 09:36.420]  going to have one. And so we went ahead and took one, but I was working the whole time.
[09:36.420 --> 09:41.500]  And I got on a plane early and came back because wild horses couldn't drag me away. Oh, and
[09:41.500 --> 09:47.220]  Shroyer and others doing a fabulous job. But this coronavirus situation and all these top
[09:47.220 --> 09:53.300]  biological weapons experts and top scientists scanning the virus and saying it's been made.
[09:53.300 --> 09:56.980]  You've got to get ahead of this. And if you notice the virus numbers, maybe we can punch
[09:56.980 --> 10:01.260]  those back up for a moment while we're waiting for the president. The official World Health
[10:01.260 --> 10:07.220]  Organization says 28,000 confirmed while I walked in here a few minutes ago was 24,000.
[10:07.220 --> 10:11.460]  But the internal Chinese numbers that leaked and were actually published in China by the
[10:11.460 --> 10:17.540]  people's daily said 24,000 dead yesterday. So what we think they're doing is they're
[10:17.540 --> 10:24.500]  just putting the number of dead as the number of infected. Think about that. We'll continue
[10:24.500 --> 10:29.420]  to track all of that as it unfolds and as we wait for the president to come out and speak.
[10:29.420 --> 10:32.540]  So what we'll do is we'll take the satellite fee, but we got to break guys, just DVR it
[10:32.540 --> 10:36.180]  in there. We'll start from the beginning of the president's speech. We're obviously going
[10:36.180 --> 10:41.260]  to carry all of this, this entire press conference. And then it's the people. We're going to open
[10:41.260 --> 10:47.380]  the phones up for the balance of the transmission here today to get your response to all of
[10:47.380 --> 10:57.260]  this. But you talk about building up on the suspense. The information is GOP on offensive
[10:57.260 --> 11:02.780]  party pushes for Hunter Biden records, ethics complaint against Pelosi. Well, Pelosi's son
[11:02.780 --> 11:08.900]  is even deeper into scams in Ukraine than Hunter. And that's what I tell the president
[11:08.900 --> 11:11.820]  every time I've had a chance to talk to him. Please, sir, don't thank me. I don't need
[11:11.820 --> 11:17.900]  a pat on the head. I need you to go on the offensive against these people because I promoted
[11:17.900 --> 11:21.900]  you and I believe what you're doing and they're going to destroy me. So you have to succeed
[11:21.900 --> 11:27.060]  now. Not just for myself, the whole country and our listeners, everybody, you must go
[11:27.060 --> 11:32.500]  on the offense. You can't just sit here and beat their attacks over and over and over
[11:32.500 --> 11:37.100]  and over and over again. You have to actually go after them. And I understand he's surrounded
[11:37.100 --> 11:41.940]  by a bunch of cowardly lawyers. It's truly disgusting. We're going to be open the phones
[11:41.940 --> 11:46.900]  up as soon as his speech is done here on this live Thursday worldwide transmission. I'm
[11:46.900 --> 11:54.940]  going to say something else here right now on air. I have not gotten a fever in over
[11:54.940 --> 12:01.180]  four years. And boy, you get on the airplanes today and all the rest of it kept knocking
[12:01.180 --> 12:10.140]  on wood telling you that boom, got a fever, flying back, got something and my fever is
[12:10.140 --> 12:15.340]  gone now. And I feel great. You know, everybody else I know has pretty much been sick with
[12:15.340 --> 12:20.860]  whatever this respiratory stuff is. Probably is some type of coronavirus and stuff is everywhere.
[12:20.860 --> 12:29.060]  But boy, I got home last night and I suck down some you gargle. Tastes like mint. And
[12:29.060 --> 12:32.260]  I'm a I've been a drinking man before. So it tastes like I've actually some of the delicious
[12:32.260 --> 12:41.700]  synopses. But what it's got is is 15 parts per million nano silver. That's what CNN recognizes
[12:41.700 --> 12:49.340]  safe for you to ingest. And it coats the mouth, the mucous membrane, the throat goes down
[12:49.340 --> 12:54.340]  the stomach and does incredible things. So I got home last night said my wife said you're
[12:54.340 --> 13:00.940]  hot second thermometer in my mouth, had about a hundred and a half temperature, bang back.
[13:00.940 --> 13:06.300]  Some of this good stuff right here. Super blue silver went over and got my colloidal
[13:06.300 --> 13:12.540]  silver silver bullet. Took some of that. A couple Advil climbed into bed and slept from
[13:12.540 --> 13:19.340]  seven until seven a.m. This morning and the fever was gone. I put on a couple shirts,
[13:19.340 --> 13:24.140]  put on a coat, put on two pairs of sweatpants, got in that bed in the guest bedroom, wrapped
[13:24.140 --> 13:32.380]  my ass up and cook like a turkey and got up this morning and boom, baby, it's gone. Yes.
[13:32.380 --> 13:37.260]  But there's something about when you talk it, the Greeks noticed it, the Romans noticed
[13:37.260 --> 13:41.740]  it, there's African sayings about it. They go back thousands of years. When you talk
[13:41.740 --> 13:44.820]  about how you've been successful and how things haven't happened to you that are happening
[13:44.820 --> 13:48.420]  to others, just like clockwork. Everybody knows you talk about I've been sick in a long
[13:48.420 --> 13:52.500]  time. You get sick. I just like so I was like, I'm trying to tell you I haven't had a fever
[13:52.500 --> 13:58.540]  over four years, maybe longer, but I just knock on wood. I don't know. Boom. Boom. You get
[13:58.540 --> 14:02.020]  on an airplane. Hell, I probably got it four days ago when I flew out on Saturday five
[14:02.020 --> 14:05.500]  days ago. I probably didn't get it flying back. But I as soon as I got out of the airport
[14:05.500 --> 14:10.340]  and it was cold, I was like, man, I'm shivering. So that's what happened. By the way, this
[14:10.340 --> 14:15.620]  immune gargle will sell out by tomorrow at the big 16 ounce. The small ones will sell
[14:15.620 --> 14:19.660]  out by Monday. And then we have the three ounces. We have a lot of that, but at current
[14:19.660 --> 14:23.420]  sales rates, it will be gone in about two weeks. And again, I just discovered last week
[14:23.420 --> 14:29.380]  that there were Homeland Security secret reports 2007 by the director of Homeland Security
[14:29.380 --> 14:33.780]  certifying that this nano silver by the nanotech company that puts it out for us is the only
[14:33.780 --> 14:38.300]  thing found by the Pentagon to take out the SARS family, which is the coronavirus family
[14:38.300 --> 14:42.740]  and that the Pentagon actually buys it from them. Again, they private label it to us.
[14:42.740 --> 14:47.540]  They probably have a whole family, but the toothpaste is original. Immune gargle is original.
[14:47.540 --> 14:52.660]  It's super wound to jealous. What the Pentagon gets and the military that's going into different
[14:52.660 --> 14:57.620]  operations, they'll take it with them to put a coating on their hands and face and things
[14:57.620 --> 15:01.460]  so that if you do get little micro cuts and abrasions, I kind of swamp, they found that
[15:01.460 --> 15:04.940]  it really cuts back on infections massively. And I showed you those secret documents. Well,
[15:04.940 --> 15:09.500]  they said, they said, was it restricted? What was the word they used when I showed those
[15:09.500 --> 15:16.340]  documents to the day? It was a pop my head to moment. The point is, is that it's selling
[15:16.340 --> 15:21.380]  out. And then if you look right over here, the storeable food, I have a note here from
[15:21.380 --> 15:25.260]  Matt Redhawk that I think I left in the conference room in there. I forgot to get that guys will
[15:25.260 --> 15:33.900]  bring that to me. And he gave us a call this morning. And he said, well, we are still able
[15:33.900 --> 15:38.660]  to ship food out. But now it's 10 to 14 days. And everybody else is totally sold out. Anybody
[15:38.660 --> 15:41.900]  else telling you they've got storeable foods is lying to you or it's crap. They've got
[15:41.900 --> 15:46.300]  high quality, new fresh food for packaging food 24 hours a day. But now it'll take 10
[15:46.300 --> 15:50.020]  to 14 days for you to get it. If you get your order in now, and it may go up to two or three
[15:50.020 --> 15:54.580]  weeks by next week, and soon they may be sold out. They have the food right now to take
[15:54.580 --> 16:01.220]  your order and get it out to you info or store.com. We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[17:27.460 --> 17:31.500]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[17:31.500 --> 17:36.060]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[17:36.060 --> 17:40.100]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[17:40.100 --> 17:44.180]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe
[17:44.180 --> 17:49.180]  taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:49.180 --> 17:59.100]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[17:59.100 --> 18:04.380]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars, it's because
[18:04.380 --> 18:11.220]  we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not giving up. That's why it's
[18:11.220 --> 18:16.420]  critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down
[18:16.420 --> 18:21.100]  when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should
[18:21.100 --> 18:26.940]  expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls
[18:26.940 --> 18:32.020]  to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally
[18:32.020 --> 18:37.980]  driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are
[18:37.980 --> 18:44.940]  awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these
[18:44.940 --> 18:50.500]  wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are
[18:50.500 --> 18:56.980]  alive. They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that
[18:56.980 --> 19:04.900]  God is in charge. This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales
[19:04.900 --> 19:10.540]  pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward. Things that I've discovered that I absolutely
[19:10.540 --> 19:16.180]  know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing
[19:16.180 --> 19:22.740]  it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help
[19:22.740 --> 19:28.740]  us and it's symbiotic. My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's
[19:28.740 --> 19:33.740]  the good halogen, fluoride is the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and
[19:33.740 --> 19:39.220]  I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago
[19:39.220 --> 19:46.980]  and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right
[19:46.980 --> 19:53.060]  now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it. It's amazing. Discover the
[19:53.060 --> 19:57.180]  benefits and it funds the Info War, a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take
[19:57.180 --> 20:02.660]  action.
[20:02.660 --> 20:17.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United
[20:17.980 --> 20:27.380]  States. By the way, this is live. We came out of break and that perfectly happened to the
[20:27.380 --> 20:34.380]  second. Wow. So the third time they tried to remove him with fraud versus a Russian agent.
[20:34.380 --> 20:41.980]  Wow, here we go. Of course, before that, they tried to say his election wasn't legitimate,
[20:41.980 --> 20:55.900]  tried to unseat him in the electoral process. This is a big victory. Listen to this. This
[20:55.900 --> 21:02.140]  is fairytale folks. This is the real world, the strength of the fiction. He's in real
[21:02.140 --> 21:12.900]  danger now, though. Now they're going to make a physical move on him. You better start defending
[21:12.900 --> 21:36.420]  his supporters, though. That's a shock, underbelly. This will be a day long. Plus, it's so much
[21:36.420 --> 21:43.060]  stronger. Thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We've all been through a lot together,
[21:43.060 --> 21:49.900]  and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation.
[21:49.900 --> 21:56.260]  I invited some of our very good friends, and we have limited room, but everybody wanted
[21:56.260 --> 22:01.380]  to come. We kept it down to a minimum, and believe it or not, this is a minimum. But
[22:01.380 --> 22:06.100]  a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months. But really, if you go back
[22:06.100 --> 22:14.660]  to it over the last number of years, we had the witch hunt. It started from the day we
[22:14.660 --> 22:38.940]  came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady who's with us right now. And it
[22:38.940 --> 22:46.900]  never really stopped. We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil.
[22:46.900 --> 22:54.980]  It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen
[22:54.980 --> 23:00.620]  to another president, ever. I don't know that other presidents would have been able
[23:00.620 --> 23:06.660]  to take it. Some people said no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you
[23:06.660 --> 23:11.380]  have to focus on this, because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have
[23:11.380 --> 23:20.940]  with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey,
[23:20.940 --> 23:26.740]  who was a disaster, by the way, it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now.
[23:26.740 --> 23:35.860]  We caught him in the act. Dirty cops, bad people. If this happened to President Obama,
[23:35.860 --> 23:41.620]  a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already, many, many years. I want
[23:41.620 --> 23:46.700]  to start by thanking some of, and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships
[23:46.700 --> 23:50.940]  and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, gee, let's have a
[23:50.940 --> 23:57.140]  normal situation. With all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any
[23:57.140 --> 23:59.340]  president and administration.
[23:59.340 --> 24:01.140]  Wow, Trump almost cracked up right there.
[24:01.140 --> 24:05.740]  And really, I say, for the most part, we're probably looking down.
[24:05.740 --> 24:13.060]  We've almost heard a cry right there. We've done more than any administration in the first
[24:13.060 --> 24:19.580]  few years. You look at all of the things we've done. I watched this morning as they tried
[24:19.580 --> 24:25.820]  to take credit for the stock market from, from, think of that, let me tell you, if we didn't
[24:25.820 --> 24:32.060]  win, the stock market would have crashed, and the market was going up a lot before the
[24:32.060 --> 24:36.140]  election because it was looking like we had a good chance to win. And then it went up
[24:36.140 --> 24:40.580]  tremendously from the time we won the election till the time we took office.
[24:40.580 --> 24:42.540]  Because America was closed for business under globalism.
[24:42.540 --> 24:44.540]  It was November 8th to January 20th.
[24:44.540 --> 24:46.660]  And it's not taking credit away from Trump.
[24:46.660 --> 24:48.660]  And it's all our credit. That's all our credit. And leading up to that point.
[24:48.660 --> 24:50.060]  He literally just untied the boat from the dock.
[24:50.060 --> 24:55.020]  Because there was hope. And one of the reasons the stock market's gone up so much in the
[24:55.020 --> 24:59.620]  last few days is people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union
[24:59.620 --> 25:19.260]  speech. It really is. It's a true honor to give it.
[25:19.260 --> 25:23.420]  Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around. They've
[25:23.420 --> 25:29.100]  been all over the world. And one of them said, highly sophisticated person said, you know,
[25:29.100 --> 25:34.620]  no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference. There is nothing like
[25:34.620 --> 25:43.500]  what I witnessed tonight. The beauty, the majesty of the chamber, the power of the United States,
[25:43.500 --> 25:48.660]  the power of the people in this room. Really, and amazing. I don't think there is anything
[25:48.660 --> 25:51.820]  like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country. You can go to any other
[25:51.820 --> 25:57.700]  location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and
[25:57.700 --> 25:59.900]  how it represents our country.
[25:59.900 --> 26:04.060]  I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going
[26:04.060 --> 26:10.660]  to be left out, but they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's
[26:10.660 --> 26:18.420]  not a speech. It's not anything. It's just we're sort of, it's a celebration. Because
[26:18.420 --> 26:24.700]  we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell,
[26:24.700 --> 26:31.380]  unfairly, did nothing wrong, did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will
[26:31.380 --> 27:00.380]  admit. Not purposely, but I've done things wrong. But this is what the end result is.
[27:00.380 --> 27:14.780]  You can take that home, honey, maybe we'll frame it. It's the only good headline I've
[27:14.780 --> 27:19.940]  ever had in the Washington Post. But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those
[27:19.940 --> 27:26.700]  papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really like that, so I appreciate that. But
[27:26.700 --> 27:32.820]  some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing
[27:32.820 --> 27:37.900]  from a legal standpoint. This is a political thing. And every time I say, this is unfair,
[27:37.900 --> 27:43.440]  let's go to court, they say, sir, you can't go to court. This is politics. And we were
[27:43.440 --> 27:50.940]  treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia,
[27:50.940 --> 28:02.060]  Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. We then went through the public report. And they should
[28:02.060 --> 28:06.780]  have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later. After lives
[28:06.780 --> 28:12.660]  were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money, people came to
[28:12.660 --> 28:22.900]  Washington to help other people. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I say. They came one or
[28:22.900 --> 28:28.380]  two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty.
[28:28.380 --> 28:32.380]  I thought, this is a live feed. We're going to end live now. We're going to hit pause
[28:32.380 --> 28:36.740]  on the satellite feed. When we come back, we'll catch up right where he says BS. And
[28:36.740 --> 28:40.380]  you know what? I'm going to air it. The Democrats can cuss on broadcasts. Nobody gets in trouble.
[28:40.380 --> 28:43.260]  The Patriots do it. We get in trouble. I don't want to cuss on there. The president just
[28:43.260 --> 28:48.980]  did. We can say that word, okay? And nobody at the FCC that Trump runs is going to get
[28:48.980 --> 28:53.220]  anybody in trouble. I'm sick of the Democrats doing what we can't do. Because he's noting
[28:53.220 --> 28:56.780]  this is the first time in history cussing to show people how serious this is. We'll
[28:56.780 --> 28:57.780]  be back.
[28:57.780 --> 29:02.820]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know
[29:02.820 --> 29:08.020]  me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little
[29:08.020 --> 29:14.300]  too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to
[29:14.300 --> 29:19.580]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and
[29:19.580 --> 29:25.020]  drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment
[29:25.020 --> 29:30.300]  advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new

[30:26.780 --> 30:31.620]  they never got enough iodine. So just check it out for yourself, 40% off in Full War Store

[31:03.260 --> 31:08.980]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[31:08.980 --> 31:14.020]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide. And
[31:14.020 --> 31:19.540]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[31:19.540 --> 31:24.940]  amazing as well. You're still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against
[31:24.940 --> 31:29.020]  that in some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out
[31:29.020 --> 31:34.460]  against communist China. Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we
[31:34.460 --> 31:40.140]  really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists
[31:40.140 --> 31:45.260]  are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to see some
[31:45.260 --> 31:50.580]  major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see
[31:50.580 --> 31:55.820]  all the poison they spray at us. That's an attempt to moralize us. We've got to remember
[32:20.580 --> 32:27.580]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[32:27.580 --> 32:34.660]  which will be blamed on those loyal to Americana. Anyone once we stage these attacks that does
[32:34.660 --> 32:43.340]  not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you
[32:43.340 --> 32:50.500]  expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like
[32:50.500 --> 33:02.140]  we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed. Hey, oh, Cobra.
[33:02.140 --> 33:18.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. First, they tried to steal the election. Then they
[33:18.460 --> 33:24.100]  tried to not seat the delegates saying that Trump was a criminal when it came to his inauguration
[33:24.100 --> 33:32.380]  on January 20th, 2017. Then they began the whole Russiagate fraud in earnest that had
[33:32.380 --> 33:38.940]  already been operating the background. When that didn't work, they went to impeachment
[33:38.940 --> 33:45.580]  and removal in the Senate. That has now failed. But narrowly, they will try again because
[33:45.580 --> 33:50.140]  the process hurts the nation and they work for globalist forces. This is what the president
[33:50.140 --> 33:54.940]  is currently saying live. We paused it when we went to break when he came out and Fox
[33:54.940 --> 34:01.540]  News carried it as well. It was all bullshit. And again, I don't even like to use cuss words
[34:01.540 --> 34:08.140]  on air, but I'm sick of how on broadcast TV, Democrats do it on the view. They do it on
[34:08.140 --> 34:12.380]  Good Morning America. They do it on their sitcoms at night. They do it during the family
[34:12.380 --> 34:21.300]  hour. And then they do it all over CNN. They do it everywhere. But then if we do it and
[34:21.300 --> 34:24.220]  we're conservatives, we get in trouble. But the president just did it and noticed Fox
[34:24.220 --> 34:30.500]  News, MSNBC, they didn't cut it out as well. Because the president did that to know how
[34:30.500 --> 34:34.180]  serious things are. Let's go to part of the live feed and we'll go back to where we paused
[34:34.180 --> 34:35.180]  it.
[34:35.180 --> 34:41.220]  Good. When you can read somebody. Fantastic job. Then he understood rightfully this was
[34:41.220 --> 34:46.060]  crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people? They're running
[34:46.060 --> 34:52.900]  for office. They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat
[34:52.900 --> 34:57.700]  side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1% or less. Most of them got
[34:57.700 --> 35:03.260]  less. They decided to go home. Let's go back to California. Let's go back to wherever they
[35:03.260 --> 35:10.100]  came from. Let's go back to New York. How about that one? Our New York senator, Gillibrand.
[35:10.100 --> 35:16.980]  Let's go back to New York after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will
[35:16.980 --> 35:20.220]  be fair, that they will be easy and all of the different things that they had to say.
[35:20.220 --> 35:24.060]  We're going to go back to the feed where we cut it and just play it uninterrupted now.
[35:24.060 --> 35:31.260]  But I just want to point something out. Mitt Romney, after trying to stab Trump in the back
[35:31.260 --> 35:37.860]  in the election, Trump still endorsed him, helped get him elected in Utah. And now he's
[35:37.860 --> 35:42.140]  done this again. But he said he did it for the Lord because of his conscience. Give me
[35:42.140 --> 35:49.540]  a break. What a Pharisee. What a hypocrite. What a fraud. What a liar. Now let's go back
[35:49.540 --> 36:00.500]  to the president and what he had to say just a little while ago. And then we will continue
[36:00.500 --> 36:05.060]  on from there. Here it is. And every time I say this is unfair, let's go to court. They
[36:05.060 --> 36:12.180]  say, sir, you can't go to court. This is politics. And we were treated unbelievably unfairly.
[36:12.180 --> 36:23.260]  And you have to understand we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit.
[36:23.260 --> 36:29.260]  We then went through the Mueller report and they should have come back one day later.
[36:29.260 --> 36:34.180]  They didn't. They came back two years later. After lives were ruined, after people went
[36:34.180 --> 36:44.860]  bankrupt, after people lost all their money, people came to Washington to help other people.
[36:44.860 --> 36:50.260]  Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I say. They came one or two or three people in particular,
[36:50.260 --> 36:55.220]  but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest,
[36:55.220 --> 37:01.500]  they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said
[37:01.500 --> 37:08.220]  we topped it. It was a nasty. It was a nasty both in the primers and in the election. But
[37:08.220 --> 37:13.740]  you see, we thought after the election it would stop, but it didn't stop. It just started.
[37:13.740 --> 37:21.060]  And tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we
[37:21.060 --> 37:28.460]  were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of
[37:28.460 --> 37:34.860]  these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all
[37:34.860 --> 37:42.100]  about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And
[37:42.100 --> 37:47.620]  then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day,
[37:47.620 --> 37:56.700]  as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for
[37:56.700 --> 38:02.940]  the other side. But they should have said that first week, because it came out. Is that
[38:02.940 --> 38:09.660]  right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days, actually. Devin, is that right?
[38:09.660 --> 38:16.580]  Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going, Mark. They kept it
[38:16.580 --> 38:26.680]  going forever. Because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that I just wanted
[38:26.680 --> 38:30.460]  an election that to a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going
[38:30.460 --> 38:38.460]  to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few papers that we were going to win. But it was
[38:38.460 --> 38:44.380]  going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And
[38:44.380 --> 38:49.860]  they said, okay, he won. And you know, I wrote this down because that was where I think called
[38:49.860 --> 38:57.180]  the insurance policy. To me, when I saw the insurance policy, and that was done long before
[38:57.180 --> 39:03.180]  the election, that was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And
[39:03.180 --> 39:11.660]  by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions, millions of dollars, 45 million,
[39:11.660 --> 39:20.180]  the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued
[39:20.180 --> 39:26.300]  by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you're president, people don't like
[39:26.300 --> 39:30.680]  suing. I want to thank my legal team, by the way, not for that advice, but for other
[39:30.680 --> 39:31.680]  reasons.
[39:31.680 --> 39:34.900]  No, when you sue them at that level, they get to sue you back and find out your information
[39:34.900 --> 39:45.540]  and twist it. If I can't.
[39:45.540 --> 39:52.580]  Trump better go on the offense now.
[39:52.580 --> 39:57.780]  Right at the beginning, they said, sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts
[39:57.780 --> 40:04.820]  are on your side. I said, you don't understand that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.
[40:04.820 --> 40:10.820]  And that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made
[40:10.820 --> 40:13.100]  up my statement to the Ukrainian president.
[40:13.100 --> 40:14.100]  That's criminal.
[40:14.100 --> 40:18.460]  He wrote it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he's a screenwriter, a failed screenwriter.
[40:18.460 --> 40:22.740]  He tried to go in. Unfortunately, he went into politics after that.
[40:22.740 --> 40:23.740]  That's actually true.
[40:23.740 --> 40:28.660]  Remember, he said the statement, which is a mob statement. Don't call me. I'll call
[40:28.660 --> 40:34.780]  you. I didn't say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had
[40:34.780 --> 40:40.780]  transcripts. We had transcribers, professional transcribers. Then they said, oh, well, maybe
[40:40.780 --> 40:50.740]  the transcription is not correct. But Lieutenant Colonel Vidman and his twin brother, right?
[40:50.740 --> 40:54.980]  We had some people that really amazing, but we did everything. We said, what's wrong with
[40:54.980 --> 40:59.620]  it? Well, they didn't add this word or that didn't matter. I said, add it. They're probably
[40:59.620 --> 41:05.500]  wrong, but added. So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read
[41:05.500 --> 41:10.700]  those transcripts, Tim's got, I don't know if Tim's here, but he said, sir, there's the
[41:10.700 --> 41:18.060]  first one to call me. Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong. And Mitch, he stayed
[41:18.060 --> 41:19.060]  there right from the beginning.
[41:19.060 --> 41:22.860]  Let's stop right here. Again, we're now about 10 minutes behind on the speech. We're going
[41:22.860 --> 41:26.540]  to air the whole thing. We're sure questions are probably going to come up. And then after
[41:26.540 --> 41:31.180]  that, we're on your phone calls here, ladies and gentlemen. I just have to say that this
[41:31.180 --> 41:36.420]  is historic. But notice it still got Trump on the defense. He's still explaining how
[41:36.420 --> 41:41.460]  he did nothing wrong. He needs to be going after them and Nancy Pelosi's son and the
[41:41.460 --> 41:47.740]  Ukrainians and all the rest of this because they're not going to stop until they're dealt
[41:47.740 --> 41:52.260]  with their criminals. They've committed massive crimes. The dossier itself could send all
[41:52.260 --> 41:57.980]  of them to prison. Hillary contributed money to it. The DNC did. Mitt Romney connected
[41:57.980 --> 42:05.820]  griffs did. And they passed this research around paying their minions up to a million
[42:05.820 --> 42:11.300]  apiece. FBI agents, wives and husbands were getting a half million, 300,000, a million
[42:11.300 --> 42:20.700]  dollars to just contribute horsemen are. So that was a payoff venue vehicle. I mean, there's
[42:20.700 --> 42:25.980]  so many crimes here that you could just throw a dart with your eyes closed and hit bullseye.
[42:25.980 --> 42:32.340]  There was like, Mr. President, you've really won now. They're not going to stop. They're
[42:32.340 --> 42:39.180]  not going to stop. They're not going to stop because they're just like degenerate gamblers.
[42:39.180 --> 42:44.460]  They just keep doubling down, doubling down, doubling down because they're mentally ill.
[42:44.460 --> 42:49.500]  Look at Pelosi. The president has been acquitted, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be right back on
[42:49.500 --> 42:52.740]  the other side. The Democrats have already fired it back up. They say they're getting
[42:52.740 --> 42:59.260]  new impeachment articles ready. Unbelievable. Stay with us. I would thank you for everything
[42:59.260 --> 43:04.260]  you've done for the info war, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks. You want
[43:04.260 --> 43:08.180]  victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them
[43:08.180 --> 43:11.900]  off your back and off your children's back. You know what? I'm the same way. And that's
[43:11.900 --> 43:16.700]  why we're on the same damn team. And it's why in force has been delivering time and time
[43:16.700 --> 43:23.860]  again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because
[43:23.860 --> 43:30.820]  I'm committed to a future for humanity. And I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019
[43:30.820 --> 43:34.340]  for standing with us because you are the info war. And I want to thank you for committing
[43:34.340 --> 43:39.140]  to stand with us in 2020. However you can the bottom of my heart from my family and
[43:39.140 --> 43:43.660]  from the great crew at info wars. I want to thank you all because you are the info war
[43:43.660 --> 43:48.980]  and you know, that's not just words. That's reality. You have made history. We have made
[43:48.980 --> 43:57.700]  history together info wars.com only has power because of you and I suggest you use it. It
[43:57.700 --> 44:03.020]  was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the morning
[44:03.020 --> 44:08.060]  and said, son, you've got to see this, the company that holds the patents on the nano
[44:08.060 --> 44:11.660]  silver that's in our toothpaste that's in our immune garden and that's in some of the
[44:11.660 --> 44:18.340]  other great products like the super silver wound shell had reports from back in 2007
[44:18.340 --> 44:23.140]  with the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security with the director of Homeland Security
[44:23.140 --> 44:29.580]  certifying an unrestricted document confidential documents was noted as that this had been
[44:29.580 --> 44:34.580]  proven in their secret test to be knocking out SARS. Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless
[44:34.580 --> 44:39.620]  now they authorized us to talk about this. I talked about it on the show last week.
[44:39.620 --> 44:44.060]  Just hiding in plain view. This is a product that we had stockpiled and we're still selling
[44:44.060 --> 44:48.780]  it 40% off or more with the combos so you get it in your hands. It's something that's
[44:48.780 --> 44:53.740]  good for everyday use regardless and it funds the operation. So infowarstore.com for your
[44:53.740 --> 44:58.060]  immune gargle and other products that contain this key nano silver.
[44:58.060 --> 45:02.300]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[45:02.300 --> 45:06.420]  for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best
[45:06.420 --> 45:09.620]  toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling
[45:09.620 --> 45:15.260]  me you got to get up there and tell me. And so here I am telling people super silver whitening
[45:15.260 --> 45:20.580]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've
[45:20.580 --> 45:25.180]  tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference
[45:25.180 --> 45:29.700]  the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this,
[45:29.700 --> 45:34.300]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after
[45:34.300 --> 45:39.780]  I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are
[45:39.780 --> 45:45.380]  happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[45:45.380 --> 45:58.140]  rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[45:58.140 --> 46:03.180]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food
[46:03.180 --> 46:07.380]  supplies and medical supplies are running out. We know the virus has already spread to
[46:07.380 --> 46:12.540]  more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be
[46:12.540 --> 46:17.660]  arriving on the United States West Coast. We've now confirmed from major food suppliers
[46:17.660 --> 46:22.100]  across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods because
[46:22.100 --> 46:26.580]  of institutional and governmental buyers. That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big
[46:26.580 --> 46:31.720]  corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates. Info wars, private labels
[46:31.720 --> 46:36.380]  from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same factory. They called and
[46:36.380 --> 46:40.620]  let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a
[46:40.620 --> 46:45.020]  few weeks and that people need to order now. They want to be able to get it within seven
[46:45.020 --> 46:49.820]  to 10 days, but if people wait, it may end up being longer. But if you get your order
[46:49.820 --> 47:02.100]  in now at infowarstore.com, you will be secured to get the food within seven to 10 days.
[47:02.100 --> 47:23.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:23.800 --> 47:42.080]  The
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.840]  deep state has failed severely. The Liberty Patriot movement is taking over the Republican
[47:47.840 --> 47:59.520]  Party and the Republic. It's ours. America is falling back into our hands. The enemy
[47:59.520 --> 48:06.480]  can feel it. They said, is Mitch smart? I said, well, let's put it this way. For many,
[48:06.480 --> 48:15.200]  many years, a lot of very smart, bad in many cases, sometimes good, but people have been
[48:15.200 --> 48:21.080]  trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the
[48:21.080 --> 48:27.040]  subject come up because they've been wiped out so fast. This guy is great. And I appreciate
[48:27.040 --> 48:36.280]  it, Mitch. And he's also given us 191 now. 191 federal judges, two Supreme Court judges,
[48:36.280 --> 48:42.640]  right? Up to 191. The globalists have almost finished America off, but the public is back
[48:42.640 --> 48:50.640]  from the dead. As my Bismarck said, God loves children, drunks, and the United States of
[48:50.640 --> 49:02.640]  America. I don't know. That's what makes them good when you can read somebody. Fantastic
[49:02.640 --> 49:07.960]  job. Then he understood rightfully, this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics.
[49:07.960 --> 49:13.440]  How about all these people? They're running for office. They're saying the worst things
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.960]  about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side, most of them got wiped out. You know,
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.320]  they got their 1% or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. Let's go back
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.080]  to California. Let's go back to wherever they came from. Let's go back to New York. How
[49:29.080 --> 49:32.600]  about that one? Yeah, we were playing some of the live feed earlier now. We went back
[49:32.600 --> 49:37.640]  to where we left off so you get to see in here at all. After they get nothing. And guys,
[49:37.640 --> 49:40.400]  we're rolling this. Don't pause the DVR. But since people have already seen us for two
[49:40.400 --> 49:45.520]  minutes or so, I'm going to talk and we'll come back to the recorded feed. We're going
[49:45.520 --> 49:50.800]  to give the number out and have callers respond to this. I want to hear what the president
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.000]  has to say, but he's still going live. So we have 20 more minutes of this. But I do want
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.200]  to take your phone call specifically on this historically and on the coronavirus because
[49:59.200 --> 50:03.560]  there have been giant developments on that front. It's going to be a big challenge for
[50:03.560 --> 50:07.600]  the United States, and it is deadly to some, and it is spreading very, very fast, and it
[50:07.600 --> 50:12.160]  is engineered. That's now confirmed. So I want to take your calls on these subjects,
[50:12.160 --> 50:19.840]  877-789-2539. First-time callers today, we're taking first-time callers, 877-789-2539. First-time
[50:19.840 --> 50:24.240]  callers, give us your take on Trump. And what he needs to do to go on the offense against
[50:24.240 --> 50:32.920]  the deep state, what you make of the speech he's giving right now, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[50:32.920 --> 50:37.360]  And then just remember, I've got this statement here from my Patriot supply. When you order
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.040]  it at infoworkstore.com, we get part of the money to fund our operation. It's shipped
[50:41.040 --> 50:44.560]  out the very same time they're in our computer system. We're partners with them for over
[50:44.560 --> 50:50.760]  a decade. And so it goes right out. They worked seven to ten days. They had the food on hand.
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.680]  They just got to package it. Now it's 10 to 14. Right now they're at seven days. But
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.880]  the orders are so high, and everything's going so crazy. Just to be safe, they're saying,
[51:00.880 --> 51:06.560]  get your order in today. It's 10 to 14 days. But they have super high-quality, swarable
[51:06.560 --> 51:11.760]  food. The four-week is great to get. The four-month is great to get. They have a one-week. They
[51:11.760 --> 51:15.960]  have year-longs. They have two years. They have special diets. It's really high-quality.
[51:15.960 --> 51:20.040]  It's packaged in the best packaging you're going to find. And it funds the Information
[51:20.040 --> 51:25.120]  War. And I only partner with folks that have quality food and that deliver when they say.
[51:25.120 --> 51:30.680]  Everybody else, I'm telling you, it's a bad industry. And I'm sad to have to say that,
[51:30.680 --> 51:35.440]  that's just the truth. So we only partner with folks. They make the Alexa Pure. It's
[51:35.440 --> 51:39.920]  the highest-rated out there, a gravity-fed filter you're going to find. Okay? You can
[51:39.920 --> 51:43.320]  find some that are almost as good or right up there with it, like Pro Pure. We sell it
[51:43.320 --> 51:48.040]  too. Great folks. But I just go with whoever's the best. Who's going to be there long-term?
[51:48.040 --> 51:51.400]  I want to form a relationship. It's like, if I get married, I'm not trying to get married
[51:51.400 --> 51:55.040]  for two years. I'm trying to find a life partner. Sometimes it doesn't always work out. I've
[51:55.040 --> 51:58.960]  been divorced, married again. But I mean, I try to have relationships because I want
[51:58.960 --> 52:02.320]  you to be treated like I want to be treated. Last thing I want is one of our awesome listeners
[52:02.320 --> 52:06.200]  to have a problem. They're great. And they're selling out of food. And with this coronavirus
[52:06.200 --> 52:10.120]  and the 2020 and all the craziness, if they're able to pop the stock market, which the globalists
[52:10.120 --> 52:13.960]  are trying right now, then it is going to be very, very serious. I suggest you get high-quality
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.120]  storeable food before it all sells out. And then separately, the big bottle of immune
[52:18.120 --> 52:23.000]  gargle that has the patented nano-silver in it. But instead of me just saying this, let
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.640]  me show TV viewers. This is from Texas A&M University, Confidential. And then right
[52:28.640 --> 52:32.440]  here, you've got Department of the Army, Headquarters, United States Special Operations
[52:32.440 --> 52:37.520]  Command from the Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration. And then you've also
[52:37.520 --> 52:42.680]  got the head of Homeland Security in here, all saying in confidential documents at the
[52:42.680 --> 52:49.560]  nano-silver that we have in super-silver and in the super-silver whitening toothpaste and
[52:49.560 --> 52:52.840]  in the super-silver wound gel. That's their main product. We probably label it. We have
[52:52.840 --> 52:56.200]  original products with them because they're big listeners and big fans. And again, that
[52:56.200 --> 53:01.920]  is the nanotech company, ladies and gentlemen. So be sure and check all that out. And again,
[53:01.920 --> 53:07.000]  that's American Biotech Labs LLC, very, very respected. And they're not cowards, so they
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.440]  don't care. We even tell you who they are. So only the best for you. This will sell out
[53:11.440 --> 53:16.520]  within days. The one ounce will sell out by early next week. And then this middle-sized
[53:16.520 --> 53:21.320]  bottle, we've still got quite a bit of it, but it will sell out very, very quickly as
[53:21.320 --> 53:25.280]  well. And you're not going to get this high-quality product, these prices. We're not going to
[53:25.280 --> 53:30.480]  buy this product anywhere else, period. Imphalwarstore.com. That also helps fund our operation. A total
[53:30.480 --> 53:38.120]  complete 360 win. Okay. Let's go back to the president's speech that, again, is still ongoing.
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.280]  Here it is.
[53:41.280 --> 53:47.680]  After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, don't show me anybody else. This is the guy.
[53:47.680 --> 53:54.680]  He was the attorney general, did a phenomenal job in the state, highly respected. And Claire
[53:54.680 --> 54:00.200]  McCaskill. So the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaign. And remember the
[54:00.200 --> 54:03.240]  last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, and
[54:03.240 --> 54:08.880]  she wins. And people say, how did that happen? Didn't happen with him. But she got so friendly
[54:08.880 --> 54:13.240]  toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have, I'm putting it in the archives, is one
[54:13.240 --> 54:19.560]  of the best ads I've ever made. And she tried to convince people that we were best friends.
[54:19.560 --> 54:25.200]  But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And
[54:25.200 --> 54:29.800]  you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh
[54:29.800 --> 54:36.080]  Hawley. He was incensed, actually. I watched him. He was incensed at what they were doing
[54:36.080 --> 54:39.120]  and what they were saying. And those were the ones. You know, I had some that said,
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.120]  oh, I mean...
[54:40.120 --> 54:43.960]  You know why you're incensed? Because the Democrats work for foreign multinational governments
[54:43.960 --> 54:49.520]  and are totally ruthless criminals and are all in great danger. Their party has to end.
[54:49.520 --> 54:54.120]  The Republican Party has to break in two. Two-party system is much better than the European model
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.640]  of 10 different parties, 20 parties, because the party in power can always parlay and buy
[54:58.640 --> 55:02.800]  off the other parties to stay in power or just change their name. Two-party system is
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.120]  the best, and it's not perfect. We don't have a two-party system. We have the Democrats
[55:07.120 --> 55:10.080]  that work for globalists and want to destroy the country and create a race war. That's
[55:10.080 --> 55:13.640]  all they say. That's their mission. You've got the Republicans that were blue bloods
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.360]  didn't know what the hell was going on. We are taking the Republican Party over. We
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.200]  do need a two-party system, but the Democrats are only in blue cities through fraud. They
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.520]  are criminals. Look at the Iowa caucuses. All fraud. There's a siren on drugs right
[55:25.520 --> 55:28.800]  now that they're announcing they're going to re-caucas it. They say enough is enough,
[55:28.800 --> 55:34.440]  DNC chair, because everyone sees through their crap. The Democrats are an organized crime
[55:34.440 --> 55:36.720]  group.
[55:36.720 --> 55:37.720]  Back to the president.
[55:37.720 --> 55:45.600]  When down big, you saw that. You saw that, Mike. But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's
[55:45.600 --> 55:53.800]  difficult. Whenever I signed bills, you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's, it's
[55:53.800 --> 56:01.480]  big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1. 99 to
[56:01.480 --> 56:12.680]  1. I say, don't tell me who's the one. Is it Mike? Yes. And he always says a good reason
[56:12.680 --> 56:18.360]  for it too, by the way. But he is. He's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.200]  right, Mike. And I appreciate it very much. He's just fantastic. And say hello to the
[56:22.200 --> 56:34.360]  people of Utah and tell him, I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry. Okay. We can say that
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.120]  Mike Lee is by far the most popular senator from the state, but you've done a fantastic
[56:39.120 --> 56:46.880]  job, Mike, in many ways, in many ways. A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's
[56:46.880 --> 56:50.680]  been so supportive and I've had great support from other people in that state.
[56:50.680 --> 56:53.920]  Well, we got to go to break. We're going to come back a little more of this, maybe skip
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.640]  to the end when he was closing statements, but this is still ongoing live speech. We've
[56:58.640 --> 57:07.640]  just backed it up. So you have commentary. Your calls are coming up 8777892539. But they're
[57:07.640 --> 57:12.800]  not going to stop. So we should talk about how Trump must go on the offensive with only
[57:12.800 --> 57:17.160]  270 days left of the election. And now what we're going to demand of the Republican party
[57:17.160 --> 57:20.920]  because there's going to be other forces coming in the Republican party trying to control
[57:20.920 --> 57:25.440]  Trump and the populist movements. Just because we've gotten beachheads all across the world
[57:25.440 --> 57:28.480]  and come back from the dead and the new world orders in trouble doesn't mean now in this
[57:28.480 --> 57:32.720]  power vacuum that that that that we're out of the woods, we started to fight back and
[57:32.720 --> 57:37.440]  suddenly started to win. But we're not out of the woods yet. There's a lot more fighting
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.360]  to do. That's there's always a fight between good and evil, but it's amazing how to be
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.520]  here and make no mistake. Trump would not have won and been in this position to fight
[57:44.520 --> 57:48.760]  back without you.
[57:48.760 --> 57:54.120]  The demand for food has not let up. We are selling record amounts of it. Everybody else
[57:54.120 --> 57:59.440]  is basically already sold out or they have giant wait list. Our suppliers have it in
[57:59.440 --> 58:04.280]  house mistaken seven to 10 days to deliver because again, they have to package it. They're
[58:04.280 --> 58:09.040]  running 24 hours a day. But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer
[58:09.040 --> 58:12.960]  wait if you haven't gotten your order yet. So I wouldn't crash today. We wanted this
[58:12.960 --> 58:17.120]  virus to be peering out. We wanted to just be hype. Looks like it is really, really
[58:17.120 --> 58:22.120]  bad and is man made. And so that's why we're seeing the huge freak out. So get your storable
[58:22.120 --> 58:26.600]  food at info wars of store.com. That helps fund our operation. It's insurance. You can
[58:26.600 --> 58:31.600]  eat a total 360 win. Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at info wars
[58:31.600 --> 58:36.960]  store.com. Get your order in. It's locked in guaranteed seven to 10 days in full wars
[58:36.960 --> 58:42.720]  store.com. And regardless, it funds the operation. We also have the immune gargle of 40% off.
[58:42.720 --> 58:46.840]  We are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price info or store.com.
[58:46.840 --> 58:53.400]  Well, it's here the year 2020. World government's out in the open. We've got the predicted
[58:53.400 --> 58:57.920]  mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer. And we've got massive
[58:57.920 --> 59:03.640]  huge censorship taking place. It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that
[59:03.640 --> 59:10.480]  promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[59:10.480 --> 59:15.200]  Wow. Yes. Now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The
[59:15.200 --> 59:19.360]  pedophile leader real, but we're real as well. And we love God and we're standing up and
[59:19.360 --> 59:24.000]  saying no. But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never
[59:24.000 --> 59:29.360]  been in Kansas. We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter. Everything
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.160]  we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[59:34.160 --> 59:36.520]  gone through and everything we're going to go through. So it's an incredible time to
[59:36.520 --> 59:40.960]  be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember
[59:40.960 --> 59:47.120]  your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of m4store.com is critical.
[59:47.120 --> 1:00:01.800]  So please take action. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. I've got a tiger by the
[1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:11.600]  tail explain the sea. I won't be much when you get through with me. He never gives up.
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:20.480]  He's Alex Jones. Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide. Well, I've
[1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:31.200]  got the day. I appreciate that. Thank you. Just to kind of fit my dreams very early on.
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:35.440]  And we have, I don't know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:39.880]  of congressmen. I'll go over them quickly, but they have, they have also been, you know,
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:47.040]  it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first Kevin, right? Is that like
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:55.080]  a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:00.600]  because they have lousy policy, open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy.
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:06.240]  Who the hell can win? Oh, the new policies raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:10.560]  know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:15.280]  to say, we're going to lower taxes. They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders,
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:21.200]  sanctuary cities, raise everybody's taxes, get rid of everybody's health care, 180 million
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:25.520]  people in the United States, and they're really happy. And we're going to give you a health
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:29.000]  care that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:35.240]  does well. That's one year. So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:42.880]  do two things. They're vicious and mean, vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:49.800]  is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach
[1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:55.280]  a long time ago when she said, I pray for the president. I pray for the president. She
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:02:01.440]  may pray, but she prays for the opposite. But I doubt she prays at all. And these are
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:07.840]  vicious people, but they do two things. They stick together. Historically, I'm not talking
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:15.200]  now, they stick together like glue. That's how they impeached because they had whatever
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:21.640]  the number is, 220 people. So they don't lose anybody. They'll be able to impeach anybody.
[1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:26.200]  You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war and they say, let's get
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:34.120]  them out of office. And they stuck together and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:40.360]  come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch,
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:47.480]  have now gone up more than any time. I think since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened
[1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:54.120]  then. But in normal times, decades, you would call it. That was a little unusual time. It
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:03:01.160]  was for a very short period. The Republicans Party Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's
[1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:04.920]  poll numbers are the highest I've ever had that. And that's the skewed numbers, though
[1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:10.200]  it's much higher. Now Trump must deal the political death blow, start indicting people
[1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:16.160]  and he'll get in the Democratic Party because from my family standpoint, it's been very
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:21.920]  unfair. It's got to be disbanded to criminal organization. It's a mafia disbanded. That's
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:26.040]  not a radical statement. It works for chai comms. It's globalist. No borders, no walls,
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.560]  the USA at all in the Democratic Party outlaw.
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:35.920]  Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know that many people, they
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:40.880]  even have a print tie, bringing up an old favorite word of mind. The Republican Party splits
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:47.640]  into one libertarian or kind of like that style. The other super conservative. It'll
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:52.200]  be in the Democratic Party. There's got to be a path. In the case of Ukraine, he's a
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:58.160]  new president. Seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption.
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:05.720]  He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty, 2001, 1999. It's a treaty, signed
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:10.800]  treaty, that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:17.080]  a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:23.880]  when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:31.760]  all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine. Then goes
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:33.760]  to China, picks up $1.5 billion.
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:36.360]  Yeah. We're going to go to Breit right here and come back, and then I'm going to start
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:39.800]  going to your phone calls. And then we'll, throughout the next hour, play clips to the
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:46.880]  president. He's still speaking on the satellite, right? He's still live. He's still going.
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:49.680]  So how about we do this? We'll pause where we were, come back and play some of what he's
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:57.040]  saying live right after this break in 60 Seconds, infowars.com.

[1:05:56.680 --> 1:06:14.400]  The president has been speaking for about 45 minutes. Let's go to what he's currently
[1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:19.880]  saying and we'll back it up for parts that we've not gotten to. Then we're going to
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:25.080]  your phone calls. Respond to this historic event. I am Alex Jones, your host. And the
[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:29.960]  Democratic Party is a criminal mafia that must be disbanded. We need a real two-party
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:34.080]  system. The Republican Party should become the totally dominant party and split into
[1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:39.320]  two. That is the right move to make. The Democratic Party are only in power in blue pockets of
[1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:42.760]  election fraud. That's been documented. Look at Iowa. They're having to recoccus it now
[1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:45.760]  because of the total fraud that has been announced here at Esch.
[1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:53.440]  Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing. The man and the woman and they came
[1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:58.480]  and they didn't have rifles. They were against supposedly pretty good shot shooter with rifles,
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:04.760]  good equipment, and all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:13.080]  shooting. And it's so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle and
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:17.960]  he's hitting people and he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:21.960]  have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entrance
[1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:27.200]  way on the other side where he was. So everyone went into the dugout, ran into the dugout.
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:28.200]  It was definitely a start-up.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:32.840]  Steve was really hit badly in the stomach and with a bullet that rips you apart.
[1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:33.840]  Steve's police.
[1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:39.480]  Steve's police was supposed to do that. It rips you apart. And these two people came
[1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:48.400]  charging forward, boom, boom, boom. And one of them, you know who? One of them, him, got
[1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:56.040]  the shooter, hit him, and then got him, killed him from long distance. It was amazing. If
[1:07:56.040 --> 1:08:00.840]  you didn't have those two people, you could imagine, right? You could imagine what would
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:06.000]  have happened. So Milani and I went to the hospital that night and he was in such bad
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.320]  shape and he's been working ever since so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:19.120]  game at the National Spark and I'm watching. And it's on television. And it's just, you
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:24.560]  know, game people, you want to win it, right? And Steve's the second base. The poor guy
[1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:26.840]  can't even walk.
[1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:31.680]  Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louis.
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:36.280]  Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball's hit the shortstop, Bobby Richardson's the
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:41.920]  second base. But Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it's hit the first base, he'll
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:50.360]  throw it to the first base. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Skellies. Steve had
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:57.480]  no range. One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:03.440]  get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. And this is a true story.
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:09.400]  So the game starts and the first pitch, Steve's in his second base and the guy is really in
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:19.080]  bad shape. And I said, this is terrible. A shot, round ball shot, is hit the second.
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:24.920]  And Steve, I say, I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, this is not good. That
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:32.040]  ball was going toward him. And this guy stopped that ball, caught the ball. He's now laying
[1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:37.360]  down. He throws the ball the first base he gets about. I said, it's the most incredible
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:42.440]  thing. I've never seen athletic. I've never seen anything like it.
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:48.720]  What Trump does is he humanizes everybody and he shows the world he's human, not this
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:51.800]  demonized creature, this straw man they built.
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:56.200]  Because you could never do that again in a million years. But you weren't going to let
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:10:01.800]  that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:07.160]  ball was not going through you because you are a warrior. Steve, he is fantastic. You
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:12.760]  are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin, what a great, what a group. I mean, what a group.
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:16.040]  I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:22.680]  there, maybe a different story, maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:32.520]  want to thank you, Steve's Collise. And, Elise, you, I just read the story. It's the most
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.600]  incredible what's going on with you, Elise. So I even said, you know, I was up campaigning
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:43.040]  for helping her, but I thought she looks good. She looks like good talent. But did I not
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:46.520]  realize when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise.
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:52.000]  All right, again, we're analyzing what the president said. I guess he's being friendly
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:56.360]  and trying to be human, which he is everybody. I'd like to see more attacks on the deep state
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:59.560]  and the globalists. And there's going to be criminal action against him. He's already
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:03.440]  said some of that. And you can go to drudgerport.com. There's a nice bull down of that. We have
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:09.520]  a bull down at infowars.com and newswars.com as well. He said it's total BS. Caught Comey
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:15.400]  in the act. It was all BS, evil, dirty cops, leakers, live, high noon, Trump triumphant,
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:19.520]  and then calls for Iowa to recanvas. You know, the Democrats are saying they're basically
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:24.280]  probably going to do that. There's so much going on, but I want to open the phones up
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:30.320]  and ask you specifically, what do you think President Trump needs to do on the offense?
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:35.200]  How will the deep state strike back? Because I can tell you here at the ground level, it
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:42.160]  is directed by Hillary, by the DNC and by Soros, and they are just attacking on every
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:47.360]  front. They're running intelligence operations on the ground. They are running fake lawsuits,
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.320]  dirty tricks. They've got special districts they've sued me in where they can obviously
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:57.680]  have the judges eating from their hands. And they still keep believing they're going to
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:01.760]  remove him. And that's why they've got to keep their actions going against everybody to make
[1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:05.880]  it look like they're still on the offense and can't be beat. So all their minions stay
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:10.200]  in place and keep obstructing and blocking an American recovery. And that's why they'll
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:14.280]  go for another impeachment. They've said they will probably before the election is to take
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:19.600]  all the oxygen out of the room and to dominate things and to make Trump go on the defensive
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.120]  instead of going on the offensive. But it's being reported by NationalFile.com, GOP on
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:31.920]  offensive. Party pushes for Hunter Biden's records. Ethics complain against Pelosi. We'll
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:38.280]  see if that indeed happens, ladies and gentlemen. But there is so much more that we're going
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:42.400]  to be breaking down here today. And I have not gotten into the latest on the virus. I
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:45.680]  should do that right now and then go to break and come back with your calls. Bio weapons
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:51.560]  expert exposes coronavirus as a weapon of war. The coronavirus outbreak could derail
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:58.280]  Xi Jinping's dreams of a Chinese century. It's time. Coronavirus, Chinese media, giant
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:03.520]  list death toll at 24,000 but quickly changes. So again, that that matches yesterday. The
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:07.360]  number of infected they were saying now it's now it's done. Now they're saying it's the
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:12.120]  number that died and they changed it back. Interesting. China deploys thermal drones
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:17.520]  to scan villagers for coronavirus from the sky. So it's all part of the robot takeover
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:21.960]  by the state because the robots will follow orders. China scrambles to find beds for virus
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:33.840]  patients as death hits 563. A floating prison. Cruise of Asian ends in virus quarantine was
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:40.200]  constant coronavirus case brings total the US 12. And there's so much more 10 more diagnosed
[1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:45.760]  with coronavirus aboard quarantine ship off Japan. We've got Erie drone footage of Wuhan
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:54.880]  reveal city that really is a ghost city. That is all coming up here today. We have so much
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:14:00.560]  other news going on a known Al Qaeda operatives that have been able to get into the US caught
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:08.400]  in the United States. YouTube pledges to remove manipulated election related videos. So anybody
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:12.920]  that they call manipulative. I mean, even you're being totally truthful like come to
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:17.680]  our restaurant. We have the most delicious, juicy food and we know a half off on burgers
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:24.320]  on Tuesdays. That's manipulative. The word propaganda just means to propagate. We think
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:27.720]  of propaganda is a bad thing. No, there's black propaganda, great propaganda and white
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:33.760]  propaganda in those terms. I tell you, Hey, this is a really great product. You need it.
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:38.000]  That's manipulative. But it's the truth. And the best manipulation is the truth and just
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.320]  treating people like you want to be treated. But again, now they're saying YouTube pledges
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:49.160]  to remove manipulated election related videos. And if someone flags it and says it's manipulative,
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:53.600]  then they take it down because the community, oh, we didn't lynch you. Just like under the
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:58.080]  Maoist system. If the students wanted an adult arrested or killed, then it happened because
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:05.920]  the community guidelines said do it. That's all coming up as well today. Huawei pledges
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:12.680]  5g network for EU market. German paper admits that most most boat migrants are not real
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:17.680]  refugees, but our military aged men invading to get free welfare and quote, engage in
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:22.680]  jihad. French police clear rat infested migrant camp in Paris. All over the US. They're admitting
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:27.360]  that migrant camps are causing the poisoning of the water supplies, homeless camps, including
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:33.440]  local water supplies, get Daniels info wars.com. This is how you make us a third world country.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:39.600]  How you sabotage us. Every policy is to sabotage us. China shoots people in the head that try
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:43.760]  to run past quarantine and the UN says they're doing the great job. The same UN official
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:48.880]  then said, as you know, on Monday that the US shouldn't block any flights and it's xenophobic
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:52.960]  from China. So nobody else will take the flights. That's fine. But when we don't take the flights,
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:16:00.640]  we're bad. We can all agree these are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your

[1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:00.960]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storeable foods. I would have storeable foods because
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:05.600]  2020 is very dangerous here. The bubble is so huge and can pop. I hope it doesn't. It's incredibly
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:09.120]  dangerous and an elemental cause. Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:12.960]  bubble pops. So, I've been promoting storeable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:17.440]  It's insurance you can eat. It lasts 25 years. We go out and find the very best companies that
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:21.840]  have the very best quality at the very lowest price. And that's my Patriot supply. And then,
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:25.920]  so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it as
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:31.040]  in full wars select. And they are saying that they've never sold this much food. They're still able,
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:35.360]  within seven to 10 days, to ship it to you if you get your orders in on their small orders,
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:41.040]  their big orders. Seven to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you if you get your order in now.
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:46.160]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now. So, get your orders in
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:50.080]  for high quality storeable foods right now for all the reasons out there. And it's insurance
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:55.600]  you can eat and it funds the InfoWare, a total 360 win. InfoWareStore.com.

[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:39.200]  I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country.
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:44.960]  She was right about that. And it's just not worth it. That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago.
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:52.640]  And I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame. But as I said, if we can put this
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:59.600]  genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do, prescription
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:04.640]  jobs, you know, we had Secretary Azar's here, and I want to thank him for this, but we had
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:11.600]  first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year, first time in 51 years.
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:17.280]  But what we can do working with both parties in Congress would be unbelievable. It'd be
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:21.440]  unbelievable. All we can do, and I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it, and Mitch
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:23.680]  is working very hard on it. But what we can do is...
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:27.120]  All right, folks. Again, I call this a press conference. I don't know if you take questions
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:33.600]  or not. Probably not. It's just his statement, his high and end statement on the whole fiasco
[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.880]  that's been ongoing. I'm just saying, how are the Democrats going to be punished for this?
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:40.480]  How are they going to be held responsible when it turns out the president was innocent?
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:44.320]  It's what he asked. They said that was intimidation while they were attacking him at every level,
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:48.000]  saying he should be put in prison, that he should die. That's what Maxine Waters said.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.040]  What was the quote?
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:55.280]  Indite, convict, imprisoned,
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:02.400]  put in solitary confinement, executed. It's just all been out of control.
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:08.240]  And I'm going to have to decide that if Trump doesn't do anything about this,
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:10.400]  that he's a masochist and likes pain.
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:20.880]  Because I'm getting sick of it. I get treated like hell in the streets and that's okay. I don't mind
[1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:24.960]  having... Most people shake my hand but having some attack me. But I don't want to sit there and
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:29.520]  take it forever and watch them, like a bunch of damn peacocks, strut around and piss on me
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:33.680]  and my family constantly and try to overthrow the country and tell me, Democrats come up to me and
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:38.320]  they say, they said at the gun rally, there was, they were a tiny minority there. They were totally
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:44.080]  freaked out seeing probably 10% of the crowd being black, another 15% or so Hispanic, a lot of Asians
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:49.040]  out with their guns, over 30,000, 40,000. The media said 25,000. That's way more than that.
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:56.560]  And the left was all freaked out, white college types with their cameras and all their stuff
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:23:00.400]  out there working for different law firms. We let her confirm. They'd say, you're going to
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:06.720]  effing prison, Jones. We're going to kill you because these are authoritarians. That's why you
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:13.600]  get all the, now it's like seven or eight Bernie Sanders campaign members saying we're going to
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:17.840]  put conservatives in concentration camps and kill them, but not before we work them to death.
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:23.280]  And you learn it's some drug addict, criminal living in his mother's basement,
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:27.680]  but that's the type of person that wants to be a concentration camp guard.
[1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:34.800]  So we've got cancer. With Trump and the rest of us, we're discovering it.
[1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:44.000]  But I mean, people are so weak. That's why they seek radical power because they don't think about
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:50.880]  the other side of using that power. But I can tell you, I don't want to put them in concentration
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:56.080]  camps. I want these people to be investigated. I want them to be indicted and exposed as a
[1:23:56.080 --> 1:24:00.720]  criminal group and removed off our back because they're going to keep attacking like a mindless
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:09.040]  zombie. Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, like old decrepit zombies, are emblematic of this.
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:17.360]  And it's like in the last man on earth with Vincent Price. They're just wandering around
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.680]  his door every night. They're slow and they're stupid, but you can't ever not be on your guard
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:30.000]  because they do not stop. They never go away. They never back down. They just attack, attack,
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:36.720]  attack, attack, attack. And anything good, anything strong, they attack because they see
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:41.920]  that as strength. They don't want fences around your houses, but they have walls. They don't
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:46.560]  want walls, but they have walls. They attack the family. They try to give known pedophiles
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:51.920]  access to your children because they are turned over to evil. They've been given over to great
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:25:00.160]  delusion. Let's see where the president is now on the Y feed. That act of community gave me the strength
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:07.520]  to keep going. It saved me in a time when I didn't even realize how much I was struggling.
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:14.720]  You know, and in a way that president has finished and we're getting footage of Pelosi who I was
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:20.640]  just talking about hodling around and nothing against old people or people that, you know,
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:24.880]  look like a creep keeper, except out of people that know her or been, let's just say around her
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:30.560]  up close, they say that she literally is scary as hell and doesn't even know who she is half the
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:37.600]  time. And again, that's who the globalist have is people like that that are tool backs and they're
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:41.600]  all investing in the idea that Trump's going to get removed, that everything's going to go back
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:45.680]  the way it was. Regardless of what happens to Trump, America's awake to your new world order.
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:50.000]  We understand your operation. It's never going back that way. Nathan, Johnny, John, Tim,
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:58.640]  Aaron, Robert, Michael, Justin, Kevin, Mike, we're going to all of your calls.
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.840]  Let's go ahead and go to Kevin in Florida first. Kevin, thanks for holding your own here.
[1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:09.840]  Thank you so much, Alex. I just want to spend a moment or two talking about this,
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:15.920]  this coronavirus. And I want to be very clear to people and your listeners and you are very
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:21.440]  smart that this is a game that we've seen plays. This is no different than the anthrax vaccine.
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:26.880]  This is no different than SARS. This is no different than the swine flu. This is another
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:33.600]  push to try and get these forced vaccinations on people with these psychotic people in labs
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:39.120]  touching up these viruses that they claim to kill everyone in their site. And I just find it very
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:46.560]  hilarious that there's in excess of 28,000 to 30,000 cases and there's only 500 potential deaths
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:55.840]  of this deadly, deadly outbreak vaccine. If you go on and you even doodle, if you doodle any of
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:27:02.480]  these supposed deadly, chill viruses in the symptoms, they all say extremely rare from anthrax
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:08.320]  to SARS to swine flu. And I think people just need to wake up because this is the plan of what
[1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:14.080]  they're going to do going forward. Specifically, obviously, the globalist want to use outbreaks
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:18.560]  to bring in world government to answer the global crisis. But how can the UN tell China you're doing
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:23.440]  a great job shooting people that run checkpoints and locking people up in their houses and burning
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.680]  bodies and mass graves? It's obviously much bigger than they're saying. But then the same UN
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:33.600]  officials say the US is xenophobic and bad for not allowing flights from China. Russia's closed
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:39.120]  its border to China and blocked all flights. The other countries before we did. So how is it that
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:43.440]  America's xenophobic and bad that we've done the exact same thing other countries have done?
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:50.560]  It just shows the UN is completely out of control. I completely agree. I look at it like the
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:56.640]  situation where the old Twilight Zone episode with the obsolete man, I really believe that
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:02.880]  they're trying to make America the obsolete man because it's just a form of hypocrisy that you
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:07.680]  could do something and get mad. But when we do the exact same thing, like you said, it's total
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:13.440]  anarchy. Well, what it is, it's a war on logic. So I think what you're trying to say is all this
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:17.840]  virus hype is going to push force inoculations in drone surveillance. We're now seeing it.
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.560]  Lot bound cities, robots controlling us and watching us, the perfect control for authoritarian
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:26.560]  state like China to use that against their population that's been rebelling against them.
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:32.560]  Absolutely. I think it too, it goes a little bit further. I think that, you know, they've done
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:37.520]  a wonderful job of dumbing down the population with the chemicals they put in the food because
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:41.440]  you've seen it. Like you said about these, anytime they have any sort of these rallies,
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:46.000]  these people are a soulless, you know, they can't form complete sentences.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.320]  The folks that are on the enemy side are hypnotized. They're not as bad all as you think.
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:52.400]  They're in a sleep state medically.

[1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:06.640]  dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus. It has now infected hundreds and hundreds of
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:12.160]  thousands of people. It is now spread across the entire planet. And of course we've now
[1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:17.760]  discovered that indeed it is manmade and engineered. We're covering it live all with our team and

[1:33:15.840 --> 1:33:23.280]  but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply an extension of what began in the
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:28.880]  old one it has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:35.520]  of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:41.840]  advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:49.280]  one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:34:01.280]  this is mr romney wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth he's a citizen of the state
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:07.520]  but will soon have to be eliminated because he's built out of flesh and because he has a mind
[1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:13.440]  and mr romney wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:40.640]  we've got loaded phone lines i'm going to take every one of these calls ronda john
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:45.200]  not here in a moment oh and shroyer is going to ride shotgun with us i'd drug him in here i said

[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:54.720]  ride shotgun oh and uh you want to tackle the latest virus developments or president acquitted
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:58.880]  and what you predict comes next and how do we punish the deep state and not take this lying
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:02.640]  down again if i don't see offensive action from the president i don't know what i'm going to do
[1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:07.200]  this is this is bs i don't want to just sit here and keep beating them while they while they sabotage
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:13.360]  and hold up the restoration of the republic well let's kind of do a quick recap of what we've seen
[1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:19.440]  this week it's been pretty historic i think alex and very significant on monday the democrats are
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:25.440]  now just publicly rigging their own caucuses and just telling the voters and screw what you vote
[1:35:25.440 --> 1:35:28.960]  for screw what you think we're just going to do this out in public and we're going to give it to
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:33.840]  buda judge even though sanders won and we're going to allow you to watch us do this and
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:38.640]  that's just how it's going to go and that got exposed and so i think a lot of people were
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:43.600]  awake to that not to mention the fact democrat turned out way down even sanders as the leader
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:49.760]  had less uh votes in this caucus than he had in 2016 and by the way just like in england and other
[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:55.520]  areas socialist and communist and globalist parties are dead labor's gone you've got over
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:36:01.040]  10 major parties in england and uh you had the conservatives blending with over 50 something percent
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:07.520]  that it's over for labor it's so the same thing we can kill this party now if we how do we do that
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:12.160]  because they are a criminal anti-american group that says the country shouldn't exist well that
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.200]  that's not a political party that's a foreign enemy operation well it's death from within and
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:23.280]  so monday's headline was democrat party in total panic and disarray then tuesday we had what to
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:30.080]  me will go down at least so far for me the greatest state of the union speech in america's history
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:36.320]  at least in modern history um from my experience still reverberating i think still resonating
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:43.520]  still drawing emotion uh and then you had wednesday the acquittal of president trump on both the
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:49.440]  false articles of impeachment that was a major victory for trump politically they had it all
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:53.520]  tied to have him already impeached and gone by the time the state of the union but everything
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:59.200]  these devils wanted is now turning against them and so now here we are today i think kind of looking
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:03.920]  at the last three days president trump just did that i mean you could call it a press conference
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:09.120]  which he just says there's a celebratory speech uh for the fact that he was acquitted and and again
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:17.120]  still reverberating the state of the union and so i think we're all waiting and i've talked about
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:22.000]  this with you before alex we're all waiting it's like the fourth of july the sun just went down
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:26.480]  we got our popcorn and our drinks and we're ready for the fire washington till it tail till he takes
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:30.480]  it the enemy he does that he'll be the greatest president soon towards washington and i don't
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:35.920]  know if trump is measuring things to say i'm gonna wait and wait on the democrats to continue to
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:39.840]  eat themselves alive and expose themselves they start indicting a few of them they're all gonna
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:46.800]  turn on each other like a pack of piranhas well they're so easy to defeat president obama uh well
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:52.080]  actually president trump said it today that if if what happened to him happened to president obama
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:57.120]  people would be in jail well what does that mean that means time for people to go well that was
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:02.000]  definitely what he was saying is we're going after him and you have right now with matt gates and
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.640]  other republicans they have filed a motion to actually remove nancy polosi from office she
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:14.560]  violated us code i believe 18 subsection 270 when she ripped up the state of the union speech which
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:20.880]  is a historic document when she ripped that up she actually violated the us code and and is subject
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:25.360]  to fine and removal that's because she's literally under chai com control her and dine feinstein on
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:29.840]  record have chai com operatives inside i told people three years ago you'll start seeing all
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:35.520]  these confucius chai com centers universities busted because they literally have the the data
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:40.800]  hack that obama allowed of the office of personnel management of all u.s. government employees
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:46.880]  operatives former agents that was given and they were so dumb the chai coms were so arrogant
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:52.400]  anyone that had worked in the pentagon anyone that was a republican anyone that had been the cia
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:58.480]  anyone that had could not get a job in academia or scholarships or phd's and they were telling them
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:05.120]  that ut sorry and then of course they had their phones tapped as they were sending these guys in
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:08.080]  they had their phones tapped they're like they would run the check and and they would get back
[1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:12.800]  to database don't hire them the chai coms were literally loading up the universities with their
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.800]  people i mean that's how far gone we are and so these people have all committed crime they're
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:20.160]  like we've got to win we've got to get rid of trump we're gonna have this big holy time and
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:23.840]  the chai coms are going to give us all the power and we were going to put the conservatives in
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.440]  death camps but it's didn't go the way they thought but you can't leave piranha like cancers
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:32.880]  like that operating we got to go to one call but just go ahead oh and well i would just say
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:38.480]  in closing what we're seeing right now is a window of opportunity and the momentum on our side it's
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:42.880]  kind of like you know in sports when you get momentum you want to step on the opponent's neck
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:46.960]  you want to drive drive it down their throat and you want to have that victory you want to seize
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:51.360]  that 30 40 years of kicking our ass we have to finish it you don't let you know and there's just
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:55.600]  so much momentum criminals always gloat over when they're winning we don't gloat we go in for the
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:00.160]  attack and we finish i just don't know if they'll be this much momentum behind trump to finally
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:03.920]  act for justice and arrest some of these deep staters as there is i think it's up to us to
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:08.400]  light a fire in his ass i think that the let's talk about that way i said i'd say calls but
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:11.440]  let's go to john and idaho john thanks for holding what do you think is going on here

[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:25.440]  operations officer on the coronavirus quantify that and tell us what you think hornia just recently
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:30.720]  moved to idaho a couple observations because that's what we were trained to do uh here in boise
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:35.680]  there is nothing being talked about but you go to the local home depot there's no n95 masks
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:43.600]  back in the bay area they're holding a emergency job fair in the east bay for liquid o2 drivers and
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:49.520]  co2 which is used in the hospitals for respiratory distress and they're also opening up travis
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:55.520]  air force base for a quarantine area so there's some things going on behind the scene that if
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:00.480]  people didn't pay attention uh you wouldn't really know so i think they think this is coming or they
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:04.160]  know it's coming but yet they're not telling the public well what you're saying is totally
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:08.160]  confirmed i don't know did you hear me about a week and a half ago or i guess last monday not this
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:14.000]  money but last monday about 12 days ago say that we have big news they're they're establishing
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.800]  emergency centers uh on the west coast they see seattle as the main epicenter and they know it's
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:22.800]  already broken quarantine they know it's already in the population and they believe it's gonna i mean
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:26.960]  i was told that high level so was mike adam separate sources and we just decided to not be
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:31.120]  absolutely specific just because we didn't want to be people scaring folks but yes that's what's
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:35.280]  going on and you're just saying at ground level the best intelligence is ground level
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:40.080]  observation you're saying you're seeing action that shows they're gearing up they are to hold
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:48.720]  the specific job fair for the liquid o2 and co2 uh just literally right on kfbk radio and kcbs uh
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:53.520]  they need these drivers right away which if you just need the drivers you can get drivers but for
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:59.440]  those two specific things they're asking for that's due to respiratory distress uh and then through
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:03.600]  my buddies at callow yes they're saying that travis is getting ready like i said for a big
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:08.880]  quarantine area so it's just things that we're seeing in the people that i know behind the scenes
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:13.600]  that they're getting ready for but yet again they're not telling the public anything and it's
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:18.560]  thanks to folks like you and mike adams who go hey you know you guys need to get ready for this
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:22.880]  it's coming uh it's very hard to get through to people you try to tell them this they look at you
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:28.400]  like you're an idiot sometimes but uh you just do the best you can do john i don't want you to hang
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:31.440]  up because you only got like a minute and i want you to quantify what you were saying because i
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:35.840]  understand it but barely about they're trying to get the systems to deliver things for people that
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:39.760]  are aren't able to breathe and and and how that's being prepared so folks can look at that for
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:44.240]  themselves because they're doing a public call but they're not pointing out why they need it but
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:49.280]  it does show that's what they're gearing up for i was told by people at homeland security that they
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.920]  know it's going to get bad they don't want to say how bad well i'll tell you when we come back

[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:07.760]  extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:15.520]  clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:21.440]  france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:27.040]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:32.640]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:39.120]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:44.160]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:50.480]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.960]  destroyer is here with us right now and while we're feeling nice about defeating the democrats the
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:09.920]  fact that we put up with this so long is uh really a crime because these people are hurting a lot of
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:13.760]  folks the blue cities they have are collapsing homeless cancer polluting little water supplies
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:17.360]  all over the u.s diseases that are only in the worst terrible countries are now here they're
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:22.320]  trying to collapse society they admitted their own documents george soros funded extinction
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.600]  rebellion says we want to destroy civilization and take down humanity humanity is a cancer
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:32.560]  they just want to have an excuse to rule over everybody folks have a totally separate population
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:40.720]  it's malthusianism that was uh that was 300 years ago malthus was a british scientist and he
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:44.640]  wanted to cram the poor together to exterminate him not let him have sewage treatment he had all
[1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:50.400]  these plans it's called malthusianism and search engine that definition malthusianism let's pull
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:59.840]  that up we're fighting malthusianism i want to hear let's go back to john in idaho big prep
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:03.760]  for incoming outbreak repeat what you were saying that they have you're watching this around the
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:09.680]  country not just in idaho but but but the but the group's prepping for what again uh well basically
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:15.120]  i still have connections back in the bay area in california and uh so that they're they're doing a
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:22.560]  emergency job fair for uh commercial truck drivers for liquid o2 and co2 uh normally you wouldn't
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:27.120]  think anything of that but you're like why so specific but because of what's going on with the
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.720]  coronavirus uh you know they know what's coming and so this is what they're getting ready for
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:36.720]  it it's uh they've got to be able to dispatch those to other points around the us and bring it back
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:42.000]  quickly so you will basically so what happens is is you go to all the private contractors you know
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.960]  that are on the list for certain uh items generators you know o2 things of that nature you tell them
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:52.160]  hey we're getting ready to gear up well these guys obviously don't have uh the drivers that they need
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:58.320]  for what's being asked for uh they're also activating travis air force base as a quarantine area
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:03.600]  so it's just things that you you know observe throughout your career like hey this is not the
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:10.000]  norm uh but then again you know folks aren't being told to get ready for this and anyone you tell most
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:14.880]  folks they have this normalcy bias where they just think it's never happened it's not going to happen
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:20.960]  here we're fine i don't think they realize how fragile the ems system is uh you know a couple
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:25.600]  things great a whole bunch of things it's completely overwhelmed and it starts to break down and people
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:30.080]  need to be able to take care of themselves uh that's right and let's let's quantify that
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:38.080]  this isn't normal because they're not hyping it but the real ground level action is for a crisis
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:42.560]  same thing in china not hyping it but acting like it's the end of the world clearly thousands of
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:46.880]  videos coming out showing all sorts of mayhem shooting people at checkpoints building locked
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:53.200]  in homes piles of dead bodies and body bags clearly this is much bigger as a individual that works
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:57.440]  in emergency management as you were saying what do you gut level think this is the evidence shows
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:51:04.080]  it's an engineered bio weapon uh and and and that it leaked out somehow uh what i think it is or what
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:09.040]  i hope it is i hope it's something that burns out over there and doesn't really get you know it's
[1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:14.640]  claws in over here uh folks that don't know things usually mutate out into a more harmless form
[1:51:15.440 --> 1:51:21.280]  sometimes um or they're bringing people in continually and you know 14 days from now we're
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:26.080]  going to see things just explode and they're going to try to keep things under wraps uh and then they
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:30.640]  won't be able to because the systems will be overwhelmed and that's the fear is that the
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:36.400]  actions will have been put in place too late and and we'll get overwhelmed so exactly and that will
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:41.200]  hurt the economy all right you're really smart that's a smart caller i love these callers uh oh and
[1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:45.040]  i'm going to pull the articles back up i covered it like on the sunday show that had bad audio and
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:50.080]  stuff i apologize that's my fault but the first hour of it but i had like where the head of the
[1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:58.080]  un uh response to the who world health organization was saying oh uh china's doing a great job
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:02.480]  blocking these cities down and doing all this that we really commended total quarantines everything
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:07.120]  walking people up in their houses but then the u.s said well we're going to block flights now
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:11.840]  one of the last big countries to do it and china said that xenophobic and bad and and and so did
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:19.120]  the un very same people that's crazy shoot people in the head that's fine in your country but let
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:25.360]  them into the u.s what the hell well and the un didn't criticize russia or japan or south korea
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:30.960]  or the philippines or anybody else anything self preservation is just you know considered
[1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:38.160]  somehow xenophobic these days that's just pretty standard i think that it's amazing the human rights
[1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:44.320]  violations happening in china right now that will go ignored obviously long before the coronavirus
[1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:49.760]  outbreak but people are you know this isn't just a quarantine situation this is essentially a full
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:56.160]  on lockdown they're boarding people's doors up they're boarding entire apartment complexes up
[1:52:56.880 --> 1:53:02.640]  if you go into one of these roadblocks they have set up and you approach the troops or the government
[1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:08.800]  that is stationed there and you get shot many times to death but we've got to let them all fly here
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:14.560]  this is insane let's go to calls here i want to go to johnny in connecticut then i'm going to go to

[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:12.880]  talk about the president's victory here but uh you know the the amazing callers that you've had
[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:20.160]  today you know very quickly trump big victory with his speech the other night today i think it's
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:26.000]  sort of cheapens it when he uh comes out like you said uh on the defense this is the time for
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:34.320]  offense we've been saying this for a long time um it's it's almost with the with the acquittal
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:40.640]  yesterday after his uh state of the union he just looked a little weak today especially when he
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:46.320]  blathers on such a long uh a speech like he did today he's like saying all good things and he's
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:52.240]  thanking the right people but he he ran on putting these people in prison and he hasn't done that so
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:56.240]  part of me saying well maybe he's waiting till closer to november to pull out the big well let
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:00.560]  me say this people ask why matt drudge is pissed i know why and not because i've talked to drudge
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:05.680]  i see what he posed i say why is trump committing political suicide he posts the video why is trump
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:09.520]  for red flags i'm going to turn against him he puts it up why is trump not doing anything to
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:15.600]  save usage who he told release it and drudge drudge is pissed because he cares about journalists
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:21.680]  and he's saying to trump what are you doing and i'm not against trump but i'm kind of pigheaded
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:26.000]  i've been persecuted so much for supporting trump i'm i'm behind trump but i can't look at drudge
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.920]  who i know's been persecuted for supporting him and get pissed at him because trump is dropping
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:36.000]  them all we better see offensive action well and i would just say you know the average or i shouldn't
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:42.560]  say the average the most informed the the citizen elite trump supporter sees that the most ardent
[1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:47.600]  trump supporters uh alex jones totally censored off the internet roger stone facing life in jail
[1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:52.640]  oh enjoyer they're now being on james o' keith off twitter yeah okay so so i think the frustration
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:59.600]  here is like look we are the the organic citizen power structure and it's okay we get destroyed
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:04.400]  in a war but you better care about us and at least put up some air defense you know we just
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:10.640]  don't hang our ass out there while we get chewed up or you know the quote we have is i'm monitoring

[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.640]  that and so i think that's not that we're not willing and i'm not telling the story to get
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:29.600]  president any issues whatever but i mean i'm not gonna even get to it but one time the president

[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:19.280]  but fox news was anti-trump until he got the nomination fox news will probably end up being
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:23.520]  anti-trump before the next reelection cycle we're already seeing some signs of that it's time for
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:28.400]  trump with his power of president engage in real leadership and to just go on some of these alternative
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:32.080]  platforms that are getting banned getting the censorship give them some love oh my god that's a
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:38.080]  great plan he did a whole ban tour yeah it's not about us a whole ban tour to boost all that and

[1:59:58.880 --> 2:00:03.680]  trump knows the average wage in war on corruption from alex jones
[2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:08.960]  trump knows the average person just wants recognition and that's great people look at the
[2:00:08.960 --> 2:00:13.280]  arms and legs blown off for medals or at least that's what trump thinks that's not why they really
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:18.320]  did it that's why for most people it's embarrassing to get those medals i want victory over these people
[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:22.720]  because i know they're evil they're trying to dominate my soul and my will and i'm fighting
[2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:27.280]  against that but i didn't tell that trump story earlier to like act cool or talk about conversation
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:31.840]  with the president all i've said is this is a war take the gloves off don't believe your lawyers
[2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:36.080]  don't believe the candy asses get rid of these people around you anybody that's worked for sorrows
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:39.840]  get rid of them that's why they're all over the news at that time when get rid of jones take him
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:44.960]  off air suing destroy him don't the president see any alex jones don't let him talk to alex jones
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:50.240]  because i'm like you cannot trust the people you brought in and i had conversations with other
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:55.680]  folks were talking to the president at the time they're like well don't talk bad about john bolton
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:01:00.000]  you know i've i've had a lot of drinks with him and played poker with him and i said listen
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.480]  he's against everybody stop thinking that and later it's been proven right so yes that's all
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:09.040]  i've told the president to do is is remove all these enemies are now andy and i've never asked
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:13.760]  for something i want i've asked for action and i think now that's where we're going with this oh
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:20.240]  and uh oh and shroy arrived shotgun weathers for taking calls right now let's go ahead and go to
[2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:23.360]  steven in main you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:33.760]  hello yes sir uh hello alex how's it going uh a long time listener i'd like to say basically
[2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:39.280]  thanks for your philanthropy and putting your neck on the line out there every single day just
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:43.920]  stop it's not philanthropy we're all in the damn ship together this is survival and i appreciate
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:48.720]  you saying that brother but everybody thinks of fighting tyranny is philanthropy it's called america
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:54.320]  and freedom and real power is not putting up with crap we have not done our job is what we've
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:59.840]  gotten so behind the eight ball do that makes sense oh that makes complete sense i mean i'm from
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:06.720]  boston so i really know what it's like to live under basically an oppressive regime but i was
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:12.800]  blessed by the grace of god now i actually moved up to main and i get to live off grid in a log cab
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:19.360]  and really deep out here in the woods off a hundred acres in the u but i mean all i wanted to say was
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:24.480]  that people if they can get more in touch with you know their
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:33.120]  their survival instincts and their manly primitive instincts and stop listening to what people have
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:42.560]  to say for them like stop trying to be controlled basically because i know people in massachusetts
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:47.600]  where i'm from that they don't care about politics they don't believe that it's going to affect them
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:56.480]  in any way and they really need to just open their eyes gather blissfully ignorant exactly we sleep
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:03.200]  while our beds are burning exactly and also i'm actually a graphic designer uh i'm i'm living off
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:07.840]  grid i have a degree and i'd love to help out the operation in some way give us your name and number
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:11.040]  and i'll hand you over to kit dangles who's a go get her around here and if you'd like to help us
[2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:14.640]  with some stuff and it's great and we'll be able to pay it down the road we're maxed out right now
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:18.800]  but god bless you that's all the volunteerism we need we need your help folks we're in this
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:24.640]  together uh oh and you want to comment on what he was just saying well we know there's an attack
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:30.560]  on masculinity we know that's why hollywood and the entertainment industry is promoting men wearing
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:34.880]  dresses and thongs and all this garbage and you kind of just sit here and you open your eyes and
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:38.960]  you're just like well what is this nobody likes this well of course nobody likes it it's not about
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:44.640]  giving you what you want it's about force feeding yeah and graining that into children's minds too
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:48.400]  so children think that they think oh that's normal so you know children are growing up seeing the
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:51.840]  clint eastwoods they're not growing up seeing the elvis presley's they're not growing up seeing the
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:58.480]  john wanes uh they're growing up seeing nas in a female cowboy outfit uh they're growing up seeing
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:05.360]  gucci shows where um malnourished twigs that that are that are identified as male i guess
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:10.560]  stress up in women's clothing and so this is this is the attack on masculinity and and that's
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:15.280]  why i think the last caller calls in and says no get back in touch with your masculinity get back
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.480]  in touch with your roots period and it's so obvious and the white papers admit it's a scientific attack
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.320]  because the Carnegie Foundation was tasked by the president back in the 30s after world war one back
[2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:31.440]  in the 20s to create a system of no more war and they said in human systems as we know it but you
[2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:36.880]  know there'll be no war you can't get rich and famous on that level unless you agree to put on
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:40.400]  the dress you know what i'm saying like you got to get on your knees it's kind of like the game
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:46.560]  people think it's cool to be rich and powerful it's not no instead of just not caring it's so
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:52.160]  unpooled it's not real bona fides being real that's what it's about

[2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:30.240]  subject and others but just briefly here i want to show tv viewer something and radio listeners
[2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:35.280]  i'll tell you about it this is super silver wound gel this is private labeled by a very respected
[2:06:35.280 --> 2:06:38.960]  top nano tech company that is the only company that has had the pentagon
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:48.800]  come out and on a restricted basis classify what they're doing and actually use it for the military
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:53.440]  and special operations of the troops so we private label this this is in stores this is our private
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:59.520]  label this is the strongest silver you can get nano tech over the counter then we have it
[2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:04.880]  at a lower level because this stuff in high levels can be toxic super silver whitening
[2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:11.120]  toothpaste with above sea coral calcium permemory mineralization of the teeth and then it's got
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:20.080]  obviously the nano silver in it and so much more that is still available though it's selling out
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:25.600]  all of these products have this patented companies nano silver super silver immune
[2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:32.880]  gargle this will sell out the 16 ounces probably today or tomorrow this will sell out by early
[2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:36.960]  next week super silver immune gargle with a little spray bottle so you spray on your hands
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:41.920]  also spray your mouth you can ingest this you can swallow this and then of course the three ounce
[2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:48.880]  bottle this will take a week or two at current sales rates to sell out i don't know why folks
[2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:51.680]  want the little one they want the big one they don't want this one but this is the one you're
[2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:55.840]  going to end up getting if you don't order the other ones today because we have five times more
[2:07:55.840 --> 2:08:01.040]  of this than we have the others combined it's the exact same stuff it's very very high quality
[2:08:01.040 --> 2:08:08.720]  it's 3.4 fluid ounces and it's 15 parts per million but that's don't let that deceive you
[2:08:08.720 --> 2:08:13.680]  you could have something they claims you know way more but it's not nano silver it's not patented
[2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:17.600]  and then look i don't make claims without showing you i was only authorized to do this about a week
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:25.040]  and a half ago and i'll show tv viewers an over cam of this the texas a and m university health
[2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:32.800]  system center this is again confidential and it's the u.s. department of homeland security
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:41.600]  tom ridge and it goes over the fact that they're looking at this u.s. department of army
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:48.480]  headquarters united states operations command that's out of florida and andrew c von eckenbach
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:54.400]  md commissioner of the food and drug administration and they go on to say that the pentagon and an
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:09:02.160]  m and others have found that the american biotech labs llc patented nano silver has been found
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:07.440]  to knock out the sars it levels better than anything else they found at that time it's 2007
[2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:12.240]  and of course the corona virus is in the whole sars family it's the antecedent of it it comes
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:18.160]  with a progenitor of it so that's the type of stuff we sell what we bring to you the truth is
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:22.160]  any silver from our research helps with this stuff this is just the very best stuff you're

[2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:54.560]  they're like should we sell everything we've got to buy more food you think this is going to be
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:58.320]  really bad and i said gut level i think it's bad i think this is a real response because they don't
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:01.920]  know how bad it's going to be and i said just like you pointed out it's already been sold out
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:06.880]  everywhere uh and i said if i was you i would i would just buy everything you can get right now
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:10.960]  and they said that's exactly what we think we're doing that so they've gone see other companies
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:15.680]  don't gamble like that they'll just take your money and then get the food if they can after that
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:20.560]  my patriot doesn't gamble they're like me they just do what they go with their gut they sign
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:24.640]  on to it and that's the end of it and boy are they glad they bought that food well we can have
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:28.800]  two weeks ago this is two weeks ago now because that's all being packaged and shipped out and
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:32.960]  then they went ahead and bought more that's coming in and they're buying more food with the money they
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:39.200]  get and they're like god we hope we're not right about this we hope this is people need to prepare
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:43.440]  in this anyways it's insurance you can eat but it's really deteriorating quickly and you should
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:47.760]  get your orders in an info war store dot com they're in our system for many many years we're
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:52.000]  partners with them so as it comes in it goes right to the head of the line they're full spectrum of
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:57.360]  food you just drop ship it right out of info wars and then that funds our operation info war store
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:02.080]  dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine oh and um i want to go to these loaded
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:07.360]  phone lines uh here but just i'm just telling folks have whatever's whatever's going on behind the
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:12.320]  scenes that's our policy some people say man that's kind of weak and weird most people hold back
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:16.880]  in focus info can be used against you well even our big nano tech supplier of silver saw wanted
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:23.200]  their name to be known i think it's about telling people what's going on at a certain points so people
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:28.240]  just know where you're at for real it's it's it's not open yourself for attack if people want to
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:33.360]  join us publicly i think that kind of shatters the fear that goes on out there well i think more than
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:40.640]  that alex it's just i mean we're literally in battle mode i mean we're we're so it's like you
[2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:45.120]  imagine being out on the battlefield in the midst of like an epic battle that's been going on for
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:50.160]  three days and it's just non-stop explosions and gunpowder and just you know death and blood and
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:53.920]  gore it's like you know someone comes up to you trying to micromanage you're like what the hell
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:58.960]  like i don't have time to think about this do it go and so that's just kind of our entire like
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:04.240]  operation status is just constant go constant on the gas we don't have time to sit here and
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:08.800]  micromanage and decide oh we need to measure this here or measure this over there we don't have
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:12.480]  teleprompters that's what they do at all the other news organizations it's all psychotically
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:17.360]  ocd control that's why they're not next year's news today's as we are but i will just say this
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  the crew is probably gonna hate me for this but i'm just saying i would hate to see alex jones
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:30.640]  literally come while driving through that wall of emergency food supply for a ad i'm just saying
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:34.480]  i don't think that that would be entertaining at all and i don't think that would sell emergency
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:39.120]  food so uh well i feel really good about promoting this and i hope folks don't need it but all the
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:44.880]  all the craziness well i just doubled down i had a i had a supply of emergency food and i just doubled
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:49.520]  it too with with this uh with the supplies that we have here and it's so convenient too with the
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:53.920]  storage container it comes in i mean if you have i just have a tiny little closet in my house that i
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:57.840]  have for a bug out bag and medical supplies let's jam one call in let's see i don't mean
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:00.800]  interrupts if these people don't hold you along you're absolutely right uh who's been on the longest
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:06.160]  here uh let's go to mike in new mexico mike thanks for holding her on the air hey alex hey
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:12.080]  ellen hey brother got the call in thank you i want to talk about ukraine the deep state
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:18.400]  ukrainian uranium one money right before the last election there was an article that came out that
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:25.600]  had no traction and the guy had tracked the uranium one money down to crimea into numbered accounts
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:31.840]  there's a reason why the deep state was using ukraine and it was to have access to numbered
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:38.160]  accounts to launder that money and this falls into trump's speech this morning these people are
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:45.840]  broke russia moved into into the crimea and seized it seized banks seized money and broke the deep
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:53.520]  state right now trump mortally wounded the democrat party and what i want to see the president trump
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:58.880]  do is step up like any self-respecting big game hunter and finish off the democrat
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:04.640]  you know what you just said this morning i swore i'd do it i even wrote a note put it in my pocket
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:09.520]  to talk about trump did the right thing because you know your mind goes back and forth but
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:14.560]  he has to finish off the chi-com and globalist funding deep state funding into the deep state
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:19.840]  and that's why he's taken them out first defeating china first defeating the globalist first until
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:23.840]  he cleans up their minions he knows to cut the head off you're absolutely right so we should
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:27.840]  i think give trump the benefit of the doubt because that's why they're so pissed he's cut
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:33.920]  their money off that's why they're crazy oh gosh they're scared to death they're they can't defend
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:38.720]  themselves all they can do is throw whatever they've got on the wall and hope it sticks and they've
[2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:43.440]  run out of stuff to throw at the wall it's all right what we're seeing is total desperation

[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:48.560]  offense but then trump has been cutting off their chi com funding cleaning out the university's the
[2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:54.880]  chi com funding the pentagon's been indicting a harvard science heads and others that have been
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:21:00.160]  selling us out that they've been indicting a lot of people and so cutting off their minions scaring
[2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:06.320]  the rest of them i think that's a big thing is that what you're saying mike yes sir you know he's
[2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:12.160]  cut the money off he started at the bottom of the pyramid and he's working his way up he's given all
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:18.160]  these people more than enough time to quit harassing him to step back take a deep breath and get on
[2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:24.800]  with you know bipartisan politics you're right he gave him a lot of chances didn't he gave him three
[2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:31.600]  years to step up and quit and help the american people they haven't done it because they're slaves
[2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:36.080]  of corrupt globalists they can't help it they're all being blackmailed behind the scenes if they
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:43.440]  don't do what the establishment says and that leaves me right to the corona virus china was taken
[2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:49.120]  between three to five million unemployment people a month they were they were losing three to five
[2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:55.200]  million jobs a month for over a year and a half the corona virus is nothing but a population
[2:21:55.200 --> 2:22:01.200]  reset for pain and he doesn't care who gets hurt in the outcome and you're right and the globalist
[2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:05.440]  going back even we were threatened a nuclear war with them in the 60s and 70s they'd say good we
[2:22:05.440 --> 2:22:10.480]  have three people please hit us those are famous statements by moussey tongue and his adjunct and
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:14.800]  you're absolutely right they release it it hits us hurts us too it's a face saving for the reason
[2:22:14.800 --> 2:22:19.680]  their economy is imploding and it's a martial law takeover drill for the chai comms over their people
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:26.240]  they don't care where anybody else ends up population wise as long as they can get their
[2:22:26.240 --> 2:22:31.360]  population in line with their economy they're going to be happy and right now they need to
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:38.960]  shed about 200 to 300 million people to get their economy back on track this is why we have the show

[2:23:30.560 --> 2:23:35.520]  pelosi who you're running against tearing up the speech what did you make of that i mean
[2:23:35.520 --> 2:23:40.960]  it's being reported that democrats are turning against her a lot of uh member state reps others
[2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:47.200]  are now leaving the democratic party over the woman you're running against first of all hi alex
[2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:51.520]  and oh and it's great to see you it's great to be back you know this is disgusting i'm right in
[2:23:51.520 --> 2:23:57.920]  san francisco i'm in the thick of it i'm in her district and i am so outraged right now i was i
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:03.280]  didn't i didn't think that nancy could hit a new low you know but every time she does she really
[2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:11.680]  surprises me still but she is tearing up the president's speech it is so disrespectful to families
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:18.080]  it was so disrespectful to our american history so disrespectful to the president it made a mockery
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:23.840]  of our nation and a mockery of the the process i mean i would imagine that people are laughing
[2:24:23.840 --> 2:24:28.720]  around the world and thinking that our country is a joke because of her you know standing do you
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:33.920]  know people would be executed if they did that in other countries shredding the constant shredding
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:39.360]  the speech that a president or leader did behind their back like this on national television well
[2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:44.720]  on national television well she's saying i'm tearing up america i'm tearing up your vote i'm tearing
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:50.400]  up your election i'm tearing up the state of the union i'm saying yes on america she wanted
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:56.320]  to piss on the president it'd be the same thing that's how i felt it was a big f u it was a huge
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:03.200]  f u to me to americans to veterans and over 60 million people that voted for trump it's as if
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:09.280]  she thinks that we don't exist in her eyes that's why i'm so outraged that i'm so excited that i'm
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:13.920]  running against her my spanish and italian blood is literally boiling right now as if it wasn't
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:18.800]  boiling already enough and i'm not much more motivated to defeat her at the ballot box and
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:24.800]  it's why i'm also doing my my Pelosi for prison campaign because she needs to be called out and
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:28.960]  she can't get away with this anymore it's disgusting people who pointed out that she should be removed
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:33.920]  as the speaker that she violated oh and you were saying uh us law and a bunch of codes tearing that
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:39.440]  up well yeah it was i believe um you guys can correct me but i think it was uh us code 18
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:44.880]  subtraction 270 and by the way representative goes are i've just seen this he tweeted this out
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:51.680]  he went and found the trash bin that nancy Pelosi threw the tore up state of the union in
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:57.840]  and recovered it and taped it back together so i mean distinct about that representative
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:02.480]  recovers the speech torn up by Pelosi pull that up but how about this i mean let's it's not even
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:06.640]  that hard to investigate an nancy Pelosi and i will say this and i don't know how much uh diana
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:12.240]  lorraine knows about this she's busy on the campaign the fbi is now running an investigation over two
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:18.400]  public officials right now in san francisco uh mohammed uh monu i think is the guy's name
[2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:22.320]  and then another uh contract oh yeah running the homeless scams and skimming money off the
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:26.960]  top and this is not this is not interior in california so they can't run this thing into
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:31.840]  the ground they can't rig this thing up this is trump's fbi this is reyes fbi they're investigating
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:35.840]  these crimes it could make it all the way up to nancy Pelosi i wouldn't be shocked if it did
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:41.760]  but it wouldn't be too hard to investigate nancy Pelosi allegedly worth 200 million dollars this is
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:47.280]  on a federal salary of 200 000 dollars per year even though she has been in congress for three decades
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:52.080]  the math still doesn't add up it's time for an investigation of nancy Pelosi and i think if she
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:56.800]  were any other american she'd have a life sentence right now in fact i i've saw that you're working
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:02.880]  on that tell us the details of that yeah absolutely well i don't know if you guys heard the news but
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:10.480]  in san francisco right now as we speak there is a plane flying around with a huge 80 foot by 25 foot
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:16.400]  banner that reads Pelosi for prison and it's flying around right now in san francisco making
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:22.720]  liberal heads explode it is raining liberal tears here in san francisco in her district uh and you
[2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:27.600]  know we're gonna start this campaign you guys had hillary for prison it's time for polosi for
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:33.760]  prison she needs to be investigated and prosecuted for her crimes against america and uh if you go
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:41.840]  to my website polosiforprison.co somehow.com was taken but.co it has a petition sign the petition
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:46.880]  to get this campaign started trump has been acquitted he's been exonerated obviously this was
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:53.440]  all just a big cover-up as usual is projection for nancy polosi's crimes i am tired of it the
[2:27:53.440 --> 2:27:57.760]  american people are tired of it we're tired of being lied to every day i totally agree with you
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:05.200]  she looks completely mentally ill yes when when she's tearing up the uh the speech i mean what was

[2:33:40.560 --> 2:33:49.280]  address last night speaker nancy palosi ripping up her copy of the president's state of the union
[2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:53.920]  speech but he will not be acquitted the impeachment trial of president donald john trump is officially
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:58.160]  over the senate has anticipated did vote to acquit president trump on both articles of
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:03.840]  impeachment against him that's not how a democracy works that's not how it works that's not how any
[2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:18.720]  of this works bullshit remember that chinese smell remember that chinese spy that worked for diane
[2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:26.240]  feinstein for what 30 years was it she was she ran runs it yeah interesting what goes on out there
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:31.920]  in california crank this part up right here
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:47.280]  all right let's go back to our guests the anilorain the anna for congress dot com on twitter
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:52.080]  the anna for congress we've got loaded phone lines here i just wanted it we got a race to
[2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:58.800]  these where i'll never get to them you're running against palosi but it's emblematic that it's a
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:03.680]  power structure of corruption like royalty or like the dark crystal skexies that
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:10.240]  biden's kissing little girls in the lips and grabbing their butts and going completely insane
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:18.160]  on tv hillary doesn't know who she is at the time uh feinstein's gone crazy palosi's gone crazy
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:23.760]  maxi waters went crazy a long time ago they're totally disconnected from reality sitting on
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:29.520]  top these districts they control that have election fraud but even but the fact that
[2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:34.800]  there's not survival of fitness and no real political fights going on just leaves these
[2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:41.440]  dead cicadas i'd call them hanging on what do you expect to happen next because she could easily
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:47.200]  have a stroker just die anytime it looks like whatever drug she's messed up on uh while you're
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:54.240]  running against her well absolutely you know look uh i never want to wish ill will upon anyone
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:36:00.800]  of course but you know things happen right god works in mysterious ways and i do believe miracles
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:05.040]  we believe miracles happen for sure we if we didn't have miracles happen if we didn't have faith in
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:10.240]  trump would not be in office right so stranger things have happened and you know the biggest
[2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:14.800]  thing is i believe that there is an awakening right now and i think that there is a cleaning
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:19.840]  up of corruption that's happening she may very well who knows you know break her leg or get
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:25.600]  sick or something like that or get to see now that she cannot no longer uh be in congress so
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:31.040]  anything can happen and that's why that's so important for republicans to run in tough blue
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:36.320]  districts i am so tired of people telling me oh that's impossible you're never going to defeat her
[2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:41.120]  you know why even do that you know what again if we didn't have that we would just be waving the
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:45.440]  white flag of surrender and we absolutely need to run in tough districts you don't know what's
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:50.160]  going to happen we can't foresee the future but we're getting a groundswell of support right now
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.720]  there are a lot of conservatives in those tough blue places that feel like they're energizing
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:37:00.640]  them and giving them hope but let's expand on that sanders who i don't like really won the
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:04.480]  domination three and a half years ago but they cheated him out of it now everybody knows they're
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:08.880]  being cheated now they're watching forcing them to steal elections forcing them to cheat is what
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:13.600]  brings them down not giving them resistance that is what allows them to win all right we got to
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:19.600]  move quick now uh let's go to the longest holding caller michael in california thank you michael you're
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:25.440]  on the air go ahead wow she's really fired up that's great i'm up down here in uh los angeles
[2:37:25.440 --> 2:37:32.800]  california and she's right on the money um there are conservatives that are in the blue areas that
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:37.120]  you know we're not represented and that's the meat that's kind of turning the media we all know
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:43.200]  doesn't want to show them they don't want to take that and uh they don't want they don't want to
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:47.520]  allow us to have a voice so i just wanted to say there was kind of an analogy i wanted to give
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:53.760]  that i was um you know we're we're witnessing we do witness uh donald trump you know he's kind
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:58.480]  of being double teamed right now or has been double teamed by the globalists kind of in a basketball
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:03.760]  reference and us us and the people we're in the paint we need to finish this up we need to dunk
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:08.960]  this right on these globalists you know so they we should be in all their events shouting them down
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:14.000]  adam ship all of them we should get up exactly you can't sit here and hope for trump to do it all
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  no sir no sir we're the people we we we put them there we got to finish this thing up so you're
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:23.440]  saying trump and we the people it's it's that's what's got to come but you know just let me say
[2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:29.680]  this this is actually already happening okay shift got shouted down the other day everywhere in front
[2:38:29.680 --> 2:38:34.640]  of dozens of politicians uh after i did the obstruction of congress with uh that's what they're
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:38.400]  trying to accuse me of with with the the nadler crimes calling him out for all his criminal
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.920]  trees and you help trigger that it was it was here's the problem no one will cover it fox news
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.720]  covers it up fox news doesn't want to cover it's okay the whole world saw it and loved it of course
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:52.880]  they do but my point is that you're pointing out is that the the establishment is fox news as well
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:57.520]  and and and the the only way to pile drive through this it's being censored on social media it's
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:03.120]  being the people at media it's just pile driving through it never relenting continuing to shout them
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:07.680]  down don't let them you may be the person that asks the questions that gets out that triggers the
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:14.000]  total defeat and it's so simple i mean i remember when uh uh uh ben berglam went to shift and read
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:18.800]  him his Miranda rights because yeah that guy belongs in prison adam shift is a treasonous
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:23.600]  stumbag who belongs in prison and trump can sit here and have press conferences all day long saying
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:28.720]  this put his ass in jail that's right they're always saying harass us everywhere we're gonna
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:33.600]  harass them we're gonna get their face with the information michael we're all alex jones we're all
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.880]  own shawyer we're all project veritas and now we're all uh miss diana now you know so we we
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:44.240]  take up this fight we're gonna finish on strong you know that we have a future to to work for
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:48.000]  that's all i have to appreciate your time god bless you brother god bless you thank you we're
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:52.640]  going to the order we receive these calls erin in virginia you're on the year coronavirus
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:59.440]  give us your take on it uh yes alex i just wanted to call in uh with a little bit of a
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:05.920]  different perspective and put a thought out there on the coronavirus um about four years ago i got a
[2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:16.240]  virus um and the virus that i got left me disabled it totally destroyed my life and i was just thinking
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:22.000]  when i saw these people dropping on tv with the coronavirus that was one of the strange symptoms
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:27.920]  that i and several other people that got the same virus had and it made me think that maybe the virus
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:33.680]  has been here already for quite some time and the people who've been getting it and surviving it
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:40.000]  it's been crippling those um and that's kind of why the global cooperation and the quarantine
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:45.120]  measures really don't match up with each other because they know it's i know there's been a
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:49.040]  bunch of weird respiratory stuff going around it killed three of my family six years ago and two
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:53.680]  weeks they all got it within a few weeks which are all died within a month so you don't tell me i
[2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:57.840]  absolutely agree with you and that's you know elin got really sick respiratory when he got locked up
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:04.080]  the dc jail there's a lot of stuff going on out there yeah thank you erin go ahead sorry
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:07.280]  whoop she's gone gotta move quick now i'm gonna tell all these people do you want to comment
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:13.280]  coronavirus that's for sure yeah uh mrs lorraine please comment on the coronavirus oh gosh i mean
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:16.880]  you know they are so not telling us the truth about it there's so many lies i feel like there's
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:23.120]  absolutely some manufacturing going on um i think that it probably was a manufactured uh virus
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:29.120]  and uh you know i mean look it's just very convenient that it happens to come out right
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:35.600]  at this time and it happens to influence these areas uh it's very odd so i have uh i i don't
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:42.960]  think anything is coincidental and uh i think it's probably manufactured well i know i don't
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:50.240]  regularly be conclusive but i can tell you decisively major universities that do this
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:56.480]  studied it said it's got the hiv delivery system on it it's been manufactured and then the the u.s
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:42:00.720]  biological weapons treaty author comes out and says it and then all this other evidence amounts
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:08.880]  this is something this is something else and that's all i'm saying absolutely i never put it
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:16.880]  past the globalist they're so uh they're they're just so insidious and you know so so intentional
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:22.640]  about the things that they do that i never put things like this past them and we got to look
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:28.000]  out for their next plans for us really well the videos are flooding in too fast even cover it's
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.120]  just body bags dead bodies everywhere it's definitely way bigger than we're being told and it's being
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:39.360]  used as a martial law drill for control in communist china but something is killing a lot of people
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:46.480]  over there and we know the receptor sites on it uh hit asian military age men a lot higher than others
[2:42:46.480 --> 2:42:50.480]  which leans toward it being a western bio weapon but i'm not saying that's what it is
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:56.960]  we're out back i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:43:03.280]  your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:08.720]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s worldwide and
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:14.720]  president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:20.800]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.920]  but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:32.160]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:38.560]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:42.960]  a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:49.280]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to moralize us
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:56.960]  we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy it is i the leader of cobra here for

[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:33.120]  just went up bitter pelosi claims trump was drugged during state of the union it looked to me
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:43.120]  like he was a little sedated here it is differences uh as do we so again i extended a hand of friendship
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:49.360]  to him oh yeah to welcome him as the president of the united states to the people's house was also
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:55.040]  an act of kindness because i he looked to me like he was a little sedated he looked that way last year
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:48:01.440]  too but he didn't want to shake hands that was that that meant nothing to me it had nothing to do
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:07.120]  with my tearing up that that came much later and that's a lie she practiced ripping it up she got
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:12.160]  caught on camera and she actually did not do a proper introduction of the president she actually

[2:51:34.480 --> 2:51:40.480]  right into it because i know there's a lot of people still on hold um but last week i was told
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:47.840]  by my sister her co-worker's brother actually supposedly got quarantined for a possible virus
[2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:56.000]  in idland to georgia that i haven't seen anything on the news about it yet oh obviously the virus
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:59.840]  is all over the u.s they're covering it up we had a guy that was involved in emergency management
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:04.000]  earlier calling last hour and i don't know if you heard anybody said no no they're they're covering
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:08.560]  up and they're afraid that it's going to get so bad that it breaks down so the cover-up gets exposed
[2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:15.120]  oh yeah but um and then also that last night uh i was staying up all night being through the
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:24.480]  internet and now they're oops we did not hang up on that caller but just boom went to was that a
[2:52:24.480 --> 2:52:31.760]  and hang up yeah that that's not us uh let's go to tim and illinois you're on the air go ahead tim
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:43.600]  hey alex welcome sir didn't hear me yes sir hey uh i just want to say diana uh you're like a 69
[2:52:43.600 --> 2:52:53.760]  camaro next to a 79 mercury mark key on the draft so nancy polosi she don't have a chance
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:53:03.440]  yeah no nancy polosi is like a broken 1974 gremlin next to a 2000 uh ferrari that's right
[2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:11.920]  i'll take it hey alex yes sir uh my thoughts uh you know we're all like five-year-olds waiting
[2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:20.560]  on christmas for trump to do something to these guys and uh what i was gonna say is i i just think
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:28.320]  that uh he's waiting till the second term i don't think they were gonna let him he knows if he did
[2:53:28.320 --> 2:53:36.240]  something it could go against him on that second term so uh i think he's holding out uh there's too
[2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:43.520]  many people on the fence so what's your thoughts on that now i totally agree and he better go on the
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:49.520]  offensive in the second term 270 days out or i'm going to go completely eight because he needs to
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:53.360]  end the globalist deep state doesn't mean we won't have problems and some corruption i'm not a
[2:53:53.360 --> 2:53:57.040]  you know dreamer who thinks everything's perfect but i don't want people in the government that
[2:53:57.040 --> 2:54:03.040]  want to destroy the country and tell me america sucks that's a litmus test i'm so tired of him
[2:54:03.040 --> 2:54:08.000]  going soft to be honest with you i really hope that he's holding all that wrath and justice for
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:13.200]  a second term because i can't take it anymore i'm getting really impatient here and we need justice
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:17.360]  i mean that's why we elected him in a con into office so that we can actually get justice and
[2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:22.960]  get these bad people uh in gitmo or behind bars where they belong let's try tim tim what do you
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:29.120]  want to see when trump gets reelected on what do you want to see day one i want to see him unleash
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:39.600]  the kraken yes and i think kraken's coming i think uh i think the american people have been
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:48.960]  waiting on this too long and i think he's going to uh i think he'll do what's right so i have faith
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:56.880]  in him you know it's funny you say that because that's exactly what i was told that trump intends
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:01.040]  to release the kraken once he's reelected i was told that by somebody very close to the president
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:06.880]  so we'll we'll see what happens and of course the kraken brings destruction on evil cities
[2:55:07.760 --> 2:55:14.320]  so notice all these diseases are breaking out in these evil cities thank you tim let's uh
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:18.400]  take another call here we had a caller saying he wants to talk about democrat cities that are
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:24.000]  infected but i guess he hung up uh let's talk to jeff in tennessee he's been holding the longest

[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:33.200]  info wars store dot com that's what i'm using what my family's using as a frontline defense
[2:59:33.200 --> 2:59:37.920]  nothing's perfect except you know prayer and god's intervention and we hope this thing isn't as
[2:59:37.920 --> 2:59:42.320]  bad as it looks but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because
[2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:58.240]  this is certainly a bizarre virus you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:26.560]  i won't get you get what i'm after till the day i die not unless you're born again brother
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:35.760]  believe me i've seen a lot stop i've even been on the dark side for a while the power of christ
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:44.880]  is a trillion times of the devil and that's only from human perspective
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:55.120]  a few final calls to take we have the woman who's running against ancy polosi as a republican
[3:00:55.120 --> 3:01:00.080]  with no republican backing but she's showing up in the polls and been a great job piano rain
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:07.520]  joins us right now we got a few final calls to take before matt bracken takes over
[3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:10.960]  what else do you have to get off your chest that people need to know watching this historic
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:15.680]  battle happen how could anybody not be inspired by this and realize we're in a critical crossroads
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:21.680]  right well i just want to make it very clear that what happened with mit romney mittens romney
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:26.960]  you know betraying the president the way he did okay that's just one example right that just happened
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:32.960]  to be a very public display of rhinoism there are people like that everywhere all over the country
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:37.760]  and we're not quite aware of them they're embedded in the local gop's they're everywhere and they're
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:43.520]  blocking true conservative candidates true patriots like myself from getting elected and they're
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:48.560]  doing lots of dirty tricks to block them and to smear them and to make it almost impossible for
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:54.000]  them to win so i just want to make that clear that you know they really are everywhere the rhino
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:59.440]  is real the rhino is strong and we've got to defeat them and i love this public execution of mit
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:04.880]  romney right now we need to stand strong as patriots we cannot let nancy polosi and the rest of them
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:11.600]  continue to win and again whether your bold way of being a patriot and fighting this culture war
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:17.520]  is running for office go for it or support a candidate donate to a candidate do something
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:21.280]  that's going to get you off your butt and actually fight for this country because we have one shot
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:26.400]  at it left we really do we're at a crossroads right now and god willing we're going to get another
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:30.640]  chance and we're going to save america but we truly have to fight right now and we've got to work
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:37.040]  together and not be silent well absolutely the globalists had won so long because we were asleep
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:40.320]  now that people are partially awake they're like why aren't we winning just do the same thing we did
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:45.840]  before people say there's this incredible evil in the wiki league saying let's cause race war
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:50.560]  and i'm not kissing minorities asses okay because there's some that are races that problems like
[3:02:50.560 --> 3:02:56.400]  whites but it's not brown people and black people i find that are the problem it's a bunch of weird
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:01.600]  whites that want to be the rulers who are like trying to have a corporate takeover a social
[3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:07.600]  takeover and and i think people are just rejecting if they're like america ain't perfect but it's not
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:12.960]  as bad as you're saying and and and then it and then it gets so more intense and then we're going
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:18.000]  to sexualize your children and people decide man i don't want to be part of this so i think things
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:23.200]  have really blown up in their face yeah they're totally overplaying their hand here this is marxism
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:28.960]  though at full display this is the full manifestation of the social marxism of the marxist agenda right
[3:03:28.960 --> 3:03:35.680]  they're dividing the men and women right they're dividing us by races by gender now by sexuality
[3:03:35.680 --> 3:03:39.840]  they're breaking up the family unit they're causing people to no longer even reproduce anymore and
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:46.480]  get here we can't unify around prosperity and decency yep exactly and we can't let the marxist
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:51.920]  marxist take over now there's going to be a whole new flood of of aocs going around that are going
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:57.360]  to be elected into office if we're not careful and we don't fight we don't have true patriots
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:02.720]  be courageous enough to put themselves in the fire america must awaken all right one final

[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:41.920]  in a moment matt bracket is about to take over but i wanted to point this out to everybody
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:47.760]  right now because it's really really important a bellwether of how serious the corona virus is
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:53.840]  is the fact that storable food all over the united states has sold out other than my
[3:06:53.840 --> 3:06:58.640]  patron supply which is now the biggest food distributor in the country after 12 years because
[3:06:58.640 --> 3:07:02.880]  they're trusted they keep a massive stockpall in hand and they deliver when they say they will
[3:07:02.880 --> 3:07:09.200]  that's why they're my sponsor and they have told you seven to ten days the last ten weeks guaranteed
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:14.960]  you order you get it seven to ten days now they called this morning another statement around here
[3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:23.520]  and they said we've got to say 10 to 14 now even though it's it's like nine to 12 because the orders
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:28.880]  are intensifying and we said no to institutional buyers big corporations and the government
[3:07:28.880 --> 3:07:34.080]  that's you bought up everywhere else but we're having to hire even more people and trying to buy
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:40.880]  forward to get the food they have the food for everybody now who gets orders in to make sure
[3:07:40.880 --> 3:07:46.240]  that you get it within the 10 to 14 days now but now it's been extended out you put your order in
[3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:52.400]  before it's seven to ten is taken care of they have high quality swarble food that is being
[3:07:53.440 --> 3:07:57.600]  packaged as we speak they have plenty of food for another couple weeks right now
[3:07:57.600 --> 3:08:01.440]  but it's the packaging it's the preparing it it's that whole process that takes place

[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:01.600]  let's go ahead and talk to nathan in michigan you're on the air go ahead
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:03.920]  hello yes sir
[3:09:05.280 --> 3:09:11.440]  alex good to talk to you uh i wanted to say about trump uh what's going on with uh
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:18.000]  in rolling out 5g i totally agree that it's it's toxic it's bad it spies on you if the
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:22.960]  shycom shouldn't have it and israel who invented it have banned it and and other european countries
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:29.680]  are banning it what the hell are we doing yeah uh the one positive thing other thing i wanted to
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:35.840]  say about trump is uh everyone says he's literally hitler he's the only president he's the only
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:42.720]  person right now standing up against anti-semitism with the uh executive order to fight anti-semitism
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:47.360]  everything they say is that they say i'm a white supremacist you go to the white supremacists they
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:53.760]  hate me more than anybody it's all crap it's the opposite of reality i'm right now going to uh
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:10:01.600]  henry ford to uni college i know you know henry ford received a medal from adopt hitler and uh i'm
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:09.760]  actually uh i claim i wasn't able to present and turn in my work in a class here because it was
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:16.080]  about how uh you know jews were prosecuted by hitler and how racism you know people with white
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:23.680]  skin still were victims of nazism and uh i actually think i might be part jewish i told them
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:29.040]  that and they actually didn't oh there there's a dialectic you have powerful jews like like the
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:34.240]  rothschilds funding anti-semitism to create a dialectic where the jews go then work for the
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:39.120]  left it's it's very sophisticated that's why the rothschilds are so powerful it's very evil
[3:10:39.760 --> 3:10:43.200]  but you're absolutely right and i'm glad you raised that thank you so much for the call
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:49.200]  you want to comment on that oh it's just it is very very sophisticated it's actually crazy how
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:54.480]  intelligent these people are how intelligent the elites are they're not dumb they believe that we're
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:59.760]  dumb but they're very sophisticated in their indoctrination methods in their social engineering
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:05.680]  methods um and in the way they roll things out and i also think that you know this is something
[3:11:05.680 --> 3:11:11.200]  that i think that we need to do as conservatives we when if president trump goes against something
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:18.240]  that raises an eyebrow with us like uh or he's pro something like 5g right or red flag laws or
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:22.960]  something like that you know i think that we should be okay to speak out about that and critique him
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:28.320]  i think that he needs to know that his base does not like that but that's not right um and we
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:33.680]  can't just always be a 24-7 cheerleader and our patriot friends need to agree we're not a democrat
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:41.120]  cult eric in south dakota you're on the air go ahead hi alex thanks for taking my call um i tuned
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:45.120]  into the president's speech this morning and in the back of my mind i was thinking you know there
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:49.760]  were a lot of surprises in the state of the union maybe we'd get a surprise this morning and hear
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:55.760]  about our pardon for roger stone general flin paul manifold um obviously we didn't get that but
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:02.400]  what do you think do you think that it's possible that now impeachment is concluded we might possibly
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:06.960]  get some action there my answer is we better and i agree the state of the union was so powerful i'm
[3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:12.800]  going to re-air clips of it tomorrow on the friday show that was like a hundred percent a plus and
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:18.800]  this was kind of like you know okay whatever it was it was weak compared it was papp compared
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:24.160]  but hey whatever the president's got his own strategy and and i think he went off the cuff
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:28.160]  today it was just him being friendly and nice i think he thinks he's won so he's kind of like a
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:32.800]  guy just ran a marathon he's kind of no for collapse on the side getting some getting some
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:39.280]  gatorade so i don't want to say you know put the president down he's 73 years old folks i'm 45 and
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:43.040]  i work hard and i have to like gut up and come in here and do their show sometimes so i don't
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:47.120]  want a hundred percent judge the president uh you want to comment on that miss uh lorraine
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:51.760]  yeah you know i've seen better performances by him obviously it was uh it took a lot of energy
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:56.480]  to do the state of the union and he takes so many slings and arrows every single day i can't imagine
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:12:59.920]  what he goes through with the whole impeachment process the average person could do a state of the
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:04.560]  union in their life and i mean you see me this guy's done a lot we can't just expect our heavyweight
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:10.640]  champion to just have bouts every week i mean every day he's like far yeah we i think that we
[3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:14.800]  we just have to try expectations of him because he's like this miracle man this this work of art
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:20.160]  how does he stay so energetic energetic how does he stay uh so energetic and just so able to bounce
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:24.480]  off these attacks like this so if he if he's a little lower energy sometimes i'm going to give him
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:29.600]  a pass for that majority eric thank you and we love you james and canada last caller go ahead

[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:15.760]  is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different
[3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:21.280]  toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:26.880]  calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't
[3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:32.560]  even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it

[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:48.480]  four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels

[3:20:33.600 --> 3:20:37.840]  care if they're in a nuclear war so they infect their own people why would they do that use them as
[3:20:37.840 --> 3:20:45.520]  carriers then a 12 monkey scenario tall national security personnel reading this from taiwan japan
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:50.160]  korea canada the u.s russia and other nations you will want to urgently forward this to your

[3:20:55.840 --> 3:21:00.240]  indicates a dangerous global escalation of the warfare tactics by a lawless authoritarian regime
[3:21:00.240 --> 3:21:04.880]  that you already know has been dispatching spies to your countries stealing intellectual property
[3:21:04.880 --> 3:21:09.200]  and infiltrating your universities governments and military weapons research institutions
[3:21:09.200 --> 3:21:13.520]  china's in game goal is world domination and there is no weaponry they won't deploy to achieve it

[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:25.520]  warfare weapon the accidental escape of bsl for facilities and launching global pandemic we are
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:31.360]  now getting confirmation from our investigators in taiwan that china his wife from taiwan he speaks
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:36.800]  fluent chinese has deployed a biological warfare attack against taiwan by seating an evacuation
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:43.120]  flight from taiwan citizens with an infected trojan horse human weapon was contaminated the entire
[3:21:43.120 --> 3:21:48.240]  evacuation flight this is a damning escalation the tensions between the communist china taiwan east
[3:21:48.240 --> 3:21:52.720]  coronavirus pandemic and it goes on for page after page it's dead on let me explain something
[3:21:52.720 --> 3:21:58.560]  right now the head of the u.n world health organization program said china's done a great
[3:21:58.560 --> 3:22:03.920]  job killing people at checkpoints locking them up mass graves burning bodies but if the u.s says no
[3:22:03.920 --> 3:22:09.440]  flights that's xenophobic and evil and bad we should take flights from china this is unbelievable
[3:22:11.680 --> 3:22:17.120]  the ncov coronavirus is out of control major media experts warn world prepare for global
[3:22:17.120 --> 3:22:22.160]  spread everything we told you weeks ago is now being confirmed the who sends out 250 000 test
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:28.800]  kits for pandemic that's own leaders now say isn't real as just some of the news we've got
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:33.120]  matt bracken is about to take over but this is very very serious information we'll be covering
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:39.200]  it more tomorrow on the friday show uh james in canada wanted to point this out the lack of
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:43.200]  government response on the surface but behind the scenes there's a major response what do you
[3:22:43.200 --> 3:22:52.000]  think's happened well honestly alex i honestly think that they're trying to set up chaos up here
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:57.760]  in canada to be perfectly honest they're flying these people in uh apparently they're even uh
[3:22:57.760 --> 3:23:02.400]  taking a jet from you guys too and they're going to be dropping people off in vancouver and then
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:08.320]  bringing them here to ontario to our largest air force base in trenton ontario and they're
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:16.240]  going to quarantine them there but from there um like trenton's well maybe 50 miles from our largest
[3:23:19.920 --> 3:23:25.280]  sorry i'm having a little bit of a brain part going on here the point is why the hell are we
[3:23:25.280 --> 3:23:31.920]  flying people in from all over the world to canada in the us well exactly and 50 miles from our
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:38.480]  quarantine and the 50 miles from our large our largest population center which is toronto and
[3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:47.040]  i live 30 miles outside of that and i'm wondering you know do i kind of bug out to my parents farm
[3:23:47.040 --> 3:23:52.000]  now or what am i going to do well i think if it starts spreading which it already is that's something
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:56.160]  people got to think about or sheltering in place god bless you and i appreciate your call that's
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:24:00.640]  following to cover that article i meant to lead with this mike adam said this to me like 2 a.m. i

[3:24:04.880 --> 3:24:10.080]  it's on m4s.com and hopefully the war room will leave with that because it is big news um matt
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:14.480]  bracken former navy seal by selling author researcher takes over right now we appreciate matt
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:19.440]  bracken we got to all the calls want to say the crew did a great job war room is 35 minutes away
[3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:26.880]  matt bracken takes over okay alex thanks a lot uh geez where do you start today do you start with
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:34.640]  the impeachment drama or the coming pandemic drama it's it's one of those weeks and we've been having
[3:24:34.640 --> 3:24:40.320]  a lot of them i think i'm going to start with impeachment because it's fresh in everybody's
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:48.000]  mind everybody saw nancy policy and then followed by uh president trump and you're my wife who's an
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:56.160]  rnc she thought he might have been he's pretty subdued um possibly medicated as um even nancy
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:25:03.920]  policy i think noted uh he has been going through a lot the man is 75 and um we can only imagine
[3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:09.680]  what kind of pressure he's under and the medical consequences he actually said in his in his uh
[3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:15.440]  speech in the in the east room that um you know that what he's been through in the last three years
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:22.240]  would have broken any other president night pretty much i have to believe that and um i i have kind
[3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:29.280]  of a different take on this as soon as the speech was over i flipped to cnn and msnbc and their take
[3:25:29.280 --> 3:25:36.240]  on it was completely different you know logically than ours they consider it a declaration of war
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:44.960]  chris mathews called it a war cry and i kind of saw it that way too this wasn't the day where he
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:50.560]  was going to come out and part in general flinn which which you know is warranted or roger stone
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:57.520]  which is warranted um he did mention offhandedly he did say that uh people that came came to help
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:03.200]  after his election had their lives ruined and and that something needs to be done about it so i do
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:10.960]  take that as a reference to people like flinn and stone but today was strictly a day to recognize
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:19.120]  uh his team his warriors he used that term repeatedly he said he has been in a war a political war
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:26.960]  and today was the day when he was he was recognizing his key warriors and the reason for that is
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:34.480]  i liken this to a a halftime locker room speech the fight's not over you know he has to get reelected
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:40.320]  in order to keep draining the swamp if he's not reelected if something happens between now and
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:46.560]  november you know pandemic market crash and he's blamed for it we could wind up with a president
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:52.880]  bernie sanders has created you know it seems impossible but uh maybe people thought that
[3:26:52.880 --> 3:26:59.040]  trump being elected was impossible remember how they all laughed uh on the bill marshow except
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:04.160]  for an colter so crazy things have been happening in this era and nothing can be ruled out he needs
[3:27:04.160 --> 3:27:10.720]  to be reelected so this is like the halftime locker room speech to his troops to go out there and
[3:27:10.720 --> 3:27:17.680]  keep fighting and by recognizing his key warriors he's he's bucking them up for the fight to come
[3:27:17.680 --> 3:27:25.120]  and he's also i think um trying to motivate the the player the players that might be hanging back
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:31.280]  still you know he's got a much stronger team going into the second half because the first
[3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:38.640]  half he had to weed out all of the the moles and backstabbers that were sent in on him because you
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:43.120]  know the word was out nobody should work for trump he wound up taking people like balton
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:49.360]  mcmaster tillerson you know these these people were not on his side and now he's got a much
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:57.680]  stronger team well on msnbc chris matthews was looking looked shaken because he said he not only
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:06.000]  was recognizing his troops but he repeatedly called the other side you know enemies and dirty cops
[3:28:06.560 --> 3:28:11.920]  and evil he called them geniuses he said imagine what they could have done if they'd been working
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:17.840]  constructively he said they're geniuses but he they're evil and something has to be done
[3:28:17.840 --> 3:28:24.480]  you know he he briefly mentioned bar he never mentioned uh charamella he did mention in a
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:30.800]  disparaging way lieutenant colonel didn't him in and he could see he was leading towards the
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:37.360]  misco and charamella connection but he didn't go there and he he did mention and give kudos to bar
[3:28:37.360 --> 3:28:42.080]  but he didn't mention durham but several times he said this can't be allowed to happen again and
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:46.080]  something's got to be done and we're going to explore this a little bit more on the other
[3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:52.560]  side of the break you know what i think trump knows is coming that's going to be done we can all

[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:06.720]  as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship taking place it's coordinated by big tech and banks
[3:32:06.720 --> 3:32:13.600]  against people that promote america and guns and freedom and jesus and the family and the protection

[3:32:24.800 --> 3:32:29.760]  want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in cancels we have never
[3:32:29.760 --> 3:32:35.680]  been in some smallville place that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs
[3:32:35.680 --> 3:32:39.680]  the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through
[3:32:39.680 --> 3:32:43.360]  so it's an incredible time to be alive i'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being
[3:32:43.360 --> 3:32:48.640]  involved but just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support
[3:32:48.640 --> 3:33:14.880]  of m4 store.com is critical so please take action you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:21.200]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[3:33:24.640 --> 3:33:30.880]  yeah i see the uh the old uh anime spot and domestic website up and just a reminder you know
[3:33:30.880 --> 3:33:35.440]  you don't have to uh go to amazon to get my books you can get them directly from me
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:42.400]  uh and cut Jeff Bezos out of the formula which i'd appreciate it but if you want him on audio
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:48.800]  or if you want the one kindle then amazon is the way to go now talking about trump uh my wife
[3:33:48.800 --> 3:33:56.480]  thought he looked sedated i think he looked tired i can't imagine i mean i'm i'm uh a dozen or so
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:02.240]  years younger than him and i can't imagine the week that he's had you know he's a guy who already is
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:08.400]  is famous for getting by on almost no sleep he's constantly calling people at you know one or two
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:13.600]  in the morning he hasn't gone to bed and he's the you know he's the last one to go to bed the first
[3:34:13.600 --> 3:34:20.800]  one up so it's got to be taking a toll and maybe now he's going to get some r and r uh while his
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:26.960]  his um warriors go out and carry the battle forward for a while hopefully he'll get a
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:34.000]  some something of a break because i think that he needs it but that said now that he's been acquitted
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:39.680]  i think in a great in a great sense he's been inoculated against further attacks he's going
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:45.200]  to be once he recovers his energy i think he's going to be a little bit more off the chain
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:52.400]  than he even has been because this inoculation effect means that the democrats are on their heels
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:34:57.760]  they can't impeach him now he made jokes about it if he cross you know if he crosses against the light
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:03.120]  they're going to try to impeach him so he's making it into a joke using the olinsky uh
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:09.920]  you know ridicule is one of your best weapons and at the same time you have to look at at the
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:15.600]  democrat national committee the democrat elites they're in the middle of their own civil war
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:20.640]  they can't put all of their attention against trump where they've just suffered a defeat with his
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:27.520]  acquittal they have a they're in the middle of a of their own internecine civil war between the the
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:35.440]  aoc communist faction and and you know then they've got a got trump on the right so they've got the
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:40.800]  communists on the left and trump on the right what we're watching from coming out of iowa
[3:35:41.360 --> 3:35:49.680]  is it is a real joke i mean they took over that caucus counting because i think it's clear
[3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:55.440]  bernie probably would have you know for sure he would have won over uh peep boated but a jig
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:36:02.480]  he would have won and it might have been like 30 to 20 with uh with with biden in single digits
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:07.760]  and this would have been a complete disaster going into new hampshire where bernie is expected
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:15.920]  to do very well the key for iowa was bernie cannot win you know no matter what we have to we have
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:21.920]  to calculate these numbers and count and recount like stalin said it doesn't matter who votes it's
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:28.640]  who counts the votes well the the dnc swept in and took over the voting from the iowans so that
[3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:35.600]  no matter what they did not want a headline bernie wins because their nightmare scenario is the
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:42.880]  bernie sanders wing of the party sweeping into the convention and winning and and just suffering a
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:50.720]  mcgovern nixon kind of a defeat it'll be you know a 40 or 45 state wipeout if it's a communist who honey
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:58.720]  mooned in the soviet union during the gulag era you know who vacationed in nicoro nicaragua during
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:06.480]  the ortega communist era the guy who sang sang the praises of yugo chavez and the you know the
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:14.560]  cuban socialism in venezuela that guy is cannot possibly win because he has too much in he has
[3:37:14.560 --> 3:37:20.480]  too much of video that's going to be played and played and played of him you know dancing
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:27.440]  and hugging with the communists during the hardcore iron curtain era you know the guy cannot win so
[3:37:27.440 --> 3:37:34.960]  so this is the the spot that polosi and schumer and they've just been you know they've wasted all
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:40.560]  of this energy fighting a fruitless battle against trump he's weak but they're far weaker and he'll
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:46.400]  regain his strength quickly whereas they now have to focus on trying to keep bernie for winning in
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:51.680]  new hampshire and that might not be able to be done because the democrats in new hampshire
[3:37:51.680 --> 3:37:57.280]  they're watching what happened in iowa they're not buying it they know it was another's theft by
[3:37:57.280 --> 3:38:03.360]  the dnc against their man bernie and i think that that they're going to come out in force to vote
[3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:11.120]  for bernie just as a reaction against the dnc um hand you know handling and and recounting the vote
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:16.640]  so i think that that bernie is going to be a clear winner coming out of of new hampshire going to
[3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:25.360]  south carolina pete buddha dig he cannot get elected in south carolina because socially in many
[3:38:25.360 --> 3:38:30.880]  respects blacks are religious and southern blacks are conservative and religious and they're not
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:39.280]  going to vote for a gay guy to bring his his male husband into the white house i mean in in manhattan
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:47.200]  and in berkeley it might seem completely normal but in rural south carolina it does not and it's
[3:38:47.200 --> 3:38:53.120]  not going to you know he is not going to win in south carolina because conservative religious
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:59.600]  you know southerners black or white are never going to vote for him period you know that might
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:05.600]  fly in new hampshire and it might fly in uh you know in the college towns of iowa minus the trump
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:12.720]  vote the republican vote it's not going to fly in any part of south carolina so what i see going
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:20.400]  into the convention is with with the machinery of the dnc arrayed against against uh of sanders
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:26.800]  and nobody getting a majority i think that what the dnc is going to be angling toward
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:33.280]  is a brokered convention and that means that um they're going to have a white knight sweep in
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:39.440]  and you know people like hillary are probably thinking that's my possibility you know i'll be the
[3:39:39.440 --> 3:39:43.840]  that i'll be after after i think it's one or two rounds of votes if there's no majority
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:50.240]  in the at the democratic convention then it's just open to anybody it's like all comers
[3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:55.360]  and they might be looking for a white knight a retired general type or a retired admiral
[3:39:55.360 --> 3:40:01.600]  you know somebody that can come in and just out of exhaustion the democrats say yes that's the guy
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:07.920]  we we have to put up against trump some you know ex-military that they can you know even if he's a
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:13.440]  socialist now they'll make him out to be the war hero war hero i mean this is a pattern they've been
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:20.800]  they've been they've been running um to find some liberal socialist democrat whoever wore the uniform
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:28.480]  which would include pete buddhajig and then play up his is heroic you know uniform service supposedly
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:35.600]  on being sarcastic and then run him to try to try to um you know trick the social moderates and
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:40.880]  conservatives into voting for him so i think that's the only chance that the democrats have going
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:48.560]  into the into the election is to find some way to torpedo of the the present field none of which
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:56.400]  can win and and arrange a brokered convention and then bring in a white knight to rescue them
[3:40:56.400 --> 3:41:03.360]  that's the only thing that's going to happen so right now is a is a is a great time for trump to
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:11.600]  to um uh reorient to rest and recuperate while the democrats are completely uh uh
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:17.840]  flummoxed with their own dilemma you know the iowa was a disaster on many levels i mean it was
[3:41:17.840 --> 3:41:24.560]  it's like a goldmine for for um you know memes and jokes that they couldn't even run a caucus
[3:41:24.560 --> 3:41:30.720]  in a tiny state a small population state and they think that they can you know nationalize
[3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:37.360]  health care and and run health care for you know turn it into socialist american health care
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:42.080]  or that they can you know if we just elect the democrats they'll make a green new deal
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:47.680]  and they're going to turn the temperature of the earth down by you know banning the internal
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:54.240]  combustion engine in the united states of america not to mention china or india or anywhere else so
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:02.000]  they're they're in their uh incompetence is on full is on is on full display and i've been you
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:08.160]  know i don't have the exact numbers but it's constantly repeated that at trump rallies they
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:13.920]  do a lot of um of metrics a demographic and and other metrics going in because they're
[3:42:13.920 --> 3:42:19.840]  signing people up something like a quarter of the people in the trump rallies are registered
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:28.240]  democrats so this is this is lining up to be um mcgovern nixon you know before watergate fully
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:35.040]  blew up um you know nixon blew mcgovern out of the water i think mcgovern only won like minnesota
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:41.040]  massachusetts and washington dc that was it and that's what we're lining up to see in november

[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:11.360]  eye on a couple of numbers and it's hard because you can't believe anything coming out of china
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:19.680]  but the the r not number which is how many people it affects seems everybody is saying it's between
[3:49:19.680 --> 3:49:25.040]  two and three and that is bad enough that is about like the spanish flu that means everybody
[3:49:25.040 --> 3:49:32.800]  infected will infect two to three people but then there's a concept of something called a a super
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:38.960]  spreader a super spreader is no different than anybody else with the virus it just means that
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:46.320]  that infected person landed in just the right fertile soil for spreading like somebody sick
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:52.640]  who winds up in the in the the prison in the barracks or on the cruise ship you know with the
[3:49:52.640 --> 3:49:59.760]  ventilation system going from room to room so a super spreader can infect 20 or 30 people
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:08.080]  and and spike in and spike an outbreak locally so even when we when we um know the ro the r not
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:16.640]  number the the fatality rate number is much harder to pin down during the spanish flu of 1918 1919
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:24.480]  the fatality rate was put at 10 to 20 percent and in china they're still saying it's around two
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:30.240]  percent but nobody really knows because it's china but there's there's a cruise ship tied up in
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:38.640]  okahama japan right now called the diamond princess and it's got 3700 people on board one
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:44.160]  lockdown in their rooms essentially you know they're not doing shuffleboard and the swimming pool
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:50.560]  is closed and you know just feeding these people without spreading contamination when you've got
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:57.200]  a shared ventilation system you you know there's no way they've got like hepa type you know
[3:50:57.200 --> 3:51:03.360]  high efficiency filters throughout the entire ventilation system so you've got people breathing
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:10.480]  common air every time a door opens and people walk in walk down these narrow passageways
[3:51:10.480 --> 3:51:16.960]  on a cruise ship they're pulling along you know their vacuum is pulling along a trail of of the
[3:51:16.960 --> 3:51:22.000]  air they've been breathing so that people that come out of their door later can breathe that same
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:29.360]  air or even just touch the same surfaces so it'll be very interesting as a lab lab experiment to
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:36.480]  keep an eye on the cruise ships because if there are outbreaks because of this super spreader method
[3:51:36.480 --> 3:51:43.360]  of concept an outbreak can be sort of supercharged in an environment like a cruise ship you know it
[3:51:43.360 --> 3:51:49.600]  happened in the spanish flu era with troop ships where you know a few were sick before the voyage
[3:51:49.600 --> 3:51:55.840]  and many people are sick and dead by the end of the voyage so we'll have to keep an eye on those
[3:51:55.840 --> 3:52:03.920]  cruise ships now in terms of the Wuhan quarantine it's a huge social experiment that maybe only
[3:52:03.920 --> 3:52:11.920]  the communist chinese could pull off to try to to wall in 50 or 60 million people and the way
[3:52:11.920 --> 3:52:18.000]  that the chinese are looking at it is that we're taking one for the global team and we're going to
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:25.360]  sacrifice an entire region that would be like an area like texas we're going to sacrifice it
[3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:30.720]  so that and it'll just burn itself out inside we can't get all the medical care in there there's
[3:52:30.720 --> 3:52:36.000]  no way to send enough doctors and nurses in there they're literally locking people inside of their
[3:52:36.000 --> 3:52:42.640]  houses that are coughing you know if you're alive in two weeks good luck otherwise don't infect anybody
[3:52:42.640 --> 3:52:49.280]  else to make sure we're locking you in but that's it that is a a reactive quarantine when you put a
[3:52:49.920 --> 3:52:55.840]  perimeter around an outbreak that's a reactive quarantine but there is a type of quarantine
[3:52:55.840 --> 3:53:04.080]  that does work in history and it is a defensive quarantine where a city or a town or a ship
[3:53:05.120 --> 3:53:11.680]  will quarantine itself while there are no infections and this actually works in history and
[3:53:11.680 --> 3:53:19.040]  the spanish flu san francisco got out ahead of the uh of spanish flu outbreaks and basically you
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:24.480]  know put all their military bases on a lockdown so that the sailors and soldiers weren't wandering
[3:53:24.480 --> 3:53:29.840]  through san francisco because by then they knew that the military bases were hit the worst and the
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:36.080]  first so they prevented the sailors and soldiers from leaving base they they restricted traveling
[3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:42.480]  now to san francisco and as a result their fatality rate was a fraction of what cities like philadelphia
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:48.480]  were so when they when you look for fatality rate you're never going to find that the spanish
[3:53:48.480 --> 3:53:55.680]  flu was 10 percent everywhere there were islands that had like you know 25 percent mortality rate
[3:53:55.680 --> 3:54:01.680]  we're talking black death mortality rates and there were there were places that had like
[3:54:01.680 --> 3:54:06.960]  less than one percent because they threw up defensive quarantines you know you're going to
[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:13.680]  take a hit to your economy but you're going to keep the infection out and by preventing air travel
[3:54:13.680 --> 3:54:20.400]  into the usa this is in effect a defensive quarantine and they work you know this is
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:28.400]  nothing new in history there's this this social uh this this this type of a a um uh social reaction
[3:54:28.400 --> 3:54:35.120]  to a pandemic is as old as history albert camu wrote a book about it's really it's the novella
[3:54:35.120 --> 3:54:41.520]  you can get it at the library or pdf one line called the plague and it's about a bubonic plague
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:49.120]  outbreak in north africa in the early 20th century and it's it reminds me of the movie jaws
[3:54:49.840 --> 3:54:57.040]  uh where the you know the the chamber of commerce does not want to hear that we need to put up a
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:55:03.680]  quarantine that we need to keep people from one part of of the port from from moving to the other
[3:55:03.680 --> 3:55:08.720]  part of the port or that we have to close the market you know the the chamber of commerce
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:15.120]  types always want to get the business to continue to continue to the last minute oh we've had 20
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:21.120]  deaths of bubonic plague that's no reason to close the food market yeah no it is it is a reason
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:26.720]  because the people going to the food market are going to spread it and next week it'll be a hundred
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:33.920]  and then a thousand so we can learn a lot from history it's not really time to panic it's still
[3:55:33.920 --> 3:55:39.520]  time just to watch you know there there are there is a lot of panic buying going on i mean food
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:45.760]  markets in asia for example but there's another aspect of this that i need to to touch on which is
[3:55:45.760 --> 3:55:52.800]  we're all focused on coronavirus but china is really in a midst of a terrible almost apocalyptic
[3:55:52.800 --> 3:55:59.440]  situation because it's not only this coronavirus outbreak there's already going back a couple
[3:55:59.440 --> 3:56:09.040]  years two different swine flues there's an african swine fever and and uh h1n1 swine flu
[3:56:09.040 --> 3:56:15.280]  that have decimated their pork industry well this is one of the main protein sources for the you
[3:56:15.280 --> 3:56:23.760]  know 1.5 or whatever it is billion chinese there's also an h5n1 bird flu which is decimating their
[3:56:23.760 --> 3:56:31.520]  poultry industry chickens ducks geese so they've got a food problem as well as as as well as a
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:38.320]  pen you know coronavirus problem their industry is folding up their stock market is practically
[3:56:38.320 --> 3:56:46.400]  you know at a standstill this is going to hit their economy and then this economic uh downturn
[3:56:46.400 --> 3:56:52.480]  in china with the shutdown of of of you know the everybody around the world that relies on
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:58.400]  chinese parts or products that they're building that are basically being assembled with chinese
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:04.480]  parts those chinese parts the containers that are underway are it and they're going to be shutting
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:12.640]  down so the pandemic effect of this even if the death rate remains low might be really just the
[3:57:12.640 --> 3:57:19.600]  ripple that triggers the tsunami of an economic global downturn so next year we might be looking
[3:57:19.600 --> 3:57:28.640]  at this not as a human mortality question but but what triggered an economic uh collapse market
[3:57:28.640 --> 3:57:35.600]  crashes and so forth so we're just in early innings and hopefully we get past november and trump is
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:59.440]  reelected because at least if he's in charge we got something and next week
