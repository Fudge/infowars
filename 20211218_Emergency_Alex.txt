[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]  It's Saturday, December 18th, 2021, and this is exclusive breaking news.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.000]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this breaking
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.360]  Saturday afternoon news alert. This is world exclusive information that you are about to see
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.200]  that affects the future of due process and all of our constitutional rights, the Bill of Rights,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.080]  you name it, that is being sacrificed and destroyed by the corrupt, out-of-control Democratic Party
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.200]  that are trying to turn America into something that resembles a cross between old Stalinist
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.240]  Russia and modern North Korea. Here we are, my friends. Well, Roger Stone,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.440]  one of the most persecuted people in American history, recently pardoned by President Trump
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:16.560]  for a crime he didn't commit of lying to Congress, was summoned back by Witch Hunt 3.0, as he called
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.400]  it, and was put there in the room with Adam Schiff, the man caught faking text messages,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.240]  faking transcripts of the President, committing serious crimes, to then interrogate him.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.720]  You're about to get the exclusive details. I just talked to Roger 30 minutes ago,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.120]  he hasn't done an interview yet, this is exclusive, and he gave me a briefing on what happened in his
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.640]  hour and a half inside of the lion's den, as he is calling it, and they are openly all over the
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.680]  news saying they want to put him in jail again for lying to Congress when he never lied to Congress.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.880]  I was there. I know Julian Assange wasn't talking to him because Roger was here working with us then
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.240]  and I was pressuring Roger to use any contacts he had to get him on. We weren't cool like Fox News
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.520]  or CNN or the New York Times that could interview Assange back then, five years ago. So I was there,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.320]  I know he was innocent because I witnessed it, but they didn't want to talk to me. No, no, no, no, no,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.880]  they wanted to lie and claim that he was the mastermind behind WikiLeaks. Incredible, but
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.560]  that's another subject. We've just gotten Roger on the line, but before we go to him with this
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.600]  exclusive breakdown, let's play the 2 minute 17 second clip of Roger yesterday coming out of the
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.760]  House office building, the O'Neill office building, and I wondered why his press conference was so
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.840]  short. More than 50 news agencies there and Roger just told me why it was so short.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.560]  Wait until you hear that in just a moment. This is very saddening to hear for the state of our
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.000]  republic and his descriptions of it are amazing. So that's coming up here in just a few minutes,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.240]  but first here's Roger's very quick press conference.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:11.600]  Good morning. This morning in fulfillment of a federal subpoena, I did my civic duty
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:20.400]  and I responded as required by law. I did invoke my fifth amendment rights to every question,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.360]  not because I have done anything wrong, but because I am fully aware of the House Democrats
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.400]  long history of fabricating perjury charges on the basis of comments that are innocuous,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.680]  immaterial or irrelevant. I question the legitimacy of this inquiry based on the fact
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.000]  that Speaker Pelosi rejected the appointment of Republicans to this committee and seated two
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:59.200]  anti-Trump Republicans. This is Witch Hunt 3.0. If the Speaker was seriously interested in getting
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.040]  to the bottom of what happened on January 6th, she would release the thousands of hours of
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.080]  videotape taken by government cameras on the incidents of that day. She would also release
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.680]  the audio transmissions of all law enforcement agencies on that day. I stress yet again that I
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.720]  was not on the ellipse. I did not march to the Capitol. I was not at the Capitol and any claim,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.280]  assertion or even implication that I knew about or was involved in any way whatsoever with the
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.560]  illegal and politically counterproductive activities of January 6th is categorically false.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.960]  What disturbed me is an investigation into my activities on January 5th, which is constitutionally
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.560]  protected free speech, the constitutional right of free assembly and the constitutional right
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.440]  to redress the government regarding grievances. I don't like to see the criminalization of
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.080]  constitutionally protected political activity. I think it is a slippery slope.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.960]  Thank you very much, gentlemen, and have a wonderful day.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.960]  And now let's talk to the man in the arena, Roger Stone. And you don't hardly ever see
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.280]  this in U.S. history when members of the press are being persecuted. But I'm also under the gun
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.520]  by these organizations that are openly controlled by the communist Chinese. I've got mainstream
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.600]  news on that in a moment about some of the committee members. But imagine the talk show
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.720]  host interviewing the other individual is also under attack here, ladies and gentlemen. And so
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.240]  they're saying Roger pled the fifth. Oh, that means that means he's guilty. Roger Stone, thank you so
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.360]  much for joining us. You've got a lot to tell us. Thank you for the exclusive.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.680]  Alex, I'm delighted to be here. It's an extraordinary experience just to travel to
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.160]  Washington, D.C. If you're a conservative or a Trump supporter or a Republican, you take your
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.600]  life in your hands on the streets. You can't go to a restaurant. You can't walk safely through
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.320]  an airport or just down the street. It's a very sad commentary on where we are in America.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.640]  As I indicated in advance, it was always my intention to fully assert my Fifth Amendment
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.560]  rights before this sham committee, because they're not interested in the truth. They're
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.080]  interested in the fabrication of some kind of process crime. In other words, find some innocuous
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.320]  or immaterial. It's interesting. National Public Radio quoted me as saying material. I said
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:59.840]  immaterial or or irrelevant comment where they can get you on a technicality. That is precisely why
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.920]  I chose to invoke my Fifth Amendment right. Not because I've done anything wrong, not because
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:13.280]  I knew in advance about the boneheaded and counterproductive incursion into the Capitol
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.920]  by Trump supporters. But what disturbs me is that Speaker Pelosi will not release the
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:28.960]  video footage of D.C. police officers bludgeoning, tear gassing, beating, actually killing one woman.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.440]  When they say this was a deadly day, they're right. The only two people who died that day
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.720]  are Trump supporters who were unarmed and undangerous to anyone, murdered. That's first
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.760]  degree murder. But this committee will never address that. So they were extraordinarily
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.240]  well-organized. They were extraordinarily courteous and professional. But you could tell
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:01.840]  from their questions that they are examining constitutionally protected political activity,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.360]  free speech, the right to assemble, the right to even come to Washington, D.C.,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.080]  and to redress the government. This entire focus on Trump's plan, the plan to persuade the vice
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.680]  president of the United States on the basis of at least two reasonable legal theories that I have
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.840]  seen that he had the authority to delay the Electoral College vote for 10 days in order
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.840]  to investigate voting irregularities is not treasonous. It is not illegal. It is not an
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:41.040]  insurrection. It is perfectly permissible. It is just being depicted by the miscreants at CNN
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.680]  and MSNBC as something that it is not. Alex, we had a very serious insurrection
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.560]  in this country. It was on November 3rd, 2020. And the more those in the fake news media say
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.840]  there's no evidence whatsoever of voter irregularity, the more you know there is.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.360]  In fact, the evidence is growingly overwhelming, particularly in the state of Georgia,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:13.120]  coming up in the state of Wisconsin, in the state of Pennsylvania. But who is it that is blocking
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:20.320]  a real examination of those voting irregularities and anomalies? It's not leftist screwball socialist
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:29.440]  Democrats. It's weak need establishment Republicans. So this proceeding was amazing.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.360]  I repeated the Fifth Amendment rights, my Fifth Amendment rights not to be questioned,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:46.480]  58 times by my count. The questions were in many cases formulated to get under my skin, to try to
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.440]  get me to argue with them, to get me to lose my temper. And Roger, let me just stop you because
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.360]  you're on fire here. And I know when I talked to you before we went on air this evening, you said,
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.120]  listen, the number one thing I want to hit is the D.C. prisoners and the fact that we have a right
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.120]  to protest and that we have a right to the First Amendment. And I'm really upset about that. So a
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.640]  true warrior fashion, you're not worried about yourself. You're worried about everybody else.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.240]  And I get that. And we're going to go there and we're going to walk through it all. But
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.040]  start over because, again, I wrote notes on our conversation. This blew even Alex Jones away.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.520]  And I know I'm soon going to be in that very same room with the committee. And so I am all ears
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.640]  earlier and all ears now. I want you to just start there. Then we'll go back through all of this
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:39.120]  and the big picture, the 35,000 foot view. But Roger Stone goes through hell, gets to D.C.,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.840]  gets screamed at, gets yelled at. You go in. And then what happened inside? Start back over about
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.760]  the Fifth Amendment and then the questions and what you witnessed, because this is exclusive
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.480]  information people want to know. Well, first of all, I want to thank General Michael Flynn
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.440]  for lending me his security detail, a very professional gentleman watching out for my
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.240]  personal security and safety. General Flynn is a great man. He's a very generous man. I want to
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.360]  thank him right off the bat. I don't think I would have gotten out of D.C. alive without that.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.440]  I arrived at the at the O'Neill office building. The media had obviously been told I was coming.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.520]  They had been starting setting up there until as early as seven o'clock that morning. I made no
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:31.040]  comment going into the building. I went through the mag machines. I was put in a private room.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.600]  Well, I'm certain they were listening to the conversation. So no substantive conversation
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:42.960]  between my attorney and I was held. I then went to the session, was introduced to all of the
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:51.120]  investigators. On a large screen, Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman from Cheney,
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:57.760]  soon to be a former member of Congress, who actually, by the way, is weighing a Republican
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.880]  bid for the nomination for president. Bring it on, Liz. See how they love you up there in New
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.840]  Hampshire. Give it a shot. Your father was a war criminal who belongs in prison. And so are you.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:17.600]  In any event, then they proceeded to ask me a series of loaded questions. They gave me a
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:24.160]  notebook with a number of exhibits, some of which were most of which were actually public matters
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.880]  that had appeared in public, either on the Internet or things I had published or others
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.120]  who had published. I declined on the basis of my Fifth Amendment rights not to comment on any of
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.600]  those exhibits. Again, not because I've done anything wrong, not because I have broken the law,
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.240]  not because I was involved in any way of in the planning or execution on these entirely
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:56.000]  counterproductive but very dangerous activities of January 6th, but because I know of Adam Schiff's
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.120]  expertise in taking something you say and twisting it. To be very clear, in my previous prosecution,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.920]  Mueller's investigators took my emails and gave them to Schiff. Schiff then was able to fashion
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:19.040]  gotcha questions, all of whom were immaterial, but many of whom were quite clever in order to
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.160]  entrap me and and convict me for lying to Congress. Now, because the Mueller report was
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.800]  fully released by cold order on November 3rd, 2020, we now know that when the judge said you
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.240]  have been convicted of lying about matters of international importance regarding the WikiLeaks
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.760]  disclosures, we know from Mueller's report that that was entirely false. There was no evidence of
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.440]  that whatsoever. And Roger, let me interrupt you again only to back you up because we're not like
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.360]  mainstream media that makes a claim and doesn't show it. Since you mentioned it, it came out this
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.880]  week that he doctored text that we'll talk about that in a moment. We have the doctored text that's
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.520]  admitted, literally edited things, moved them around, put periods where they weren't, but
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:06.320]  worse than that, let's go back to Witch Hunt 2.0, the Russia gate, where he was reading a fake
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.320]  transcript that he said was of Trump and the Ukrainian president talking like the godfather,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.560]  which of course wasn't true. Here is real perjury. Here is real fraud. Here it is.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.360]  The essence of what the president communicates.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.320]  We've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:35.200]  But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.720]  from you, though. And I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.360]  I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand lots of it. On this and
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.520]  on that, I'm going to put you in touch with people, not just any people. I'm going to put
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.200]  you in touch with Attorney General of the United States, my Attorney General Bill Barr.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:03.200]  He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I'm going to put you
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.320]  in touch with Rudy. You're going to love him, trust me. You know what I'm asking, and so I'm
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:16.080]  only going to say this a few more times in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:22.480]  I'll call you when you've done what I asked. This is in some in character what the president
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.000]  was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine. It would be funny if it wasn't such a
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.960]  graphic betrayal of the president's oath of office. But as it does represent a real betrayal,
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.600]  there's nothing the president says here that is in America's interest. After all,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.560]  it is instead the most consequential. And he goes on to say the most consequential thing Trump did.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.840]  So he just told the world that was real. And for a couple days, he said it was real. People actually
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.800]  confronted him. He said, OK, I just made it up. So this is a person that you're being interrogated
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.320]  by yesterday. No kidding. You said Fifth Amendment because any speech to him, he will then
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.200]  misrepresent. If you talk to them, they will claim you said something else. So the only way
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.720]  to not be misrepresented by this fiction writer that will give Stephen King a run for his money
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.040]  is to not give him any material. What do they say in the 1983 hit movie War Games?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.040]  It's a strange game. It is a strange game. The only way to win is not to play. And that's what
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.720]  you're saying, Roger, right? Well, this this week, only just the day before I went to the
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:35.280]  committee session, Adam Schiff yet again caught taking a text message, which I now believe was
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:42.640]  sent from former Texas Governor Rick Perry, a good man, to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:51.600]  in which Adam Schiff truncates two entire paragraphs and places a period making it appear
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.440]  much shorter and then mischaracterizing it as somehow nefarious. Let's be very clear.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.240]  Donald Trump, any American, has the absolute right to speak about and to challenge the results
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:11.200]  of the last election. That is not unreasonable. It is not treasonous. It is not unconstitutional.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.360]  It is not criminal. And Roger, let me stop you again and just back back on what you're saying.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:25.760]  What is criminal is editing matters, announcing them from Congress. Adam Schiff hides behind his
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.880]  congressional immunity. Congressman, you pencil-necked geek. I challenge you to waive
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.320]  your congressional immunity. You have maligned me and defamed me for two years. If you have
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:45.760]  any cojones at all, if you are a man, it is questionable. I challenge you to waive your
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:53.280]  congressional immunity and face me in a court of law. You won't do so. Now, Congressman Schiff posed
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.000]  a question to me, asked me whether it was true that I had been convicted of the crime of lying
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.320]  to Congress, and I had said I specifically invoke my Fifth Amendment right regarding any question
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.720]  posed by you. I wish I could have given a more extensive answer, but to do so would have been
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.680]  to waive my Fifth Amendment privilege, which I was not going to do. Alex, I know that they have
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.840]  you in their sights. I also know that you have done nothing wrong. By the way, it would make a
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.160]  hell of a T-shirt. And my advice to you, this is not obstructing justice. This is just friend to
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:41.520]  friend. Do what your lawyer tells you to do. But given the track record of Adam Schiff and his
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:51.040]  colleagues and the faux Republican Liz Cheney to manipulate, to twist, to misrepresent what you've
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:57.440]  said, or to take things that you say that are irrelevant, immaterial, or innocuous and turn
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:05.040]  them into a crime that can send you to prison, this is not a legitimate good faith process.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:13.360]  If it were, then Speaker Pelosi would release the footage of Capitol Hill policemen bludgeoning,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:22.720]  tear gassing, beating on unarmed Trump supporters in the tunnel between the Capitol and the Senate.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:30.080]  She has not done so. I also call on Speaker Pelosi to release the audio transmissions
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:37.520]  of all of the law enforcement agency radio transmissions that day. Failure to do so
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.640]  proves that this isn't an investigation. This is a cover-up. Where is Ray Epps?
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:53.200]  Ray Epps is indisputably an FBI informant. He was seen on January 5th and 6th urging people
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.360]  to breach the building. I haven't seen a subpoena from the committee to Mr. Epps. I haven't seen
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:08.400]  that announced. So this isn't an investigation. This is yet a witch hunt. Let's call it 3.0.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.280]  Roger, stay right there. I want to interject here. Darren Beattie is going to be joining us
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.240]  coming up later in this special Saturday evening transmission. But what other broadcast do you find
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.360]  where you actually have the guest and the host in the crosshairs of the same system? So since you
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.240]  bring me up and give me your personal First Amendment advice, understand your advice is
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.840]  already basically where I am. So let me go ahead. Since this is all out in the news,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.200]  I know the committee is going to be watching this. And I'll go ahead and tell people what's
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.480]  going on. I told you 30 minutes before we went on air what had happened. Because again, we're U.S.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.760]  citizens and allowed to talk to each other about what's unfolding. Here's the CNN headline. House
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.720]  January 6th committee postpones deposition for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. And here's why
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.200]  that happened. When they sent us the subpoena weeks ago, I simply called around a whole bunch
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.680]  of lawyers and almost all the big top criminal lawyers said, well, my firm won't let me. And I
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.200]  said, well, I already have Norm Pattis. He's a famous criminal lawyer who's already representing
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.520]  me in defamation cases. I said, I'll go ahead and call Norm. And Norm is right up there on the top
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.440]  10 criminal lawyers in the country. And he said, well, I've got to do this trial I'm doing this
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.960]  week. I can come after I do this trial, which is totally normal. So he calls up the committee and
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.560]  I'm not going to get into all of it and just says, hey, I need time to get down there and check all
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.800]  this. He comes here. I go, here's my phone. There's everybody, everything. Here's all the emails,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.880]  everything. He looks at it and goes, my God, this is exculpatory. You're like a hero.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.960]  Because a lot of the stuff's not out yet. And I said, it doesn't matter. That'll never be put out
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:47.600]  by them. And so basically I told him, I said, you can have this stuff and then I'm done. You can
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.360]  sit there and try all your subpoenas, all this other crap, trying to make me come to DC. I know
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.720]  you want me in a perjury trap. This was a fiasco, as you said, boneheaded by the people that went in.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.120]  I wasn't part of that. Are you kidding? There's no evidence of that. I've told the truth. I don't
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.480]  want to be part of your circus. I don't want to be testifying before you because I know you get
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.120]  in front of these people. They want to put you in jail. They will absolutely just make up whatever
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.760]  they want. I mean, Schiff will read a fake transcript on air of me or something. So the only
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.600]  way to protect myself from a real criminal, which he is, is to not talk because he will then
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.960]  misrepresent whatever I've said. And so that's where we are. In fact, I'm just going to leave it
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.040]  at that. But that's where I am. Obviously I'm going to be sucked into Mordor. I'm going to have
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.040]  to be where you are very, very soon. I'm not going to get into the details of that. I really tried to
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.160]  treat them like they're not criminals and say, do you actually want to have a law firm certify?
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.360]  Here's everything on your search terms. Because it's not what you want. And obviously they know
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.160]  it's not what they want. They know I'm innocent of any premeditated garbage. They know we tried
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.240]  to stop it. They know that you, they've got all your text messages from everybody saying,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.200]  this is badly managed. They know you didn't even want to go. And I basically pistol whipped you
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.720]  into it. And I apologize again, Roger. Uh, and so that's where we are. And that's where I stand
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.480]  because there's no honor amongst thieves and you put yourself in the arena with frauds where they
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.120]  control the arena. You're not in the arena of men. You're in the arena of the criminals
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.240]  that have hijacked and run this country and sold it out. And again, just the only way to win is not
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.280]  to play. Well, and part of their strategy, you know, this Alex is to wear us down financially.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:35.280]  I mean, my trip to DC cost me $45,000 between security hotels, traveling, uh, and then the
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.640]  lawyers, cause I had to consult multiple attorneys. These are very specific and unique
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.040]  areas. We're not talking about a deposition by the FBI or an investigation by DOJ. We're talking
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.640]  about a congressional. Let me just stop you. I'm going to stop you. You're going to have the floor
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.600]  for at least 10 minutes. Then we got all these other things to get into with you that are so
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.160]  important. But let me just explain. I'm not ashamed to ask for money from our listeners.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.240]  We're the tip of the spear. We're under massive attack. You asked us to fight this war. I'm not
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.080]  bitching at you. I'm just saying we are literally in the 11th round with the enemy there. They're
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.840]  in trouble. We're in trouble. And so this is where the real fight is. And so absolutely go to Roger
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.120]  Stone's defense fund and donate folks because this guy is a prize. Like the, like the Roman
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.440]  standard, they want to capture and burn. Uh, they see me as capture the flag as well, just like
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:29.200]  Trump. And so you asked us as populist to fight. If they're able to destroy us, that sends a message
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.840]  to the Congressman and others, everybody else, be cowards, lay down, you'll be defeated. But if you
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.560]  rally behind us and hold us up as a standard, as the Bible says, when the enemy comes in like a
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.360]  flood, the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it. So I'm willing to go all out. I'm not
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.200]  going to back down. I'm not going to stop, but we almost couldn't do Christmas bonuses this year
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.840]  because there was no money. And then they go, wait a minute, listeners donated a couple of bitcoins.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.120]  So I cash those out to do Christmas bonus. And all I'm saying is
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.320]  we, I sold my house. I'm all in. I don't care. I'm not a victim. I'm not complaining. I'm,
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.440]  I'm winning. I'm changing the world, but we are your sword in this fight. And so I need you to
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.760]  go to info war store.com and get books and get films and get t-shirts. I need you to go to reset
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.360]  wars.com and sign up for this game changing, amazing course because it takes money to fight
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.200]  a war. You want us to keep fighting, keep supporting and you've been doing it. And I
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.720]  commend you, but we're taking on the democratic party. We're taking on the folks that bankrupted
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.880]  Remington. We're taking on the justice department that's hijacked by Chinese communist infiltrators
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.080]  that control Congress. We are literally your gladiators in the death battle against the new
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.760]  world order all the way. And so remember, we are an extension of your will against these people.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.760]  So we need your financial support now at info war store.com. Roger, where do people support
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:54.960]  the gladiator in the lion's den? Please go to stonedefensefund.com. That's stonedefensefund.com.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:02.000]  Give anything you can. They're trying to ground me down. As you know, Alex, I still have six
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:10.640]  remaining civil lawsuits that are just baseless harassment, unsubstantiated, groundless lawsuits
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:19.200]  filed by crackpots, nut jobs, left wingers, Soros backed front groups in an effort to wind,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.280]  just to grind you down and drag your name through the mud. So go to stonedefensefund.com.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:34.000]  Every penny is appreciated. Your prayers are appreciated. If God is for us, who can be against
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.320]  us? And Roger, let's elaborate on the money issue because that's a true story that we go to the bank
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.520]  account, the corporate account. Look, my enemies know they're already spying on us. They already know.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.280]  And there's like $200,000 in the whole company account two weeks ago. And I said,
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.680]  we can't give Christmas bonuses. And then luckily more money came in from reset wars.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.920]  So we're doing all right. We're like, hey, people gave you two Bitcoins and some other stuff.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.560]  Let's cash these in. So it becomes a news item. Why did Jones cash in his Bitcoin this week?
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.720]  Because we need the money. And look, I'm not bitching at people. I'm saying,
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.760]  you want somebody to take on Soros, you want somebody to take on the new world order,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.760]  Adam Schiff, we're doing it. And so we are your champions. Okay. You are our champions.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.520]  If you don't back us, we will fall in this. And I know I've got six lawsuits left for the 50
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.640]  something the Democrats filed. We're battling through. We're not going to give up. And here's
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.960]  the good news. People are waking up now. People know we told the truth. So we're more important
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.720]  than ever. That's why they want to put us in prison. That's why they want to say convicted
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.640]  felon Roger Stone or convicted felon Alex Jones. That's what they want because they're losing,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.160]  they're failing. And that's why your financial support now is more important than ever. And
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.920]  Roger, I got to say your new t-shirt designer. Ours are great. I designed most of them. Some
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.720]  of mine are wonderful. Most of them are just okay. Yours are the best ever. Where do people get a
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.800]  Roger Stone t-shirt? You've got your anti-vax t-shirts. You've got them all. Where do people
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:02.320]  find those? You can go to stonecoldtruth.com in the shop, stonecoldtruth.com in the shop,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:09.040]  or you can go to rogerstonestore.com. I've got to tell you, Alex, a great guy that you introduced
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.680]  me to, Eric Mancow Mueller, the Mancow. He's coming to Florida at Christmas because he and
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.960]  his family are taking my wife and my family out for Christmas dinner. Why? To tell you the truth,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.440]  we can't afford it. That's why. A great patriot, and we're going to spend some time
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.200]  and some great Christian fellowship. And by the way, I don't want to go there,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.000]  but I know your personal lawyers and everything, and I know what goes on.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.760]  You had a couple million dollar house. You had money. You hadn't been a lobbyist in 25 years.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.120]  You were an author, but you lost your house. And we're not here whining or bitching. We're explaining
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:47.840]  this isn't BS, ladies and gentlemen. So you ask people to go all the way. You ask people to stand
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.840]  up for you. We've done it. And so I am really tired of watching Roger barely hang on for life,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.680]  which encourages them to attack more. And I hate seeing info wars whittled back when our
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.240]  influence is the greatest it's ever been. We are one of the main, if not the most powerful weapon
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.440]  against the globalist. God has put us in this position. And so when Roger today said, Hey,
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.280]  can I also mention my T-shirt or something? I'm broke. I said, Roger, we're going to spend 10
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.280]  minutes on fundraising today. Just let me bring it up. Of course he didn't. He brought it up first
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.400]  because I get it. He's out of money. And so folks, one day you don't want to see info war shut down
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.920]  going into this critical time of 2022 with 325 days left from the election. So support us both
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.400]  today. Stone, tell them the, the defense fund that supports just the legal. And then also to support
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.320]  you for travel, bodyguards, everything else, get a T-shirt, wear a Roger stone shirt, trigger the
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:49.120]  enemy stone defense fund.com. That's stone defense fund.com. Alex, as you know, I have the greatest
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.800]  gift any man could have because last week we learned that my wife of 30 years, Nadia Stone is
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:03.840]  now cancer free. I can't tell you how many info warriors supported the expense of her all natural
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.480]  homeopathic and holistic cancer treatments. And our prayers have been answered. My wife of 30 years
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.640]  is healthy. She's strong. She's spiritual. This could never have been done. If you want to help
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.880]  us in that, because now remaining cancer free is crucial. She still needs the, the intravenous
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.800]  vitamin infusion. She still needs the peptides. They are specifically and particularly expensive.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:36.240]  You can go to stone family fund.com, but this is a demonstration of the power of prayer,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.240]  the power of Jesus Christ almighty. And I want to thank all of the info warriors and Alex,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.120]  everyone in your family, cause I know you've been praying for us and God has answered our prayers.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.960]  My beautiful wife is back on the ramparts. She actually stood in for me in a speech last week
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:59.360]  when I was unable to attend. And I can't tell you how proud I am of her and my daughter. So I want
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.400]  to thank everybody who's been there for us for the last two and a half years, two and a half years.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.720]  I have fought the witch hunt. I have fought the relentless hounding first of Robert Mueller and now
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:19.040]  of Congressman Adam Schiff, but I won't quit. I won't fold, but I can't do it alone. I can't fight it.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.360]  Absolutely. So in the time we have left with you, I got to go in about 15 minutes. Let let's run
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.040]  through all these other things. Amazing. People don't know, but for those that don't understand
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.640]  again, we're symbols of populism and Liberty that they want to destroy and put in prison.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.040]  So we can't respond. So they can lie about us to demonize the movement against this foreign
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.240]  globalist takeover. We literally are the front lines of the fight. I didn't ask in the modern
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.200]  world. I didn't think that I would be amongst the quote founding fathers of the resistance
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.360]  against the new world order. I didn't know it would come this fast, be this crazy, or I'd be
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.640]  in the middle of it. But imagine folks, this is where they put us. And that's why I just beg you
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.560]  to keep us in the fight because we're barely in the fight and it's taking massive support from you.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:07.280]  And we really appreciate it. And we don't want them to win. They want to break our will. Adam
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.560]  Schiff and Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and these other creatures, these Ed Buck worshipers
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.760]  are out to get us. And that's why I thank you all. I'm going to stop right there. Now, Roger,
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.560]  in the time we've got, you've talked about the January six prisoners. We'll get back into that.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.800]  You've talked about a lot of the big picture stuff. But imagine, I mean, they already indicted
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.200]  everybody they went after in Russia gate and put almost everybody in prison. So it's not like we're
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.600]  up here just going, oh, we're being subpoenaed by this is like you're subpoenaed in a car wreck by
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:44.400]  an insurance company. Folks, this is a political witch hunt that makes McCarthy blush literally
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.800]  out to put us in prison, admitting it. They're all over the news. They got former prosecutors
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.680]  licking their lips saying Alex Jones is a liar. He launched the attack. They're defaming me.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.640]  Roger Stone was a coward and launched the attack and headed his hotel. Total liars. I know I was
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.760]  there. It's me literally licking their lips going once they testify, we'll get them on perjury and
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:09.360]  they're going to jail because they'll say we lied. So we are literally in our end game. We are literally
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.920]  facing prison right now. And if they have their victory, we won't be here talking.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.800]  Imagine what a group like this is going to do to you and your dollar and the borders and your
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.520]  children and your medicine. You're the target. Like Trump always says, they're trying to get
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.080]  through him to get to you. That's exactly what's going on. So take this interview from
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.840]  Mandot video. It's right now streaming live at info wars.com, but from free world news.tv and
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.040]  Mandot video and share it like your future depends on it because it does. Now let's do 15 minutes,
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.360]  Roger. I got BD and others coming up. They're going to talk about the huge developments with
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.800]  that federal linked individual, Ray Epps and all the rest of it coming up huge news on that front.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.640]  But let's go through all this because I mean, you told me all this was game to talk about,
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.160]  but some of this stuff is, is, is just unbelievable that's going on. They brought up me and you and
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.840]  Trump and just made stuff up. Uh, you've got just, just, uh, they were asking about fundraising.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.400]  I mean, let's go through these notes, go through it all for people.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.800]  Well, once again, um, I answered the fifth amendment to every question that was posed to
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.760]  me in a very precise wording supplied by my attorneys. Um, the, what they would like to prove,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.320]  which does not exist, uh, is that I, or you, Alex, or anyone else, uh, was in some way
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:36.720]  coordinating with president Trump because you see he's the real target. They are deathly afraid
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.480]  that he's going to run for president again and beat them for a third time. And I believe he's
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.000]  beaten them twice. I must tell you, I saw the former president a couple of weeks ago,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.320]  and he looks better than he's ever looked in his life. He was 25 pounds lighter in excellent
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:00.880]  spirits, but very deeply hurt by what he sees happening to this country. The gasoline prices,
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:09.520]  our ignominious retreat in Afghanistan, where we left them $86 million worth of military equipment,
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.920]  making the Afghani, uh, army, the fourth best armed army in the world, 86 billion,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.920]  86 billion. Pardon. That's what I meant. Uh, and beyond that, our own generals could have
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.120]  destroyed. They could have blown the stuff up if they couldn't remove it, but they declined to do
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:33.600]  so. No general Milley is not stupid. As the president says, he's a trader. There's a big,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:40.080]  big difference. Uh, I'm very optimistic about the future because the backdrop for a resurgence
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:48.480]  is never better. We will win the 2022 elections. We'll win both houses. If we have a free, fair,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.680]  honest, and transparent election that can only happen. If there are outlets like info wars
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:02.080]  that are out there telling you what is really going on, what is really happening. I can tell
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:08.640]  you right now, I guarantee you the investigators for the January six, uh, are gathered around
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.040]  their computers, watching this broadcast, taking notes, trying to find something that they can now
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:22.320]  ask Alex Jones about. Should he choose to appear before them? This is a game of gotcha. There is
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:29.680]  no real crime. The only crime here is by them. Why hasn't why didn't speaker Pelosi
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:36.800]  called the national guard? Why didn't that happen? Why won't they release the video that shows a
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:44.320]  woman literally being trampled to death in the tunnel between the U S Capitol and the U S Senate?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:51.200]  What is it they fear? I can tell you what they fear. They fear the truth. And now their plan
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:58.640]  is to criminalize perfectly legal, perfectly normal, constitutionally protected, political
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:06.160]  free speech, free assembly, the right to call out the election irregularities. They're trying to make
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:12.160]  these things crimes. They're not crimes. We have constitutional protections that guarantee this,
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.920]  but that is their game plan. That's why I joined Alex in asking you to go and do your Christmas
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:25.040]  shopping at the info wars.com store, because that way you can not only get great products,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:32.560]  but you can keep this flagship afloat without info wars and a handful of others. And by the way,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.960]  Alex, one of the things they wanted to ask me about, they paid clippings of my interview with
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:42.640]  Tucker Carlson on Fox Nation. If you haven't seen it, you really need to see it. But they played
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:50.560]  clipping specifically from that interview where I said correctly that immediately after the president
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:57.760]  spoke on the ellipse, I was contacted by the Secret Service asking to escort me to the Capitol.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:04.000]  The idea was to get me at the Capitol at the exact time you arrived and at the exact time
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.480]  that the Capitol was breached. I declined. I also declined, based on the Fifth Amendment,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.080]  to answer any questions about that yesterday. But it just goes to show you they're monitoring
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.360]  my interviews with Tucker Carlson, with the great Tucker Carlson, and trying to twist that
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:28.480]  against you in some way. It's insidious. It's nefarious. It's evil. In fact, I think it's
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:35.360]  satanic. But we won't fold. We won't yield. We won't give up if people will just support us,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:40.560]  if people have our backs. Absolutely, because we're now symbols of the American populist rebellion.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.920]  That's why if there was another Alex Jones or Roger Stone, I'd be supporting them,
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.360]  because that's somebody they're trying to take down. In closing here, some folks have decided
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.560]  to talk to the committee. I don't know if you can get into that, but then they just try to twist
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.680]  what they say when they've done nothing wrong or completely open. I can't imagine being people like
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:06.640]  this, that are just this evil and literally are the opposite of justice. Well, yesterday you saw
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.000]  Speaker Pelosi arguing that members of Congress should be able to trade stocks, essentially on
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.320]  the basis of insider information. 72 members of Congress hold stock in Pfizer, the company that
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:29.760]  makes the vaccination they're trying to force every American to take. This is evil and it's wrong,
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:35.120]  but these are people who are not acting like they are comfortable in power. They're not acting like
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.640]  they're people who are confident in power. They act to me like people who know the vengeance of
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.600]  Jesus Christ is coming, and they need to do everything possible as quickly as possible
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:53.280]  to snuff out our constitutional rights, cancel the US Constitution, and jail and perhaps destroy all
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:59.920]  of their political critics. That's why I'm glad to be with you here today on Infowars. I can't
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.440]  even begin to tell you, and it's in my book, The Making of the President of 2016, the impact that
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:12.640]  Infowars has had in the last five years. Without Infowars, Donald Trump would never have been
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:19.280]  nominated for president, never mind elected president. Without Infowars, the truth about
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:28.240]  the Russian collusion hoax would never be known. Without Infowars, and a few brave journalists like
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:36.000]  Tucker Carlson, the truth about the second Ukrainian impeachment hoax would not be known.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.960]  If it weren't like the upcoming journalist, Dr. Beatty, with Revolver, which is a website that
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:50.320]  you absolutely must tune into, because Darren Beatty has done journalistic work that no other
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.160]  investigative journalist has had the courage to do to demonstrate that the entire January 6th
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:04.800]  riot is a setup, a government-encouraged setup, and he is piercing through that cover story like no
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.800]  one else in the country. He's got big breaking news in a moment, but before we forget to get there,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.760]  I said, hey, why was your press conference less than three minutes long before we went on air?
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.000]  And you said, oh, they threatened to arrest us. So I've been to that office building. I've been there
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.440]  before, but then with you, for stuff we were covering, and there's press all lined up right
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.520]  there. That's where they are. And so you come out where the press is, and they go, no, we'll arrest
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:33.440]  you. Move along. So you still did two minutes, 17 seconds. So now they're not only trying to put you
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.720]  in jail and take your free speech and say these rallies are illegal that preceded January 6th,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:44.560]  but now the Capitol Police under the control, as you said off air, the meth head, Pelosi,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.240]  don't even let you have your free speech in front of a press conference. I mean, this is crazy.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.880]  They summon you there, but then you're not even allowed to talk to the press.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:57.760]  Yeah, it's absolutely true, Alex. Look, I can barely clear my throat in two and a half minutes.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.880]  I had a lot more to say. I had to be succinct because the Capitol Hill police officer was
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:09.840]  telling us to move along. He essentially told us we had three minutes. So they not only don't want
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:17.520]  you to have a free, fair investigation, they don't even want you to speak. They don't even want you
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.600]  to have your opportunity to tell your side of it. That's why I had to be here on the show today.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:30.320]  This is the first interview I have given since leaving Washington DC with my skin. And it is
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:36.640]  always great to be with you, Alex. I'm going to promo this so that as many people as possible
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.880]  can see it because I think we have made a little history here today.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:46.480]  Absolutely. And when you first came on 40 minutes ago and you said, listen, I put my life in my
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.440]  hands going to DC. I've got to have at least six, seven security because, yeah, a lot of people,
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.120]  hey, we love you. Shake your hand. But then Antifa sees you. They get a call. Suddenly they know
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.760]  where you're at. A mob shows up trying to attack you. And that's what's happened to Rand Paul
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.400]  and so many others are trying to walk down the street and within minutes they're attacking him.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.000]  He's been shot at. He's had his ribs broken. I mean, this is what it's like to be in Portland
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.840]  or D.C. or areas of New York City now or even Chicago. It's very, very frightening how
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.400]  authoritarian and out of control. And these people aren't fighting corruption. They're fighting for
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.520]  the establishment against the few mavericks like Senator Paul, who were telling the truth and
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:34.640]  exposing Fauci. It's absolutely true, Alex. And as I said earlier, airports, restaurants,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:39.920]  just walking down the street. If you're a free thinker, if you're a Trump supporter,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.960]  if you're an info warrior, if you believe in the Constitution, you're taking your life in your
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:51.040]  hands. They don't want to just yell and scream obscenities at you. I had a guy yesterday walking
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.880]  through TSA threatening to kill me with police officers standing around. I do my best to ignore
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:03.440]  them. I don't want to engage. I'm not a violent person. But don't touch me. Don't push me. Don't
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:11.040]  poke my chest. It would be a major, major mistake. I can't believe this is happening in America.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.080]  If I were in a public space and I saw some prominent liberal politician, I wouldn't yell
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.520]  obscenities at them. I wouldn't threaten them. I'd ignore them. That's what should be done.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.120]  But that's not what is. Absolutely. They're censoring us. They're attacking us. They're
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.600]  trying to put us in jail. I know you don't pay attention to it, but my God, the calls to arrest
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.160]  us and put us in prison and rape and kill us are just and now they want to say that a lot about
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.440]  raping your wife. I mean, these people are just foaming at the mouth. Yeah, unbelievable for
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.240]  anybody who missed this Saturday. And I've actually made a joke that because I had invoked my Fifth
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:50.560]  Amendment right, that members of the January 6th Committee should be able to gang rape my 74 year
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.680]  old wife, who is now winning her battle with cancer. It's hard to believe that anyone think
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:03.440]  that that's funny or entertaining or in good taste. But not a single member of the January
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:10.240]  6th Committee has denounced that obscenity, has denounced that hate crime. That shows you what
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.200]  kind of people we're dealing with. Alex, thank you. God bless you. I'm going to move on down the road.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:21.760]  I want to see what Dr. Darren Beatty has to say. One of the most courageous journalists in America
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.800]  today. Absolutely. Roger Stone, one more time, the websites.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:35.520]  stonedefensefund.com, stonedefensefund.com to help me in my legal battle, stonedefensefund.com
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:42.320]  to help my wife in her ongoing battle to stay cured of cancer, cured of cancer. And of course,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:49.360]  if you want one of those great Roger Stone t-shirts, go to stonecoldtruth.com in the shop
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:55.040]  or go to rogerstonestore.com. And Roger, I can hear people coming in to get you. You got to go.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:00.160]  But two last things. One minute, because I got notes we didn't hit. Restate your North Korea
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:06.240]  comments we had before we went on air, if you can. And then also, you were talking about this
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.800]  is literally a Lyonsden for you moment. I was saying, hey, what do I call the interview? Speak
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.520]  to those points, the North Korea comment, the Lyonsden comment. Yeah, I mean, I heard this from
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:21.360]  someone else who was who was questioned by the committee. This person said, no, I know nothing
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:27.040]  whatsoever about the plans to break into the Capitol. And their response was, so in other words,
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.480]  you are admitting today that you were deeply involved in the plans to break into the Capitol.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:40.800]  That's how North Korea like this is. You do feel like you're in Lyonsden. So I felt in a D.C.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:48.160]  courtroom with a biased judge, a crooked jury forum and a completely rigged jury
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:55.040]  and corrupt prosecutors. It's the way I felt on Friday. But on the other hand,
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.360]  I had the protection of the Lord. I had prayed substantially. There had been prayer chains,
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.720]  prayer groups with me. I went in with the protection of God. I was not afraid. I knew
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.200]  what I had to do and I did it. And Alex, I will never stop fighting for this country
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:19.840]  as long as the Patriots, as long as the info warriors have our backs. Thank you. God bless
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.600]  you and Merry Christmas. Absolutely. Powerful. Thank you, Roger. Be safe.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.200]  Like Roger said a few weeks ago, he said, whether we like it or not, we're joined at the hip now.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.600]  We're going to go to break for just a moment. And then Jacob Engels, who was there with Rogers,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.280]  also an investigative journalist who's been massively hacked and attacked. He broke the
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.520]  big thing with the gubernatorial candidate in the meth party. That's why he's been punished so much.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:48.240]  He's going to be joining us for about 30 minutes. And then the gentleman they're talking about the
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.280]  head of Revolver with big breaking news that just broke this morning with more proof of the Fed's
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.400]  provocateuring and trying to lead some of the million people there for Trump into that operation
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:04.080]  that's coming up here in about 35 minutes from now. And then more on this emergency
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.920]  Saturday transmission. I'm up here seven days a week, as you never know when we might be in
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.880]  prison or killed or nuclear war is going to start. I mean, it's all crazy. Stay with us.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:24.320]  We'll be back on the other side. Well, here we are. The year 2021 is almost over.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.320]  Christmas is just a few days away. I want to take a little bit of time out to thank you all
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.840]  for keeping us in the fight. The new world order would have already basically won if it wasn't for
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.760]  info wars. And I'm not bragging. I'm letting you know that together as a family, we have changed
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:47.440]  the world and that we have a responsibility because God put us in this position to not back
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.720]  down now at the very critical point. This is an info war and the globalists are trying to break
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:58.640]  your will and demoralize you. And I produced a two part course, mind war, spirit war, six plus hours
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:04.320]  that lays out the most game changing information ever. It's available right now at reset wars.com
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.720]  and through Christmas day, we have extended the sale 25% off. So reset wars is now available
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.800]  at info war store.com and also reset wars.com for 25% off. Thanks for getting the course
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.480]  and thanks for keeping info wars on the air.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.640]  Infowars tomorrow's news today.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.720]  All right. I was already trying to get Jacob Engels on two weeks ago, but he was traveling
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.520]  and was busy. And then I just so happened to finally get him when he was with Roger Stone and
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:54.880]  in DC yesterday, he may still be there. I don't know if he got back to Florida, but the reason
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.280]  I wanted to get him on is he helped break and push the big story with the Democrat gubernatorial
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.400]  candidate caught in the big gay orgy with the methamphetamine and the drugs. And then he got
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.520]  persecuted. He got hacked, he got attacked, he got sued and he finally got back up. But he's another
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.360]  example of who they're trying to take down because Jacob Engels continues to be right at the tip of
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.360]  the spear. So I want to get his take on the general world and where he sees it all going and
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.160]  so much more ahead of the Revolver chief editor and owner coming on with this big breaking news.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.920]  Jacob is a publisher at Central Florida Post, a contributor with the New Dawn magazine. He is
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:34.640]  committed to truth journalism on a local level, centralfloridapost.com, truly embattled. That's
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.160]  who we always have on as the folks that the enemy's after because we know they're over the
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.320]  target. So Jacob, great to have you back. I remember you, you and I and Roger out at dinner
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.320]  and stuff years ago before we even got indicted. And I was making jokes at dinner that Roger,
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.640]  you're not a Russian, ha ha ha. And I was airplaneing in pieces of steak at Eddie V's.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.960]  But now it's not funny. I'm not laughing now because being innocent doesn't mean
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.840]  jack crap with the CHICOM run committee. So give us your bird's eye view and your
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:06.160]  fly on the wall view of traveling with Roger from Florida up to DC and what you witnessed yesterday.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.680]  Pretty historic stuff that makes McCarthy look like a saint.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:16.640]  Absolutely, Alex. And the scariest thing was just before Roger's hearing yesterday,
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:22.320]  before the January 6th committee, I wrote an article about how one of the top members of
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:28.640]  that committee, she's actually my congresswoman in Central Florida, her husband has a company that
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:35.360]  they manufacture their products exclusively in China, in Chinese Communist Party controlled
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.400]  factories and facilities. And she's allowed to sit on this committee and talk about, well,
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:45.120]  if you question election integrity, if you question the results of the 2020 election,
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:49.760]  you shouldn't be allowed to join the military. You shouldn't be allowed to have security clearance.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.840]  No, it's people like Stephanie Murphy who shouldn't have security clearance. These are the
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:59.120]  people who are trying to lock us up for using our voice and our constitutionally protected free
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:04.080]  speech, Alex. You know, it's funny you raised that. I didn't know you would. There's a gateway
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.920]  part of an article about it, obviously, and you've been writing about it. But that's where
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.320]  I was going next. So we're definitely simpatico right now. Break this down more. This is a big
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.960]  deal. This is who's sitting in judgment. You have Swallow's Well, who's got an admitted Chinese
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.400]  agent. You've got Dianne Feinstein, literally on the payroll, her chief of staff being a Chinese
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:30.080]  communist agent. I mean, this is sick. Yeah. And Stephanie Murphy, Alex, she runs in 2016 and she
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.040]  beats a Republican incumbent who was there for 20 years, probably stayed a little bit too long.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.520]  And she turns a district that was Republican for 20 years now is becoming increasingly far left
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.240]  and Democratic. And a lot of people in Orlando, where the district is, we're starting to call it
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:52.480]  Portland East with all of the homelessness and Antifa and BLM activity downtown. But her husband
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:58.400]  runs a sportswear manufacturing company where she actually holds patents on some of the most
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:05.200]  popular products, Alex, and they produce exclusively in China. And Business Insider and
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.320]  everybody else has covered this, that under Xi Jinping, he has increased the amount of CCP
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:18.880]  operatives in every factory in China, foreign owned and owned even by Chinese citizens.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:24.240]  So what kind of pillow talk is she bringing home to her husband that he then runs to his handlers
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:32.160]  at the CCP and bribes them and gets sweet deals. And she's allowed top secret and national security
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:39.040]  secrets and access to these information briefings. And we're talking about if you made a QAnon post
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:44.240]  or you were at stop the steel rallies like you were at, Alex, in Georgia and all over the country
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.440]  fighting for the integrity of this election and country. And we shouldn't have security clearances.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:55.520]  Are you kidding me? Great point. And again, you write over at centralfloridapost.com that you run,
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.000]  also Gateway Pundit. I want you to write for him for so many places. And I love how, again,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.280]  you're under massive attack yourself, but you didn't bring up yourself. That's why I want to
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.280]  get you on a few weeks ago. You want to bring up America being under attack. But talk about Roger
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.720]  being under attack, obviously what you witnessed yesterday. And then let's get into wherever you
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:17.280]  want to go, Jacob. Yeah, well, yesterday we go to the hearing, Alex, and you have this den of vipers
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.080]  that he's about to step into these demonically really, I think, possessed and compromised
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:27.760]  individuals. Their souls are in a sad state of affairs. And the news media is out there and
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.280]  they're mobbing him like a Justin Bieber concert. But instead of asking important questions that we
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.680]  all want to know the answer to really important things that American people care about, they're
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:44.480]  saying, where's your top hat? Where's your monocle? Where's an outrageous outfit from you? They want
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:49.520]  to make us all into caricatures. But Roger went into that hearing. He asserted his Fifth Amendment
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.000]  right. He came out, made a statement, called out Nancy Pelosi for withholding that surveillance
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.080]  footage and went on his merry way. But these people, it was funny. They were, when we were
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:05.040]  waiting outside the media, they're like, Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, weird, weird. Alex is coming tomorrow.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:10.160]  Where's Alex? Do you know when he's going to arrive? Trying to get information out of me to
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.720]  drop a dime on you so they could harass you. This is how sick, but also how stupid they are.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:21.760]  I'm never going to sit here and provide intel on our fellow patriots and do silly things like that.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:26.000]  But that's what the media was doing. And then we go back a couple of weeks ago, and something
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:33.120]  you've talked about for years is the perversion of our schools and our students and the upbringing
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.880]  that they have in these government run institutions, public schools. And I went to a
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:41.040]  public school meeting, school board meeting, and I exposed this gender queer book, which-
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.760]  Yeah, that's where we're going. Again, I'm not anti-straight, anti-gay, anti-anything,
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.720]  but children, I don't care if it's heterosexual, I don't care what it is,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.560]  leave children alone. That's why I wanted you on weeks ago, and you got thrown out. In fact,
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.360]  I forgot to have the crew get the video. Tell them where to grab it and they will.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.120]  But you got thrown out for simply criticizing on our own reporter,
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.720]  Christy Lee got thrown out in Austin for doing it. And I mean, this is images of children having
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:11.360]  sex with adults. Yeah, and it's even worse than that. It's the graphic images, Alex, but then
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:17.120]  the text and the way that they're speaking about it is something that I probably couldn't even find
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:22.400]  in the Hustler store down in Fort Lauderdale or in the Playboy store. And it was just so,
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.880]  it's like the deep dark part of the internet is where this content's coming from.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.040]  And as you know, you were there, but all over the country, they leave it in the library and
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]  when parents try to bring it to the police, they go, we may arrest you. That's obscene.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.240]  Yes, Alex. And you make a great point because they had a school board meeting
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:47.920]  on Tuesday of this week, and they were more concerned about, well, it was such a spectacle.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:53.760]  It was an agitator who brought this up. They were more concerned about denigrating me than they were
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:59.520]  the fact that the people in eighth, ninth grade were allowed to check out this material without
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.280]  permission from parents, Alex. And that's the biggest thing. We don't care, gay, straight.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:08.080]  We don't want this kind of sexualized content, but most importantly takes away your right as a
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.320]  parent. How do we know that's it? They're not just, they're trying to get over parental rights
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.400]  all over the world. They're giving kids shots without their parents' consent. That is literal
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:24.880]  biological rape. Yes, no, 100%. And then they're raping their minds with this perverse content.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:32.240]  And after I exposed them and that video went viral, Alex, what happens? I sustained a cyber
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:41.200]  attack on my website from Russia, from Ukraine, from Myanmar. It lasted weeks. And I've attacked
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:45.200]  George Soros before. He sent me cease and desist. I've exposed Andrew Gillum. I've been on this
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.680]  program so many times with you exposing big things, but really the culture war is where
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.680]  it's at. That's what broke the camel's back. I totally agree. So that was, let's talk about
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.600]  that Rubicon and why you think that is, but I'm sure Russia launches real attacks themselves.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.880]  They're not perfect, but generally I've read in the Vault 7 documents how the CIA and other groups,
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.560]  mainly ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, they're the private intelligence agencies. We have articles
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.720]  here where they're tracking everybody in real time. The ADL is talking about spying on us,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:18.080]  that they grab servers or they grab people's computers in Russia or Ukraine and they attack
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.960]  so Russia and Ukraine can be blamed. Do you think Russia really attacked you? Or do you have any
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:28.880]  idea who really did it? Well, we're still an investigation and I think you hit the nail on the
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:34.560]  head though. They get into our servers, they erase everything and the public HTML that they leave over
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:41.680]  on the dead website, Alex, was tens of thousands of code in Russian. So I think that was part of
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:46.640]  their plan to make it seem like my source code was in Russian, that my site was built by Russian
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.560]  propagandists and that fits into their whole phony narrative. Okay, I don't even know that,
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.440]  but that's what Vault 7 says is they break into your server, they put the evidence on it that
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:01.920]  you're with a foreign power so you can be the enemy. Absolutely, absolutely. And it's in the
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.640]  past, my website being down now, it's past me not being able to report the news. What kind of
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:14.000]  perception does that create? People then think that I'm somehow compromised by these assets,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.360]  that they could be in trouble. I had people who didn't even want to talk to me on the phone,
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:25.600]  they're afraid that they get hacked. And then it takes me to spend all of this money and put all
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:30.080]  of this effort out there to get my website back. So it cripples you for a couple of weeks when you're
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.480]  missing all of these big stories. And who knows, we could have had the biggest story and I couldn't
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.760]  have done it because I didn't have the website because I wanted to put it back up when it was
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.360]  safe and I knew it was secure. But we're still raising money on our give, send, go, give, send,
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:52.720]  go.com slash CFP. And the next stage of our fundraising is me being able to hire a cybersecurity
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:57.840]  expert so I can know the exact source of the attack. Because we have the digital breadcrumbs
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.480]  and I just have to have somebody with some knowledge and experience and they can tell us
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.040]  exactly who did it. And by the way, speaking of persecution, I want to get everybody on who's
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.160]  real and hardcore and breaking huge news like you've been doing.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.480]  But let's talk about the real most persecuted person of anybody out there and that's Julian
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.840]  Assange. What do you make of him? Nine years now in jail, multiple years solitary confinement,
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.320]  a CIA team, two women wanted to have sex with him. They now dropped the charges,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.720]  they admit it was a CIA setup. That's admitted. Now he's had a stroke. Now they're going to
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.200]  extradite him here. I think this is Trump's greatest failure. And I like Trump overall,
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.880]  way better than Nancy Pelosi. But the fact that he said, I don't care who's got the WikiLeaks,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:46.160]  release them. I don't care who has the emails. And then he leaves him out to dry, leaves him
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.800]  in a twist in the wind. This for me is just really pisses me off. I don't want to obsess
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.680]  over Trump, but 20% Trump, 80% the globalists. But what do you make of what's happened to Julian
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.120]  Assange? Because he's being tortured to death right now in solitary confinement.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:08.480]  I think Alex, I would have to decide that that is the most egregious failure of President Trump,
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.240]  that he did not get Julian Assange out of there, provide him the protections, allow him to release
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.640]  any other documents that he had. And you know what? He should have quite frankly hired him
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.600]  as an investigator to get the intelligence community, CIA, the deep state under control.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.520]  What he did was a patriotic service for every citizen of the world. What he did is real
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.800]  journalism. And even somebody like Glenn Greenwald, Intercept and Daily Mail and other
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.840]  places that he writes for. Glenn, who was the toast of the town for the liberals, they loved
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.920]  Glenn Greenwald when he was exposing the Bush administration and reporting on a lot of what
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.360]  Julian Assange was doing. But all of a sudden when Julian Assange starts attacking the Democrats,
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.440]  when Trump gets into office and starts exposing the failures and the hypocrisy and corruption of
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.160]  them, Julian Assange is verboten. He's not allowed. He should be in jail. He should die.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.280]  The kind of stuff you see on Twitter from so-called free speech activists and Columbia
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:12.320]  School of Journalism journalists is really gross. But they hate us. They hate Trump. They hate you,
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.880]  Alex. They hate the people listening to this program so much that they're willing to kill
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.880]  Julian Assange. And they've been torturing him for years in this confinement and having him stuck in
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:30.000]  that embassy. And I really am concerned for him. Let's talk about CentralFloridaPost.com because
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.960]  again, I want to have people that are in the front lines of the fights that are breaking
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.320]  huge stories. You've broken so many huge stories, Jacob. Tell us about Central Post. Tell us about
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.360]  some of the big stories you've been breaking and why they're trying to shut you down. Because as
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.680]  you said, when you got into the culture wars, when you really exposed that governor candidate
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.640]  ill-beating, when you exposed the fact that they're literally promoting pedophile books
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.120]  at local schools, that's when they shut you down, which is showing their main target is the children.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.840]  Yes. And that's what we continue to do. I try and take the Infowars approach on a micro
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.920]  local level, Alex. That's why I say truth journalism on a local level. And I don't care
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.760]  if it's Democrat, Republican. We exposed Andrew Gillum in 2018 when he was running for governor.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.120]  We were the first publication to come out and say that he was involved in gay sex orgies where
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.880]  drugs were prevalent. We said that in 2018. And even members of the Republican party and
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.720]  conservative movements said, Jacob, you've gone too far. That's too much. You can't talk about
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.800]  his personal life. And then- It turned out it was all true. You guys said that before the photos
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:37.280]  were even out. Yep. And then the issue is they're obviously blackmailing him. We're not attacking
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.760]  the guy because he's in a hotel room. That's his own world. The point is that he's been blackmailed.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.640]  Yes, Alex. And that's the point I made in 2018 when I first reported on Andrew Gillum's gay sex
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.000]  orgies and everything else he was involved in. I said, if this guy gets elected governor,
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.800]  the lobbyists, the powers that be, the special interests, they're going to have the photos,
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.560]  they're going to have the videos, and they'll get every piece of dirty legislation through there
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.880]  that they want by blackmailing him. And then we find out it's absolutely true. I get no apologies.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.880]  I don't get any retractions, but I don't care about that. I care about telling the truth.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.120]  And so that's what we continue to do. And again, I said, it's not just Democrats. We have
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.680]  Republicans running in these primaries that claim to be America first, Alex. And that's what I'm
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.480]  focusing on in the next couple of months is exposing these people who are grifting off of
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.480]  the movement and taking money out of people's pockets by claiming they're for America first
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.680]  when they're really McCarthy, Deep State, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, RINOs.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.320]  Absolutely. Let's talk about them because it almost looks like the neocons are in charge of
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.200]  the Democrats. From your research, who's in charge of all this?
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.920]  The neocons really kind of have that staying power in Washington, Alex. And they control
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:57.040]  that establishment, kind of saber-rattling war hawk caucus, I would like to call it. And that
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:03.680]  is across the board, Republicans and Democrats. So we really can't trust anybody anymore. We can't
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.840]  trust the people that are running for office. The only way we know we can trust them is if
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.480]  they stood up for people like you, people like me, President Trump, Roger Stone, everyone else
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.960]  that's been persecuted. Exactly. The litmus test is, are the globalists after you? Because I've
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.360]  seen some of these candidates getting caught by Veritas behind the scenes when I hate Republicans.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.400]  I'm just running to take over, just like this Congresswoman is a Chinese connected agent that
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.200]  you were talking about. Yes. And we'll go back to Stephanie Murphy for a second, Alex. I just want
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.600]  to talk about how she was one of the first people to use the Capitol Police in an improper way.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.320]  In 2018, when I was covering her doing Man on the Street, I'd have to show up and pop out of
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.760]  the bushes basically to try and get her to answer questions. She communicated to a local chamber of
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.800]  commerce that there were credible threats against her. And when that individual pressed them and
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.840]  said, well, what do you mean? You can't have control over the guest list. You can't tell us
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.400]  who we can have at this event. Her chief of staff and her staffers said that I had been identified
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.440]  as an active security threat by the Capitol Police against her. And they used that as a
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.000]  reasoning to get local law enforcement to show up and throw me out and manhandle me.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.080]  So she is a Pelosi puppet, but she's also one of Pelosi's favorite because her family that she
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.040]  married into, Alex, runs Full Sail University. It is the largest for-profit university in the United
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:27.840]  States that, by the way, survives almost 90 percent on Pell Grants, federally funded dollars that they
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:33.040]  get in the pocket and keep as private money. So we're funding their operation. They send her to
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:40.160]  Washington. And her husband's running this company over in China. And she is allowed to have access
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:47.120]  to intelligence briefings and top secret documents. And we're not, you know, we need to
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:54.000]  scream from the rooftops. There's Stephanie Murphy. But we remember Fang Fang. Fang Fang banged her
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.120]  way into Eric Swalwell's office and he never had to pay for that crime. So we just have to keep an
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.800]  eye on these people and keep. Well, it's like Dianne Feinstein's head person was a Chi-Com agent.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:09.360]  I mean, it's just it's incredible how infiltrated and controlled this country is.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:16.800]  Yeah. And when it's not their own personal money, it's their spouse's money or their family's
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:22.400]  money. There's always some connection to Chinese Communist Party or to these foreign elements that
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:29.760]  they accuse us of being inclusion with Russians, China, all over the world. And that's what they do.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.600]  They project its projection. Oh, Jacob Ingalls, he's a Russian disinformation agent. No, you are.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.760]  But you paint me with that brush because you silenced me on Facebook, Twitter and everywhere
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:46.000]  else like they've done to you, Alex. So our best thing to do is to keep doing programs like yours
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.120]  and keep writing. I don't care if you have time for one article a week. American citizens should
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:56.800]  be out there being citizen journalists. You're absolutely right. You know, Jacob Ingalls,
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:04.480]  what else is on your radar screen? The COVID lockdown tyranny, the open borders, the devaluation,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:09.760]  the currency inflation. I mean, my goodness. Worst inflation in U.S. history. And they say
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.280]  it's only going to get worse. Where do you see this going? Well, all of those are very important
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:20.320]  issues, Alex, but I come back to the Capitol Police. Nancy Pelosi announced two months ago
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.880]  that she's going to start opening regional offices of the Capitol Police that only have
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.040]  jurisdiction in the district. Exactly. What do you make of them saying they're opening
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.040]  up offices all over the country? First, California and Florida. What is that?
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.920]  Well, that's so they can get into these school board meetings, get into these county commission
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.800]  meetings. And they've already tried to label these parents and community members as domestic
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.880]  terrorists for daring to speak up about their elected representation. But when you put the threat
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.680]  of the Capitol Police and I did public records requests with the city of Tampa, Alex, where this
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.840]  is supposed to be happening, they came back and said, we don't know where their office is. We've
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.720]  had no coordination with them. They've sent us no email, no text message, no phone call. Now,
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.840]  any other law enforcement agency, there would be some paper trail coordinating with local law
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:13.440]  enforcement to get office space, to get coordination with staff, extra help shutting down streets,
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:20.400]  any type of their operations. Why is that not there? Why don't we know where this office is?
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:27.120]  And once we identify where this office is, I really think that people need to be made aware
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.560]  and know what's going on in their community because these are the last step of any authoritarian
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:39.280]  takeover is to establish a Praetorian guard of enforcers. Yeah. And so if you get these regional
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.240]  Capitol Police offices open in every state, Alex, can you imagine now Congresswoman Murphy,
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.960]  if she shows up at an event, she's got an armed brigade of goons. So nobody can question her
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:57.680]  any more. And that is really scary. And they have full power to arrest you and to operate
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.680]  in your communities and local law enforcement. Governor DeSantis, do something about this. Please
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.040]  do something about this. What about DeSantis? I mean, people can say, oh, he went to Yale.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.760]  We don't trust him. But Christ said, judge the tree by its fruits. I mean, he's been doing,
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.880]  I think, overall better than Trump. I mean, I mean, I just have a good feeling about DeSantis
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.280]  that he just at the end of the day has children and doesn't want them enslaved. I know he kind
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.040]  of came out of the establishment, but man, I got a good feeling about DeSantis. What do you think?
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.800]  Well, he's really kind of grown on me, Alex. And I have to give a lot of credit to Roger because
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.200]  in the past couple of months, Roger has hit on a lot of these issues. He said, well, DeSantis,
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:43.920]  you said no mandates or no lockdowns for vaccine or for mask, but you have these local municipalities
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:51.040]  and towns disobeying that. So you need to crack down on it. And then Roger had brought up the
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.240]  point of the election integrity. And DeSantis, after Roger brought that up, he said, we're
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.040]  establishing the Office of Election Integrity in Florida with full law enforcement investigation.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.120]  By the way, let's just start over. Exactly. Well, that's why I wanted you on two weeks ago
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:12.080]  because I was reading your articles about this. This is huge. I mean, Roger is aggressively
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.080]  demanding this, which I get. Roger's telling me, don't be nice to Trump. Tell him what you want.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.640]  Don't kiss his ass. Well, that's inside baseball, but he doesn't want a little buddy. He wants
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.200]  somebody that's like a man. I'm like, okay, well, it's the president, but all right.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.280]  And so I would tell Trump, I want this. Tucker Carlson did that too. So what you're saying is
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:36.000]  Roger did this and DeSantis has come out with an election integrity move. He's come out and said,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.920]  don't let people take shots or wear a mask. And he's actually going after the cities.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.680]  That shows he's actually listening. So start over with that because that is huge.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:51.600]  Yeah. And that shows a responsive elected leader. Alex Roger is a citizen of Florida. He has a
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.920]  platform that many people don't, but he shares a lot of the concerns that millions of Floridians
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:02.080]  had about these lockdowns, these mandates, the election integrity questions. But when we flip
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:08.160]  out onto DeSantis, he goes with us. That's really good. We like that. Yes. Yes. No, no, we do like
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.840]  that because again, I think that's a responsive leader. And sometimes Alex, in your life, in your
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:22.400]  conversations, we aren't always right all the time. We all make mistakes. We get busy. We forget
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.200]  things. We need to, we need people. That problem with conservatives and Christians and populists
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.280]  and hard workers is we don't want to tell people what we want because we're, we're leaders. We're
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.440]  not victims. We don't need you, but we do need to get on our leaders. We do need to put pressure on
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:42.880]  them because the left's doing it. We need to do it. Yeah, no, we absolutely do Alex. And that's
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.600]  what I just hope people continue to do the next couple of months and years. Let me recap that
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.320]  was interrupted. Explain those two points. DeSantis has is making not just the turn. He
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:58.080]  already did that. He is getting really hardcore and actually responding to what Roger had criticized
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:05.680]  and others. This is beautiful. So to recap that. Yeah, he is establishing the office of election
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.040]  integrity. He is cracking down on these County commissions and the school boards for their
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:17.520]  mandates on masks and vaccines and no longer allowing Biden to come in and buy them out and
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:24.960]  pay their fines. So he has been a responsive leader. And if we had 49 Ron DeSantis is,
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.320]  we wouldn't have to worry about what Joe Biden, crazy Kamala are doing.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.120]  Jacob Engel, central florida post.com. Everybody bookmark it. He also writes for the gateway
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.680]  pun in a lot of the publications. I see his writings in central florida post.com. Jacob,
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.400]  thank you so much. And I look forward to talking to you again. Thank you for having me on Alex.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:51.040]  Victory is on our side. That's right. God is on our side. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.440]  I'm going to go to break for about two minutes and then we're going to come back with revolver.news
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:05.360]  owner and head editor, Darren J. Beattie straight ahead with huge, huge, huge news. And during the
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.880]  break, I'm going to print his article he sent me this morning that I read that I forgot to print.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.320]  So I'll have that article for you as well. Straight ahead. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.200]  We're here outside the doll today, lads, because we're living in very precarious things. We're
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.560]  living in an inverse world in which the suppression of vital information, which is of a public
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.840]  wordiness, is being suppressed by the legacy media. Federal health officials say neither
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.800]  ivermectin nor hydroxy chloroquine are effective treatments for COVID. Don't even call them
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.000]  mainstream because they're all going to collapse like all the corrupt institutions are going to
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.080]  collapse when this great light comes out. There's serious vitriolic anger in the air and it's going
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.400]  to manifest and it's not going to be good for any citizens. This is not a lunatic fringe. This is
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.320]  people who are very well versed, very well researched and are aware as to the plans of the
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.360]  global elitist cabal that have plans over the course of this decade to completely abolish every
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.160]  single element in the concept of freedom. Screw your freedom. It's the freedom of your own body,
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.600]  freedom of bodily autonomy, the freedom of travel. If you have travel plans, there is one more thing
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:19.040]  to add to your packing list. Proof of vaccination. The freedom of association, the freedom of human
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.480]  expression. They want to incorporate people into a transhumanist movement and whilst that seems very
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.000]  far-fetched for a lot of people, it's what they have in plain sight. Go look at UN Agenda 21,
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.120]  look at UN Agenda 30, look at the WEF. It's all there in plain sight for the average Joe
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.440]  soap to find out this information. They call it the great reset. This is their global domination.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.560]  This is it. This is modern war. How it's going to manifest, I do not know, but I do suspect that
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.600]  the human spirit is going to rise up against this tyranny over the course of the next number of
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.840]  years. When this shit hits the fan, when people realize what's actually been done, they're going
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.400]  to want to pound the flesh. Violent clashes are erupting across Europe as thousands of people
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.120]  protest the latest round of COVID-19 restrictions. For everyone's children, they guard children,
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.200]  the special units children, because future generations will have absolutely nothing.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.280]  They will not have ownership over their own bodies. The only way to control it is to mandate
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.280]  vaccination. They will not have ownership over their own future. They can only dream of owning
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.480]  a property. The WEF was the number one plan into 2030 is you will own nothing and you will be happy.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.520]  That's pure communism, lads. If people don't own any resources, who does own it? A state which is
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.080]  a bastion of corruption, which is a banana republic in terms of a lack of accountability. Who is
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.280]  holding these bastards accountable? Who the fuck is holding these bastards accountable? I'll tell
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.800]  you who's going to hold them. The people of Ireland will. And when the people of Ireland wake up,
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:43.280]  by God, there's going to be health care. And now Roger Stone's brief press conference.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:56.080]  Good morning. This is this morning in fulfillment of a federal subpoena. I did my civic duty and I
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:04.160]  responded as required by law. I did invoke my fifth amendment rights to every question,
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:11.200]  not because I have done anything wrong, but because I am fully aware of the House Democrats
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:18.240]  long history of fabricating perjury charges on the basis of comments that are innocuous,
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:25.520]  immaterial or irrelevant. I question the legitimacy of this inquiry based on the fact
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.840]  that Speaker Pelosi rejected the appointment of Republicans to this committee and seated two
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:42.080]  anti-Republic, anti-Trump Republicans. This is Witch Hunt 3.0. If the Speaker was seriously
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.280]  interested in getting to the bottom of what happened on January 6th, she would release the
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:53.760]  thousands of hours of video tape taken by government cameras on the incidents of that day.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.800]  She would also release the audio transmissions of all law enforcement agencies on that day.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:08.560]  I stress yet again that I was not on the ellipse. I did not march to the Capitol. I was not at the
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:15.920]  Capitol. And any claim, assertion or even implication that I knew about or was involved
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:23.440]  in any way whatsoever with the illegal and politically counterproductive activities of
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:31.280]  January 6th is categorically false. What disturbed me is an investigation into my activities
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.920]  on January 5th, which is constitutionally protected free speech, the constitutional
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:45.760]  right of free assembly and the constitutional right to redress the government regarding
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:53.600]  grievances. I don't like to see the criminalization of constitutionally protected
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:59.360]  political activity. I think it is a slippery slope. Thank you very much, gentlemen,
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:06.800]  and have a wonderful day. Well, the Revolver head editor joins us Darren J. Beattie. He is,
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.400]  of course, a doctor. He's a former professor of political science at Duke University,
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.760]  went on to serve in the White House as a speechwriter and advisor to President
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:20.320]  Trump on policy. He's now the founder of Revolver.News and of course helped the great Roger
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:26.400]  Stone and the great Tucker Carlson and myself expose what's really going on. Their top story,
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:34.560]  Meet Ray Epps part two, damning new details emerge exposing massive web of unindicted operators at
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.360]  the heart of the January 6th committee. But don't worry, they're all over the news saying they want
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:45.040]  Roger and I put in prison for perjury. That's why we've got to plead the fifth because we say
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.480]  the sky's blue. Alex, what color is the background behind you? Well, it's baby blue. Oh, but that's
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:56.480]  dark blue. That's Navy. You're going to prison. Jury, is that Navy blue? Yes, it is. Jones,
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:02.160]  five years in prison. That's how this works. So Professor Dr. Beattie, thank you so much for
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:08.960]  coming on with us on Saturday evening. Big times, big things happening, big breaking stories on your
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:15.920]  front. A lot of new developments this committee. Where do you want to start? I'd be happy to start
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:23.200]  wherever you'd like, but we have this major new piece at Revolver.News. It's the real follow-up
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:30.560]  to the previous bombshell comprehensive expose of the individual called Ray Epps and all of his
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:38.720]  actions. This follows up on that story and tells, really puts together an entire untold narrative
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:45.840]  entire truthful and thoroughly documented narrative of exactly what happened especially
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:54.720]  leading up to the initial breach points. That famous footage of the breach of the metal barricades
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:02.240]  two seconds incidentally after Ray Epps whispered in the breacher's ear. That fateful breach,
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:09.840]  multiple people cutting fences, removing fences, and just generally setting the stage very early
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:16.240]  on before the Trump speech was even over and the rally goers moved over to the Capitol. There are
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:22.880]  a bunch of people who were there in advance setting the stage creating the conditions
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:30.320]  for this rally to become a riot. And we show exactly what they did. We show the mechanism
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:37.200]  of how they did it. And we show that these key figures who were there early on and had cool
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.640]  professional demeanors and behaviors, they were there for a purpose, many of whom I think it's
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:49.040]  important to point out, Ray Epps is from Arizona. A lot of these people are from Texas. And so
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:55.840]  they're such Trump supporters that they fly across the country and don't go to the rally.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:03.120]  Instead, they're by the Capitol hours in advance setting the stage for the riots to occur.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.560]  And he's there with a bunch of provocateurs, I'd say 50% that first got there before Trump
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:15.040]  even began to speak, they were actually attacking. And so I think that timeline is really important.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:21.760]  The image that you have shown right now, it shows that the initial breach site, the site that we
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.560]  call the Ray Epps breach site, because this individual Epps who was calling for going into
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.160]  the Capitol the night before, he's right there at the metal barricades whispering in people's ears
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:39.200]  two seconds before the barricade breaches. That's a strategically very important breach site because
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.400]  people coming in from the White House, people coming in from where Trump's speech would have
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.480]  been, that is the entrance. That is the site that they would pass. And again, why isn't he being
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:56.960]  subpoenaed? Why hasn't he been arrested? Well, that's a great question. Not only has he not
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.360]  been arrested, he has not been subpoenaed. And to complicate matters still further,
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.480]  and this is an issue that I brought up in the aftermath of our first big piece on Ray Epps,
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:15.360]  is that he was originally deemed so important by the feds that immediately after 1-6, he was one of
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:23.920]  the 20 special chosen few who was important enough to be on the 20 most wanted, FBI most
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:32.160]  wanted list for January 6th. They said, we'd love to know who this guy is. Help us identify this man.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:39.520]  The internet identified him and crickets from the feds. And then the day after Revolver.News
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:46.800]  released a major report on 1-6 and the likelihood of federal involvement, the day after that,
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:54.320]  the feds quietly scrubbed Epps' presence from their public database. And the only relevant
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:01.200]  follow-up is that in the aftermath of Revolver.News' major expose of Ray Epps, we have a couple
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:06.160]  citizen journalists who actually took the step of confronting Rep Epps at his home,
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:12.560]  doing what the feds evidently won't do. And instead of the feds following up on this and
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.160]  going and asking Ray Epps, the feds paid a visit to those two citizen journalists who had the
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:25.280]  temerity to question Ray Epps. And when those Phoenix FBI field office agents approached those
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.640]  citizen journalists, the citizen journalists said, oh, this might, must be about our visitation of
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:38.160]  Ray Epps. And the FBI Phoenix field office agents said, Ray Epps, we have no idea who this is.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.400]  Ray Epps lives in Arizona. He lives in Phoenix. Oh, it's absolutely ridiculous. So I read the
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.080]  article this morning. It's leaked. It's very powerful. It just puts it all together. The
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.640]  pieces are coming together. So here's Roger, who wasn't even there that day at the ellipse
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.240]  or the other event, because he couldn't get through people. There wasn't enough security.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.920]  It was a million people. I was calling, why aren't you coming? He's like, because I can't
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:06.080]  get through the crowd. I'm done. I'm flying out. This is crazy. And he's being subpoenaed. They're
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.760]  trying to act like he's a mastermind. They're trying to say, I'm a mastermind. They've got
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:18.800]  former federal prosecutors on MSNBC and CNN saying, oh, Jones and Stone are liars. We'll soon
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.840]  put them in prison. And then they're like, oh, look, they're cowards. They're guilty. They're
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.160]  declaring the fifth. When they're saying we're going to go lie, we have nothing to lie about,
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:34.320]  what maniac would go into that rig committee that isn't even set up right? You're supposed to have
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.000]  real Republicans on it. How am I supposed to even be part of the sham process?
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.280]  Well, you're not. I mean, look, this has multiple dimensions to it. This big hoax has multiple
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:55.040]  dimensions to it. The story of Ray Epps and these other key breach figures, their job is evidently
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:01.680]  to create the conditions to turn this rally into a riot and to follow through on Epps' repeatedly
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.840]  stated mission to go into the Capitol. And we show exactly how that happens. That creates the
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.880]  spectacle that these various figures in the regime wanted to have. And another but related dimension
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:22.640]  to this story is they want to impute to this spectacle responsibility to key figures in the
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:29.840]  alternative media and key figures in Trump's inner circle so as to more closely link this
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:35.760]  event to Donald Trump and his supporters. And so that, of course, is what accounts for the ridiculous
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:44.640]  fixation on you, on Roger Stone, on Steve Bannon and so forth, and the astonishing lack of interest,
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:52.880]  downright neglect of these key figures. And in Ray Epps' case, the only singular,
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:27:00.000]  sole, unique person caught on camera in the mountains of documentary video evidence of one
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:07.200]  six and one five, the only person caught on camera stating an explicit desire and intention to go
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.800]  into the Capitol. And yet this is the person that they have no interest in, not even enough to give
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:18.720]  him a subpoena. And that has to tell you everything you need to know about this joke-sham committee.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.840]  Well, that's right, Dr. Beatty. But just to expand, you're technically right.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.560]  And I'm not saying it's anti-fagery. That's a stalking horse. That's a straw man. That's a
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.120]  red herring. They were involved, obviously, but not the main group and all these federal informants.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.720]  We know that they've covered up and aren't unmasking. I want to hear where that investigation
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.480]  is going. But we did have Jaden X the day before the day saying, let's go in, let's burn that
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.760]  mother effer down, but not on the tape saying, go get in there, break in, and then they do it.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.960]  So they should both be investigated. Ray Epps is dead to rights. I mean,
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.640]  I know you've showed this video. We have the video up on the revolver.news report that everyone
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.080]  should go and read and share it because the more powerful and subversive the report, the more the
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:09.920]  regime tries to clamp down and censor it. And you know that more than anybody, Alex. So they're
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:18.160]  really trying to censor this. But yes, Ray Epps stated it explicitly, repeatedly, calmly, coolly,
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:25.280]  with the cold intention of a seasoned professional. That's right. He had the whole markings of
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:31.120]  somebody following a job, a fed, totally calm, secure, and just robotically doing what he was
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:40.720]  doing. This is very clearly not his first rodeo. He's a seasoned professional. He demonstrated
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:48.320]  actually remarkable and impressive facility with crowd control. And he's just on a mission,
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:55.840]  persistent. He didn't want anyone to get hurt. He wanted to do his job. And his job very clearly
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:03.920]  was to get people to go into the Capitol peacefully. And he wasn't the only one.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:10.720]  And so for this follow up piece on revolver.news, we introduce a number of other very interesting
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:17.520]  key figures who played major roles in cutting the fencing, cutting the barricades, breaking
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:23.520]  the barricades, and played major roles in instigating the crowd to go into the Capitol.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:30.080]  And so we have very extensive coverage with video of these figures, many of whom constitute
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:37.200]  Ray Epps' scandals in their own right. So we tell the full story. If there were a January 6th
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:42.880]  commission that weren't a political scam and a joke, this would be the sort of thing they would
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:49.040]  release to the public. This is the most important document for the American public right now to read
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:54.560]  today. Dr. Beatty, you're not hyping this. You're absolutely right. What you put together this
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.480]  morning when you sent it to me, I spent like an hour and a half reading it. It is so bombshell.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.480]  I learned a lot of stuff I didn't know. So it's life and death for this republic to expose this
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:07.680]  because we'll go back to the document and what happened that day just 11 months ago. But first,
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.720]  notice now they're not wanting to talk about what happened at the Capitol. They're not wanting to
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:18.400]  talk about the insurrectionists on the ground, as they say. They want to focus on legal lawful moves
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.120]  to challenge for 10 days the electors, which Democrats did four years before. They want to
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.040]  act like that was the insurrection and that was the attack. They're suddenly moving away from
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:31.120]  what happened on the Capitol to Congress and people and misrepresenting what happened there.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.880]  That shows me they're concerned about Tucker Carlson and Revolver and what you guys have
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:44.320]  been doing. Right. Well, actually, it's rather amusing, but a mediocre regime sycophant outlet
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:52.480]  known as Litifact did our coverage the honor of designating the reporting on the federal
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:31:00.560]  involvement in January six as the lie of the year. So if the regime at Perachik mediocrities
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.280]  at Politifact say it's lie of the year, I think that gives you a pretty good indication of how
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.960]  freaked out the regime is that people are finally starting to ask the right questions.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:14.880]  Exactly. They're like, this is the worst, horrible thing. This is the most evil thing.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.360]  Do not look at this. This is what which means it's the most powerful thing, because that's
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.160]  my next question. They're clearly hanging their hat on January six and saying domestic groups
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.960]  that question elections or vaccines or lockdowns or terrorists. They're getting I know you don't
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.960]  speculate, doctor, but obviously they're provocateur in a new Oklahoma City or
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.240]  something big ahead of the election, and they don't want this narrative challenged.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:42.640]  Right. No, absolutely. And if I could just say some words up there, you had a guy in your your
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:49.760]  b-roll there that I was going to talk about. Great job. Yeah, there you go. So this guy is known in
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:56.400]  the research community as a scaffold commander. And he, like another of other key individuals
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:02.800]  we cover in this report, he's right by the peace monument very early. In fact, you probably know
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.400]  that the official account of how January six went down and how the breach went down
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:13.040]  was that it was a bunch of proud boys that came and they did the initial breach. And yes,
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:18.640]  there were proud boys. But what's remarkable and what we demonstrate in this piece is that
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:25.760]  the key individuals that we chronicle here actually showed up at the same place before
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.160]  the proud boys got there. And they just happened to go on to take major roles in instigating the
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.920]  riot and bring down barriers. This individual that you're showing on the b-roll, he was there
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:44.560]  way early on before the proud boys. He was hectoring the police back then, and he cut the
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:50.480]  fences himself. And he just happened to end up at the top of the scaffold with his bullhorn
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:57.440]  coordinating really with Epps, who was standing right on the ground. Just like Ray Epps, though,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:03.200]  we can't subpoena him. We can't arrest him, though. No, you can't do that. Despite the fact that he
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:08.960]  keeps telling people, move forward, move forward, move forward. That's literally the only thing he
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:13.760]  says. Someone else is smart and trained. That is because a giant crowd doesn't know where to go.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.800]  Move forward, move forward. Not knowing just like in a mosh pit or a concert, you're going to push
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:22.160]  through the line. You're going to and then the police are going to attack and that's going to
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:29.120]  cause the explosion like a chemistry interaction. No, look, it's it's basic crowd type psychology,
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.400]  which these people likely being seasoned professionals are very familiar with. Now,
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:40.560]  if you're in a big crowd like this and you hear an authoritative voice repeatedly and constantly
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.520]  saying move forward, you don't know what's going on. You don't know if someone had an accident
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.880]  somewhere around and they want to move the crowd away. You just hear this noise and you basically
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:57.040]  do what you're told because you see other people doing that and very quickly move forward. Once the
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:02.800]  capital itself was breached and people were going into the capital, the move forward changed into we
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:09.200]  need to fill up the capital. Those were his explicit commands. And this guy, just like Ray Epps,
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:16.400]  nothing about him. FBI doesn't care about him. They don't want him. They want you and they want
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:22.400]  Roger Stone and they want Steve Bannon and they want the 70 plus million Americans who happen to
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:27.760]  disagree with the corrupt direction that this regime is taking. That's right, Dr. Beatty. You
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.200]  just said it. They are taking over a million person crowd, getting a maximum five hundred,
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.960]  six hundred to go in the capital. They're provocateurs there who are protected now,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:40.960]  who we've identified in hindsight, not being arrested when they when they did a thousand
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.400]  percent more than Roger or I did or Trump did. That's total proof there. And then now they're
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.440]  framing all Americans that don't like Biden and inflation and open borders and globalism and
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:57.360]  everything as terrorists. I mean, this this is systematic. That's why January six is what
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:04.720]  the entire deep state is hanging its hat on. Yes, absolutely. And so, look, I think beyond any
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:11.200]  reasonable doubt, if any reasonable person reads this Ray Epps report, reads the first one,
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.240]  you go to Revolver Dot News. I'm going to say all your reports have been amazing,
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.480]  but this I should have set up front. You have all the proof here. My problem is we're already in
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.520]  such incredible news here that I don't hype stuff up enough when it's so huge. This thing
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.000]  closes the door on it, proves it. I mean, you couldn't show a grand jury anywhere this
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.360]  and they wouldn't turn and say, oh, my God, the Justice Department set this up and ran this. I
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:38.080]  mean, this is the proof. And now it is all of our responsibility, us in the media who
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:47.200]  know the truth, to do justice to the compelling, substantive force of these pieces, to do justice
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:53.280]  on the congressional side, getting congressional allies from Matt Gates, Marjorie Taylor Greene,
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:36:00.320]  everyone, Massey, everyone, get them to put pressure on the FBI, on the DOJ. That's what
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.720]  we need to do. Don't be on the defense of defending ourselves that we attacked the
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:09.680]  Capitol and that's the last thing we wanted. It was a huge fiasco. Get on the offense exposing
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:15.440]  this because because I don't see again how they get away with anything they're doing if this comes
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:21.200]  out. It's too late for them. And this is the beautiful thing. They lost complete control
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:26.880]  over the narrative very early on when the whole lie about what happened to Officer Sicknick
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.680]  unraveled before our very eyes. Revolver News incidentally played a big role in that,
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:38.560]  but they weren't able to ossify the narrative quickly enough and powerfully enough to really
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.160]  gain a foothold that was not to be questioned and that we're very fortunate for that. And I really
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:50.880]  do think it is too late for them now. They can't put this back in. The only way to lose this is to
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:57.600]  drop the ball and to not be persistent. With persistence on this, we can get the ultimate
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.280]  truth and we can force a reckoning on this issue. And that's going to require your audience,
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:09.040]  everyone's audience, everyone to read and share is going to require action at the congressional level.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:15.360]  And I happen to think among these many people who are very likely informants or even agents,
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.880]  I happen to think you know this better than anyone, Alex, is that the way that this works is
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:27.120]  the higher ups use these people as pawns too. And I wouldn't be surprised if Ray Epps or one of
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:33.040]  these other people feels used, exploited. Maybe it didn't go down exactly as they thought it would,
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:38.400]  or they were told it would. They're having a crisis in conscience. Whatever it is,
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:44.400]  all it takes is one of these individuals to do the right thing and be a hero and expose their
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.680]  handlers, expose their communication, expose what's really going on. And I think there's a
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.320]  decent chance of that happening. And we're going to put a lot of pressure on this as well. Well,
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.800]  that's my biggest point here that I should have said up front, Dr. Beatty, and that's that
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.600]  Trump has said the real insurrection was November 3rd. And Trump has said, oh, what they did shooting
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:12.240]  people was wrong. But I know you talked to the president some. He needs to come out and say, hey,
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.880]  you set up my people. You ordered the National Guard to stand down. I tried to get, you sent half
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:22.960]  the Capitol Police away on tribal control and you set us up. He needs to get on the offense
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.320]  because they are just desperately blaming Trump. Why we blow our feet off like this is ridiculous.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.600]  They're desperately trying to act like questioning electors, which Democrats do all the time is bad.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:39.360]  And so I, again, just see Republicans, Republican leadership, flat footed again,
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.880]  intimidated by the mouse that roars by corporate media. When with raps and all these people and
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:51.360]  with the revolver report, which again, Tucker's piece is incredible. It's amazing. It totally
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.840]  freaked out the system, but it's an hour long and some of them aren't going to watch it. Your
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.480]  text report with all the stuff is like an FBI investigation that they should be doing.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:06.240]  It is so damning. And so we need to get Republicans on the offense instead of letting
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:12.960]  the Democrats hold plan for 2022. Is this lie when we have them, if these Republican leaders
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.960]  will just grow some ovaries and testicles? No, it's absolutely true. And unfortunately,
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:28.400]  this is, you know, with the Republicans, I tend to say a 95 to be generous, 95 of the Republicans
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:35.920]  are fall into the category of stupid, weak or corrupt. And you don't get anything out of them.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:41.680]  They're set up to be losers and to lose. But the good part is we do have a small percentage of
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:47.840]  people who are fighters and who are intelligent. And if there's enough pressure from the public,
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:54.960]  this stupid, weak and corrupt people will fall in line. And that's why it's so crucial that we
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:01.920]  maintain a dogged persistence on this, not lose focus. Keep to this story, because the number one
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:08.480]  thing that the regime wants is for the short attention spans. Just move on to the next outrage.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:14.400]  Forget about it. And, you know, move on, move on to the next outrage. Exactly. Because
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:23.680]  Russiagate was a fraud. The Kuwait or Kuwait, the Ukraine garbage was B.S. and now this is total B.S.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.440]  except they actually provocateur. This is their Waterloo. If we push it, an example of how weak
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:35.040]  they are. We've got you. We've got Tucker Carlson, myself and a few others. The listeners are awesome
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:39.840]  who pushed over the edge and it's got them in a total panic. If we just shut this down their
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  throats, it's over because they provocateur it. We caught them. Where is the indictment of Ray Epps?
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.560]  Where is the indictment? Where? No, they're not being indicted. They're not being subpoenaed
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:56.080]  because it's embarrassing for the people that ran this attack. Absolutely. And the beauty of this
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:02.560]  is that we don't, we're not left with simply a theoretical case of, oh, there were feds involved.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:09.600]  We have the theoretical case is very powerful attached to specific people. And so we can ask
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:17.040]  very specific and pointed questions about Ray Epps, about other figures, about the oath keepers, about
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:22.960]  a range of things. And when you're able to ask specific questions like that and focus the thesis
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:28.800]  on specific individuals, it becomes very powerful. And all you have to do is maintain
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.720]  a persistent attachment to it. Keep pursuing the evidence. What they want is you to forget about
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:40.000]  this. They never intended for anyone in the public to know the name of Ray Epps in the first place.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.040]  Now that that cat's out of the bag, they're in real trouble because revolver.news is not going to
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:50.320]  stop this issue. You're not going to stop this issue. And now it's not just us who are aware.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  Now mainstream Republicans are aware of this and they're outraged because they rightly understand
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:03.440]  that this is the biggest scandal in recent American history, at least if you discount COVID.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.040]  Oh, and I totally agree. And obviously they're preparing something in the next 325 days
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.880]  that's going to be framed on populist Americans. I mean, they're everywhere. Oh, they're going to
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.560]  blow stuff up. They're going to kill everybody. Same ones in the tech capital. It's imminent.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.840]  No, it's not imminent. What's imminent is them trying to stage something. And I don't get
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.680]  strength out of the Democrats and the globalists right now. I mean, you see two CNN producers
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.600]  busted more and more coming out about what they're into, how they control people, how it's a bunch of
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.560]  baby Epstein's up there. I mean, people need to be optimistic because this house of cards is coming
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.520]  down if we just have some basic leadership. But let's talk about you, doctor, because I know you
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.120]  were a great speechwriter and a great political scientist. You got involved warning Trump,
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.560]  but you became, cause I know this stuff just like you do, but you did a better job of
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.040]  collating it, getting it together and then, and then being that leader, which is an example of
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.840]  everybody else. Sure. 5% are leaders on the right, on the side of good. They have to be
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.880]  leaders though. What woke you up to this or what made you decide to be a major leader on the tip
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:10.160]  of the spear of this? Because I've been persecuted and really threatened to harass for doing this.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:14.240]  That's another question. What have you gone through? Because I've never asked you this
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.920]  privately, but I would imagine you've been persecuted as well. And people say, Oh, well,
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.440]  I better not do it. I'm getting persecuted. No, that's where all the good stuff happens. Folks,
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.600]  you know, you're over the target when you're getting the flag.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.600]  Well, yeah. I mean, we, we haven't yet been hit quite as hard as you have. You're sort of the,
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.000]  the gold standard when it comes to the regime trying to shut someone up. And I have to tip my
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.480]  hat, commend you tremendously for maintaining such an amazing institution as you have in the face of
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:51.360]  incredible persecution that I think most Americans would generally associate with some kind of
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.840]  third world dictatorship and not the United States of America. But that's where we are.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:02.480]  We're at a place where the FBI is raiding the offices of journalists that happened to
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:09.440]  Project Veritas. We're in the age when probably one of the bravest journalists of our time,
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:17.600]  Julian Assange, is basically being subject to torturous, sort of a slow motion execution
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:26.160]  by the United States regime. And so it's a very dangerous time. The stakes are very high. Very few
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:32.320]  people are constituted in such a way as to understand what this, you know, to have an
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:37.760]  inclination to play for keeps, to play for the highest stakes. But when you do, it's you're
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:43.440]  doing something real. You're making a difference. And I like to think that if Revolver wasn't around
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:50.480]  doing this, it just wouldn't be done. And that is a great privilege because I think a lot of cases
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.120]  people are in a position where if they were to stop doing what they're doing, someone else would be
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:01.920]  around and take their place. And they're basically interchangeable. This is a real niche. There's not
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:07.920]  a lot of first class investigative reporting on the right. And we're doing it. And we're making
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:14.320]  a tremendous impact. And I'm very grateful to do that. And I'm very grateful to be in the same
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:21.120]  conversation as you and other people who have really paved the way decades in advance on this
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.000]  stuff. Well, doctor, I want to say that back at you. This is a historic time. And I'm just
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.760]  honored to be here. It's actually an honor to do this and be persecuted because they're coming
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.520]  out for everybody. And this is what men are supposed to do. It's a very honorable position.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.400]  And we've got a good chance of winning. If the listeners and viewers go to Revolver and get
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.760]  the reports now and share them, they are so scared of this. And thank God for Tucker Carlson,
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:50.800]  revolver.news at Darren J. Beattie. That's B-E-A-T-T-I-E. Dr. Darren J. Beattie,
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:54.480]  thank you so much. Two minute closing comment. I know you got to go.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.720]  Thank you. Well, for two minutes closing, I would simply say your audience, you've got to go to
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.120]  revolver.news. You got to read this. You got to spread it. We need to spread it. We're being
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.640]  attacked. We're being censored. But the audience, your audience, the public has the power to overcome
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:16.240]  the censors in this case. We've reached escape velocity. So now is simply the time to push,
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.280]  push, push and not let go because the regime is now in the defensive position.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:26.240]  That's a 30 second closing comment, but I agree. That's why they're so dangerous, though.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.440]  Some people are like, oh, we're winning. Yeah. And they're going to launch some major crap.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.760]  Yes. Yes. All right, doctor, thank you so much. Have a wonderful holiday coming up. We really
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.520]  appreciate you and everybody else. Revolver Dot News. Get the report right now, folks,
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:47.040]  because you're just as important as Dr. Beattie and myself and Roger Stone and Tucker Carlson.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.880]  And we need President Trump to talk about this as well. Thank you so much, doctor.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:57.280]  Thank you. All right. I'm going to go to break. I'm going to come back and we've got one more
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.680]  big interview on Saturday night. And I tell you, the Saturday night shows are very popular. On
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.840]  average, they're in about two million viewers just at band out video. And then we stream it
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.320]  out and a lot of radio stations pick it up. So conservatively, three million people every
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.840]  Saturday watch these. And it's why I'm here. I want to be with my four year old daughter.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.680]  I want to be with my family. I want to be with my wife. I want to be hiking around and barbecuing.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:25.680]  But I'm here because this is history happening. And I appreciate all of you being here as well.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.640]  We're going to come back with a final segment and a big interview straight ahead on this Saturday
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:42.880]  evening. Stay with us. Christmas Day 2021 is almost here. And I want to encourage our amazing
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.120]  listeners and viewers who have changed the world through your support of Infowars
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.000]  to help take this fight against tyranny to the next level. And that's what Reset Wars does.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.560]  We've extended the sale of 25 percent off on the course, Mind Wars Spirit Wars. It's two courses
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:05.680]  in one until Christmas Day. Ladies and gentlemen, help give your friends, your family, your neighbors
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:11.120]  the gift of being aware of how the globalists are manipulating them and trying to break their will.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:16.800]  And please give yourself and the whole world the gift of keeping Infowars on the air at this
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:20.720]  critical time. Without your support, we would have already been shut down. With your support,
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.120]  we're not going to stay on air. We're going to take the fight to the next level because now
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.320]  is the historic point. Now is the inflection point. And it's all about Reset Wars.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:45.680]  25 percent off through Christmas Day at ResetWars.com. Get the course now.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:55.280]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:02.080]  OK, so we just had Roger Stone on with exclusive huge breaking news.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.760]  We had Jacob Ingles on with massive information as well. So important. And then
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  Dr. Darren J. Beatty. It was all game changing. And it's the reason they want to put me in
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.880]  prison or kill me. So I'm not doing this to lose. I'm not doing this because I think
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.880]  I'm just sticking my head in a lion's mouth for no reason. I believe in you.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:31.200]  And I know how powerful you are. And so everything I talk about, everything I do, I believe.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:39.200]  Like the guest I'm about to have on the show for you, I know is super smart. And he did an
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.760]  incredible job when I interviewed him yesterday. I'm about to re-air it. But wait till I get him
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.680]  on the second time and he really lets you have it because he's one of the smartest people I know.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.120]  Mike Reardon. That's coming up in a moment. But I want to spend just a few minutes here
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.480]  with you talking about the future. You know that clip from Braveheart that's based on a
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.360]  composite of true legends. Again, are they true stories? Well, they're legends told about what
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.720]  really happened. Is it exactly accurate? We don't know. But they're legends based on true events.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:15.120]  True legends. Some legends like Jack and the Beanstalk obviously aren't based on, you know,
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.960]  reality. But many of our legends are. And
[01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:30.250]  we are living in a legendary moment right now. These are the times when the whole future's
[01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:37.210]  being decided. These are basically Genesis points. So we have the true legend of William
[01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:41.330]  Wallace who did exist and did fight those battles and see the movie Braveheart. It's
[01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:45.090]  basically the Scottish version of it. I'm sure it's in between that and what the English
[01:50:45.090 --> 01:50:51.850]  said. But longshanks existed. Those battles happened. That really went on. And he's sitting
[01:50:51.850 --> 01:51:01.330]  there with their force that's outnumbered two to one. And he says many years from now
[01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:05.410]  lying in your bed you want to look back on this and wish that just once you'd stood up
[01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:12.330]  and been a man. I mean the full quote is yeah. If we run we will live because they got a
[01:51:12.330 --> 01:51:16.370]  coward running around saying look at that army it's too big. If we run we will live.
[01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:23.850]  And he says yeah. If you run you'll live for just a while. But then many years from now
[01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:29.730]  laying in your beds what would it be like to just once just once tell them they can
[01:51:29.730 --> 01:51:34.970]  take our lives but they'll never take our freedom. And listen I'm not looking to die.
[01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:39.470]  I don't have some death wish. But I understand that I've got the freedom I've got because
[01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:44.790]  my ancestors were willing to kill for it. And they weren't perfect either. But they
[01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:50.750]  had an idea of freedom better than those before him. This country wrote the book on human
[01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:56.430]  liberty didn't mean it was ever perfect. It knew it was wrong. Thomas Jefferson tried
[01:51:56.430 --> 01:52:01.110]  to end slavery in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence and they told him no you're
[01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:07.230]  not doing that. But did it did it. His ideas then grew around the world and was victorious
[01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:12.950]  including in England the country he would defeat in the next 10 years. So it's the people
[01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:17.670]  that stand up for what's right up front that we owe everything to doesn't mean they got
[01:52:17.670 --> 01:52:22.430]  it all done didn't mean they were the ones that were totally successful but to have the
[01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:28.270]  system stare back at them and act like they were nobodies. When the globalists running
[01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:33.310]  things support Chinese slave camps and oppression and total surveillance and pedophilia and
[01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:39.390]  evil they aren't even in the same league as a George Washington or a Thomas Jefferson
[01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:42.990]  or a Benjamin Franklin or a Thomas Paine or a Patrick Henry.
[01:52:43.670 --> 01:52:52.670]  I saw these big national articles attacking a colonel that was advising Trump to say no to the electors and the rest of it and fight election fraud.
[01:52:52.670 --> 01:53:02.670]  And they said, yeah, he's an army colonel. Big deal. MSNBC did. But they went. But now he runs a brewery. He's not an intellectual.
[01:53:02.670 --> 01:53:10.670]  He makes alcohol. What the hell does that even mean? The elitism of the establishment is ridiculous.
[01:53:11.670 --> 01:53:18.670]  It's disgusting. And they show it. They can't even help it because they live around it constantly.
[01:53:18.670 --> 01:53:25.670]  The most unhappy, horrible places is the inbred rich people. The generational wealth that got their power and got their money.
[01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:34.670]  I'm not against rich people. I'm not against wealth. I'm not against success. I'm against old money because it is callous and stupid.
[01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:45.670]  And it's jealous of success. It's jealous of trailblazers. It's jealous, on average, not all of them, of people they know are superior to them.
[01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:50.670]  They could be black. They could be white. They could be Hispanic, Asian, old, young, male, female, whatever. Doesn't matter.
[01:53:50.670 --> 01:53:56.670]  They've got that spark in them. And there's nothing that pisses off a blue blood.
[01:53:56.670 --> 01:54:02.670]  You got blue bloods in Africa. You got blue bloods in Asia. You got blue bloods in Europe. You got blue bloods in Central and South America.
[01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:10.670]  You got establishment people that got there because they were born into it or because they're part of the system, not because they actually did something.
[01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:19.670]  And it's those people that are the enemies. It's those people that will destroy us. It's those people that have got to be stood up against.
[01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:22.670]  So I'll say it before I go to this interview.
[01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:36.670]  What would you give, many years from now, lying in your bed, wishing just once, so they can take our lives but will never take our liberty?
[01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:45.670]  But see, those Scots could have run off and lived on their mountain tops and been left alone. They just wouldn't have governed themselves.
[01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:48.670]  They'd been slaves.
[01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:55.670]  But you don't have what the Scots had. You don't have a choice to run off the mountains.
[01:54:55.670 --> 01:55:01.670]  The New World Order is coming with poison shots to sterilize you and grow prions in your body.
[01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:08.670]  The major studies now show with 5G, they can frequency control and make the crystals grow.
[01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:15.670]  Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. It's a binary weapon. We now know. I'm going to cover it tomorrow on the Sunday show. Major studies.
[01:55:15.670 --> 01:55:21.670]  They are implanting you with the detonator switch. A lot of people have heart attacks and die. That's a side effect.
[01:55:21.670 --> 01:55:26.670]  A lot of folks have blood clots. A lot of people get cancer. That's a side effect. It's a prion machine.
[01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:32.670]  They're putting crystals in you that they in laboratories can hit with a frequency and grow.
[01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:37.670]  We're talking about blood clots killing you in just a few hours if they hit you.
[01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:44.670]  People are being implanted with their self-destruct switches, but you don't run them. They do.
[01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:50.670]  So we are at an epic moment, an epic crossroads in human society and civilization in the future.
[01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:58.670]  And you have got to decide now whether you're for this evil and whether you're going to roll over to it or whether you're going to fight it.
[01:55:58.670 --> 01:56:04.670]  Because you're not going to get to run off to some mountaintop in Scotland and raise your sheep and your family and yeah,
[01:56:04.670 --> 01:56:09.670]  pay the king half your money and give them your daughter if they want them and get beat up and pushed around.
[01:56:09.670 --> 01:56:13.670]  That's bad enough, but at least the British let you live, right?
[01:56:13.670 --> 01:56:19.670]  As long as you give me your daughter and give me most your money and give me half your sheep and kiss my ass, I'll let you live.
[01:56:19.670 --> 01:56:24.670]  The New World Order isn't coming here saying we'll let you live long as you kiss our ass.
[01:56:24.670 --> 01:56:28.670]  They're saying they're going to kill us.
[01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:35.670]  So I'm going to ask you right now, this isn't some heroic move to stand up against them.
[01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:42.670]  I'm not going to die and I'm not going to roll over and I sure as hell ain't going to join these people to kill you.
[01:56:42.670 --> 01:56:48.670]  Not because I even love you that much, but because I know there's a God made the world and made the universe that's pissed.
[01:56:48.670 --> 01:56:53.670]  And I'm scared of that God.
[01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:57.670]  That's right. I'm not trying to save anybody here because I'm the best guy or the perfect guy.
[01:56:57.670 --> 01:56:59.670]  I mean, I love people. I love my family. I love you.
[01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:05.670]  But at the end of the day, when I'm facing down the barrel of a New World Order attack and don't give a damn about them,
[01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:11.670]  it's because they're sitting there staring at us, attacking us, trying to threaten us.
[01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:13.670]  And I don't even see them. I just see God right there.
[01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:24.670]  I'm like the story in the Bible about a soon to be prophet going down the road and the mule stops and the mule won't keep going.
[01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:29.670]  He gets out of stick when he starts beating that mule, that mule lays down on the ground.
[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:33.670]  He's beating it and beating it and beating it and beating it.
[01:57:33.670 --> 01:57:36.670]  And it won't get up. It won't do what it wants.
[01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:44.670]  And all of a sudden, he finally looks down that road and he sees an angel with a big old flaming sword come to kill him.
[01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:47.670]  And then he understands what he was dealing with.
[01:57:47.670 --> 01:57:56.670]  And the American people are that mule. It's just beating us and beating us and beating us, trying to make us join their Satanism, join their pedophilia.
[01:57:56.670 --> 01:58:02.670]  And we see the angel with a big sword like, I don't like I can't I don't I love children anyways.
[01:58:02.670 --> 01:58:08.670]  But by God, that's going to that's going to get me. You think I'm going to sign on to that?
[01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:12.670]  So we're so close to the end now, folks, we're so close to the new beginning.
[01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:16.670]  We're so close to get out of these prisons they built for us.
[01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:22.670]  And so that's why I come to you and I say, what we do here is valuable, what we do here is important.
[01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:27.670]  And what you've done building this operation and setting it up and providing for it has changed the world.
[01:58:27.670 --> 01:58:34.670]  And now I need the funds to fight harder than ever and to expand the fates of the enemy.
[01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:39.670]  And I also need you at the same time to consciously realize the globalist control paradigm and break free from it.
[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:45.670]  And so everything I bring you, I know is powerful and I know will change the world.
[01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:50.670]  But you've got to believe we have the answer. You've got to believe in yourself.
[01:58:50.670 --> 01:59:00.670]  You've got to break free. So the listeners got really pissed when we launched reset wars in three days, went back to full price, whatever.
[01:59:00.670 --> 01:59:07.670]  I don't care. I'd sell it for free if I could. But it's discounted 25 percent off through Christmas Day and reset wars dot com.
[01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:14.670]  I want to thank all of you that were supporters and got the course because just the money that came in from that allowed us to even keep paying the bills.
[01:59:14.670 --> 01:59:18.670]  And I'm about to dump the money I sold my house in and then we'll be out and then I got to lay people off.
[01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:21.670]  Then we got to shut down. Then the enemy wins. Do you want that?
[01:59:21.670 --> 01:59:29.670]  So thank you all for going and becoming a member at reset wars dot com and getting the course and watching it and sharing it.
[01:59:29.670 --> 01:59:33.670]  But you go get a George Strait ticket for five hundred thousand, two thousand dollars.

[01:59:38.670 --> 01:59:41.670]  You're like, well, why is this so much? Alex is everything away free.

[02:00:00.670 --> 02:00:06.670]  This is you deciding, ladies and gentlemen, on whether you want to see this continue on or not.
[02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:10.670]  And it's your vote. And if you choose, we continue on. We fight.
[02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:14.670]  I go into Mordor. I go into Congress. I go into where I have to go.

[02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:25.670]  And I think you are going to do that. So I want to thank all you that become members and got the course.
[02:00:25.670 --> 02:00:29.670]  It's the most valuable information we've ever released.

[02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:42.670]  Stop it, stop it when they're using it on the general public.

[02:06:36.670 --> 02:06:38.670]  You can choose. There's a bunch of them.
[02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:42.670]  And like some of them, God's going to show you, like, you really want to go to this mission?
[02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:45.670]  I chose, I think, the most dangerous and exciting mission.
[02:06:45.670 --> 02:06:48.670]  But this is very real, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:50.670]  And God literally said, here's the missions. Which one do you want?

[02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:04.670]  Join Satan if you want that.

[02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:18.670]  All right, let's go to Mike Reardon, who also is a great researcher.
[02:07:18.670 --> 02:07:20.670]  And I interviewed him on Friday.
[02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:23.670]  I thought it was a really powerful interview, so I thought it fit into all this.
[02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:26.670]  But I want to thank you all for becoming members at ResetWars.com.
[02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:30.670]  I want to encourage those that aren't members to go, to get it, to share it.
[02:07:30.670 --> 02:07:32.670]  Your spam filter, when we send you the course, we'll try to block you.
[02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:34.670]  But we'll send it out to you as many times as it takes.
[02:07:34.670 --> 02:07:38.670]  ResetWars.com, 25% off through Christmas Day.
[02:07:38.670 --> 02:07:39.670]  I want to thank you all.
[02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:44.670]  And I want to thank the amazing crew on Saturday evening being here to get this out.
[02:07:44.670 --> 02:07:48.670]  I want to encourage and ask all listeners and viewers watching the live streams at Infowars.com
[02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:54.670]  and when we archive this big four plus hour transmission to FreeWorldNews.TV to share it,
[02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:56.670]  because that's how we defeat the enemy.
[02:07:56.670 --> 02:07:58.670]  That's how we take it to the next level.
[02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:02.670]  Here's my interview with Mike Reardon on how to break free from the prisons in our minds.
[02:08:02.670 --> 02:08:04.670]  Stay with us.
[02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:30.670]  Pre-program them about who they are to make them controllable and how to break out of that.
[02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:31.670]  So please continue.
[02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:32.670]  Right.
[02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:37.670]  So once you are in that box, they can keep you there as long as they want.
[02:08:37.670 --> 02:08:44.670]  And the only way to get out is to understand that there's going to be something better on the other side.
[02:08:44.670 --> 02:08:49.670]  So people have motivation to break out of their box because the human mind is naturally negative.
[02:08:49.670 --> 02:08:51.670]  The human mind wants to be comfortable.
[02:08:51.670 --> 02:08:54.670]  The human mind is naturally lazy.
[02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:59.670]  So that means if you have the opportunity to stay home, watch Netflix, stay on your phone,
[02:08:59.670 --> 02:09:02.670]  your mind is going to say, that's a pretty good idea.
[02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:08.670]  So when, for example, the lockdowns came down and the whole quarantine, your brain was like, well, sure thing, not a problem.
[02:09:08.670 --> 02:09:15.670]  And what happens after that is now we are faced with how do we get out of that way of thinking?
[02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:18.670]  How do we get out of that laziness?
[02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:25.670]  And that's the most difficult part, because once someone stops something, it becomes more difficult to start it back up.
[02:09:25.670 --> 02:09:31.670]  If someone threw a knife at the wall or a board and they don't succeed, well, they'll say, maybe I'm not good.
[02:09:31.670 --> 02:09:34.670]  Right. This is something I'm not good at. And they'll quit.
[02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:45.670]  Now, if someone says, OK, I'm not good at it today, but I'm going to practice and I'm going to get better and they practice and get better, they become stronger.
[02:09:45.670 --> 02:09:52.670]  And when we look at our mindset, when we look at what needs to be done in the world and society, we have to become stronger.
[02:09:52.670 --> 02:09:56.670]  And most people are just OK with becoming followers.
[02:09:56.670 --> 02:10:00.670]  They explain to me the victim mentality from your angle.
[02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:08.670]  It's totally on exactly a victim instantly gives up and then looks for some group to control them, to give them power instead of saying, no, I'm going to get stronger like you said under attack.
[02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:13.670]  So I've had clients who are on the left side, right side.
[02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:25.670]  But what I have noticed is that most of the clients who are Democrats on the left, they are going to be more timid and afraid of challenges.
[02:10:25.670 --> 02:10:33.670]  And that was really interesting to me, because why are they less prone to pushing themselves to driving forward?
[02:10:33.670 --> 02:10:38.670]  And it's just because they have been told, well, just take it easy.
[02:10:38.670 --> 02:10:41.670]  You don't have to push when you don't feel like it.
[02:10:41.670 --> 02:10:43.670]  Right. Just do what is comfortable for you.
[02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:46.670]  The limitations were already set for them.
[02:10:46.670 --> 02:10:52.670]  So the moment they quit, the moment they give up, they say, well, I guess it was not meant to be.
[02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:55.670]  And obviously anybody telling you that's your enemy.
[02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:57.670]  Correct. I mean, come on. Correct.
[02:10:57.670 --> 02:11:04.670]  So so for people who are putting you in a box and telling you that you can't do something, those people should be put on the back burner.
[02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:12.670]  Right. So, yeah, you can use them as as a source of your motivation and determination to get ahead in life.
[02:11:12.670 --> 02:11:14.670]  Exactly. Don't be them. Correct.
[02:11:14.670 --> 02:11:17.670]  Because you learn from your environment.
[02:11:17.670 --> 02:11:27.670]  So if your environment is not what you want it to be in the behaviors of the people in your environment or not what you want them to be, you have to start to change them.
[02:11:27.670 --> 02:11:33.670]  What the whole premise of what a mindset coach is was we're looking at how you're looking at the situation.
[02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:39.670]  And if you're looking at it, if you're looking at the situation in a negative way, then we just have to adjust it.
[02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:49.670]  When you have your back against the wall and you are concerned about where the bills are going to be coming from.
[02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:55.670]  Right. So you have bills and you're trying to figure out where's the money going to be coming from and you are doing all you can.
[02:11:55.670 --> 02:12:00.670]  And then someone says that you can't do something unless you do something, for example, the mandate.
[02:12:00.670 --> 02:12:02.670]  If you don't get the vaccine, you're going to lose your job.
[02:12:02.670 --> 02:12:11.670]  They're using a fair based type of tactic to say, hey, we're going to take what you need in order for us to continue with our agenda.
[02:12:11.670 --> 02:12:20.670]  That's the stick. Right. And the reason why I believe they're doing it is because they're all about money.
[02:12:20.670 --> 02:12:31.670]  And it's not so much about. What can we get away with is I know I'm going to get away with it because they know people are not going to fight back.
[02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:39.670]  People are not going to fight back. They know that people are going to be happy in their nine to fives because once someone gets in a box, again, they don't want to leave.
[02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:45.670]  Exactly. We're going to stay there. We're going to come back and talk about how to get out of the box with Michael Ridden of Reven Concepts dot com.
[02:12:45.670 --> 02:12:47.670]  R-E-V-E-N.
[02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:56.670]  I don't screw around when it comes to information. I'm a game changer. Infowars is the zeitgeist.
[02:12:56.670 --> 02:13:01.670]  And we just dropped our most important work yet at reset wars dot com.
[02:13:01.670 --> 02:13:06.670]  You can now see the course reset wars at reset wars dot com.
[02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:10.670]  The course is public. The course is live.
[02:13:16.670 --> 02:13:23.670]  It's the third hour of the live December 17th Friday transmission of the Alex Jones show.
[02:13:23.670 --> 02:13:29.670]  That means my good friend Michael Reardon is here with us that I twisted his arm to get on air.
[02:13:29.670 --> 02:13:36.670]  We have great discussions. Good friend of mine. And he always just has really great ways to boil down knowledge.
[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:39.670]  Mike, thanks for coming on the show, man. Always enjoy talking to you.
[02:13:39.670 --> 02:13:47.670]  You wanted to start with the mass psychosis that's going on and how you witnessed that in the education system and how to break out of it.
[02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:57.670]  Right. So when I was an educator, it's interesting because you have to deal with it in the sense of what is going to be the next steps.
[02:13:57.670 --> 02:14:01.670]  Right. Because you just don't teach a first grader how to do calculus.
[02:14:01.670 --> 02:14:06.670]  Right. They learn addition and subtraction and it's a series of steps.
[02:14:06.670 --> 02:14:16.670]  So for people, I started to wonder right now we're in an age of covid and basically everyone's going to be influenced by mainstream media.
[02:14:16.670 --> 02:14:19.670]  How did that happen? Right. It didn't just happen overnight.
[02:14:19.670 --> 02:14:24.670]  So I started to look at it from the premise of the school.
[02:14:24.670 --> 02:14:28.670]  Right. So I'm a teacher. I'm in school. What is happening in the school system?
[02:14:28.670 --> 02:14:34.670]  So I know Dr. McCalla, I believe he was on Joe Rogan and he was talking about mass psychosis.
[02:14:34.670 --> 02:14:41.670]  And he talked about how there needs to be four steps in order for that mass psychosis in order to occur.
[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:45.670]  And in the school system, if we think about it, the first step is already there.
[02:14:45.670 --> 02:14:49.670]  Isolation. We put you in a desk. We give you a cubby.
[02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:55.670]  We give you a spot and we say this is where you need to be and you don't deviate from that.
[02:14:55.670 --> 02:15:06.670]  So now you're stuck in one spot, one place, and you're not encouraged to ask your peers, ask your classmates for the answers.
[02:15:06.670 --> 02:15:10.670]  Now you're by yourself. You're on a desert island and you're isolated.
[02:15:10.670 --> 02:15:20.670]  So when covid started to happen and the quarantine started to happen, why was it so easy for people to say, well, I guess I'll just give up my rights.
[02:15:20.670 --> 02:15:26.670]  I guess I would just give up my freedom and I was a stay inside. I'm not I'm not an essential worker.
[02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:29.670]  That had to happen from somewhere. It didn't happen overnight.
[02:15:29.670 --> 02:15:38.670]  So from a young age, when a child is most susceptible from age zero, zero to seven, that's when a child is most susceptible.
[02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:43.670]  Right. Because they are going to be operating under their environment and their behavior.
[02:15:43.670 --> 02:15:48.670]  So if their environment is telling them to do something or the behavior is to enact.
[02:15:48.670 --> 02:15:56.670]  Right. Stay inside. Don't go out. That's going to have a psychological effect on them when they reach adulthood.
[02:15:56.670 --> 02:16:05.670]  And typically that's going to be putting them in a box saying that you need to stay here and you need to do what we say you need to do and you don't talk back.
[02:16:05.670 --> 02:16:10.670]  And right now we need to start to change that type of behavior.
[02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:14.670]  To be prisoners and guys, you can type in there's a bunch of studies.
[02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:19.670]  Studies show cognitive levels of children under lockdown plunged in the last two years.
[02:16:19.670 --> 02:16:24.670]  This is serious child abuse. And these are behavioral psychologists knowing this running this program.
[02:16:24.670 --> 02:16:29.670]  This is really abusive. Yes. And I think there was a video that came out.
[02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:38.670]  It was on on Twitter and it was about a teacher in California who was talking about, I believe, gender.
[02:16:38.670 --> 02:16:45.670]  And they were influencing a student to think about a certain way, right, to think gender in a certain way.
[02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:49.670]  Now, when you're a teacher, you have a big role to play, right?
[02:16:49.670 --> 02:16:54.670]  You have someone's child for at least eight hours a day.
[02:16:54.670 --> 02:17:00.670]  And of course, the child could be sleeping eight hours. So that means the parent has the last eight hours.
[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:05.670]  And most parents don't take education past the school.
[02:17:05.670 --> 02:17:11.670]  Typically, the parents say, have you done your homework? Are you doing what needs to be done? Great. All right. See you later.
[02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:17.670]  But now parents are starting to pay attention, especially after the whole quarantine lockdowns.
[02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:25.670]  And children had to learn at home via Zoom or whatever Internet Web site they use for that type of classroom.
[02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:30.670]  And now parents are seeing like, hey, my kid is not learning in school.
[02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:36.670]  And now that's when you see all these parent board, you know, all these, you know, parents going to these board meetings
[02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:42.670]  with with superintendents and and just the whole educational system.
[02:17:42.670 --> 02:17:47.670]  And they're fighting back. They're saying this is not right. What they're learning is not necessary.
[02:17:47.670 --> 02:17:56.670]  And if we look at curriculum, there's a basic set of content that is going to be learned that children need to learn.
[02:17:56.670 --> 02:18:00.670]  But now we're starting to get into what we want them to learn.
[02:18:00.670 --> 02:18:05.670]  But who are the people who are telling us that they need to know this type of content?
[02:18:05.670 --> 02:18:13.670]  Mr. Government, if we think about it, they're saying, well, we want the kids to know this so we can stir them in a certain way.
[02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:17.670]  The whole race type of thing. Right.
[02:18:17.670 --> 02:18:25.670]  So so so I think they're I think the term they're phrasing is for critical race there.
[02:18:25.670 --> 02:18:30.670]  Critical race there. Yes. Thank you, Alex. Why is that necessary?
[02:18:30.670 --> 02:18:36.670]  And is to keep us down is to keep us in a sense of, oh, I'm a victim.
[02:18:36.670 --> 02:18:42.670]  And as long as we keep that victim mentality, we're going to have a difficult time moving ahead in life.
[02:18:42.670 --> 02:18:48.670]  And you've got great ways of explaining things. And by the way, I'm always reading names of things wrong.
[02:18:48.670 --> 02:18:52.670]  I go to your site all the time. It's Reven, not Raven, but Reven.
[02:18:52.670 --> 02:18:57.670]  Explain with that what Reven concepts means. I always got to for some reason, I always got a butcher intros.
[02:18:57.670 --> 02:19:03.670]  Yes. So Reven concepts rather. Yes. And Reven concepts means the concept behind never.
[02:19:03.670 --> 02:19:09.670]  So if you turn Reven Reven around, it means never. Oh, I get it. So I'm an idiot.
[02:19:09.670 --> 02:19:14.670]  I have dyslexia. I'd seen like Raven concepts or even it's Reven, which means never concepts.
[02:19:14.670 --> 02:19:19.670]  Right. And the name came from when I was actually a swim coach.
[02:19:19.670 --> 02:19:25.670]  I was given a I was given a student from another coach. She was going to be an educator also.
[02:19:25.670 --> 02:19:31.670]  So she was going to the program to become a school teacher. She's going to be teaching people's children.
[02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:35.670]  And she gave me one of her students because she was booked and I said, not a problem.
[02:19:35.670 --> 02:19:39.670]  So the child had a fear of water and he didn't want to go into the deep end.
[02:19:39.670 --> 02:19:44.670]  So I had 30 minutes with the child to get him to swim in the deep end.
[02:19:44.670 --> 02:19:52.670]  And what I had to overcome was her teaching and then his beliefs and his belief was that he couldn't do it.
[02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:57.670]  And she even told me before I brought him into the deep end, don't even try.
[02:19:57.670 --> 02:20:02.670]  It's not worth it. And this is a person who was going to school to be an educator.
[02:20:02.670 --> 02:20:09.670]  And I can't tell you how many times educators have put students in a box saying you're not going to be anything.
[02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:12.670]  Wow. And that's what you told me like a year ago.
[02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:19.670]  We were talking is there literally don't even know they've been trained by the education system to program and put walls in people's minds to build prisons.
[02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:23.670]  And now it's so obvious saying we're not essential. They're trying to have adults stay in a prison.
[02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:31.670]  Mm hmm. Exactly. And then when we look at the essential workers, right, the health care workers and then all of a sudden they hit you with a mandate.
[02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:35.670]  And if you don't get the vaccine, guess what? You are no longer essential.
[02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:40.670]  So they can give you a term to make you feel good and they can take it away when they want to.
[02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:44.670]  And it's and it's going to be similar to how companies will give you a promotion.
[02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:49.670]  But the promotion is only a name change is not necessarily an increase in monetary amount.
[02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:54.670]  It's saying, well, we're going to make you the director of science and history.
[02:20:54.670 --> 02:21:00.670]  And you say, wow, that's great. And you put it on your LinkedIn page and you say this and everyone congratulates you and you feel good.
[02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:06.670]  But you necessarily didn't go anywhere. And people are not going anywhere in life.
[02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:13.670]  They're giving a facade, a false sense of movement, and people will go through life thinking they're making progress.
[02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:17.670]  But they're only going backwards. Beautifully said.
[02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:22.670]  And again, people need to go to Reven Concepts, R-E-V-E-N Concepts dot com.
[02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:25.670]  And I should have asked you what that name means. That is really amazing.
[02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:30.670]  It's never reversed. And instead of never, you're saying, no, we're doing it.
[02:21:30.670 --> 02:21:33.670]  Correct. That is smart. I need you to help me with the new names.
[02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:39.670]  Yeah, of course. Yeah, I tell you, I tell you, Michael Reardon is being really nice right now and really calm.
[02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:45.670]  He's being being very, very, very, very gentlemanly. We're going to turn him loose here on the other side.
[02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:50.670]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. Reven Concepts dot com.
[02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:58.670]  Michael Reardon, educator and a good friend of mine and here talking about what's going on.
[02:21:58.670 --> 02:22:02.670]  And just the points he makes when we were hanging out sometimes are just dead on.
[02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:08.670]  So we got caught up by that break coming. You were getting into how they put walls around people's minds,
[02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:15.670]  pre-programmed them about who they are to make them controllable and how to break out of that. So please continue.
[02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:21.670]  Right. So once once you are in that box, they can keep you there as long as they want.
[02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:28.670]  And the only way to get out is to understand that there's going to be something better on the other side.
[02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:33.670]  So people have motivation to break out of their box because the human mind is naturally negative.
[02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:37.670]  The human mind wants to be comfortable. The human mind is naturally lazy.
[02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:43.670]  So that means if you have the opportunity to stay home, watch Netflix, stay on your phone,
[02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:46.670]  your mind is going to say that's a pretty good idea.
[02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:52.670]  So when, for example, the lockdowns came down and the whole quarantine, your brain was like, well, sure thing, not a problem.
[02:22:52.670 --> 02:23:00.670]  And what happens after that is now we are faced with how do we get out of that way of thinking?
[02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:02.670]  How do we get out of that laziness?
[02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:09.670]  And that's the most difficult part, because once someone stops something, it becomes more difficult to start it back up.
[02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:12.670]  And let me just say this. I like take throwing knives.
[02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:18.670]  I had some throwing knives once you were at the office and I was and I can like throw six of them and maybe get one to stick in the wall every six.
[02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:23.670]  You like through all six of them and stuck in the wall. You're really good at darts, everything else you do.
[02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:31.670]  And you're like, but that's just an example of you decided just to train yourself and have the will to do it instead of thinking, oh, these aren't going to stick.
[02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:38.670]  And then I tried the other day, I threw it like 12 feet away, all four darts bullseye by just saying I'm doing it.
[02:23:38.670 --> 02:23:48.670]  Yeah. So when you make up your mind and you say you're going to do something, the probability of you achieving it is going to be greater than if you went in it nonchalantly
[02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:57.670]  or if you went in it and you didn't have your full intention of whether completing it or if you failed, you say, well, at least I tried.
[02:23:57.670 --> 02:24:01.670]  And for people, you didn't just put those knives in the wall.
[02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:03.670]  You like drove them in like a machine gun.
[02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:05.670]  They're a little bit scary.
[02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.670]  I know a lot of guys are good at that.
[02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:07.670]  They can be they barely stick in the wall.
[02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:11.670]  You haven't like pounded in this probably because I go to the gym, I guess.
[02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:17.670]  But going back to why people are not successful.
[02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:25.670]  Right. So if we use your analogy of the throwing knives, if someone threw a knife at the wall or through or a board and they don't succeed,
[02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:28.670]  well, they'll say maybe I'm not good. Right. This is something I'm not good at.
[02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:36.670]  And they'll quit. Now, if someone says, OK, I'm not good at it today, but I'm going to practice and I'm going to get better.
[02:24:36.670 --> 02:24:40.670]  And you they practice to get better and become stronger.
[02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:47.670]  And when we look at our mindset, when we look at what needs to be done in the world and society, we have to become stronger.
[02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:51.670]  And most people are just OK with becoming followers.
[02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:55.670]  Explain to me the victim mentality from your angle.
[02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:59.670]  It's totally on exactly a victim instantly gives up and then looks for some group to control them,
[02:24:59.670 --> 02:25:04.670]  to give them power instead of saying, no, I'm going to get stronger like you said under attack.
[02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:09.670]  So I've had clients who are on the left side, right side.
[02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:15.670]  But what I have noticed is that most of the clients who are Democrats on the left,
[02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:20.670]  they are going to be more timid and afraid of challenges.
[02:25:20.670 --> 02:25:29.670]  And that was really interesting to me because why are they less prone to pushing themselves to driving forward?
[02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:33.670]  And it's just because they have been told, well, just take it easy.
[02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:39.670]  You don't have to push when you don't feel like it. Right. Just do what is comfortable for you.
[02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:47.670]  The limitations were already set for them. So the moment they quit, the moment they give up, they say, well, I guess it was not meant to be.
[02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:53.670]  And obviously anybody telling you that's your enemy. Correct. I mean, come on. Correct.
[02:25:53.670 --> 02:26:00.670]  So so for people who are putting you in a box and telling you that you can't do something, those people should be put on the back burner.
[02:26:00.670 --> 02:26:08.670]  Right. So, yeah, you can use them as as a source of your motivation and determination to get ahead in life.
[02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:13.670]  Don't be them. Correct. Because you learn from your environment.
[02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:23.670]  So if your environment is not what you want it to be in the behaviors of the people in your environment or not what you want them to be, you have to start to change them.
[02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:32.670]  So for people who are stuck, whether it be believing they're not essential, believing that they can't get out of the circumstances they're in,
[02:26:32.670 --> 02:26:40.670]  they have to start to think in a more optimistic way and in a way where they see their future is attainable.
[02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:44.670]  And think about, Mike, how evil that is to say you're not essential.
[02:26:44.670 --> 02:26:51.670]  That's like Hitler saying these groups are sub. I mean, that is such an amazingly criminal statement to say you can't go outside.
[02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:56.670]  You're not essential. And people just OK, I'm not essential. Imagine that thought to children hearing that.
[02:26:56.670 --> 02:27:05.670]  Right. And it's all about control, because if I tell you that you can't do something, then the most logical question after that is, well, what can I do?
[02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:09.670]  And they're going to tell you what you can do. Well, you can stay inside. You can stay six feet apart.
[02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:15.670]  You can get this vaccine. You can do what we tell you because we know best we're an authority.
[02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:23.670]  And of course, those people need authority. Those people need people to tell them exactly what they need to do.
[02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:27.670]  Because even some of my clients, they would say, Mike, can you just tell me what I need to do in life?
[02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:34.670]  When you talk about clients, explain what you do. I should have brought that up. Tell me what he does. I should tell him.
[02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:39.670]  So so so what I do is I help people get to their most desired place in life.
[02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:45.670]  Correct. Yes. So I primarily work with mindsets and I can have an array of things.
[02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:48.670]  So life coach is an umbrella of the many things that I do.
[02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:51.670]  So I work with relationships. I work with career development.
[02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:59.670]  And what the whole premise of what a mindset coach is, was we're looking at how you're looking at the situation.
[02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:09.670]  And if you're looking at if you're looking at the situation in a negative way, then we just have to adjust it and start to go down the path that is going to be most ideal for you.
[02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:15.670]  In other words, you've helped me out with a lot of great ideas. They've always turned out amazing. That's why I mean, I really you're you're an amazing brain.
[02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:18.670]  But you're right. I was already innately doing it with big attacks.
[02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:22.670]  Like, OK, I'm always going to the angle to take this attack like judo and use it against them.
[02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:25.670]  But then in my personal life, I wouldn't use that same thing.
[02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:28.670]  No, we got to use at the high level and the low level the same tactics.
[02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:36.670]  Right. So when you're looking at the basic structure, especially when you're talking about government education, it has to be a step by step basis.
[02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:43.670]  Right. You have to look at the cause and effect if you are backing a dog to a wall.
[02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:48.670]  Right. And the dog is timid. The dog is scared. Eventually, the dog is going to attack, is going to fight back.
[02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:54.670]  But if you train the dog to think that it is not powerful, that is weak, it won't fight back.
[02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:59.670]  So no matter how far we push you to the wall, you're not going to do anything.
[02:28:59.670 --> 02:29:05.670]  And that's where we are in society. Right. People are back to the wall and they don't know what to do.
[02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:08.670]  And they're just looking for a way out. And I offer them a way out.
[02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:15.670]  But it does require a huge effort on their part because it is a challenge you have to overcome.
[02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:20.670]  Wow. I'm listening. We're going to break in a minute, but just continue to break that down.
[02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:30.670]  So when you have your back against the wall and you are concerned about where the bills are going to be coming from.
[02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:36.670]  Right. So you have bills and you're trying to figure out where some money going to be coming from and you are doing all you can.
[02:29:36.670 --> 02:29:41.670]  And then someone says that you can't do something unless you do something, for example, the mandate.
[02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:43.670]  If you don't get the vaccine, you're going to lose your job.
[02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:52.670]  They're using a fair based type of tactic to say, hey, we're going to take what you need in order for us to continue with our agenda.
[02:29:52.670 --> 02:30:01.670]  That's the stick. Right. And the reason why I believe they're doing it is because they're all about money.
[02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:13.670]  And it's not so much about. What can we get away with is I know I'm going to get away with it because they know people are not going to fight back.
[02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:20.670]  They know that people are going to be happy in their nine to fives because once someone gets in a box again, they don't want to leave.
[02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:26.670]  Exactly. Mike, we're going to stay there. We're going to come back and talk about how to get out of the box with Michael Ridden of Reven Concepts dot com.
[02:30:26.670 --> 02:30:36.670]  R-E-V-E-N. That sounds even cooler than Raven Concepts in the United States, in Europe, in Asia.
[02:30:36.670 --> 02:30:45.670]  Corporations are running big promotions for people to get microchips implanted that include vaccine records amid new covid restrictions.
[02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:50.670]  This is all an exercise in enslavement. And you notice the people that give in only get more enslaved.
[02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:55.670]  So Michael Reardon, continue, please. I mean, let him have it because you're in a great job on air when we talk.
[02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:58.670]  Probably you're just on fire and you totally get what's going on.
[02:30:58.670 --> 02:31:05.670]  You have great ways of putting it. People to understand that the only thing they have to lose is not waking up and saying no and say I'm not a victim.
[02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:09.670]  Victimhood is not like a deed on the universe. It's the opposite.
[02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:15.670]  So keep explaining that to people, how we get out of victimology and how we get into victory ology.
[02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:21.670]  Right. So most people tipped through are going to be tiptoeing through life only to make it safely to death.
[02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:29.670]  And for those type of people, I tell them to get loud and then how to get loud, because most people want to make a difference.
[02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:33.670]  They want to make a change in your life, but they don't even know where to begin.
[02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:43.670]  And I know you're doing a reset wars and reset wars is a great way for people to wake up and say, oh, wow, like this is what's possible in my life.
[02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:55.670]  And what I do, whether it be motivational, positive talk, the podcast, I'm helping people start to see what is possible and helping them get loud.
[02:31:55.670 --> 02:32:07.670]  Because the voices of the American citizens are being muffled from our First Amendment right to the censorship on social media.
[02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:11.670]  You can't go out and you and say what you want anymore.
[02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:20.670]  If you use the word COVID on YouTube, you're automatically hit with a little mark saying, well, make sure you get your COVID information from the right place.
[02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:23.670]  And the CDC can do whatever they want.
[02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:26.670]  They can change the definition of a vaccine.
[02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:32.670]  The Webster definition, the Webster dictionary just changed the definition of anti-vaxxer.
[02:32:32.670 --> 02:32:34.670]  And they label you.
[02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:40.670]  They say, well, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you're now going to be a person who needs to be watched.
[02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:45.670]  What you're saying is when they try to suppress you, the answer is do the opposite.
[02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:47.670]  Yes and no.
[02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:51.670]  So when they're trying to suppress you, you have to pay attention.
[02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:57.670]  You have to pay attention to how they're moving, because if they're moving in a certain way, if you look at.
[02:32:57.670 --> 02:33:02.670]  A martial arts like Hapkido, for example, you use the enemy's momentum against them.
[02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:08.670]  So when you figure out what they're doing, you say, OK, I understand what you're doing.
[02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:17.670]  And then there is going to be like a like a move you do that's going to counteract what they do.
[02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:22.670]  So if they're forcing you into a corner, the only thing you have to do is pivot.
[02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:25.670]  You don't have to get push your you don't have to get pushed into the corner.
[02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:27.670]  And a lot of people don't know how to pivot.
[02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:34.670]  So if they say, for example, you had a pivot when they banned you, they say Alex Jones is banned on YouTube.
[02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:39.670]  He's banned here and there. And now he's one of the most banned men in America.
[02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:42.670]  But you didn't say, well, I guess I'm done.
[02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:45.670]  You pivot in that when you did that.
[02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:48.670]  Now they're like, wow, he's a force to be reckoned with.
[02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:57.670]  And now they're going after you so so ferociously is because they understand you're the highest level of leader.
[02:33:57.670 --> 02:34:03.670]  You are a transformational type leader and a transformational type leader is going to be a person who has the highest
[02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:14.670]  level of engagement in the highest level of effort to help empower people to be in a better place and to see what they are unable to see.
[02:34:14.670 --> 02:34:19.670]  And as much as I want people to see the truth and I say, hey, the government is doing this to you.
[02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:25.670]  They're playing you. They're using fear to influence your choices and your decisions in life.
[02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:32.670]  Regardless of that, some people cannot see the other side, regardless of how you put it.
[02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:38.670]  So how do we get people to start to see the other side? And it's by small steps.
[02:34:38.670 --> 02:34:42.670]  You have to do it slowly. You can't scare these people, right?
[02:34:42.670 --> 02:34:51.670]  Their sheep. So these people who are afraid of their own shadow, you have to not say, well, the government's the problem.
[02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:57.670]  You have to say, well, what's your problem first? And now we're talking about you because you're comfortable with you.
[02:34:57.670 --> 02:35:02.670]  You is already in your comfort zone. And now we're talking about how we can get better.
[02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:11.670]  And then we start to look at the obstacles that is stopping you from leaving that type of comfort zone, stopping you from achieving more in your life.
[02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:15.670]  And we get them out of the transit baby steps. And I agree with you.
[02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:21.670]  About a month ago, I was talking about and you said you talk about packets like they don't care that they said, oh, you only need one vaccine.
[02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:28.670]  They feel good while they're in it. They they only believe in the perception, not the reality of how it works.
[02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:39.670]  But you had a great way of putting that. So once you start something right, the process, it's easy for you to keep on going with whatever the agenda is.
[02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:43.670]  So if they give you one, they said, well, you have to take another one. Well, it's not that big of a deal.
[02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:53.670]  I already did it once. And. When it comes to switching that around, so not so people are not telling us what to do, but instead of what we can do,
[02:35:53.670 --> 02:36:01.670]  if we put it back into the steps where it's going to be approachable, people are going to be more prone to take those steps.
[02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:07.670]  Now, the problem is people don't even understand that there is going to be an alternate solution besides the vaccine.
[02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:13.670]  Well, now you can become more healthy, right? Use use going to the gym, right?
[02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:18.670]  Eating healthy, making sure you are in the best shape of your life.
[02:36:18.670 --> 02:36:22.670]  Notice how they try to block all that. Right. The alternative treatments, everything.
[02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:28.670]  All right. And I believe Joe Biden was on the news the other day and he was talking about hurricanes and tornadoes in Florida and Texas.
[02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:31.670]  And he says the best way to combat this is to get the vaccine.
[02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:36.670]  He did. Yeah. And that doesn't make any sense. So why is this using fear?
[02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:40.670]  Just any fear you can. Right. So so he's saying, well, if you don't want to get by,
[02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:48.670]  if you don't get hit by a hurricane or a tornado or anything to happen to your loved ones, you make sure that you're getting a vaccine.
[02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:51.670]  This is like a rabbit's foot. As for luck.
[02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:55.670]  Well, he's saying, like, take the shot. The hurricane won't hit you. Right. Yes.
[02:36:55.670 --> 02:37:03.670]  So he's he's basically using fear as his prime motivator to enact people to make a choice.
[02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:05.670]  Right. And that choice is to become vaccinated.
[02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:14.670]  And I'm not anti vaccine where I'm not saying that to not get the chickenpox shot or to get a measles shot.
[02:37:14.670 --> 02:37:16.670]  Do your research. Right.
[02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:22.670]  And for a vaccine like the covid-19 vaccine, you have to ask yourself, do you need it?
[02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:29.670]  And most people are not going to need it. It's just that they feel like they need it in order to be safe.
[02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:40.670]  And for those people, I'd like to think of it as if someone wants to carry a firearm and they believe that firearms going to keep them safe.
[02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:43.670]  That is going to be just a certain way of thinking.
[02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:48.670]  Now we have people who think they need a vaccine in order to feel safe.
[02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:57.670]  And for that way of thinking is going to lead to limitations down the road, because now if they have one vaccine, they need the second.
[02:37:57.670 --> 02:38:01.670]  They need the booster. And then they realize it's just going to be the flu shot.
[02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:11.670]  They need to get it every single year. What is happening with the vaccine is that now we have people who are going to be getting this vaccine
[02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:16.670]  and they're thanking the government. Thank you, government, for saving me, for protecting me.
[02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:24.670]  And now, no matter what the government does, they are the good guys. And as long as they are the good guys, we're not going to fight them.
[02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:29.670]  We're not going to say you're doing wrong because they're the heroes in those people's eyes.
[02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:38.670]  And I interrupt you earlier with the break, but how do you get somebody out of that Stockholm syndrome where you're saying trying to head over the head doesn't work sometimes incremental?
[02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:43.670]  You're like, well, let's talk about you. Let's talk about. So you have to challenge their beliefs.
[02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:51.670]  And when you place the truth in front of them, they are going to want to turn their head.
[02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:55.670]  They're going to say, no, no, no, that's wrong. That's wrong. And you keep doing it.
[02:38:55.670 --> 02:39:06.670]  But you do it in the sense of noninvasive. So if you think of it encroaching, so I'm going to encroach until they protest and then they're going to protest.
[02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:11.670]  They're going to say, no, no, no, this is not true. And then you wait and then they forget.
[02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:21.670]  And then as soon as they forget, you encroach again and you keep doing it to the point where they're like, now I'm in the truth and I can't deny it.
[02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:25.670]  You're right, though. They like they hide in being asleep.
[02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:29.670]  So you like you watch them jump back into being asleep and you wait till they wake back up again, I guess.
[02:39:29.670 --> 02:39:38.670]  Right. And you just have to kind of go through that that jigsaw or whatever of putting the pieces together.
[02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:45.670]  But in the way where they don't notice that the puzzle is becoming complete and we're telling them this is the truth.
[02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:52.670]  This is no longer going to be a facade that people are telling you that is the truth to which is really alive.
[02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:57.670]  Because most of what's happening, especially like on mainstream media, is opinion.
[02:39:57.670 --> 02:40:04.670]  And it's about choosing what what delusion you want. Revin concepts dot com r e v e n.
[02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:13.670]  After decades of intense research, our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:25.670]  The reset wars have begun. Start your journey at reset wars dot com today.
[02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:28.670]  All right. Michael Reardon's here with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:36.670]  Jay Dyer takes over in the next hour and I want to get rid and back in here soon because we're just just getting going here on air.
[02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:43.670]  Revin concepts dot com r e v e n concepts dot com. You know, here's what I know.
[02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:47.670]  What I understand is how the globalists actually operate.
[02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:50.670]  Once you study it, you learn more and more. It's like you progress through levels.
[02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:53.670]  I know what's going to happen in the stock market. I know what's going to happen in so many levels.
[02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:56.670]  And I'm trying to get the public to realize all this.
[02:40:56.670 --> 02:41:02.670]  Instead, the globalists want to keep people dumb and controllable, which why would you live in a world like that with a bunch of dumb sheep?
[02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:04.670]  That's dangerous. But that's really the split here.
[02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:08.670]  And you were talking during the break about influence and that key term.
[02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:17.670]  Right. So when you go to school to become an educator, they are going to focus on the psychology of learning the mind.
[02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:24.670]  And you're going to learn how people are going to become the person you want them to become.
[02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:28.670]  So if you're in kindergarten, they learn a certain way. If you're in college, they learn a certain way.
[02:41:28.670 --> 02:41:32.670]  And you have to present it in a way they understand.
[02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:41.670]  So when I was teaching various grades, it required me to know the influence I needed to input into that type of classroom.
[02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:45.670]  So it's going to be different learning from kindergarten versus college.
[02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:56.670]  And now that we are out in the open, right, with all that's going on in the world, the influence is mainstream media.
[02:41:56.670 --> 02:42:02.670]  Right. They are they are knowing what they need to do in order to make you feel a certain way.
[02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:06.670]  And they they use fear as as the premise.
[02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:13.670]  And what a good educator would do is to use positive positivity as the way to do it.
[02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:22.670]  And it has to be in small bite steps, of course, because if I go ahead and I give you a challenge that seems so far out of reach,
[02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:26.670]  your mind subconsciously is going to say, whoa, buddy, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:32.670]  But if I put it in a sense where your mind sees it as approachable, then it's going to be different.
[02:42:32.670 --> 02:42:40.670]  Because if I just use a two by four, as you were saying earlier, and I try to bang it over your head saying, hey, you need to listen.
[02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:45.670]  This is what's happening. Wake up, wake up, wake up. You can't shake them awake.
[02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:51.670]  You have to gently say, well, come here, let's wake up together and coffee over.
[02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:56.670]  Yeah, let's have some coffee and some tea and let's get you awake.
[02:42:56.670 --> 02:43:06.670]  But it has to be approachable. And when you face a challenge, you have to face it in the sense of how can we break this down in the most approachable steps?
[02:43:06.670 --> 02:43:10.670]  Think of weight loss, for example. You don't say you're going to lose a hundred pounds.
[02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:14.670]  You say, I want to lose five pounds first and then you're going to lose.
[02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:18.670]  OK, well, I look great now, but let me see what happens if I lose ten pounds.
[02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:22.670]  And you start that process because if you say you're going to lose a hundred pounds,
[02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:28.670]  the probability of you reaching that goal is going to be minuscule versus if you say you're going to lose five pounds.
[02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:34.670]  There's going to be a compound effect of having a success, having more success.
[02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:39.670]  And the more you achieve, then you're going to start to see more progress down the way.
[02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:45.670]  And you mentioned this when we've talked privately, but imagine a five year old child, be they brown or white or whatever the color they are.
[02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:52.670]  They're in school hearing. There might be bad because what color they are, that I could imagine that would really screw a child up.
[02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:56.670]  Because I remember when I was in elementary school, I was really insecure and nervous about everything and nobody was even being mean to me.
[02:43:56.670 --> 02:44:02.670]  I couldn't imagine if I was told I was bad because I was black or white. I mean, that is serious abuse.
[02:44:02.670 --> 02:44:08.670]  Right. And that's just going to be influence. Right. How can I influence you to think the way I want?
[02:44:08.670 --> 02:44:17.670]  And for children nowadays, if we look at the children just walking around while their parents are not wearing a mask, but the children are wearing a mask.
[02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:22.670]  How did that happen? It happens in school. Right. You have to wear your mask in school. You have to wear your mask at that.
[02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:24.670]  Yes, there are songs telling kindergarteners to wear your mask.
[02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:28.670]  That shows the school is really the parent that the children are wearing and even when the parents aren't.
[02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:32.670]  Exactly. And I was out just the other day and I saw a little girl.
[02:44:32.670 --> 02:44:37.670]  She was probably four or five years old and she was wearing a mask and she was happy as can be.
[02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:43.670]  And the parents didn't have a mask on. So it's not the household that's telling you what you should be doing.
[02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:50.670]  It's the school. Because you have to understand that kid, your child is going to be in the school for a prolonged period of time.
[02:44:50.670 --> 02:44:56.670]  And the teacher can do whatever they want. What a group of bad people to teach children they're dirty and bad and do this to them.
[02:44:56.670 --> 02:45:00.670]  To teach them, oh, you're dirty. You got to wear a mask. You're dirty because of what color you are.
[02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:05.670]  That is so damn abusive. And then when parents complain about it, they send the FBI after them.
[02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:11.670]  I mean, this is like cartoon level. And it's just to keep control.
[02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:16.670]  The schools are going to be part of the government and the government needs to be protected.
[02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:23.670]  Because what the government doesn't want people to know is that the people have the power, not the government.
[02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:33.670]  So when so so when people start to get power, right, when someone starts to rise in a level of power and the word starts to get out there.
[02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:36.670]  Now, all of a sudden, the government's like, well, we need to stop you.
[02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:40.670]  We need to say that you are wrong and that you're the enemy.
[02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:44.670]  And people need to be wary of what you're saying because it's not true.
[02:45:44.670 --> 02:45:49.670]  But what we say is true. And you need to listen to people like us because we're going to keep you safe.
[02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:52.670]  We're going to protect you. And so what's the answer? Rally around those.
[02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:59.670]  The system's trying to shut down. So the answer is going to be making sure you find like minded people.
[02:45:59.670 --> 02:46:04.670]  And you want to understand where you want to be in life, because for people who don't understand where they want to be,
[02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:10.670]  then they're just going to keep on living life wherever the hurt, you know, wherever the hurt is taking them.
[02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:17.670]  So they might not necessarily reach your most desired place in life, but they are just going to go where society goes.
[02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:23.670]  And typically that's going to be downhill. So if you are a middle class person, for example,
[02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:27.670]  pay attention to how life was 10 to 20 years ago for you.
[02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:34.670]  And if life was better for you 10, 20 years ago, then you should have some type of inclination that you're going in the wrong direction.
[02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:37.670]  But let's be clear. Things are so negative now. Even if you got money, it's going downhill.
[02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:41.670]  Right. I mean, Klaus Schwab says they're collapsing and all. How do they think they're going to get out of it?
[02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:47.670]  Why do you like the communists, the Nazis? Why do they always want to make other people have nothing that makes them feel better?
[02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:50.670]  But they bring themselves down. Right. It's a restructuring.
[02:46:50.670 --> 02:46:55.670]  So they so they're being very meticulous in who is going to take power.
[02:46:55.670 --> 02:47:01.670]  And I was thinking about that past week now. Who is going to be next in power?
[02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:05.670]  Right. What is going to be the next steps? When is the collapse going to happen?
[02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:12.670]  And I have a number. I have a date. But it's all just speculation at this point.
[02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:20.670]  Now, tell me your view. So I'm giving it a year and a half before people say enough is enough.
[02:47:20.670 --> 02:47:25.670]  I agree. They're going to try to crash it once the Republicans get a narrow majority to blame them.
[02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:29.670]  That's what I was thinking this morning. Right. And they can do it in a few ways.
[02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:32.670]  Right. So Joe Biden, of course, see now.
[02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:36.670]  And you did a great job in the last hour, but now you're being to my career.
[02:47:36.670 --> 02:47:39.670]  You really don't know what's going on. This guy. I love this guy, man.
[02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:42.670]  I'll tell you, be a huge talk show as we get him on air to tell folks what's coming, Mike.
[02:47:42.670 --> 02:47:51.670]  So, you know, Joe Biden and puppet see now he is going to be taken out of the position of power of presidency.
[02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:56.670]  Right. And Henry Ford, he he talked about, I believe, in the 80s or sometime.
[02:47:56.670 --> 02:48:02.670]  He said that the way a woman will become president is by assassination, by assassination.
[02:48:02.670 --> 02:48:05.670]  Right. I don't think they're going to do that. I think they're going to still love Joe.
[02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:11.670]  Joe's just going to say, hey, you know, I just want to hang out with my wife and take it easy.
[02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:15.670]  And Camilla is going to come in and she's going to take over.
[02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:23.670]  And what needs to happen is that we need to understand that that's the first step of them making their next move.
[02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:33.670]  And we can't make them and we can't let them take any more moves after that, because if we do, they're going to keep that ball rolling and they're going to take over the elections again.
[02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:36.670]  They're going to make a new variant right before the elections.
[02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:39.670]  And then all of a sudden there's going to be mail out ballots again.
[02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:49.670]  And your voice is not going to matter because they're going to say, well, we can make as many votes as we want for Camilla Harris or whoever they choose to be the next president.
[02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:53.670]  And we're nothing against women. But why do they obsess over putting women in power?
[02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:58.670]  Is it because it just historically destabilizes thing or then women think that like they're somehow in a fight with men?
[02:48:58.670 --> 02:49:01.670]  Well, think about the whole feminist movement right now. Right.
[02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:07.670]  If you go on YouTube, most likely your home feeds could have some type of feminist person talking.
[02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:13.670]  Right. And it's just a way for you to become acclimated to that type of environment.
[02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:17.670]  Every video game, every movie that women are the heroes, the men are bad.
[02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:20.670]  Since Mary with Children 30 years ago.
[02:49:20.670 --> 02:49:25.670]  And right now they're just making a forward because it's easier for the brain to accept.
[02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:32.670]  Well, it makes sense. And it's important for us or for them to make sure people are operating under.
[02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:34.670]  Well, that makes sense. It's only logical.
[02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:38.670]  And if it's a logical step for those type of people, they're not going to question.
[02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:41.670]  They're not going to fight back.
[02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:45.670]  But again, there are a lot of women that are smart and would be great leaders, the ones they're putting forward.
[02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:50.670]  What is the obsession with putting women in charge when they're not really in charge or puppets?
[02:49:50.670 --> 02:49:53.670]  It's because they find the people they can control.
[02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:57.670]  They're not looking for people who are powerful. They're looking for people they can control.
[02:49:57.670 --> 02:50:01.670]  And for example, when the Romans would take over an area in Germany or wherever,
[02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:05.670]  they would kill all the men down to age 10 and keep the women because the women would submit.
[02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:07.670]  That's just a biological fact. Right.
[02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:16.670]  And then now we have feminists who want to be in power and they'll do whatever it takes in order to be in that type of position.
[02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:26.670]  So if they have to give up their dreams, their livelihoods, they would because they're going to be at a higher power.
[02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:32.670]  Right. A feminist wants to be equal to a man. But if you really dig down deep, what do they want?
[02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:34.670]  They want to be greater than man.
[02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:38.670]  And look at Hillary Clinton's the beta test of that.
[02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:44.670]  And so she wants to be front and center. I'm powerful. Pay attention.
[02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:49.670]  And for the people who can't see that that's happening,
[02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:57.670]  then they just have to start to see what type of things are popping up on their YouTube, for example.
[02:50:58.670 --> 02:51:01.670]  Reven Concepts dot com.
[02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:03.670]  R-E-V-E-N Concepts dot com.
[02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:07.670]  Michael Reardon. All right. You got to come back again soon, my friend,
[02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:09.670]  because you're just starting to get going here with people.
[02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:11.670]  But you wanted to talk about Joe Rogan during the break.
[02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:13.670]  So you had a Joe Rogan story. You want to say something about that?
[02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:16.670]  Yes. So Joe Rogan talked about this is the saying.
[02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:20.670]  It's a quote that many people might be familiar with is that.
[02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:26.670]  Tough times create strong men. Strong men create easy times.
[02:51:26.670 --> 02:51:30.670]  Easy times create weak men and weak men create tough times.
[02:51:30.670 --> 02:51:35.670]  And that's the cycle we're in right now, where the government understands that cycle very well.
[02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:39.670]  If we can keep them weak, if we can keep them needy,
[02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:42.670]  then we can make them do whatever we need them to do.
[02:51:42.670 --> 02:51:47.670]  So, for example, beginning of the lockdowns,
[02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:53.670]  we're going to give people an extra $300 because they need that type of money because they're not working.
[02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:55.670]  They make you in the position of some survey.
[02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:59.670]  They keep you weak because we had easy times, right?
[02:51:59.670 --> 02:52:01.670]  So we had our fathers and our ancestors.
[02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:05.670]  They were strong men. And then they gave us easy times.
[02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:10.670]  They said, well, I don't want my child to go through these types of challenges that I went through in my life.
[02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:13.670]  So they say, I'm going to create easier times.
[02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:18.670]  And the government caught on and they said, well, let's just keep easy times going.
[02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:21.670]  And then we can make those people do whatever we need them to do.
[02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:22.670]  We can control them.
[02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:29.670]  We can say, well, in order for you to get your 401ks, you need to make sure you're fully vaccinated.
[02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:36.670]  You need to show a passport in order for you to in order for you to come in and enjoy a night out.
[02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:39.670]  You need to show some type of proof of vaccination.
[02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:42.670]  Right. So they're literally saying what we can and what we can do.
[02:52:42.670 --> 02:52:50.670]  And for the people who are operating under that weak type of mentality, they're going to say, well, I guess I don't have a choice.
[02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:58.670]  And the fact that they believe that they don't have a choice is proof enough that they are operating under a fixed type of mindset.
[02:52:58.670 --> 02:53:02.670]  And that's going to be one that doesn't operate under growth is going to be operate.
[02:53:02.670 --> 02:53:04.670]  It's going to operate under circumstance.
[02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:07.670]  And I love your mindset.
[02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:09.670]  There's so many different schools of thought like Carl Young.
[02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:11.670]  Obviously, I follow Jesus Christ.
[02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:22.670]  But just about the mindset of the real world of street smarts, of just how it really works, the real politic of that and stop being a fool and just thinking the system loves me is going to care.
[02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:24.670]  I mean, that's just a lie.
[02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:27.670]  And we have to elevate ourselves.
[02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:31.670]  We have to become leaders more so than followers.
[02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:34.670]  And I love what you do with info wars.
[02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:37.670]  Right. We you are info warriors.
[02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:39.670]  Right. We're creating info warriors.
[02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:43.670]  And what reset wars is doing is creating info leaders.
[02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:45.670]  Right. There's there.
[02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:48.670]  They're now trying to stop reset wars.
[02:53:48.670 --> 02:54:02.670]  And there's a reason why they're trying to stop reset wars is because they understand that that type of workshop, that type of class is going to create new leaders of the world and to have powerful people come up and to say enough is enough.
[02:54:02.670 --> 02:54:05.670]  They don't want that type of fight because they know they're going to lose.
[02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:09.670]  And I was talking to you, I believe, a week or two ago, I told you, don't stop.
[02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:20.670]  Don't stop. And as much as they push, as much as they want you to quit, they do everything in their power to make you feel like maybe I should stop.
[02:54:20.670 --> 02:54:22.670]  Don't stop. Well, I'm not.
[02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:28.670]  We were having a hard, hard conversation about that because I worry about my family, but they're going to get destroyed anyways if this thing succeeds.
[02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:31.670]  So we just got to be all in, do the right thing, trusting God.
[02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:33.670]  Exactly.
[02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:40.670]  Well, reset wars, you know, it's historical how they know that they can create these false images of ourselves that are losers.
[02:54:40.670 --> 02:54:43.670]  That's not who we are. Right. So just the idea of I'm not that loser.
[02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:47.670]  That's so powerful. And I'm surprised that they out of the gates try to block it.
[02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:51.670]  But they are really worried about us empowering people and us saying, hey, you're amazing.
[02:54:51.670 --> 02:54:58.670]  You're incredible. You're made in the image of God because they understand the influence that comes behind being positive.
[02:54:58.670 --> 02:55:01.670]  So the brain is naturally negative.
[02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:05.670]  And in order to counteract the negative, you need three positives.
[02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:10.670]  So the fact that you're giving people what they need in order to change, they don't want that to happen.
[02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:14.670]  So now you have reset wars and you're talking about positive, positive, positive.
[02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:17.670]  This shows negative or what's bad so they don't do it.
[02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:20.670]  But I tried to make it all positive. They really don't like that. Correct.
[02:55:20.670 --> 02:55:25.670]  Because now about a month ago, you said, I think you're going to get some issues with like being all positive.
[02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:28.670]  That's what it is. Right. Because now you're starting to balance out.
[02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:31.670]  And that's why your credibility, that's why your audience is growing.
[02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:37.670]  It's because now people are like, wow, it's making sense now because it's not just one side.
[02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:41.670]  Because if you're on one side, then of course, the other side is like, you're my enemy.
[02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:47.670]  But now that you are saying, hey, I'm on both sides, I want you to be better.
[02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:49.670]  I want everybody. Not exactly.
[02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:52.670]  Revin concepts dot com. Michael Reardon. Thank you so much, my friend. Amazing job.
[02:55:52.670 --> 02:55:53.670]  All right. Thank you.
[02:55:58.670 --> 02:56:02.670]  There are things the enemies of humanity don't want us to know.
[02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:05.670]  There are secrets they want to keep.
[02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:11.670]  I'm Alex Jones, and I've made it my life mission to expose those secrets and empower humanity.
[02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:13.670]  And I've made my greatest discovery yet.
[02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:18.670]  Join me there as humanity goes to the next level at reset wars dot com.
[02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:31.670]  Get our great bag of it here.
[02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:36.670]  I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communist?
[02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:38.670]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world.
[02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:43.670]  That's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:47.670]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that the media calls communist.
[02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:48.670]  But really, they're just a commune.
[02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:51.670]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:53.670]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:55.670]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels.
[02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:57.670]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years.
[02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:58.670]  And the price has never gone up.
[02:56:58.670 --> 02:57:02.670]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50 percent more per pound.
[02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:05.670]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:09.670]  It's wake up America Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[02:57:09.670 --> 02:57:11.670]  In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:19.670]  Anyway, so it's info war store dot com.
[02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:21.670]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:23.670]  And if you don't fund us, don't want us here, that's fine.
[02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:27.670]  We'll see you next time.
