[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:40.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.200 --> 00:53.060]  well that happens more and more I'm so busy so much is going on around here
[00:53.060 --> 00:59.360]  that I've slid in to my transmission command pod here in the info war about
[00:59.360 --> 01:05.640]  10 seconds late but we are live and it is Friday and 10 seconds from now it'll
[01:05.640 --> 01:10.000]  be Friday again as everyone knows you should get older life speeds up but what
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.400]  happens is life speeds up not just because you're getting older but because
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.000]  the world itself is speeding up we are going to be live here for the next three
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.600]  hours I am Alex Jones your host the website is info wars calm and at
[01:25.600 --> 01:33.120]  prisonplanet.tv we have Webster Griffin Tarpley joining us from Tripoli he's been
[01:33.120 --> 01:39.520]  on the ground at different government buildings and bombed-out facilities and
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.560]  I'm told we even have footage of Tarpley at a pro-Qaddafi event so we'll get
[01:44.560 --> 01:51.520]  his coverage of that along with the video also Mike Ravel former US senator
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.360]  and 9-11 truther will be joining us wow I don't think I've ever heard Lenin
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.520]  LaRouche come out and say 9-11 is a total inside job and that the government
[02:00.520 --> 02:06.360]  was behind it but he said that yesterday that was pretty powerful also Bob
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.160]  Chapman is going to be joining us we're working on getting Dr. Paul Craig
[02:09.160 --> 02:16.000]  Roberts to pop in today as well because he was one of the first to say that the
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.880]  Dominic Strauss con situation was his phony as a $3 bill I don't like
[02:20.880 --> 02:28.880]  Dominic Strauss con for the first few days I halfway seized upon it people are
[02:28.880 --> 02:32.800]  like well you said he's a scumbag well he's a scumbag and this is how globalist
[02:32.800 --> 02:37.360]  act this is part of the course and my point was maybe he did it maybe he
[02:37.360 --> 02:41.280]  didn't and Roberts was like no this is a setup because of what he's done
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.320]  politically and of course Roberts was the former head of policy at the
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.120]  Treasury so he's he's moved in those circles and then it came out that's the
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.000]  and this was confirmed a few days after they didn't get a lot of attention but
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.880]  it was in the French British and few US papers confirmed Charcosies Carl Rove
[02:57.880 --> 03:04.320]  his chief political strategist came out and had to admit that he'd sent a
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.000]  Twitter out before air con had even been arrested before it was even known
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.680]  before he was even detained in the in the 45 minutes while they were looking
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.560]  for him and another one of Sarkozy's aides also
[03:17.560 --> 03:23.400]  twittered with their enjoyment and they later admitted well we had spies on
[03:23.400 --> 03:32.040]  Sarkozy I mean Sarkozy had spies on con so I mean right there danger will
[03:32.040 --> 03:36.640]  Robinson this is the guy who admittedly was going to run against Sarkozy big
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.320]  globalist they're all globalist and these guys pick each other off these
[03:40.320 --> 03:44.280]  people you know these guys you know played dirty tricks on each other not
[03:44.280 --> 03:47.480]  just the general public and the population of the world and our
[03:47.480 --> 03:53.240]  economic systems and admitted that that they had quote spies following con
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.360]  around of course con was set to run against Sarkozy coming up next year and
[03:58.360 --> 04:02.400]  in all the polls was at least 10 points ahead of him and so it was a clear
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.920]  setup the reason I raised that the police and the prosecutors are now having
[04:06.920 --> 04:12.520]  to admit that the maid has been caught lying on a host of issues and that he
[04:12.520 --> 04:16.480]  may be released at any time I mean they may drop the charges so that's in the
[04:16.480 --> 04:22.720]  New York Times New York Post it's up on info wars.com as well we've got some
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.080]  reports going over some of the history and background of that so just more
[04:27.080 --> 04:32.000]  examples of the dirty tricks because listen normally globalists can rape
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.760]  people they can kill people and the police won't go after them I mean the
[04:36.760 --> 04:42.040]  New York police are notoriously mafia it's it's like the former head of the
[04:42.040 --> 04:48.640]  FBI Jagger Hoover saying that the mafia didn't exist because they had photos of
[04:48.640 --> 04:55.680]  him dressed up like Queen Elizabeth basically so they only bust you if they
[04:55.680 --> 04:58.680]  want to and if they have to they'll frame you we'll be right back it's all
[04:58.680 --> 05:04.120]  coming up all coming up. Hello this is Steve Shank what does freedom mean to you

[07:03.040 --> 07:07.400]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.760]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.760 --> 07:16.080]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:16.080 --> 07:20.440]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.440 --> 07:24.480]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.480 --> 07:29.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:29.080 --> 07:33.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.200 --> 07:37.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.160 --> 07:41.000]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.680]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.680 --> 07:49.680]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[07:49.680 --> 07:54.360]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[07:54.360 --> 08:00.680]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[08:00.680 --> 08:24.040]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:24.040 --> 08:33.800]  it is Friday the first day of July 2011 they prepare to celebrate the nation's
[08:33.800 --> 08:40.680]  birthday remembering July 4th 1776 I hear the mainstream corporate
[08:40.680 --> 08:45.160]  establishment media talking about how have we're gonna have a happy 4th of
[08:45.160 --> 08:52.560]  July and celebrate security no King George the third offered security which
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.600]  was really a nice name for tyranny we celebrate independence and freedom and
[08:57.600 --> 09:04.080]  private property and independence against despots on July 4th and if you
[09:04.080 --> 09:09.160]  read an FBI or Homeland Security training manual they are basically like
[09:09.160 --> 09:16.800]  vampires afraid of big silver crosses when they talk about folks that are into
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.400]  the Bill of Rights Constitution and our Republic
[09:20.400 --> 09:24.400]  Webster Griffin Tarpley of course is joining us with another quick report
[09:24.400 --> 09:29.360]  from Tripoli big developments over there with Russian envoys as NATO
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.920]  preparing a Libyan ground invasion that's the intel Russia has also Air Force
[09:34.920 --> 09:40.920]  Times reporting that AFRICOM Air Force Navy still flying Libyan emissions we
[09:40.920 --> 09:47.440]  also have some reports that I want to integrate together with the last few
[09:47.440 --> 09:52.520]  weeks that we've heard Fox News Glenn Beck and others talking about agenda 21
[09:52.520 --> 09:59.560]  and the global standardization of laws with carbon taxes and international
[09:59.560 --> 10:05.840]  zoning through federal zoning and these rural councils that are being set up to
[10:05.840 --> 10:13.200]  basically pressure people off their land the premises ID the animal ID the food
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.520]  safety act all lobbied for by multinational Big Agra to openly shut
[10:18.520 --> 10:24.000]  down their competition I thought I would get into the rest of the story coming
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.200]  up later in the broadcast either when Bob Chapman's on with us or in the
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.640]  second half of the second hour a senator Mike Ravel's joining us on new 911
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.280]  truth developments former US senator and presidential candidate Mike Ravel's
[10:40.280 --> 10:43.400]  gonna be popping in at the start of the next hour if it partly joins us then of
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.160]  course our weekly visit with Bob Chapman that'll be a smorgasbord of important
[10:47.160 --> 10:56.200]  news intelligence and information so all of that is coming up on the broadcast
[10:56.200 --> 11:08.720]  today now continuing here back to the agenda 21 stuff there's an article out
[11:08.720 --> 11:12.400]  of American thinker that's very well documented a purposeful flooding of
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.560]  America's Heartland and it gets into this year despite more than double the
[11:16.560 --> 11:22.040]  usual amount of mountain and high planes snowpack and even ever-present risk of
[11:22.040 --> 11:29.480]  storing and strong spring storms the true believers in the Army Corps of
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.680]  Engineers have persisted in following the revised MWCW recklessly
[11:35.680 --> 11:41.280]  endangering millions of residents so they didn't early on allow the floodgates
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.520]  to be open on these highland lakes and mountain lakes they let it build up and
[11:47.520 --> 11:53.240]  and then once the spring storms came they released it all at once Missouri
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.080]  senator Roy Blunt agrees calling the management plan flawed and poorly
[11:57.080 --> 12:00.480]  thought out no it's not poorly thought out senator Blunt characterize the
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.280]  current flooding is entirely preventable and told reporters that he intends to
[12:04.280 --> 12:11.040]  force changes to the plan Greg Palivka a wall apologist with the Corps of
[12:11.040 --> 12:18.280]  Engineers in Yankton South Dakota told the Seattle Times that this event will
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.680]  leave the river in a much more natural state than it has seen in decades and
[12:23.680 --> 12:30.160]  they have links to all this so this is about not see they openly with the
[12:30.160 --> 12:33.240]  rewilding want to get rid of dams and then they've said that you've heard that
[12:33.240 --> 12:36.560]  you've seen that but instead what they're doing is they're now just not
[12:36.560 --> 12:40.240]  using the dams or they're letting the water build up and then releasing
[12:40.240 --> 12:44.320]  dangerous amounts of it and then talking about well this is natural you
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.480]  shouldn't be living in a floodplain and FEMA continues here after here to
[12:49.480 --> 12:55.520]  expand floodplains even houses on top you know hill tops 300 feet above lakes
[12:55.520 --> 13:04.520]  here in Austin you just just just as an eye type stuff that is going on and it's
[13:04.520 --> 13:10.600]  all about land grabs all about power grabs all about a gen 21 all about this
[13:10.600 --> 13:15.800]  rural council that ties into the 10 governor council continuing here on
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.120]  February 3rd of this year a series of emails from Fort Perry South Dakota
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.880]  director of public works Brad Lawrence sound of the alarm loud and clear
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.400]  in correspondence to the headquarters of the American Waterworks Association of
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.440]  Washington DC Lawrence warned the Corps of Engineers has failed thus far to
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.640]  evacuate enough water from the main stem reservoirs to meet normal runoff
[13:39.640 --> 13:43.440]  conditions this year's runoff will be anything but normal and the same email
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.320]  he describes the consequences of the Corps failure to act as a flood of
[13:47.320 --> 13:51.440]  biblical proportions this is before any of the flooding began his emails were
[13:51.440 --> 13:55.240]  forwarded from Washington DC the state emergency response coordinators nationwide
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.280]  the core headquarters in Omaha Nebraska which is responsible for the Missouri
[13:59.280 --> 14:02.480]  River system claims that they heard no such warning from Lawrence or anyone
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.760]  else considering the wild distribution of the correspondence the wide
[14:06.760 --> 14:10.000]  distribution of it and likely reactions from officials in endangered states
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.960]  that denials strain crudility or a reality the the the smell test and it
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.480]  just goes on so see I've already gotten into this now but I'm gonna get into it
[14:22.480 --> 14:27.320]  later in detail because it's so important and it shows this attitude
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.680]  this is a set policy you can pull up the report it's going back to the 60s but
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.640]  but but now these ideas have become mainline to not build fire breaks to
[14:36.640 --> 14:41.200]  not allow on national federal and state lands and even private land that they're
[14:41.200 --> 14:47.280]  trying to restrict now the cutting of timber and then the forest debilitate
[14:47.280 --> 14:56.440]  fall into you know basically briar patches with lots of fallen trees huge
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.200]  amounts of fuel if you've ever been in a forest that's been kept up for centuries
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.080]  and and and had human intervention it's beautiful it's it's it's it's it's it's
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.880]  expansive the wildlife pours into it you go into a lot of these forest that have
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.560]  had a lot of old growth that's died and things and had a lot of different type
[15:15.560 --> 15:20.240]  of insects and festations it looks like something out of a wastelands badlands
[15:20.240 --> 15:28.520]  horror movie and it's just massive amounts of quote devilish carbon by the
[15:28.520 --> 15:34.280]  way that gets ignited by the thunderstorms and lightning storms and and now
[15:34.280 --> 15:37.440]  I'm digressing but they're they're they're not building a lot of new dams
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.120]  they're trying to get rid of the old dams and have destroyed quite a few then
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.840]  when they do have dams they're using them as a weapon and and and letting the
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.160]  water go right to the crest and then once the rain starts they already have
[15:49.160 --> 15:54.560]  the snow drifts melting then the rain comes and then they release it at once
[15:54.560 --> 15:57.840]  to have the maximum effect the Army Corps of Engineers are incredible
[15:57.840 --> 16:01.440]  engineers incredible history they've they've they've built one of the best
[16:01.440 --> 16:06.960]  inland dam and and water control systems the world's ever seen and suddenly in the
[16:06.960 --> 16:13.280]  last few decades they're reversing all of that and using the water as a weapon
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.800]  it's diabolical but it's stated they don't want people living in many of the
[16:18.800 --> 16:23.720]  rural areas and they're going to use water as a weapon all right now I'm
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.120]  really blowing a lot of time here but I'm gonna tie that into President Obama's
[16:27.120 --> 16:29.880]  executive order we talked about this a few weeks ago but I want to really tie
[16:29.880 --> 16:34.320]  it all together one three five seven five creates rural councils because we
[16:34.320 --> 16:38.680]  posted on YouTube yesterday because I've never seen this of a film clip of Ronald
[16:38.680 --> 16:45.880]  Reagan as governor talking about globalist world government plans to
[16:45.880 --> 16:53.000]  rob the Midwest of its farmland and force people out which is the stated
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.040]  rewilding project I mean this is just amazing so I was blown away seeing
[16:59.040 --> 17:04.600]  Ronald Reagan say this so that's coming up later okay obviously in other news I
[17:04.600 --> 17:07.640]  tend to just cover whatever is on the top of my head I think it's most important
[17:07.640 --> 17:13.000]  and sometimes it's well that doesn't seem as important but in the wide long-term
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.560]  frame it's it's really dangerous to realize how predatory the establishment
[17:17.560 --> 17:23.840]  is firefighters scrambled to contain blaze near lab in Los Alamos National
[17:23.840 --> 17:30.360]  Laboratories in New Mexico the fire is burning they're nearly unabated through
[17:30.360 --> 17:37.600]  the Santa Fe National Forest and Valos Caldera National Reserve by late
[17:37.600 --> 17:46.720]  Thursday it had charred 93,678 acres and strong winds threatened to be the
[17:46.720 --> 17:50.600]  firefighters greatest challenge we have seen fire behavior we have never seen
[17:50.600 --> 17:56.880]  before said Chief Doug Tucker told reporters now the good news is in the
[17:56.880 --> 18:00.680]  last few hours right as the firefighters weren't sure they can stop it it's
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.160]  close as 50 feet away they've been battling it because they weren't allowed
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.800]  to cut back fire breaks the last few decades right up to the facilities were
[18:08.800 --> 18:15.120]  20,000 plus barrels of uranium and plutonium are stored and there's already
[18:15.120 --> 18:20.480]  been nuclear testing all over that area so it is putting a lot of isotopes into
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.680]  the atmosphere that had been bound up in the soil and the plants for 60 plus
[18:25.680 --> 18:33.440]  years of ongoing testing but the good news is the winds changed directions away
[18:33.440 --> 18:39.400]  from the facility in the last few hours and so keep your fingers crossed because
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.720]  we are all downwind ever I mean I'm right here in Texas and we're already

[18:49.200 --> 18:53.840]  into where I live and I saw a report in the major news what just last two weeks
[18:53.840 --> 18:59.000]  ago that the average person and tested scientists did in Seattle are getting
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.240]  five hot particles a day that means particles not just background radiation
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.360]  but actually highly radioactive particles different isotopes but uranium
[19:08.360 --> 19:16.280]  plutonium strontium cesium cesium blowing over here and that people on
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.120]  the east coast are getting as many as five hot particles a day in your mouth
[19:20.120 --> 19:25.600]  in your nose into your lungs and I mean it is well but Chernobyl admittedly

[24:37.960 --> 24:41.240]  broadcast on this in the near future because we've been covering it for 16
[24:41.240 --> 24:48.280]  years I've been on air they set up agenda 21 in 92 at the big earth
[24:48.280 --> 24:52.280]  conference headed up by Maury Strong you can pull up the video online you can
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.440]  pull up the quotes where he said a post industrial America it is our job to
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.640]  destroy the West and destroy industrial society reduce the world population by
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.640]  at least 80% Jesse Ventura's his global warming fraud show and the first
[25:08.640 --> 25:14.560]  season was a really good and exposed all that but I'm just glad this
[25:14.560 --> 25:17.960]  information is becoming mainline but you need to understand that's where the
[25:17.960 --> 25:21.640]  standardized zoning is whether you're in England or Australia or Germany of the
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.920]  US it's the same stuff that formula ones coming into Austin they're gonna pay
[25:26.920 --> 25:31.760]  for it with taxpayer money but then the companies agreed which then sets the
[25:31.760 --> 25:37.640]  precedent to pay all these carbon offsets to private companies I mean it's
[25:37.640 --> 25:41.720]  just a total scam and Al Gore's the head of one company the Rothschild's are the
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.120]  head of the biggest but President Obama's executive order 13 575 again we
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.320]  talked about this a few weeks ago they're like oh rural councils and it's
[25:51.320 --> 25:56.640]  got the Department of Defense on it Homeland Security and they already had
[25:56.640 --> 26:01.800]  this covertly set up and they've send out Homeland Security at events I've
[26:01.800 --> 26:04.880]  seen at the Associated Press and they get the farmers there to talk to him
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.040]  about Al Qaeda and once they get there it's like is someone growing marijuana
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.760]  are there illegal guns in the area help us watch your neighbors I mean it's so
[26:13.760 --> 26:19.360]  creepy and they know the Midwest the the bitter clingers as Obama called them
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.360]  cling to their guns their Bibles are the biggest enemy of the establishment and
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.760]  plus the farmers in the East and then the Amish and the folks in the West they're
[26:28.760 --> 26:33.000]  targeting them everywhere but the Midwest is is really where it's
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.600]  happening and if you just joined us I read earlier where the Army Corps of
[26:36.600 --> 26:41.360]  Engineers and knowingly I mean there's science to this and working and giving
[26:41.360 --> 26:48.920]  orders to the big reservoir dam operators in their plan with record rain
[26:48.920 --> 26:55.400]  in many of these areas that they list that you're now seeing flooded with the
[26:55.400 --> 26:59.720]  the reservoir is already full with the record snowmelt about to come in and
[26:59.720 --> 27:05.440]  they just waited until it was cresting the dams and released it and it's being
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.840]  called a false flag and I totally agree and now the Army Corps is in there
[27:10.840 --> 27:15.440]  trying to demand that people be forced to sell and expanding floodplains and
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.560]  of course FEMA makes you buy flood insurance from them now they control
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.720]  the consortium that started after Katrina I know a lot of folks live on the
[27:24.720 --> 27:32.800]  lake but but but even in hilltop houses 200 300 feet above the lake and you know
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.480]  that these areas have never been underwater in modern times and then
[27:37.480 --> 27:41.160]  they're like well you got to pay extra stuff now just like Obama saying you've
[27:41.160 --> 27:48.120]  got to buy insurance it's it's it's just a scam they just order you as a form of
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.560]  taxation to the private corporate interest let's go to this Fox news clip
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.360]  and again if Fox was more like this all the time I'd support him shows a real
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.240]  war inside the elite covering what the rural affairs agenda and this new
[28:00.240 --> 28:04.560]  council really does here it is you'll find that they've also asked for the
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.240]  right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.640]  government the secretary of agriculture asked for the right to seize farms
[28:13.640 --> 28:18.080]  through condemnation and resell them to other individuals and contained in that
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.000]  same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.160]  remove two million farmers from the soil if you live in the heartland of America
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.300]  you have to listen up while the nation was distracted with the Anthony Wiener
[28:32.300 --> 28:36.640]  drama president Obama signed an executive order that will seize greater
[28:36.640 --> 28:42.040]  power over food fiber and energy in our vast countryside areas the president
[28:42.040 --> 28:46.760]  created the White House rural council to quote make sure we're working across
[28:46.760 --> 28:50.520]  government to strengthen rural communities and promote economic growth
[28:50.520 --> 28:56.080]  sounds great but get this the council involves a long list of the most
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.400]  powerful people in America Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner the defense
[29:00.400 --> 29:04.880]  secretaries on it Attorney General Eric Holder even the head of Homeland
[29:04.880 --> 29:08.880]  Security Janet Napolitano why would Homeland Security be involved in
[29:08.880 --> 29:13.040]  exerting power and influence over the heartland why would the Defense
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.240]  Department be involved in promoting economic growth the plan calls for the
[29:17.240 --> 29:21.440]  federal government to control almost every aspect of rural America it will
[29:21.440 --> 29:26.160]  also quote identify and facilitate economic opportunities associated with
[29:26.160 --> 29:30.680]  energy development outdoor recreation and other conservation related
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.400]  activities really when did hunting and fishing become associated with
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.400]  conservation related activities all right what does that mean he goes on and
[29:38.400 --> 29:43.240]  calls it a new world order ladies and gentlemen that was Ronald Reagan by the
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.400]  way at the first they had this plan in 64 and it's like something out of
[29:47.400 --> 29:51.200]  Stalinist Russia you can't make this stuff up it's a gender 21 we're on the

[33:16.800 --> 33:21.960]  phones are down now but the jaren keeps trying sometimes we're able to get
[33:21.960 --> 33:31.320]  through to the peace area of Libya where the Nobel Prize winner Obama under UN
[33:31.320 --> 33:38.320]  orders is killing people in mass and preparing a giant ground invasion as
[33:38.320 --> 33:46.680]  part of the peace they've also started in Somalia and of course in Yemen
[33:46.680 --> 33:52.520]  and they're talking about starting it in Sudan more predator drones dropping
[33:52.520 --> 33:56.760]  bombs on people and the Pentagon says that of a hundred innocent people are
[33:56.760 --> 34:03.600]  killed to get quote one bad guy that is peace and so Obama the man of peace
[34:03.600 --> 34:08.000]  aren't all of you are America and Huffington Post people proud of
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.040]  yourselves well of course you are you loved it when Bill Clinton launched that
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.200]  UN war against the Serbs and the Serbs were pretty vicious and engaged in a
[34:16.200 --> 34:21.920]  lot of atrocities and I'm not Serb I don't have a drop of Serb blood in me
[34:21.920 --> 34:26.840]  but I'm sorry to tell you that the UN admits in its own reports that they
[34:26.840 --> 34:32.120]  knew that the Croats and Muslims killed roughly in that long conflict double
[34:32.120 --> 34:37.960]  what the Serbs did it's called ethnic warfare and so I do not support the
[34:37.960 --> 34:44.360]  Muslims or the Croats either and I actually one time in New York about six
[34:44.360 --> 34:49.960]  years ago the cab driver said I am Albanian after we were driving about
[34:49.960 --> 34:56.600]  five minutes you are Alex Jones Bill Clinton is God to us and I said so he
[34:56.600 --> 35:03.000]  goes yes I know you are with the Serbs and I was just like well but it's
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.840]  admitted that you guys killed double and attacked the Serbs first you know after
[35:08.840 --> 35:12.680]  Tito died the whole place broke up it was under communist socialist control
[35:12.680 --> 35:17.800]  and and then it was destabilized and you know the whole war and and and and
[35:17.800 --> 35:23.200]  you guys were attacking the Serbs and and he's like they need to die they need
[35:23.200 --> 35:30.400]  to and he goes don't argue with me or I will throw you out of cab and I was like
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.880]  well you can go ahead and drop me off and he started smiling acting nice going
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.760]  no no Americans do not know Americans do not know they had blonde hair and blue
[35:39.760 --> 35:45.080]  eyes too but he was a Muslim and he wanted to suck me into his Christian
[35:45.080 --> 35:49.280]  Muslim fight I don't want anybody killing each other I'm tired of it but
[35:49.280 --> 35:54.440]  I'm sorry don't tell me that Belgrade has to be bombed with DU weapons
[35:54.440 --> 35:58.400]  everywhere and their TV stations their water treatment their factories that
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.080]  made peaceful aircraft and cars to be bombed because they wanted to be a
[36:02.080 --> 36:07.400]  sovereign country and yes they were in tribal warfare and and you can look at
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.120]  from any angle and say who's bad you can look at it from the Palestinian
[36:11.120 --> 36:14.040]  perspective and say Israel's bad you can look at it from the Israeli
[36:14.040 --> 36:18.560]  perspective and say the Palestinians are bad I don't have a dog in the hunt I
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.000]  don't have a dog in the fight I want my private property I want my second
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.720]  amendment I don't want my government flying around bombing all these
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.600]  countries constantly as we go bankrupt it's real simple so I'm not for the
[36:32.600 --> 36:41.000]  Muslims I'm not for the Serbs I'm not for Israel I'm not for the Russians I am
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.120]  not for any of these sides any of these groups I am for liberty I am for
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.360]  freedom I am for individuals of all those groups black white old young
[36:51.360 --> 36:56.400]  German Russian Mexican Venezuelan I don't care if you want freedom then we are
[36:56.400 --> 37:00.520]  brothers and sisters in liberty but if you don't like freedom if you like
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.320]  collectivism and corporate globalism I don't like you I don't like the fruits
[37:05.320 --> 37:08.640]  of what you promote you don't know what you're doing most of you were idiots
[37:08.640 --> 37:14.880]  who support globalism all right now I'm ranting you tell me we have tarpoli so
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.920]  what I thank you I can see you guys even less when the lights are off them I was
[37:18.920 --> 37:21.520]  trying to remember why I like the lights on there that's because I can it's like
[37:21.520 --> 37:26.000]  I just I get these hand signals usually and I can't tell what's going on but hey
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.800]  I don't blame you guys don't want the senator fluorescent lights those things are bad for
[37:30.800 --> 37:36.320]  you I think we're put some track lighting in there's the answer okay coming up
[37:36.320 --> 37:43.760]  obviously Dominic Strauss-Kahn the case is falling apart and it is a setup is
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.600]  it saying he's a good guy no it's a horrible globalist but this is Sarkozy
[37:47.600 --> 37:50.800]  who knows that Khan's gonna beat him in the election the French are now saying
[37:50.800 --> 37:54.320]  he's surging even more in the polls this came out and he's gonna probably be
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.200]  released soon and go back and become the next president of France so we'll be
[37:58.200 --> 38:05.960]  talking about that but I take you now to Tripoli and we're showing pro Qaddafi
[38:05.960 --> 38:11.920]  video right now from Libyan television that's up for a time and gets bombed
[38:11.920 --> 38:15.680]  routinely but they get it back up the phones go out routinely and in this
[38:15.680 --> 38:21.240]  footage you can at one point see Webster Griffin tarpoli in fact maybe
[38:21.240 --> 38:27.760]  we'll pause it when it gets to the part where you can see Webster there there's
[38:27.760 --> 38:34.280]  maybe Yemenese TV broadcasting up oh this is live this is live footage right
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.920]  now jaren saying he saw tarpoli earlier on the footage Webster Griffin tarpoli
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.880]  you are now joining us very brave to be there now nearing your second week in
[38:43.880 --> 38:48.560]  Libya or about to end the first week Webster welcome thank you very much
[38:48.560 --> 38:55.720]  Ali these are gigantic crowds it looks like it is a curse review 200,000 or
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.080]  more how many people is that I think that's probably about right it's in the
[39:00.080 --> 39:05.440]  hundreds of thousands and the thing is I'm here above green square this is a
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.080]  vantage point at the edge of the old city of Tripoli which goes back to the
[39:11.080 --> 39:16.840]  Roman Empire so I'm up here with the press call we came on the press bus
[39:16.840 --> 39:22.360]  today and they're easily tens of thousands right in the in this packed area
[39:22.360 --> 39:28.120]  right below us where they're they're really having a quite a time they're
[39:28.120 --> 39:33.320]  chanting and dancing and they're shooting off collection of colleagues
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.680]  every now and then you hear a ripple of machine gun fire there's such slaves that
[39:38.680 --> 39:43.800]  they have 200,000 or looks like more people firing automatic weapons in the
[39:43.800 --> 39:46.800]  air can you imagine land of the free home of the brave what the government
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.440]  would do if 200,000 people tried to gather with Kalashnikov's in the capital
[39:51.440 --> 39:58.080]  what would happen I don't know but here it's also women I think the the demand
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.800]  for Kalashnikov's among women here is monumental but let me just give you an
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.640]  idea of the setting we're about two hours from the Mediterranean Sunset and
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.480]  the reason they have these demonstrations late in the day is what I'm
[40:11.480 --> 40:16.040]  feeling right now the Sun is still very strong right we're basically on the
[40:16.040 --> 40:21.200]  northern edge of the Sahara Desert the Mediterranean is about half a mile away
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.600]  so we're right here by this basin in the board of Tripoli right across from me
[40:25.600 --> 40:32.240]  is a building that goes back ultimately to about the 5th century AD it's Marcus
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.880]  Decimus Aurelius one of the later Roman emperors built this palace and he built
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.520]  the walls to the old city and then beyond that you could see the minarets of
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.080]  the of the interior of the old city those came later of course those came in
[40:47.080 --> 40:52.560]  the 700s and the 800s and the place is back then it's green it's the sea of
[40:52.560 --> 40:58.960]  green they have got these green stripes right about six feet wide and every
[40:58.960 --> 41:03.360]  tribe is competing with every other tribe to see who can have the longest one
[41:03.360 --> 41:07.320]  and some of them are in his four kilometers long and the other one says
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.480]  that's nothing we've got ten kilometers over here so that's going on we got
[41:12.480 --> 41:18.000]  above me there are these floodlights right like at a ballpark and there are
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.200]  people climbing up on these things with great danger to life and live can you
[41:23.200 --> 41:30.480]  imagine if us troops go into that city I think that would be rivers of blood and
[41:30.480 --> 41:36.480]  once again these were people who put up with a million a million dead under the
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.400]  Italian colonialism they're the first people in the world to have poison gas
[41:41.400 --> 41:47.640]  used on them that didn't stop them and the ultimate of the Italians built what
[41:47.640 --> 41:52.480]  it looks to the it's something like a primitive version of the Berlin wall or
[41:52.480 --> 41:58.480]  the inner Deutsche the inner German border in the Cold War except this was
[41:58.480 --> 42:03.400]  all along the border between Libya and Egypt to keep the British from sluggling
[42:03.400 --> 42:09.720]  in support for the rebels so there's chanting now the chance it's actually a
[42:09.720 --> 42:16.080]  very good-humored crowd you see some pro-Syrian flag there's a solidarity
[42:16.080 --> 42:21.600]  with theory operation there are some other flags down there and the big guy
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.920]  that they hate is Sarkozy man down down Sarkozy down down Sarkozy that's the
[42:26.920 --> 42:31.920]  the order of the day and they were all there was already sort of spontaneous
[42:31.920 --> 42:38.120]  jubilation yesterday when when Sarkozy got himself yanked by this guy when he
[42:38.120 --> 42:42.880]  was working a rope line some some guy grabbed him by the jacket and just about
[42:42.880 --> 42:46.960]  threw him down and apparently that guy whoever he is says that that had to do
[42:46.960 --> 42:52.120]  with Libya well we know what that stuff is worth but still here it's
[42:52.120 --> 42:57.160]  welcome because out of all of these figures Sarkozy is undoubtedly the most
[42:57.160 --> 43:01.960]  hated so he is the number one villain do we know why Sarkozy who admittedly was
[43:01.960 --> 43:07.760]  financed with some Libyan money and making deals with Muammar Gaddafi why
[43:07.760 --> 43:13.760]  Sarkozy is trying to double cross Gaddafi well it because you've got to
[43:13.760 --> 43:20.000]  remember who was Sarkozy is right there's I think there's some maybe a sign
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.440]  down there that says something about Sarkozy's ancestry he is the bastard
[43:25.440 --> 43:32.520]  son of the CIA and the says that Sarkozy's mother I guess his biological
[43:32.520 --> 43:39.600]  mother remarried and the guy who became the stepfather to Sarkozy is
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.040]  Wiesner I think Frank Wiesner Frank Wiesner I don't know what number or
[43:44.040 --> 43:47.840]  junior but this is a this is a celebrated family of the State Department
[43:47.840 --> 43:53.320]  and above all this CIA so sure Sarkozy's not even from France for folks that
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.720]  don't know that I think more Hungarian to begin with yes big influence that the
[43:58.720 --> 44:03.600]  household that he grew weapon was the CIA household so now we've got a puppet
[44:03.600 --> 44:08.960]  president of France and it's just amazing the woman that was put in as the
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.120]  new head of the IMF right this black guard I've heard some stories about
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.800]  black guard now from some French people who were here
[44:16.800 --> 44:23.520]  Thierry Maison among others and the idea is good luck God as a French minister
[44:23.520 --> 44:30.960]  treasury secretary she put out an order that it was forbidden to speak French in
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.320]  that ministry she said everything has to be done in English everything has to be
[44:35.320 --> 44:38.120]  written in English don't come to me and talk to me in French I want to hear it
[44:38.120 --> 44:43.320]  in English she's an anglophile so that's that's putting it mildly she's off the
[44:43.320 --> 44:49.080]  deep end on that stuff now there's a there's a crescendo of oratory and
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.680]  cheering in the background that you may hear and I see another guy up on this
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.560]  no no you're reporting we've got the video up for prison planet dot TV viewers
[44:57.560 --> 45:02.640]  wonderful live but but let me stop you because I want to cover two points with
[45:02.640 --> 45:05.520]  you here because I know you're not getting a lot of news while you're over
[45:05.520 --> 45:09.560]  there under the bombardment Russian envoy a NATO preparing Libyan ground
[45:09.560 --> 45:16.760]  invasion info wars dot com this is art of our a RIA you know the main TV in
[45:16.760 --> 45:24.560]  Russia a Dmitry Rogozin told RIA Novostat on Friday that NATO is probably
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.400]  preparing a ground invasion to overthrow the Gaddafi regime in Libya he took he
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.160]  is Russia's NATO envoy I think that now we are witnessing the preparation stage
[45:34.160 --> 45:38.560]  for a ground invasion which NATO and at least some of its members are going to
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.360]  begin and then that we go into the Guardian in our past reports we broke
[45:42.360 --> 45:46.480]  this of course three weeks ago from our intel sources first Cav under three
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.920]  corps out of Fort Hood and others just that contingent it at least 15,000 with
[45:51.920 --> 45:57.480]  another 15,000 support trips 30,000 there the Marine Corps commander out of one
[45:57.480 --> 46:04.280]  base two months ago said yes we're leaving to go to Libya so so so so
[46:04.280 --> 46:10.120]  Tarpley what do you make of the fact that Russia is now saying that they've got
[46:10.120 --> 46:16.400]  intel the green light is rolling forward I mean this is madness I think it's widely
[46:16.400 --> 46:23.640]  known I was just on Russia today via Moscow a couple of hours ago and that
[46:23.640 --> 46:27.600]  should be up at the top be back next before it's too long their hope and if
[46:27.600 --> 46:32.280]  the main idea was that the block off also the foreign minister had said
[46:32.280 --> 46:37.280]  something similar so we got all the all the main Russian representatives in the
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.280]  world really putting out that line so they obviously see something coming and
[46:42.280 --> 46:47.600]  then they'll that's what's the ball in our court I thought today some analysis
[46:47.600 --> 46:50.440]  of that vote in the House of Representatives from last week which
[46:50.440 --> 46:55.920]  indicates that there are already enough boats in the house to cut off the money
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.440]  and stop the war at least from the House of Representatives point of view
[47:00.440 --> 47:12.920]  sorry I just got interrupted here they I think I may be the only person doing a
[47:12.920 --> 47:21.160]  live feed not understand Lord Tarpley please continue the thing the thing is
[47:21.160 --> 47:26.440]  it's coming right so the the House of Representatives you've already got enough
[47:26.440 --> 47:33.240]  votes all you need is a clean bill that says no more funding no more killing no
[47:33.240 --> 47:38.200]  more war and nothing is approved and not even retrospectively because when you
[47:38.200 --> 47:43.240]  look at that the bill put in by Congressman Rooney last week which was
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.120]  presented as the one cutting off the fund which lost by about 30 votes that
[47:48.120 --> 47:54.880]  could have had 70 more anti-war Democrats voting for it but it was a
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.840]  people said it was approving Obama through the back door because it said no
[47:59.840 --> 48:04.840]  killing but everything else is fine but if all the logistics and everything else
[48:04.840 --> 48:09.640]  you know up to killing but not including killing is fine and what Obama has done
[48:09.640 --> 48:14.520]  is approved a lot of people just don't want to vote for that so again well we
[48:14.520 --> 48:18.680]  know the timing Webster we know the propaganda because they always beta
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.400]  tested up front three months ago or three months and a week ago when they did
[48:22.400 --> 48:27.600]  the UN resolution that the servile President Obama followed and told
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.240]  Congress you know go fly a kite go jump in the lake or jump off a cliff they
[48:32.240 --> 48:38.520]  said we may need ground support troops and that they're gonna quote create a
[48:38.520 --> 48:43.800]  humanitarian corridor into Tripoli and so they're gonna roll up in tanks and
[48:43.800 --> 48:50.000]  say if you don't let us occupy if you shoot at us then you you're engaged in
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.360]  terrorism so so the new psychology is we're invading bombing you from the air
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.080]  the US tanks are gonna roll in and then if you don't let them roll in and take
[48:59.080 --> 49:04.880]  over you're a terrorist so this is the new Orwellian type idea we have lots of
[49:04.880 --> 49:08.440]  lots of luck with that one there there were enough collage the cops that I can
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.480]  see right down here in the square to put up a fairly significant resistance and
[49:13.480 --> 49:20.600]  as I looked out towards the the Mediterranean out over the key of the
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.400]  clay of the old port there are these columns that were put up the victory
[49:24.400 --> 49:30.480]  between victory columns and these refer to the USS Philadelphia which came here
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.880]  during the Barbrie pirate stuff right the shores of Tripoli this is it and that
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.080]  both there's very poorly there I can take you to see now the graves of the
[49:40.080 --> 49:45.320]  four guys who got killed in that one so the whole history about this place is
[49:45.320 --> 49:50.720]  that don't do it they are very well-armed and so this is a very good
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.600]  webster I'm looking at this crowd it looks like a lot more in a wide shot
[49:54.600 --> 49:58.880]  than 200,000 I would estimate that crowd at above a half a million
[49:58.880 --> 50:05.480]  conservatively because from where I am I can't get it out here beyond this the
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.480]  Roman port and then these two pillars and if I look out over the ocean I've got
[50:10.480 --> 50:15.320]  some webster here's the other issue Saddam was a dictator a US installed
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.880]  dictator on record in 79 but because I don't support Saddam I'm an American I
[50:19.880 --> 50:22.480]  am supposed to support him when they say support him and then hate him when they
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.600]  say hate him but Saddam would only have little tribal folks in Tikrit and other
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.080]  areas that he trusted a few thousand with guns to show he had to support the
[50:31.080 --> 50:34.840]  people a lot of Iraqis didn't like him obviously I don't blame him but I've
[50:34.840 --> 50:39.160]  never I mean this looks like half a million or more people out there waving
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.840]  guns around I mean my gosh the CIA watching this right now and you know
[50:43.840 --> 50:47.320]  they're watching it well that looks like more than half a million they've got to
[50:47.320 --> 50:53.240]  know that that looks like total resistance right there and holy mackerel
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.400]  I mean that is a tribal group stirred up like a bunch of bees well let's talk
[50:57.400 --> 51:01.120]  about what this ground invasion is gonna look like on the other side most
[51:01.120 --> 51:06.280]  Americans believe famine and hunger will never happen but what if day one may
[51:06.280 --> 51:13.040]  end breaks out at grocery stores day three families are on edge day five the
[51:13.040 --> 51:18.160]  neighbors come knocking day 10 small bands of thieves begin stealing at gun
[51:18.160 --> 51:23.200]  point day 15 desperation but the government can't help because there's
[51:23.200 --> 51:29.080]  no food left introducing the grab-and-go emergency food supply from

[55:52.400 --> 55:59.360]  dice book info wars.com or 888-253-3139 Webster it's it's like we're
[55:59.360 --> 56:04.240]  living in in a in a surreal world you're over in Libya hundreds it looks like
[56:04.240 --> 56:08.200]  half a million in the streets with guns ready for war we're being told this is
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.360]  peace and we're and we're calmly talking about another US invasion with the
[56:13.360 --> 56:41.580]  president saying it's not war I mean this is insanity so again for the
[56:41.580 --> 56:45.920]  tribal structure and the tradition and the very fierce independence is the
[56:45.920 --> 56:49.600]  last place in the world anybody in their right mind would want to invade and on
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.320]  the other side it's a very good-natured crowd right this is this is like a it's
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.280]  a holiday it's a happy crowd right there polemic right a lot of great gusto in
[57:00.280 --> 57:05.840]  the chanting dr. Z taking it taking it really hard but at the same time not
[57:05.840 --> 57:09.720]  animus against foreigners right there's no you know people punching you or
[57:09.720 --> 57:14.840]  whatever you you know you think you might expect so it's absolutely surreal
[57:14.840 --> 57:21.040]  because the people that you find here are westernized in the sense that they want
[57:21.040 --> 57:26.000]  modern civilization they want science technology industry social progress
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.640]  the rising standards of living there are a lot of cars and a lot of the people
[57:31.640 --> 57:36.680]  look more collage the cops Tarbley I'm looking at this that looks almost like a
[57:36.680 --> 57:42.080]  million people this is a man because they I mean there's so many people they
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.800]  can't even pull the camera far enough back we're about to go to break but you
[57:46.800 --> 57:49.960]  probably don't know about Dominique Strauss Conn it just broke New York
[57:49.960 --> 57:54.840]  prosecutors are saying the woman's lied about most of her story and that there's
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.340]  talk of the case being dropped and of course everybody knows Sarkozy's
[57:59.340 --> 58:03.920]  chief of staff released that Conn was gonna be arrested before it was even in
[58:03.920 --> 58:08.680]  the news they admitted they had spies on him why do you what do you think's
[58:08.680 --> 58:12.200]  happening with Conn who was set to run against Sarkozy
[58:12.200 --> 58:19.960]  I don't know it is a little bit puzzling right what's happening but as soon as Madame Lacan the
[58:19.960 --> 58:26.360]  the Anglophile agent was installed in her new post then they left this whole
[58:26.360 --> 58:30.680]  thing all the pieces it's kind of what they do with congressmen congressmen are
[58:30.680 --> 58:35.560]  often you know that the prosecutor will leak a whole lot of stuff during your
[58:35.560 --> 58:38.480]  campaign yeah they halfway burn them and then the case falls through but the
[58:38.480 --> 58:41.640]  change is already made stay there

[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.560]  those that don't know you're in the middle of that demonstration Strauss
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.560]  Kahn seems seen as near collapse New York Times made who accused DSK of sexual
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:14.200]  assault repeatedly lied the police are saying next question on Strauss Kahn
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.520]  was he set up I mean it's admitted that Sarkozy's Carl Rove political
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.040]  strategist released a Twitter before he was even arrested before it was even in
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:29.600]  the news and they later said yeah we had spies on Kahn and clearly this is
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.560]  Kahn was going to run against Sarkozy and when what other comments do you have
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.600]  Tarpley just a typical US prosecutorial message member congressman
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.640]  Weldon of Pennsylvania dealt with the things and he got he got attacked by a
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.120]  prosecutor then I don't believe there ever was an indictment of trial what a
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.560]  congressman from New Jersey right after 9-11 the senator name is escaping me
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:01.680]  now but he wanted to have an immediate inquiry and they simply put up a bunch
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.360]  of slanders about him and he never never got a talk about this and we got
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.400]  another question about the cops in the background I have you one of your family

[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.320]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.760]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.680]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.080]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.800]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.760]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:48.280]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.600]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.920]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.880]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.240]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.560]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.320]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:42.160]  we're so bankrupt but why shouldn't the banker try to bankrupt us even more we
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.600]  also have a lot of other really important news dealing with Obama's
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:54.680]  executive order on the rural councils in UN agenda 21 we also have more on TSA
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.880]  body scanners and now in Europe doctors are refusing to go through and just not
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.080]  allowed to fly this is going in on all over the world so we're going to be
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:08.160]  covering that come about 20 minutes 25 minutes from now when former US senator
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.760]  Mike Revelle 2008 presidential candidate and distinguished former US senator
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:17.680]  from Alaska from 69 to 81 is the founder of the 9-11 initiative campaign
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.200]  Mike has traveled extensively to speak with 9-11 truth activists about his
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:27.200]  effort they've now launched or about to launch 9-1-1 cc.org or 9-1-1 cc.org
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:31.240]  it'll get you there both ways or Mike Revelle.us you can link over to the
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.760]  other site that way they got a very exciting initiative to call for a new
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:42.080]  investigation of 9-11 and again 9-11 whether you think it's an inside job or
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.000]  not whether you buy the fairy tales or not the Santa Claus is real and the rest
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.560]  of it the building 7 could fall and it's on that passports could survive and be
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.240]  found that day I mean all of this craziness you cannot deny it's been
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.520]  used against the American people the Patriot Act is used thousands of times
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.360]  a year per state admittedly and non-terror related domestic disputes
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  marijuana that that that our republic is dying and 9-11 is a stake that they're
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.640]  trying to basically you know crucify us with they're killing us with this
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.880]  system and so the the idea I see these people on my website saying if you don't
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.000]  like the TSA don't fly well they admit they're going on the streets of America
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.480]  I mean they're going into high school proms I mean it's it's it's incredible
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.520]  that all of this is happening and and so we've got to expose the fraud the myth
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:37.600]  the fable the religion of 9-11 the idea that government is going to protect you
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.040]  from real terror attacks provocateur terror attacks stage terror attacks
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.520]  manufactured synthetic there's always different forms of terror attacks and
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.200]  that's why we've got to expose the big lie of 9-11 that's launched all these
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.840]  wars they said Saddam did it you know that I mean it just it's it's it's
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.800]  ongoing senator Gravel thank you for joining us today to announce this new
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:06.120]  initiative well thank you for having me big and giving us an audience that's
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:12.520]  attuned to conspiracy theories and and really doesn't buy necessarily what the
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:20.040]  government has put out we you know even even the people in the commission that
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:25.360]  was appointed by Bush admitted that they were designed to fail they didn't have
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.520]  enough money they didn't have enough time and several members that called it a
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.840]  fraud we need to know what's going on as you pointed out in your lead up here we
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.400]  have probably with the most significant event in the last hundred years
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.600]  affecting our history our survival as a democracy and and it needs to be
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:53.680]  investigated we need to know what really happened leading up to 9-11 what
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:59.000]  happened on 9-11 and what happened in the aftermath of 9-11 and we don't know
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.120]  that we do know that over the last nine years almost ten years now that as
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.000]  private citizens on their own initiative have gone out and done unbelievable
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.440]  research scientific research analysis and and really that information that
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.840]  knowledge those data that data indicates that there is just something askew and
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.780]  what really happened and we need to know it now we're not saying that this
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:34.200]  party or that party are the guilty parties what we're saying is the facts
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:40.200]  do not add up at this point in time and it's in our national interest to
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.480]  investigate the situation to determine what really did happen and if there were
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.080]  other people involved in criminality but we don't know that yet we just know that
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.040]  it doesn't add up right now well I had and this is important because it shows
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.200]  the the the people's tactics they're going to be used the folks that want to
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.880]  suppress inquiry investigation transparency the BBC came here to
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.200]  interview me and I and I had agreed to the interview but then forgot about it
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.200]  months later they showed up and I was kind of blindsided by it and once I was
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:21.680]  in the interview the the individual interviewing me just kept giggling and I
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.080]  would say well do you think passports can magically come out of the fireball in
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.960]  the plane and be found in all the bedlam and he giggled and said yes I do and it
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.200]  was real funny so I mean I was dealing with a real mercenary and then he said
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.480]  don't you want to you know to deny 9-11 truth don't you know it's dying don't you
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.840]  know it's been discredited when actually the opposites happened according to all
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.440]  the polls and the evidence and now I understand that they're going to people
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.640]  in the 9-11 truth movement who could clearly are cognitive dissidents folks
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.800]  that Cass Sunstein talked about infiltrators who basically are called
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.600]  up you know before the council to admit they're a witch and to denounce us and
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:07.320]  say that we're witches you know it's kind of like that thing from 500 years
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.160]  ago and you know he said you know do you want to renounce your 9-11 truth or
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.000]  ism you know everyone's renouncing it and it's kind of like everybody knows
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.120]  the moon is made of cheese everybody knows they found WMD's in Iraq so so
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.280]  so they're so desperate to prop up their fable their conspiracy theory that
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.680]  they're now going to incredible lengths and they've got all these us and in
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.640]  foreign specials the British specials BBC specials coming out where they
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.560]  announced you know that ding dong you know you know the evil witch of 9-11
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:46.640]  truth is dead and it shows how desperate they are senator and it's not
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:51.560]  working it's not working at all because I think any reasonable person looking at
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:59.160]  the situation can't quarrel with the having an investigation it is just so
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:04.040]  fundamental when when you don't have all the information having an
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.480]  investigation is just logical and that's really the the whole case that we
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:15.000]  make we're not we're not we're not defining a conspiracy we're just
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.080]  saying that there's enough questions that require an investigation and since
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.400]  the body politic my god the politicians are frightened of this and that they
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.320]  think it's a it's a poison pill for their own careers if they even step
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:37.520]  forward and and say something on it and so what we need is what we're doing which
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.680]  is beginning to take ordinary citizens and bring them to the floor and pressing
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.160]  for this investigation we're gonna talk about the new initiative but people tend
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.480]  to forget now coming up just a few months away three months away now or
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:16:00.040]  less ten year anniversary that six of the 10 9-11 commissioners say that it was
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.080]  either a complete fraud in the lie and a criminal cover-up by the quote Pentagon
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.840]  and White House or a partial cover-up in the aftermath of the three lawyers two
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.560]  of the lawyers farmer and others have come out and said it's a criminal cover
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.120]  up Cheney and Bush testified not on the road but in secret I mean it's just
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:23.760]  goes on on folks forget the commission itself after the fact came out and said
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.480]  it was a fraud because they know later the truth's gonna come out and they had
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.960]  pangs of conscience that's that's accurate Alex and that alone to get all
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:39.120]  the other data though like with respect to building seven and all of that but
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.680]  that alone requires a new investigation and without going into any
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.720]  conspiracies we're just saying that the people who were charged with
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.400]  investigating it have said we didn't do the job and and and and they've said
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.200]  even worse as you pointed out so how could anybody question that the
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:05.440]  efficacy of going forth with not asking the government because we know will not
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.480]  get justice from the government but asking the people in various states do
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.080]  you want a new investigation and if they vote in the affirmative for the
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:20.880]  initiative then a body comes into being a citizen's commission comes into being
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.120]  which then other states by initiative or resolution can tie into with a joint
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:34.280]  powers agreement and so we can broaden the geographic reach of of this
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.160]  commission right across the country even though we don't have it in federal law
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.760]  at a national level and by the way the feds are obviously very scared of this
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.160]  they tried to get a state investigation and then the city investigation in
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.320]  New York even though they had the signatures that the courts wouldn't
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.000]  let it come forward they are kicking and screaming they do not want independent
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.240]  investigations to draw attention to the complete nonsensical fairy tale you know
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.800]  forget because the media the corporate globalist media always says well you
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.440]  have all these different views and ideas because we don't know the truth we're
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.640]  investigating there's a whole sea of different ideas a lot of them have been
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.480]  proven to be operatives that go in to try to you know say ridiculous things that
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.320]  discredit real inquiry and we're seeing that's the new initiative with the BBC
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.920]  and I've been just confirmed some information this morning this blows me
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.040]  away we have to continue to collate the information the system is very scared
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.480]  and trying to rewrite history again back to their false narrative but it's not
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.920]  going to work no I don't think so and I think that this approach see it's an
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.840]  actionable approach what we've had within the 9 11 truth movement is
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.880]  essentially at the gathering of information and data what we're now
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:56.440]  doing is is taking this information and saying hey we need a legitimate
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.240]  investigation the government's not going to give it to us so we need to use the
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.960]  only tool at our disposal in which is exist in 24 states where people can
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.720]  make laws directly and so we're going to be using that whether California
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:18.960]  Oregon Massachusetts Colorado Alaska Arkansas we'll be using that vehicle to
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.360]  get the people to make the decision or ask the people to make the decision
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.520]  should an investigation go forward should we create a new commission now to do
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:35.960]  that Alex the rub is is will we be able to raise the monies nobody in the
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.800]  leadership role here is well endowed financially but will we be able to raise
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.640]  the contributions from ordinary citizens maybe a few angels to get this
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:53.840]  undertaking on its way and and get the information to the American people as to
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.440]  what they can do senator revel stay there let's come back and talk about the

[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:14.880]  former US senator Mike Ravel presidential candidate is our guest
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:18.000]  unfortunately have one more segment where they might look forward to having him
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.240]  up for full hour in the near future as this initiative launches so codify
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.400]  exactly the news site when it's launching what you plan to do with this
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:39.800]  new this new initiative what first off the site is 9-11 or just 9-11 cc.org
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:46.720]  and cc stands for the campaign committee and now what what the initiative
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:54.480]  does it it permits people to be able to vote for against creating a new
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.680]  commission they will be appointed by the board of directors of the campaign
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:09.480]  committee and that commission or that language will set up a transfer of the
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:16.000]  political jurisdiction in questions power grand jury powers to be able to
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.720]  subpoena to be able to put people under oath and to be able to provide a
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.440]  report of indictment that would be turned over to the jurisdiction in
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.920]  question now once we can get this initiative enacted into a single state
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:38.280]  or a number of states on a parallel fashion then other states will be able
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.480]  to buy initiative or buy a law of their legislative bodies join this
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:53.400]  commission and add their jurisdiction their grand jury powered jurisdiction to
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:59.840]  the commission and so if we start let's say with Oregon Alaska then Massachusetts
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.400]  and then California can tie into you got to look upon it as we're creating a
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:12.160]  bucket of powers grand jury powers and other states can decide to jump in and
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:19.400]  be part of that body of powers and not only states but local jurisdictions that
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.680]  have initiative powers like New York City and over 50 in the state of the
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.800]  Texas where they can buy by law is their legislative by the people with
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:36.880]  initiatives or their governments can choose to just join the effort and as
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.960]  people across the country realize what this commission can do there will be a
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:50.120]  lot of effort a lot of political power pushing legislators to join in this
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:57.120]  investigation and so it's a defacto national initiative that we're creating
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.960]  by filing it in various states now the success of being able to do this is all
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.920]  dependent upon can we raise the money from ordinary citizens who put up ten
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.760]  dollars twenty dollars hundred dollars that will permit us to fund this
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.920]  undertaking and the funding of the commission itself can come from the
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.760]  various jurisdictions across the country well I mean explain this to me because I
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.640]  think it's a good idea to have investigations and have grand juries be
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.560]  contacted or have state commissions or even city commissions because of a
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.480]  city lost any of its citizens it can do it New York obviously would be the you
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.720]  know ideal place that's been tried they got the signatures but it was blocked
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.800]  even though you know the law said they should have done it but I mean what
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.640]  about an initiative just to get it on referendums in states to have a state
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.000]  have a commission because I mean in law because I know you're a former US
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.040]  senator you know a lot so explain to me how are you going to get states to say
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.040]  yes we're down going you know past this resolution now we're going to bring in
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.720]  this you know you know this commission you know that you guys have created or
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.640]  or is your commission more of an advisory movement to get the state to set up
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:19.160]  its own commission no god no it's not an advisory and this is real what what we
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.760]  do is by passing an initiative in any one state let's say we pass it in Oregon
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:28.720]  where it takes less takes less than a hundred thousand people to vote for it if
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:35.200]  the people vote to create this commission any other states by initiative or by
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.640]  law enacted through their legislatures can join that commission once it's in
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.840]  existence and that's what we'll have in the constitutional lawyer lawyers say
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.600]  this this passes muster this will I mean yeah that's for sure in fact it's a
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.440]  takeoff on what we had historically you remember the terminology a runaway
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.040]  grand jury well what has happened was before the government covered his
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:06.640]  backside by changing the law people could form a grand jury and go ahead and
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.880]  investigate well they were investigating the criminality of a
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.800]  government and so this was so threatening that the law was changed now I
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.720]  understand that's why they've turned juries and grand juries into kept
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.000]  creatures of the prosecution well senator revelle we're definitely gonna
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.840]  have to get you back up in the near future this initiative is I guess being
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.920]  launched right now the site's up it looks great and if folks want to find out

[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:55.040]  Dominic Strauss con situation with him before I get into some of the other
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:02.960]  news let me just hit that right now Strauss con case seen as near collapse
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:10.080]  and when this first happened I said look cons bad guy for his policies world
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.480]  government world carbon taxes globalist of that you know corrupt
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.760]  parasitical globalist ruling class but I went on and said you can get away with
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:27.360]  murder in France in their city like Paris or New York in the US you and
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.920]  diplomats get caught with sex slaves chained up murdering people Bill Clinton
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.360]  raping women one after the other and settling with them and first thing it
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.000]  wasn't true that he rapes him and bites him and he's protected so why are they
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.400]  normally protected over and over again but in the head of the IMF Dominic
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:55.800]  Strauss con started to agree that maybe they shouldn't bankrupt all the
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.000]  countries maybe they were going too fast maybe let's not break up the euro
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.200]  yet and that he was gonna run against our cozy he was above him in all the
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:11.400]  polls on average about 10 points set to run next year in the next election in
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:20.360]  France sarcosis a total globalist puppet and then con leaves checks out goes
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.800]  and eats hangs out with family in New York that we're visiting gets on a
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.760]  plane and they grab him off the plane and say he was running and things
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:36.520]  turn out that wasn't true but the biggest piece of evidence is this it's that the
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:41.960]  chief political strategist for sarcosis his Carl Rove his David Gergen admitted
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:49.640]  in the LaFigaro BBC he said you know they called and said you twittered more
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:56.000]  than 30 minutes before it was he was even arrested you twittered that he had
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:03.320]  raped a woman or tried to rape a woman and was going to be or had been
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:06.480]  arrested how did you know that and then we turned out start one of sarcosis
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.640]  aids did it as well two different twitters to the media alerting them to
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.120]  make sure the story was spun the way they wanted and they said well we had
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:21.200]  spies in the hotel watching him I mean oh wow you knew this supposedly happened
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.440]  because you had spies following him oh you're not setting him up you just have
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.560]  spies following him well now the New York Times is reporting Strauss-Kahn case
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:35.400]  seen as near collapse and this is the New York Times the sexual assault case
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.240]  against Dominic Strauss-Kahn is on the verge of collapse as investigators have
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.920]  uncovered major holes in the credibility of the housekeeper who charged
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.840]  that he attacked her in the Manhattan hotel suite in May according to two
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.720]  well-placed law enforcement officials this is a guy who was staying in a
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:58.520]  $4,000 a night hotel room this is a guy who flies around on private jets
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:05.560]  everywhere where French Airways keeps a seat open for him on every flight to
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.560]  and from France on all their major planes all their major flights there's a
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:18.800]  seat just for Dominic Strauss-Kahn DSK and he can have you know any women he
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.000]  wants he reportedly did with a French reporter what eight years ago say oh
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.520]  you're so beautiful and start you know saying I want you like Pepe Le Pew you
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:31.920]  know and grabbing at her which which is terrible unless you're a TSA agent then
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:39.200]  it's security so the issue here is whether he did it or not now first it
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.920]  was raped then it was he grabbed on her well Al Gore the woman reportedly saved
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:48.920]  the DNA they're understood in that she described him like a sex crazed poodle and
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.320]  then when she wouldn't have the relations he just ran over like a dog I
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.400]  don't want to get into what dogs do but you know what they do that's why she had
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.320]  the DNA on her and just pinned her and just basically well you know what people
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:06.800]  do like a dog quote quote crazed sex poodle and you notice that guy swept
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.840]  in the rug so whether he did it or not why have they decided to go after him
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.160]  when normally Bill Clinton can bite women that's how he dominates him he bites
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:21.400]  their lips bites their nose that's a specialty really hard bleeding like a
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.560]  wild animal kind of like you're in a bear trap you know grabs your nose and
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.400]  then you know does what he does I mean that's what Ted Bundy would do as well
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.920]  very very nice people so I asked the question of why is this happening why
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:43.120]  is this why is this going on now continuing here with this article
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.000]  although forensic test found unambiguous evidence of sexual encounter
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  between mr. Strauss con and French politician the woman prosecutors now
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.840]  do not believe much of what the accuser has told them about the circumstances or
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:00.840]  about himself or or did he really do it and now they're they just did this to
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.720]  get him out of the IMF job and kind of discredit him and now they're gonna drop
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.160]  it I mean we don't know the point is there's all sorts of foul play going on
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:16.800]  here continuing here since her initial allegation on May 14th the accuser has
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.240]  repeatedly lied one of the law enforcement officials said by the way
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.880]  the toll-free number to join us to talk about any of these issues I've raised so
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:32.760]  far today is 1-800-259-9231-1800 259-9231 we'll get you up and on the
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.920]  air I said we're gonna take calls and I forget to give the number out 800-259-9231
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:44.480]  we'll get you here on the transmission today continuing senior prosecutors met
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.640]  with lawyers from Strauss con on Thursday and provided details about their
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:54.360]  findings and the parties are discussing whether to dismiss the felony charges
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.840]  among the discoveries one of the officials said are varying issues
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.240]  involving the asylum application a 32-year-old housekeeper who is from
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:07.480]  Africa Guyana and possible links to people involved in criminal activities
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:13.080]  including drug smuggling and money laundering oh she's mob connected and
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.840]  and then magically there's there's Sarkozy French spies in the building and
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.200]  then this happens open but but but because there was one reported groping
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:30.800]  maybe that's called rape now they have a bill in the legislature of New York that
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.200]  all hotel workers have to wear an emergency beacon because there might be
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.200]  rapist somewhere that's like the TSA well terrorist hit us and instead of just
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:46.840]  arming the pilots I mean do you really believe on planes that had a 22%
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:52.880]  occupancy was the average that you know dozens of men on board that a guy's got
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.240]  up with box cutters everybody kissed I mean ladies and gentlemen I'm not
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.280]  aggressing I'm sorry somebody gets up with box cutters and says I'm hijacking
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:08.440]  this plane a major can of tyrannosaurus rex is gonna get opened and I'm and
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:12.360]  folks I've had my you know what what plenty of times by people a lot tougher
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.320]  look I'm telling you right now you get in the fight with an average man I mean
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:25.480]  they are going to stomp the living daylights out of you when someone is
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.680]  being oppressed they have the power when someone attacks you you've got the
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:36.360]  power a few times I got in fights where I wasn't a hundred percent right and in
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:43.440]  the right I had no power I couldn't black out and tear people to pieces but
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.880]  I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen I don't think New Yorkers and people up there
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.960]  are a bunch of wimps I've been in New York a lot the people aren't wimps up
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.960]  there they're ready to get in a fight like anybody else I don't believe people
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:58.640]  from the East Coast laid down like this I don't believe it including military
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.600]  veterans that were on board those aircraft see I'm now digressing I don't
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.920]  believe it it's all fraud it's ridiculous but sorry the point is do you
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:11.760]  really believe that that people with with with box cutters did this and then
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.200]  now we've got to have the TSA doing this nationwide now they're saying if
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.080]  there's ever a shooting at a mall which are looking for patsies and mentally ill
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.520]  people to do it if they advertise enough there's gonna be shooting shoot-ups in
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.600]  malls crazies are gonna do it we got to have TSA outside every mall and they're
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.160]  gonna attack schools gotta have takeover police-stated schools now happen and
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.080]  there's gonna be a tax on the highways gotta have that there and there's gonna
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:38.320]  be a tax at the supermarket gotta have I mean it just it never ends and then we
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.460]  have the government with an armed camp to keep us safe but they're really the
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:46.280]  ones taking our rights robbing us and the tyranny is set up in their own
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.240]  documents for we the people so I see that's how my brain works I get into
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.160]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the fact that she's mafia connected the police are
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:00.000]  reporting and the cops must be completely freaked out by this because
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.800]  obviously higher-ups Bloomberg said go ahead with the prosecution that's how
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.760]  compartmentalization works not like all the cops are evil but it's go ahead with
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.400]  the prosecution we've got the witness throw the bookheading the cops are like
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.480]  well here she is we're gonna go ahead and go along with it and then now the
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.640]  cops start burrowing deeper into it and they're now going oh it looks bad looks
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:29.920]  looks like a setup that's why well continuing here prosecutors and
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.320]  defense lawyers will return to state Superior Court in Manhattan today if we
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.080]  need to continue to follow this and see the latest on con let's let's let's
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.240]  search engine Strauss-Kahn see the latest when Justice Michael J. Obus is
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.400]  expected to consider easing the extraordinary male conditions that he
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.080]  imposed on Mr. Strauss-Kahn in the days after he was charged indeed Mr. Strauss
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.200]  Kahn could be released on his own recognizance and freed from house arrest
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:55.200]  reflecting the likelihood that the serious charges against him will not be
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.440]  sustained and it just goes on I got another one here made to accuse DSK of
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:05.400]  sexual assault repeatedly lied sorts of saying again she's told hey you got HIV
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.320]  they were also reporting that and then we don't know that's true and you want
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.360]  to stay in the US you're connected to all these groups you're gonna get the
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.640]  stage just get into his room and they insert him into the room and the rest
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:20.280]  is history or her into the room and the rest is history and then the enemy of
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:24.640]  sarcastic is removed and they get an even more globalist globalist because he
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:29.480]  had been criticizing the total implosion of society he had been doing
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.080]  this so I'm done talking about that there it is Strauss Kahn house arrest
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.360]  ends that's in the Wall Street Journal and if we scroll down there please I'll
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:48.160]  be able to read that but we now know that his reported house arrest ends here
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:59.520]  I could just pull it up right here Dominique Strauss Kahn I could find it
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:06.840]  out right here and read it click news I just didn't come up can you guys put
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.720]  that article back up and just scroll up a little bit because I want to I want to
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.360]  see what's going on with this breaking right now for some reason I put that in
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:21.200]  and the way the system works there it is former international monetary fund
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.120]  leader Dominique Strauss Kahn was released from house arrest Friday in
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.840]  new revelations about his accuser you know led sexual assault but criminal
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.280]  charges weren't dismissed so that did happen at the court hearing assisted
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:40.240]  district attorney said prosecutors consented to charges to his changes to
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.720]  his bail conditions because of their view and strength of charges against
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.560]  Mr. Strauss Kahn has changed well there you go ladies and gentlemen now the
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.920]  French are saying you know he's gonna win even bigger you better not get on
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:56.360]  any airplanes or the Sarkozy isn't gonna stop there okay let's go ahead and go
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.720]  to phone calls here let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida Steve you're
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.640]  on the air yeah hey Alex two things I'd like to bring up real quick number one
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:14.080]  since you had to send around about the 9-11 reinvestigation Dan Patrick
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.960]  senator in Texas there you know I live in Houston I lived in Texas for 14 and
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:23.840]  a half years before I moved here to Florida but you know two years ago I
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:28.760]  called his shell on the anniversary of 9-11 of the 8th anniversary and I'm
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:34.320]  glad he's calling out the corrupt government there in Austin however I
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:40.080]  would like to see you call him out because the thing is is that when I
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:46.520]  tried to talk about 9-11 being inside job he totally shut me down took the
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.000]  part told the party line of the neocons and so while I'm glad that he's taking
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.160]  this kind of stand I still have my doubts about his credibility as one that's
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.080]  for the people in the office that he's been because of the fact that you will
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:07.240]  not come out I mean I'll be honest I mean I mean I'll be honest with you you're
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:11.720]  talking about state senator Dan Patrick here in Texas right yeah I mean I mean
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:15.480]  we they didn't do a special session we should pressure Perry to bring another
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:20.960]  one back and they even killed their whitewash bills and so he Dan Patrick
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.240]  isn't even on the radar screen I know he was a radio talk show host before
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:29.160]  becoming a state senator and now he's extremely prominent but I mean in the
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:35.160]  whole scope of the world he's a nobody and but I mean yeah I mean of course I
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.960]  call out anybody who buys into the whole fairy tale because how do you
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.080]  criticize the TSA groping well what do you expect from a government that
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.400]  criminal elements in it stage the 9-11 attacks I mean the hijackers on record
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.400]  were trained at US bases Newsweek Associated Press you know the FBI
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.080]  magically found passports that day totally made up in the rubble I mean
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.280]  does anyone believe that they ordered a stand-down of NORAD I mean the list goes
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.400]  on and on we don't know exactly what happened but we know there's cops saying
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.200]  get back they're gonna blow up seven and the news said they building seven has
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.360]  fallen its own footprint they cut to it it's still standing there because they
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:16.200]  had that report ready to get out their story and they jumped the gun and so I
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:20.000]  mean I totally hear what you're saying Stephen but I mean you know at the end
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.600]  of the day Dan Patrick give me a break I mean he's a state senator from Texas
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.920]  on and he's been groped and others have been groped and other members of the
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.240]  House instead of been grubbed so they're mad about it these guys fly a lot it's
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:36.720]  like hey this is the tyranny you wanted you want to believe fairy tales you're
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:40.080]  gonna get jackboots sticking their hands down your pants your wife and daughters
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:44.680]  are gonna be felt up by you know pedos as they call them and so you know Dan
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.760]  Patrick will wake up later when America's totally you know just Nazi
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.840]  Germany on steroids that's what we got to plant the seeds now a lot of folks are
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.040]  gonna listen now they're gonna listen later when the pain come we'll be right

[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:14.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:19.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:39.720]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.840]  I'm doing well how are you doing sir all right I was just on the prison
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.680]  planet forums and I was talking about the Greens Party in Australia their
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.760]  leader Bob Brown just called for a globalist government and if you go to
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:26.400]  the home page for the Greens Party in Australia they say their justification
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.760]  for wanting global government is for human rights but I'll just uncover it
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:35.280]  that all these outlaw motorcycle gang law hype in Australia because we don't
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:40.040]  have enough terrorists so we demonize the hell angels and make these crime of
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:45.000]  association gang laws well anyway the pit the very fourth force driving those
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.120]  laws is the United Nations and this particular charter affects America to the
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:56.760]  United Nations charter against transnational organized crime article
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:02.560]  five criminalization of participation in a criminal group that's what I mean I
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:06.960]  know suddenly all over the world the answer to any problems is a private
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:10.960]  corporate global government Time Magazine Newsweek Financial Times Wall
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:15.520]  Street Journal but separately though they call for a private global corporate
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:22.080]  government that we all pay carbon taxes to and a global agenda 21 under the 10
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:27.360]  regions of the world with 10 sub regions per region under the rural council the
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.120]  global food council the governor's councils when we're now going under
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:36.080]  official UN treaty world government Ronald Reagan warned about it the 64 I
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.480]  just saw an incredible clip we played last hour I can't believe I never saw
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.680]  that about that plan I knew about the plan from Bernadine Smith she sent me
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:49.000]  news articles over a decade ago from like the LA Times and things where the
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.960]  plan had been discussed but I know Reagan had spoken out against it and but
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.760]  again separately though the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center mainstream media
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:02.880]  says we're crazy and Herman von Roompi the head of the EU calling for global
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.440]  government the new prime minister of England calling for it the last guy
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.560]  none of that exists though we're going under corporate global government now
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.360]  let me I just googled Paul Brown you know head of Australia calls for world
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.880]  government and I didn't find it I believe you because I've seen him call for it
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:25.680]  before I guess I go to prisonplanet.com then click on the prisonplanet.com
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:32.200]  forum and then I'll try to find it what section of the forum is it international
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:36.440]  news in the main section actually I'm going to come to what it's about so
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.520]  basically the Greens say they're for human rights on this crap but this
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:45.960]  particular law before it can be passed in Victoria and that's their plan they
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.520]  have to destroy the closest thing Australia has to the Bill of Rights
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.880]  which prohibits crime of association so because the UN says we have to delete
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:01.480]  the Victorian human rights and responsibilities charter 2006 so this
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:06.040]  this new gang laws the UN is pushing can be put in so if we do what the Greens
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:13.120]  say we are destroying our own human rights Bill of Rights like legislation in
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:18.240]  Victoria so this has proved the Greens are against human rights and I just want
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:23.320]  to go on to talk about the very first outlaw motorcycle gang law in Australia
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:28.240]  because it's just been used against an 18 year old Aboriginal boy or Facebook
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.760]  one-liner all he said was a police officer was gay and he's just been
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:37.600]  charged with 60 C crimes actors. Oh yeah now all over the world they've got
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:50.160]  thought crime speech crime tyranny. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:55.800]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:59.920]  important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:03.760]  everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your

[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:19.640]  and America's biggest small-owner general growth properties. In fact Barron's
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:23.880]  called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:27.240]  watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:31.360]  yet and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least

[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:15.280]  Aboriginal boy by gay police officer I know it's the shocking claim but Google
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:20.040]  backs it up ABC News backs it up the New South Wales police own press release
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:23.600]  backs it up yeah well this is the best way then because I'm on there and I can't

[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:35.960]  okay Australia's first gang law 60c used against 18-year-old Aboriginal boy okay
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:42.760]  it's on the it's on the international section now 60c Crimes Act is the crime
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:48.280]  of obtaining true personal information Google case shows this Aboriginal boy
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.240]  made a one-line comment on Facebook about a police officer's sexuality if he
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.120]  lied he would be charged with public defamation but if you actually know the
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.960]  police officer is gay you can get five years jail for obtaining true personal
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:06.120]  information and actually I was on the another radio show in the US the Kim
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:09.360]  Commando show and she will went all constitutional and said this could never
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.280]  happen in America because I found I found I found the mainstream news articles
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.200]  want to look into this again again this is what they do first in Europe they
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.680]  said you can't be a Nazi or you're arrested then you can't criticize
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.240]  government then you can't Robin Page who isn't even political said rural
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:31.640]  communities to serve the same rights as gays and Muslims and homosexuals and
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:35.760]  Muslims and they said the word homosexual was now insulting even though
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.640]  it's like saying hetero homo homosexual it's just a name it's a
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:45.280]  scientific name he was arrested BBC reporter and so this is the thought
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.480]  crime and this is what they're now teaching in our public schools here
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:54.200]  getting us ready for it and just incredible I'll have to look more into
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:59.280]  this but yes I have the ABC news story out of Australia and they're reporting
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.160]  it with a straight face and again if you call someone heterosexual you don't get
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:08.560]  five years in prison it's it's it's that's what hate crimes are it's special
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:15.640]  special it's special rights it's like you are gay you are the supreme ruler and
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:19.360]  and and and we must send our children to public school and you will teach them
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.880]  we're like but I don't want my five-year-old being taught about any
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:26.360]  type of sex shut up homophobe we're arresting you swat team get a battle
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.480]  force and I mean this is the new America this is the new England this is the
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:35.800]  new they're trying it in the US Canada they arrest you similarly sir this is
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.000]  incredible I'm glad you got it on the show holy mackerel somebody on a
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.560]  Facebook some kid just made a joke about about you know some websites I mean
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:54.040]  don't let hate dictate embrace diversity and so the guy made a comment
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:58.280]  about it just an off-handed thing and he's going to jail I mean boy I tell you
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:03.200]  Australia whoo evil this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:07.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.680]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:19.600]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:24.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:28.200]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:39.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:43.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:46.760]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.320]  what tyranny is going to look like we're gonna play this Ronald Reagan clip in a
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:24.240]  moment look at England look at Australia look at Canada I see the reports
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:30.000]  constantly where a BBC reporter Robin Page host of one man his dog is actually
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.120]  pretty liberal in a speech said they're shutting down our farms they're
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:41.360]  they're banning hunting we need the same rights for the culture of rural people
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:46.280]  as Muslims and homosexuals and they arrested him and said we have got
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:52.320]  committee of people who decide what's hate and the word homosexual is that so
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:58.160]  I guess if I call my dog a canine it's hateful to dogs or if I call a frog a
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:04.360]  reptile or if I say I'm a heterosexual I should then be arrested or if I call
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:11.360]  the Sun a you know gaseous combustion system it's it's it's it's
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:17.480]  sonophobic or I call a television an old-fashioned television a cathol ray
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:24.560]  tube display device arrest arrest but I mean let's say you called someone
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:27.840]  horrible names let's say you called someone who was gay their derogative
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:36.040]  terms free speech but see all of the quote protected groups who then are
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:41.440]  put into special guilds and government they can do whatever they want to you but
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:47.400]  you you and I mean my wife has women come up to her in the grocery store that's
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:49.760]  why she wanted to move out of Austin it doesn't happen where we live now in the
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.960]  country nice people and women will come up at Whole Foods and go you've got three
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:59.160]  children and I mean this actually happens of course they're totally unhappy by
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.720]  the time they're 45 and desperately trying to have them these poor women but
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.480]  but I mean it is a hatred of life and you go to the Whole Foods counter and
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.080]  it's like how to live austerely it's so cool to live under austerity it's good
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:16.880]  we're getting poor I've shown you the magazines oh the bankers it's an idea of
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:23.640]  of being poor being great being a schmuck being conned and here it is the
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.120]  caller called us about and sure enough teen charged overport
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:36.040]  Macquarie police Facebook harassment and this is ABC News Australia a port

[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.360]  site police say last month 18 year old allegedly created a Facebook title all
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:55.120]  port Macquarie police are corrupt oh actually and we have screenshots of the
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.440]  evil site on the prison planet forum we have it saves you can see the crime
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:05.760]  local police say it named a couple of officers the page has been taken down so
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:09.760]  actually reading deeper it's saying they're corrupt boom you don't film in
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:13.120]  your front yard America you don't call him corrupt but then they also charged
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:17.760]  him for saying you know look at this photo of the police together I mean what
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.920]  are they all yeah I mean oh my gosh well they'll show him won't they have spent
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:25.800]  some time the taxpayers are gonna pay they've already taken the Aussies guns
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.280]  they killed crocodile Dundee the real crocodile Dundee wouldn't hurt his guns
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:32.400]  and they swat team he murdered him hardcore he was killed like 12 years
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:36.200]  ago yeah even in our era about that I've got the original magazine I was
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.640]  digging through files few months country ran into a minute meant to take it in
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.800]  here they showed him didn't they that country belongs to them of course the
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:46.760]  their government's totally sold out the communist Chinese I also see here yes
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.880]  they're there their their prime ministers call for world government but it
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.680]  doesn't exist and government says if you talk about it you're probably a
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.120]  terrorist the team has been charged with obtaining personal information about the
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:01.600]  police officer for the purpose of harassment it turns out they got public
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:05.160]  because we've got the big write-up on prison planet public stuff that they put
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:09.160]  out and they said look at this person you know and oh nope don't do that you're
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:13.840]  going to jail police say there were some positive comments about them on the page
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:20.080]  oh that's that's not allowed either the young man is due in court August 8th so
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:25.360]  he'll he'll stay in jail until then that's good so I mean actually the gay
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:28.400]  part was only part of it he said they were corrupt and that's a form of
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.760]  harassment so he's been dealt with now immediately now we're going to Bob
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:35.960]  Chapman I want to take on this first because it's something I covered in the
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.880]  first hour but I want to get his take on it we're gonna go back to your calls as
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:45.120]  well but Bob Chapman former intelligence officer biggest private
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:50.880]  silver and gold broker helped do the Gary Allen report now his son of course
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.920]  runs Politico Gary Allen son but a preeminent guy fighting tyranny for
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:58.920]  50 years and has had to course leave the United States due to harassment so he
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.280]  can live to fight another day joining us from undisclosed location joining us
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:07.080]  here in a moment but President Obama's executive order 13 575 creates rural
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:11.880]  councils and and so you won't believe me two weeks ago when I talked about this
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:16.160]  or 16 years ago when I talked about Jenna 21 even though I'm going under it
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.400]  in Austin doubling the power prices raping everything home inspections total
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.560]  harassment big globalist groups above the law given waivers but it's happening
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.560]  but but here's Ronald Reagan in 64 in 64 talking about what the Agriculture
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:35.120]  Department was trying to do then and the Agriculture Department statement is get
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:39.840]  beggar get out their policy is to shut down small farms they have the premises
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:46.800]  ID the animal ID they have the they tried to pass the safe food safety act
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:51.560]  because big pharma owned big agra as always it's a big con by their own
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:55.640]  merged they have 17 million in one week last November try to pass that to
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:59.520]  openly shut down all the small farms and ranches with incredible you know ten
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.200]  dollars in regulation with chips tags on a five dollar chicken just total
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:08.080]  bankruptcy but then Tyson the rest are exempt that's just one example just the
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.840]  end of it all now the IRS already doesn't let you ride off your hobby farm
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.600]  you keep a family farm a family ranch you try to run cattle to get the state
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.920]  tax exemption because you couldn't pay if it wasn't there with the property tax
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.160]  and then you run the cattle you pretty much lose money having them but you got
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.120]  to have them there to be able to have the tax exempt and they come in now to my
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:32.320]  family and they say you're not getting that you're not you don't get to you know
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:36.520]  it's a hobby it's got to be profitable or you're out but then you just how it's
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:41.000]  incredible most small farms and ranches they work at the feed store they work at
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.560]  the prison or they work at the power company or they work you know delivering
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.680]  mail on a route I know all the other truck drivers and then they take care of
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:51.600]  their cows and they get home at seven o'clock at night or they take care of
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:55.360]  their sheep or their crops it's all over and they're gonna have the
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.720]  receivership arm come in with federal help so they can have the federal busy
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:03.240]  bodies there to organize and con everybody and don't worry America's
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.840]  going down you wanted America you want Terry you're getting it here's Ronald
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:10.920]  Reagan talking about it you'll find that they've also asked for the right to
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.640]  imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:19.840]  the secretary of agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:24.320]  condemnation and resell them to other individuals and contained in that same
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:28.400]  program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:34.360]  two million farmers from the soil if you live in the heartland of America you
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:38.280]  have to listen up while the nation was distracted with the Anthony Weiner
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.640]  drama president Obama signed an executive order that will seize greater
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:47.880]  power over food fiber and energy stop right there and they go with executive
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:53.560]  order homeland security spy brigades local homeland security offices
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:58.840]  department of defense offices they're gonna help you meanwhile the rest of the
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:04.800]  story find my stack here it is the rest of the story breaks down that they
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:09.960]  during the winter let all these highland lakes mountain lakes where all these
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:15.680]  major floods are having as change their policy flood everyone they let it build
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:21.160]  up and then knowing the snow melt would come when releasing it all at once and
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.480]  they are openly trying to force folks off their land I read this in the first
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:31.160]  hour and bragging that it's good to get people off of their land and so now
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:35.080]  they're not fixing the dams they're they're they're not building ones they're
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:38.520]  tearing them down but they use the existing dams to build it up and then
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:43.240]  floods you and they were advised on this they knew it was coming and now
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:46.720]  they're gonna take the property Bob Chapman I tell you it is just getting
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:51.560]  crazier and crazier you wrote about agenda 21 back in 1992 when they first
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:55.480]  rammed it through and Maury Strong said we're going to bankrupt the West that
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:59.080]  is our goal and that is their goal and the average person just can't admit it's
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:06.800]  this bad you're absolutely correct and it's been an evolving process something
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:12.880]  that's been very subtle didn't show its head the way it has until just recently
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:22.880]  reminds me of 666 the agglomeration of cities into regions and and that's
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:29.360]  coming next I'm sure and you know that was written about 50 years ago and so
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:36.200]  these people got a lot of patience and they're putting into operation what they
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:44.440]  want to put in it reminds me of the years between 1934 and 1939 in Germany
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:50.880]  they did all these kinds of things but today they're so much more advanced than
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:59.920]  they were then that was a experiment learning curve I firmly believe that the
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.960]  situation that existed and was financed the way it was in Germany during the
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:12.080]  1930s and before that actually was a trial run for what we're seeing today and
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.880]  proof of that you look at the amalgamation of Western and Eastern
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:26.000]  Germany some 15 years ago and you'll see that all of the people who were
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:34.440]  involved in spying on both sides and the Stasi were never prosecuted for
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:41.640]  anything it was incredible I mean intelligence organizations spent years
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:49.000]  and years spying on the Russians and the East Germans and for the same kinds of
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.240]  things and if you remember Alex it wasn't all that long ago then they had
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:19:00.360]  Marcus Wolf and some of the other people who were involved in Stasi and in the
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:11.400]  KGB in America with the State Department and they were under contract to teach
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:18.000]  Americans in that Americans in that sphere how to do that in how to set up
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.200]  spying systems which you've mentioned well Bob we're going to break but I mean
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:26.960]  this is so diabolical he sets up Bush starts Obama continues the 10 governor
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.480]  councils so he can ignore the states under FEMA has 10 kept minion governors
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:35.560]  that now run the 10 regions they set up as they've done in other countries this
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:40.800]  rural affairs office where they admit now you're going to have the Department
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:46.240]  of Defense and the feds running around in your cornfields I mean stay there Bob
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:55.880]  it is so hellish people have no idea how much trouble we are in we are being
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:02.400]  occupied just like Iraq or Libya or any of these countries where can you find a

[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.880]  leaders calling for it but I did find the Australian Prime Minister calling for
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:20.160]  global government and then they've got the green parties when you click on it
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:26.560]  greens.org.au I'm gonna get Watson or Kerr somebody do an article on this it
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:33.120]  says global governance and it's got the path to world government it's got how
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.840]  great the international criminal court is how great the UN is that all nations
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:42.400]  must accept the criminal court and the UN invasion armies for peace I mean this
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:48.480]  is they come in they fund a group to uprise and then the UN invades you and
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.000]  it's all happening and of course they put Obama in and gave him a peace prize
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.920]  that's all part of the joke it's all part of the it is peace that's what
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:59.840]  Obama keeps saying he said and his speech a couple days ago we played the
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:03.560]  clip yesterday said I don't need to talk to Congress this isn't war this is
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:10.480]  peace and he actually said that he said this is peace this is peace Bob
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:15.840]  Chapman they are just it's happening the world government's here
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.960]  well they're going forward like it was here and they want it to be here and
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:28.520]  they're making it be here and all the earmarks are there and you know Australia
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:35.440]  has been one of the leading places obeying the orders of the new world
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.840]  order and which is rather such a surprising I didn't think that they in
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:47.800]  years past would be but they are we carry on Australian section in our
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:51.560]  international forecaster we have a lot of news coming out of there we have
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:57.960]  several good sources there and they've got some pretty good coverage through the
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:04.720]  media there that you are still be able to pick something up that's useful but
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:11.720]  we're going to see this all over the world it's part of a larger plan and
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:17.000]  they're ready to go on it and they're pushing it and they the people who are
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.120]  involved are coming right out and saying yes we have to have a new world order and
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:24.920]  you're going to hear more and more of them and they're trying to condition you
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:30.960]  to think that maybe that's good and then it's better than being unemployed but
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:35.080]  then I still even go on mainline Republican shows and they still go
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:37.760]  you're a conspiracy terrorist you believe there's a group setting up world
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:41.320]  government and they're like all over the news saying that's the answer to
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:45.280]  everything but even some mainline conservative talk show host still can't
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:49.640]  wake up because they remember the 30 years past where you're not supposed to
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:53.680]  talk about it because it doesn't exist so as that I mean it's like somebody who's
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:59.200]  been told trains don't exist trains don't exist if you ever see one coming at
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.520]  you it's imaginary your schizophrenic and so somebody sees a train coming they
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.280]  just walk out in front of it and it's like it's going 70 miles an hour it's
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:11.240]  rumbling they're honking they're trying to slam their brakes on and you're just
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:18.160]  going it's not a train it's not a train I mean this is mind control absolutely
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:26.480]  mind control and in its present form it's been refined greatly the major
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:31.640]  media uses it all the time that's why so many of these people get hooked and then
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:37.720]  they get sucked in and then they get indoctrinated and then when we got a
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:42.120]  call of them tell them the truth they said gee that can't be true I mean I
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:47.400]  didn't see that anyplace else they are you sure and as you well know Alex that's
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:55.000]  the kind of thing we have to put up with and this Facebook thing with the young
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:03.640]  man and that's probably going to spread all over the world that kind of
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:10.160]  apprehension because you said what they figure is the wrong thing that's going
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:15.720]  to become more prevalent it'll be a way of scaring people into not talking
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:21.480]  about anything it's getting insane what about Dominique Strauss-Kahn the New
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.560]  York Times they've released him from even home detention they say they may
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.920]  drop the charges that she's reportedly mafia connected and they admit the
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.200]  Sarkozy had intelligence people there in the building
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:43.040]  well you and I talked about this as it happened and we said that's probably
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:49.720]  what did happen and as we find out it is what happened the question is what are
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:57.000]  they going to do with this person this lady who made the false accusations
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:05.520]  and is she being interrogated as to why she did what she did and if she was
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:15.120]  directed to do so who directed her it's a good question well I've said it you
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:19.640]  know whitey bulger now that he's about to supposedly expose all the feds that
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:24.520]  ran him he might fall down a flight of stairs or hit his head and this lady you
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:29.720]  know I well she might end up like some of those Clinton people remember
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:36.920]  McDougal dying up in the jail cell in Dallas that's right and of course the
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:43.560]  one that his body was found there in Washington out on the lawn yeah he had
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.600]  the bullet hole in his head with no blood at the scene Vince Foster we'll be right
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:57.520]  back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio

[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:53.680]  into some of the other important news today dealing with the economy with Bob
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:34:01.240]  who's a real expert on that front I remember a few weeks ago a bunch of
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:05.200]  national media and of course red state and all these sites attacked us saying
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:11.960]  we were insane conspiracy theorist for even questioning that Rick Perry went to
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:15.560]  Bilderberg or that he would end up being the front-runner for president or that
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:20.920]  he was even running I mean that to be able to think and to have sources inside
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:24.840]  the governor's operation to have other sources around the country including
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:29.200]  national media to know that he gave a pledge he wouldn't run for president in
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:35.960]  2012 or 2012 and that he that we told you he would break the pledge because it
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:39.800]  was never a pledge it's all he's changing his mind it was always his
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:44.480]  intention this is Al Gore's former chief of staff in his campaign in Texas this is
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:50.080]  her president this is this is a guy Karl Rove got to flip to Republican this is a
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:53.720]  guy that's for force inoculations on record the only governor to publicly
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:59.320]  push it this is a guy who's for open borders in the past and been given
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.240]  awards by Vicente Fox for Sanctuary City you notice the Sanctuary City bill
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:08.880]  died he introduced his bills to kill them it's in Ron Paul agreed that's the
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:14.200]  tactic so a bit of a matter people like to be con so hey I understand
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:20.800]  it's fun Romney leads national poll but Perry debuts in second place and this is
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.440]  out of real clear politics well they already had polls showing he was in the
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:27.320]  second place and depending on the poll it's Ron Paul's number one number two
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.680]  and number three and Rick Perry now talks and acts like Ron Paul but he
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:36.520]  doesn't actually do what Ron Paul did what do you make of this Bob Chapman
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:43.280]  that the mainline Republican sites are very upset and even chastise the
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:47.360]  judge report for looking to our stories two weeks ago that that that we would
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:51.320]  dare to say that that Rick Perry was going to run for president even though
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:58.880]  we are a real media organization who has real sources well I think what they're
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:07.640]  trying to do here and this will be done in perpetuity and that is to discourage
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:13.560]  any outside opinion and that's what yours is it's outside the box opinion is now
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:17.800]  conspiracy theory or breaking news I mean if I can say this keyboard is gray
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:23.680]  that's a conspiracy theory I'm not allowed to have any view well I you know
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:27.520]  my feeling on that is let them talk all they want we just keep on doing what we
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:34.160]  doing and but I I see a lot of harassment today particularly a paper like
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:41.960]  yourself and this is part of it of this vilification so that people will start
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:47.880]  to wonder well really is Alex and Bob were are they that way are they
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:54.040]  conspiracy theorists and really off base and this is the tact that they're
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:59.640]  following and you'll get all of these bogus attacks making up stories about
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:05.480]  what we're talking about just simply isn't true and it's got to go on and on
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:11.520]  and you in the past like myself we just ignore it we talked about this a dozen
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:15.680]  years ago now that's why they're that's why they're losing credibility
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:21.440]  exactly they're losing credibility because they don't live in the real
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.840]  world but they they get more and more ridiculous is my point that that's a
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:30.280]  major breaking news that we've got sources that Perry is gonna run for
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:34.040]  president we've been saying it for almost four years on record it's in my
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:39.320]  film in game and then the system is so upset by our credibility that they
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:42.960]  flip it around and say we don't have credibility so the debate is about do
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:46.800]  we have credibility or not instead of the facts that we're laying out to
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:54.200]  people it's a mind trick they are terrified and a few weeks ago you made
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:59.320]  the statement we are breathing down their collar and they don't like it and
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:06.280]  you're absolutely correct and the the greater the breathing is or the heat
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:13.080]  down their collar the more aggressive they're going to get and you know when
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:19.440]  you were talking about the attack on this young man in Australia I was thinking
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:26.120]  of this word a word usage and of course you and I use all kinds of word usage
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:32.840]  and that's probably how they're gonna come at us you said something about
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:36.440]  something and you can't say that so we're gonna put you pick you up and put
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.960]  you in jail they already do that in Canada I mean this is modern book
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:44.600]  burning this is like arresting you as a heretic and you know if you're a
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.320]  Copernicus and don't think the earth is flat or if you're Galileo and you
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:53.800]  know that the earth orbits the Sun they just arrest you I mean it's right back
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:59.120]  what it's always been well when the Vatican was running things they ex
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:06.200]  communicated you and many of the great minds of history have were ex-
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:11.520]  re-indicated so it's nothing new it goes back for centuries but I think
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:16.480]  they're getting it down to a fine art and then putting a zinger a stinger in
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:22.040]  there which is you know if you say that sort of thing about somebody like that
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:28.120]  policeman is a homosexual then off you go you get tried and you get put away for
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:33.520]  three or four years where you will be indoctrinated and it's just like the
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:38.440]  Communist had in their camps recently and well that's what the Communist said
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:41.280]  they said you're saying things we don't like you're going to reeducation camp
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:44.880]  I mean that's these are reagent and how people are listening right now going good
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.680]  it was mean to say that reeducation camp reeducation camp I mean it shows how
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:57.000]  much trouble we're in it is very very serious and sometimes you can't even
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.320]  convince your close friends and members of your family that it's as dire as it
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:09.200]  is they just don't see it and everybody out of everybody only a fraction will
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:14.440]  ever see it because their minds just don't work that way where they can
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:21.680]  uncover things like this and see through them it it takes a special kind of
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.920]  approach and most people don't have that I want to go to some calls Bob but
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:33.120]  there's a lot of other news floating around right now the Russian minister
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:37.280]  Russian envoy to NATO says yeah they're getting ready to go in September
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:43.000]  October we had partly on live and showed live video of what conservatively
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.880]  look like a half million people running around with AK-47s and grenade launchers
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:53.720]  in the middle of Tripoli men women children hopping up and down saying
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:57.120]  we're ready you know we want peace but it but if the tanks come we're going to
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:03.200]  fight I mean Saddam was a dictator installed by the West and you know he'd
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.160]  have little staged events with a few thousand of his hand-picked people with
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.080]  guns to show look I'm on a dictator no this was half million people in one
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:18.640]  square with automatic rifles and grenade launchers saying bring it on and hey
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:20.880]  the bankers the bankers are going to bring it on they don't care they
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:25.720]  march our army and marine people in there they get killed well that's
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:31.040]  absolutely correct and they're pulling troops out of Afghanistan right now to
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:38.640]  send them over to Libya and I get a lot of questions on that yesterday and you
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:43.360]  know from the marine disposition and and you know what you said you know these
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:48.000]  are professional people in in our military they don't want to go and do
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.800]  these things but they're under contract and they don't have much choice they
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.320]  argue they get court-martialed then they go to jail so what good is that so they
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:02.200]  go and put themselves in the line of fire and it's something that they totally
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:09.400]  and completely disagree with now let's look at the economy more and more you
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:13.440]  know the the financial times of London on Monday that the dollar will lose his
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:17.560]  World Reserve status but they say 25 years introduced the idea to us the
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:21.120]  Chinese say the dollars already dead is the World Reserve but the other
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:25.480]  currencies are falling Greece has rolled over to the austerity break down the
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:31.840]  current economic geopolitical landscape one of the factors that we have to talk
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:37.960]  about when we talk about the dollar and it's a very important in the last 11
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:48.480]  years every year nine major currencies fell on average more than 20% versus
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:54.800]  gold and silver so if the dollar goes down against the the pound of the euro
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:43:00.280]  or any currency it's important but what's really important is all of the
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:05.640]  currencies are going down in varying degrees versus gold and silver and
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:11.080]  that's extremely important people don't look at it that way it'll understand
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:17.400]  because no one ever tells them but versus other currencies you've just seen
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:26.240]  the dollar back off into 74.5 or approximately the USDX index which is
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:31.480]  six major currencies versus the dollar and that's really not going to get
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:37.000]  any better even know England and the countries in Europe and many other
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.480]  countries got similar problems the government in the United States has
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:48.480]  seen fit along with the Federal Reserve to so overburden the American economy
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:56.720]  and the dollar with this tremendous debt that there's no way that the dollar
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:02.000]  can appreciate it's going to continue to depreciate and that's the bag that we're
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:08.640]  into and unless something is done to stop that which is more than anything
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:14.720]  else speculation by Wall Street it's going to continue and I think that they
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:22.720]  wanted to continue because they want to be able to pay off their debts with
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:28.720]  cheaper money and this is what they're up to and we see them as you said
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:32.040]  every time they want a new quote bailout which is really just another robbery
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:37.240]  every time that happens we see another news article oh ratings agency you has
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:41.840]  to lose its lose its credit rating you know if you don't give the bankers more
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:49.640]  money so it's just endless I mean just they're not going to stop well a good
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:55.240]  example of that is what you and I and Max have just seen over in Greece and
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:45:02.320]  everybody knows what's happened there what I'm terribly afraid of now is this
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:07.520]  could very well lead to violence and revolution in Greece and I think there's
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:10.800]  a distinct possibility of that we have a lot of subscribers here who are
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:16.720]  connected and they tell us that it could very well happen so we'll see what
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.160]  happens over the next few weeks but that sort of thing if it happened in
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:28.240]  Greece it's quite all over Europe and to the United States your phones crackling
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:33.680]  a bit Bob but your yeah I know we got the big storms in my area let's go ahead
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:40.360]  and talk to G2 in Illinois G2 welcome welcome Bob I want to throw you a
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:45.480]  couple of powder pops because my female hormones are up I've been drinking
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:49.760]  lake water out of plastic bottles number one you mentioned Greece those
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:55.280]  demonstrators you can go on the internet they are agent provocateurs and that was
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:00.680]  sham opposition in Greece check it out second big story on G2 because you're
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:04.160]  making these big statements you're talking about this phenol a admittedly
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:11.660]  turning all mammal species males quote feminine then the mice release a
[02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:15.120]  pheromone that they're feminine and then the females won't mate with them and
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:18.560]  people need to understand it's in all the major printer cartridge ink all the
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.400]  major brands most the printer ink at the store it's in most the plastic we drink
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:29.160]  out of okay a a serious issue B they've had millions of people on the streets of
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:33.120]  Greece yes the police have been caught breaking out windows and setting fires
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:36.720]  of things even on mainline Greece television are you saying all the
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:43.800]  protesters were agent provocateurs no but it's it's on the internet and they
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:47.920]  Greek TVs got them because they let away some guys with a tattoo one of them had
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:54.440]  a left tattoo on his left arm what's your view of the austerity what's your
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:59.600]  view of what happened to grace well you're talking about Shin bet against
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:07.320]  sin pain and you're talking about the GF to the Gaza flotilla to they just had
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:13.080]  sabotage down there there's some Irish ship it's called Sourza it's Gaelic for
[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:17.960]  freedom it the drive shaft was cut and the rudder was cut off then and then
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:23.600]  this followed Monday Tuesday days after the sabotage the Julianna in Piraeus
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.720]  Harbor Athens Greece where the propeller and the drive shaft were cut up the
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:35.160]  Irish ship but group leader fintans Lane supported by Prime Minister Ed Edna
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:39.280]  Kenny okay okay let me let me get Bob Chapin to comment on that thank you G2
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.200]  haven't heard from you in a while let's go Bob your comments on what he was
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:53.400]  saying well first of all the actions happened versus those ships and who is
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:59.120]  a likely suspects the Israelis because they don't want a flotilla although this
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.880]  to me has very little to do with Greece other than I think there was one ship
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:11.240]  there and a little hazy on what happened with it I don't know whether it was
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:16.920]  off Piraeus or where it was but I don't know the one thing belongs to the other
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:22.160]  or it has anything to do with the other there's no there's no question this
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:28.960]  sabotage with the flotilla that's going to Gaza and they had to take off minus
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:35.200]  one or two or three vessels and that's just simply dirty tricks and the
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:40.480]  Israelis are well known for that as far as Greece is concerned Asian
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:45.320]  provocateurs you're always going to have them and that's just the way governments
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:51.000]  work today but there's tremendous amounts of people you and I both have many
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:58.360]  videos of what's gone on they were over the last almost a month now and I have
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:04.560]  people who are subscribers who live there and they're very successful some
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:11.080]  of them some of them a middle class and everybody knows everybody in Greece it's
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:19.120]  a small country and generally speaking and so I think that 99% of what you're
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:25.080]  seeing in the streets by protesters is real absolutely let's really disturbed
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.640]  and I don't blame them absolutely Pamela in Wisconsin you're on the air
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:36.960]  welcome hi Alex how you doing good I'm glad we're all awake and I just want to
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:41.320]  let the good news that Jesus Christ Yahweh is Australia you can find him at
[02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:48.440]  YouTube Brian is Yahweh to Pamela get to come on come on I mean I'm not sure what
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:51.760]  you're talking about do you have any questions or comments for Bob well it's
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:55.280]  a piece of stuff from the lore lovers to the kingdom to have a truth right now
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:49:58.400]  we're trying to say I appreciate your call I'm not gonna do it I think we got
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:02.560]  some prank calls today John in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead yeah
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:06.160]  how you doing Alex good thanks for everything you do your guests your
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.520]  your staff there and thank goodness there's people like you in the world
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:14.360]  I'm this I sent a couple emails and did there's a couple things that I want to
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:18.320]  say on the first one I say as I was trying to figure out exactly how much
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:23.440]  government costs us in this country now from depends on your tax bracket but
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:28.320]  most people one way or the other pay about 60 percent in taxes and studies
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:35.120]  I've seen Bob Chapman that's about right and what in France it's over 85 correct

[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:23.960]  unfortunately we are out of time here ladies and gentlemen we got a special
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:29.120]  broadcast coming up on Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I'll just leave it at that towards the
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:33.240]  end of the show the last 30 minutes of the broadcast on Sunday are important to
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:37.040]  end to Bob Chapman's our guest I want to get to all these people but we were
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:42.680]  talking to John in New Jersey and he was talking about what percentage we pay
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:46.880]  in taxes if you really get down to it businesses everything passes on the cost
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.040]  to you but then you have all the fines the fees the regulations the property
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:54.840]  taxes the business taxes and even if you're you know quote blue collar making
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:59.360]  you know a lot less money than some folks you you're hit the worst because all
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:02.880]  the expenses of what you buy you know people that have more money than you
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:08.120]  and their businesses are passing the expenses on to you but again their
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:12.000]  problem in in all their public documents is a quote overheating economy
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:16.640]  things growing fast that they don't like that this is a command destruction
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:19.800]  economy and I want Bob to comment on this but it's I mean they constantly talk
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:23.680]  about this for a hundred years where they're taxing to suck money out of the
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:28.800]  economy to slow things down and then giving waivers to insiders so only they
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:32.520]  can operate with an unfair trade advantage and the examples of that are
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:36.320]  Legion but the big one is 2,000 plus companies that give to Obama get
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:39.800]  healthcare waivers and now no one can compete with them they can lower prices
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:43.200]  and it's whether it's a hamburger or a car and no one can defeat them they're
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:50.040]  just its total criminal mafia operations Bob Chapman well it's the same as the
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:55.840]  situation with the profits of offshore corporations that are American
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:01.280]  corporations you can make money keep it offshore five years ago we had
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:07.720]  legislation the promise was that these transnational conglomerates would hire
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:12.040]  people in America if they could bring money back and they were allowed to
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:18.160]  bring money back about 350 billion dollars and instead of paying 35% taxes
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:22.680]  they paid five and a quarter percent they want the same deal again this time
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:26.320]  they want to bring back two trillion what did they do with the money last time
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.080]  they went in the market bought their own stocks ran up the prices and cashed in on
[02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:38.880]  their options does that answer your question John yeah well some good
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.320]  information you know I found a wiki page I think that probably has the best
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.920]  information it's from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and they they're up
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:52.720]  over 72% of GDP excluding the debt now you know we have a unique opportunity
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.000]  right now and the only solution that I could think of that I want to tell all
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  you know I'm going to interrupt you 72% in taxes because I know
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:04.320]  conservatively 60 but yeah a lot of estimates have France above 90 I wanted
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:09.360]  to be conservative because folks won't believe it if I lie in any way it's that
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:13.800]  I tend to go with the most conservative numbers knowing people won't believe it
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:17.760]  and so on so it's not lying it's all go with the and then people accuse me of
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:21.320]  exaggerating and generally it's the opposite but yes I've seen those numbers
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.880]  sir what type of greedy person are you you want to keep you want to keep 28% of
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:31.440]  your money I mean it's not enough that serfs only paid 10% in ancient Europe
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:36.760]  and you're paying 70 plus what type of sicko are you John well that's why it's
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:40.800]  not funny man are you a racist because not wanting government-run health care
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:46.280]  is racist I mean well you know all of that's just ridiculous sense but I'm
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:48.840]  sorry make your point and then Bob will finish I'm sorry I'm just talking to
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:52.960]  somebody who's greedy and hateful unique opportunity right now because it is
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:56.480]  financial crisis and the only thing that I could think is that we got a band
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:59.560]  together we got to stand up against these people
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:03.720]  too much of a window of opportunity never do this and say you know what the
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:06.840]  federal government's fired let's bring everything down to a local level where
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:09.640]  least you could show up at some guy's house and give him a hard time if he
[02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:13.200]  gets out of control and it that's it that's everything I could think that
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:18.800]  well Bob Chapman final comments on that my friend I just want to leave you with
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:25.200]  one thing here are the current European tax rates UK 67 and a half percent
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:34.960]  France almost 60 Greece 65 Spain 61 Portugal 62 Sweden 80 Norway 79.3

[02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:01.720]  network network
[03:00:01.720 --> 03:00:16.800]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:21.600]  we've got different TV networks on out there during the breaks and I saw the
[03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:27.360]  headline on Fox government sues Apollo 14 astronaut we're gonna pull that up and
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:30.320]  see what that's about it would five more minutes with Bob I wish I could go for
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:34.600]  ten more hours but I got a long way to go in a short time to get there another
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:38.600]  way to say it the woods are lovely dark and deep but I have miles to go before
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:45.440]  I sleep I'd love to go these calls we'll see what happens but and and and again
[03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:49.120]  Bob I think you're just going with the income tax rates you know you're not
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:53.120]  counting the council you know you the city the you know the parish whatever
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:56.920]  the jurisdiction is all the telecommunications fines and fees the
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:04.120]  carbon taxes the travel taxes the sales taxes the environmental taxes the
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:10.000]  service taxes the hotel taxes and because the numbers I've seen is from
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:15.160]  the OECD the UN complaining that the United States is only a little over 60
[03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:19.840]  percent of total taxes and so the world invests here kind of like Texas you know
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:23.160]  it's better in the rest of the US up so Glenn Beck's moving here am I sir nothing
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:29.880]  he doesn't do that it intimidate what we're doing but so basically that's why
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:33.720]  I was saying France from the numbers I've seen is approaching 90% in many
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:41.680]  tax brackets go ahead agreed and the VAT alone will put you up there and so the
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:46.400]  taxes are prohibitive and that's the way they're going to get in America if you
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:51.840]  notice the the plan that they're trying to put together to the extend the short
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:58.120]  term data limit they want to raise taxes and the Republicans are saying
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:03.720]  generally speaking no we want you to cut back on what you're spending and they're
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:13.160]  at a standoff and but nobody mentions is that between the date that the extension
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:21.520]  ended in August the second the federal government will have borrowed about 275
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:26.440]  billion dollars to keep the government going during that period of time which
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:34.440]  they borrowed from the pension plan without informing anybody so to speak
