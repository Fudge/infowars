[00:00.000 --> 00:28.240]  You know it's days like these when the plate isn't just full, it's so overwhelming that
[00:28.240 --> 00:34.000]  I feel like I'm letting everybody down and then I get overheated and I get really really
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.080]  hyper and my brain speeds up and I get gasped on and the great things to say and I interrupt
[00:41.080 --> 00:48.760]  them because that's why I always thank you for putting up with me because it's just it
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.160]  makes my brain explode every article because my brain makes connections in memory to a
[00:55.160 --> 01:00.880]  larger picture and I'm basically like Robbie the Robot with smoke coming out of my ears
[01:00.880 --> 01:08.600]  so thanks for putting up with me when I say that because just one of these articles has
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.560]  hundreds of data points with it that give me chills up my back and then I'm sitting
[01:13.560 --> 01:21.920]  here at home and last night and this morning and in the office looking at all this and
[01:21.920 --> 01:30.360]  just every story and the way the mainstream media responds to it and tries to lie is crazy
[01:30.360 --> 01:36.760]  you know we tell you that we're next year's news today Roger Stone has been saying since
[01:36.760 --> 01:47.480]  January of 2017 one year ago he has been saying that the key to bringing Obama, Hillary and
[01:47.480 --> 01:52.960]  all of them to justice is the illegal FISA warrant which they then lied and said they
[01:52.960 --> 01:58.560]  didn't have first they said they were surveilling then they said they weren't then they said
[01:58.560 --> 02:08.920]  we were crazy and made it up remember all the CNN clips and it just goes on and on and
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.760]  I kept saying this is the key to everything I agreed with Roger that the fact that they
[02:12.760 --> 02:18.240]  were spying illegally on the campaign and then we're doing it when he was president-elect
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.360]  and then the day he gets elected it's the front page of the New York Times that they
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.080]  were spying on Trump Tower and then they lie about it to Congress and say it's preposterous
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.240]  Clapper Brennan Comey in front of Congress we have all the clips we're going to play
[02:35.240 --> 02:45.840]  in today and now Congress has the classified FISA warrant directed by the president it
[02:45.840 --> 02:52.920]  wasn't just Comey that went with the fake fuse and GPS the president of the United States
[02:52.920 --> 03:02.120]  directed that the frontrunner and the Republican nominee be spied on for espionage with no
[03:02.120 --> 03:10.640]  proof with a fake dossier and then lied about it to Congress and lied about it to the American
[03:10.640 --> 03:17.560]  people and now it's all blown up in their face and they just hope like Gruber why do
[03:17.560 --> 03:23.440]  I harp on Gruber so much the top strategist to get Obamacare passed and he said I was
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.000]  hired to deceive people that this was going to triple prices on average within five years
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.760]  and I was hired because I'm the best at lying and thank God the public has no memory these
[03:34.760 --> 03:43.680]  are quotes they don't want you to have a memory and here right here now we have Congress we
[03:43.680 --> 03:51.080]  have senators we have the FBI coming out it's all right here Congress confident bombshell
[03:51.080 --> 03:57.400]  FISA abuse memo will be released soon resulting in major criminal indictment of major officials
[03:57.400 --> 04:01.920]  I believe there are people who will go to jail over the Intel memo worse than Watergate
[04:01.920 --> 04:07.880]  shocking house Intel memo reveals FISA abuse by senior DOJ and FBI and notice Trump had
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.080]  this from the time he got into office he doesn't release secret stuff though he's waiting for
[04:12.080 --> 04:17.840]  it to be released through proper channels law enforcement was so upset they leaked to
[04:17.840 --> 04:27.960]  us a previous mass surveillance program of Trump all his residences and my residence
[04:27.960 --> 04:38.120]  and my private office we broke that last year so yeah next year's news today and then it
[04:38.120 --> 04:41.440]  goes on and on and on and then we have the Roger Stone articles from back in March of
[04:41.440 --> 04:47.240]  last year Trump wiretapping a scandal bigger than Watergate Roger Stone though after the
[04:47.240 --> 04:52.000]  fraud of the FISA warrant again that's how smart Roger is the more and more I realize
[04:52.000 --> 04:59.640]  that guy is scary how dead on he is we've got even bigger news to just stay with us
[04:59.640 --> 05:05.880]  I'm so excited the new product and for life.com in a glass bottle two months servings filled
[05:05.880 --> 05:13.480]  to the brim filled to the absolute top the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill

[05:18.200 --> 05:24.480]  beyond that quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to
[05:24.480 --> 05:28.280]  their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two
[05:28.280 --> 05:34.000]  hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.280]  and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen
[05:41.280 --> 05:46.240]  you add the preglonone to it which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body

[06:18.040 --> 06:38.080]  is a war on your mind it's Friday the 19th day of January 2018 I am your host Alex Jones
[06:38.080 --> 06:43.480]  Sean Hennedy last night said that the Russia investigation is over and is officially blown
[06:43.480 --> 06:51.280]  up in their face I agree that it's a double head tap what we just saw the first unstoppable
[06:51.280 --> 06:57.640]  salvo was all the fusion GPS coming out with the husbands and wives in the Justice Department
[06:57.640 --> 07:02.200]  FBI a very close-knit group of less than 30 people at the top the deputy director of
[07:02.200 --> 07:11.240]  the FBI the head of the Russia operations or inside of the Justice Department all connected
[07:11.240 --> 07:17.120]  by the way to the communist Chinese smoke screening and blaming Russia for their operations
[07:17.120 --> 07:23.480]  they went in created the fake dossier used it to get the fake Pfizer warrant and now
[07:23.480 --> 07:32.920]  we know Obama directed the warrant unprecedented beyond Nixonian Congress has the memo it's
[07:32.920 --> 07:38.360]  classified but they are trying to look at how they're going to release it notice Trump
[07:38.360 --> 07:42.560]  knew all this day one he got elected he got briefings once he was president that's why
[07:42.560 --> 07:49.320]  they were so scared on the 20th he could see it all and that's why when he said I think
[07:49.320 --> 07:54.120]  it's going to come out Obama was spying on me and they said you're insane Comey said
[07:54.120 --> 08:02.720]  it was insane we're going to get those clips in front of Congress two weeks later was that
[08:02.720 --> 08:09.560]  early February he said the president pulled the headline Comey it's insane to say that
[08:09.560 --> 08:16.560]  Obama ordered spying or knew about spying on Trump the spying didn't exist he said and
[08:16.560 --> 08:25.280]  Obama wasn't involved it was insane there it is Comey called Trump crazy he was both
[08:25.280 --> 08:32.600]  crazy and insane after Obama wiretapping claims report there it is video from the hill when
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.480]  did I tell you I told you see my memories it has precision I told you February but I
[08:36.480 --> 08:42.120]  guess he testified again in the fifth month last year but he also did it in February
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.200]  so there you go multiple testimonies so crazy insane hearing after hearing after hearing
[08:48.200 --> 08:55.160]  after hearing and contradicting himself hearing over hearing there was no secret memos he
[08:55.160 --> 09:00.120]  didn't leak to the press there was a secret memo he did leak to the press perjury perjury
[09:00.120 --> 09:06.080]  perjury perjury as bad as Brennan saying the NSA has never spied on any US citizen period
[09:06.080 --> 09:12.560]  it's doesn't exist it's like saying New York City doesn't exist Dallas Texas doesn't exist
[09:12.560 --> 09:22.600]  your mama didn't exist bananas aren't yellow bears aren't brown skyed and blue there it
[09:22.600 --> 09:29.520]  is yeah in March Trump's baseless wiretap claim remember the hysteria in January February
[09:29.520 --> 09:39.760]  March and April and CNN clip Alex Jones is the one he's the insane person that says the
[09:39.760 --> 09:52.360]  president was being wiretapped and the and the White House is using info wars as a source
[09:52.360 --> 09:58.560]  think about that the White House wasn't using us as a source Obama was the source when he
[09:58.560 --> 10:05.240]  was president elect when Trump was president elect they were in the news saying we spied
[10:05.240 --> 10:10.040]  on Trump and have total proof he's a Russian so Trump goes well it's illegal to leak that
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.480]  if you have it but I know that isn't true so you're lying also about fake leaked intelligence
[10:15.480 --> 10:24.120]  which is doubly criminal and now we know it was worse than we thought because they're
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.120]  dumb enough to even say in memos we got to set the president elect up we got a stopping
[10:30.120 --> 10:36.080]  because that's in the new FISA they got that when Obama was outgoing then there's a previous
[10:36.080 --> 10:42.480]  FISA and previous surveillance that wasn't even authorized going on during the campaign
[10:42.480 --> 10:52.800]  obviously this is unbelievable New York Times needs to come clean on wiretap headline yeah
[10:52.800 --> 11:01.080]  that was September of last year pointing out that on January 20th one year ago tomorrow
[11:01.080 --> 11:08.640]  that they said they were wiretapping the president but then again CNN said that I literally made
[11:08.640 --> 11:16.600]  it up and that there was no reports saying it even though there were thousands so see
[11:16.600 --> 11:24.280]  my crime is a memory Gruber said we could screw these people over and triple their rates and
[11:24.280 --> 11:32.600]  rob them thank god they're so stupid and thank god they have no memories a memory is everything
[11:32.600 --> 11:36.600]  if you're good natured love god have a good memory and are hardworking the universe is
[11:36.600 --> 11:47.360]  yours and they all bet on you not having a memory and so now we have congressional investigations
[11:47.360 --> 11:53.520]  we have congressmen and women that have seen the memos they say it the venom is vicious
[11:53.520 --> 12:01.240]  and that it's Obama directing the whole operation well of course he's the president you don't
[12:01.240 --> 12:07.920]  think they're gonna carry out stuff this criminal if it wasn't a direct order but for months
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.480]  and months and months every day of every week last year they said the Trump was in shame
[12:13.480 --> 12:20.480]  in congressional testimony crazy Mueller said he was crazy Comey said he was crazy everybody
[12:20.480 --> 12:30.640]  said he was crazy and now it's all imploding Comey called Trump crazy and outside the realm
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.240]  of normal while the president thought there was something wrong with his FBI director
[12:35.240 --> 12:43.920]  her toxic relationship revealed and now everything Trump said confirmed in royal flush yet again
[12:43.920 --> 12:49.600]  congressman confident bombshell Pfizer abuse memo will be released soon will result in
[12:49.600 --> 12:56.600]  criminal charges of top officials I believe people are going to go to jail worse than
[12:56.600 --> 13:02.360]  Watergate we're gonna play these clips coming up the next segment but we need to have the
[13:02.360 --> 13:10.040]  big headline on info wars.com and news wars.com because it seems like nobody else is doing
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.520]  this we've got to do it yet again I'm not complaining I just don't get how people don't
[13:14.520 --> 13:23.000]  see the forest for the trees here the headline Trump 100% vindicated in saying he was illegally
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.840]  spied on because they illegally went and lied with fake dossiers knowingly in meetings
[13:30.840 --> 13:36.960]  saying it's an insurance policy to then go get a warrant to authorize with parallel construction
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.440]  what they were already doing for over a year and a half illegally and all that's coming
[13:42.440 --> 13:50.280]  out so we need to go and show screenshots of the New York Times and the washroom post
[13:50.280 --> 13:55.080]  and CNN just like I just did on TV your radio listener they're putting up dozens of articles
[13:55.080 --> 14:02.160]  saying Trump's insane Trump's crazy didn't happen and then it's exactly as he said and
[14:02.160 --> 14:06.320]  ram that down their throat because that's the medicine to the poison that's the medicine
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.480]  of the lies of them saying we're fake news the president's insane he's fake he's dangerous
[14:11.480 --> 14:17.280]  no over and over you'll never have a growth rate of 3% roared past that New York Times
[14:17.280 --> 14:23.480]  Krugman full of prunes you just won the fake news awards telling America we never be great
[14:23.480 --> 14:32.920]  again demoralizing us like Tokyo rose in World War two unbelievable and now all of it proven
[14:32.920 --> 14:40.840]  yet again in your stinking faces take that people ask how can suddenly things one year
[14:40.840 --> 14:47.720]  later be so much better be turning around so quickly because it was artificial suppression
[14:47.720 --> 14:54.440]  that's what globalism is China has been picked as the industrial base and the place to have
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.680]  prosperity for the elite not the people it's an economic war this has been a 21st century
[14:59.680 --> 15:08.160]  war and guess what patriots just recaptured the country to a certain extent that's all

[20:54.640 --> 21:01.040]  and when he was president elect and so here's an article out of newsweek just last year
[21:01.040 --> 21:08.680]  December 30th did Obama wire tap Trump no but it was just one of the rights top conspiracy
[21:08.680 --> 21:19.720]  theories of 2017 so this is just 20 days ago they're still saying this didn't happen when
[21:19.720 --> 21:26.680]  it's all admitted imagine who reads this the most gullible people now if you guys pull
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.080]  that info wars article back up please I can give them the day thank you here is an adan
[21:31.080 --> 21:41.120]  solazar article from March of last year when we were hammering them with the truth so was
[21:41.120 --> 21:48.240]  drudge report New York Times editor blames info wars for Trump wire tap claims after
[21:48.240 --> 21:57.720]  reporting on wire taps and he goes on to say that I made it up so what they do is when
[21:57.720 --> 22:01.400]  they want to say something fake they just go oh that came from Jones because they want
[22:01.400 --> 22:07.720]  to discredit us at the same time turn us into a symbol of falsehood when we're the symbol
[22:07.720 --> 22:14.360]  of truth that's what we attempt to be and then project the lie again regurgitate the
[22:14.360 --> 22:21.040]  lie onto Trump and the American people knowing full well his paper ran 20 plus articles in
[22:21.040 --> 22:26.040]  January saying that they'd wire tap the president and that we've gone over all those articles
[22:26.040 --> 22:33.600]  just from the New York Times saying it in January alone but as soon as he became the
[22:33.600 --> 22:38.800]  president he said that's illegal and it's not true and they went you're insane you're
[22:38.800 --> 22:48.400]  crazy here's the FBI director no one ever spied on you you're crazy then we think it's the
[22:48.400 --> 22:57.640]  DEA gives us the documents of Trump and myself being spied on for eight years by Obama I
[22:57.640 --> 23:02.080]  knew it was real database because it was phone numbers I had my private office that nobody
[23:02.080 --> 23:08.920]  had and it said Alex Jones's private office number Trump's private office number Trump's
[23:08.920 --> 23:12.640]  private apartment Marlago number and I had Trump's number at Marlago his private number
[23:12.640 --> 23:22.400]  I'm sitting there going my god this is real and you notice the media didn't touch that
[23:22.400 --> 23:28.800]  when we released screenshots with our numbers blacked out because they knew it was Pulitzer
[23:28.800 --> 23:36.480]  prize level information oh Roger Stone convinced Obama administration got FISA warrant to monitor
[23:36.480 --> 23:43.600]  him and now that was last year early last year April of last year all of it proven and
[23:43.600 --> 23:47.800]  what did Stone say over and over again next year's news today he said they got illegal
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.840]  FISA with illegal BS and they spy on everybody including you Alex and including Trump and
[23:52.840 --> 23:57.000]  his whole family and they're lying about it and they've perjured themselves to Congress
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.880]  that we have him cut and dry they will go to jail if Trump moves on this and every time
[24:01.880 --> 24:07.840]  he talks to the president he says sir the FISA court was illegal they had illegal wire
[24:07.840 --> 24:12.320]  tapping before they lied to do it you've got to go after him you've got him cut and dry
[24:12.320 --> 24:19.440]  just like they got Nixon for illegal spying cut and dry and now you see it that's why
[24:19.440 --> 24:24.640]  they hate us folks because we are technical we're on the level with what's really going
[24:24.640 --> 24:30.280]  on talking to the experts that's why they want to shut down and I just keep saying that
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.160]  because it's like alert alert alert alert we're you know the base is being attacked
[24:34.160 --> 24:39.960]  and I just keep going yeah yeah yeah yeah just letting you know that this is going on

[24:44.160 --> 24:48.760]  on civil war with hardcore criminals that sold us out of the communist Chinese but Obama's
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.880]  a communist Chinese agent all of them these people are hardcore criminals and you suddenly
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.040]  see it in the news Chinese communists have taken over every university Chinese communists
[24:58.040 --> 25:02.840]  have bought up Hollywood Twitter text the orders of the communist Chinese Google I mean

[25:14.880 --> 25:18.760]  is from March we put the M4's article back up great job finding that there's a bunch
[25:18.760 --> 25:29.920]  of these videos but here is CNN memorializing the fact that they say that I made it up that
[25:29.920 --> 25:35.280]  Trump was being spied on and that I was Trump source memorializing what lying scum and by
[25:35.280 --> 25:41.160]  the way Anderson Cooper is leftist foundation CIA and I can tell you right now that that
[25:41.160 --> 25:50.640]  New York Times editor unbelievable that these are the enemies of this country arrogant conceited
[25:50.640 --> 25:56.440]  think they're invincible guess what you're just men like everybody else in fact your
[25:56.440 --> 26:02.240]  traitorous men you're globalist you were hired because you hate the country you were hired
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.240]  because you actually enjoy kicking America while it was down well guess what buddy both
[26:07.240 --> 26:13.160]  of you we're not down anymore we've been stopped pretty bad but we're up and awake now and
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.200]  we're politically going to get you back you understand that you started it you're going
[26:18.200 --> 26:21.960]  to get it now scum everything you did to my family everybody else what you've done to

[26:30.600 --> 26:37.560]  piss all over the country and break it's back so we can teach you the lesson like you globalist
[26:37.560 --> 26:45.200]  are let's go to these two traders back in March memorializing the truth because we have
[26:45.200 --> 26:49.960]  a memory and we're going to keep hammering them when people start going to prison and
[26:49.960 --> 26:52.880]  they're never going to stop trying to get the president you can't play this game we're
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.040]  always going to cause a civil war if we send Hillary and all of them to prison Mr. President
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.560]  they're not going to stop they already started a civil war they've all got to go to prison
[27:01.560 --> 27:05.560]  they're saying you're a dictator we all need to be shut down take our free speech and then
[27:05.560 --> 27:10.680]  say you're doing that they've already launched their operations fill muds on TV saying he's
[27:10.680 --> 27:16.320]  going to kill you all we can do is go after them now turn the dogs loose they started
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.840]  it they did it they're the foreign power they're the enemy they're the traders get them get
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.800]  them here's the clip and so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.760]  cites a theory that he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe right wing
[27:32.760 --> 27:40.520]  media and then there's the New York Times and then after his tweet storm info wars then
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.440]  started saying well look it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story misreading
[27:44.440 --> 27:50.840]  our story and now a few weeks later the White House and the president are citing info wars
[27:50.840 --> 27:54.840]  so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right
[27:54.840 --> 27:58.960]  wing fringe theory both of which there's no evidence to support and just to be clear
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.480]  there is and correct me if I'm wrong there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting
[28:03.480 --> 28:08.920]  in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of
[28:08.920 --> 28:13.760]  then candidate Trump correct nothing I mean if we knew that that is a fantastic story
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.920]  and it just goes on and on and now we know it's in the Pfizer document the president
[28:19.920 --> 28:26.440]  directed it himself of course he did I mean you don't just think we thought that right
[28:26.440 --> 28:31.160]  you don't think that once he was president elected once he was president he didn't get
[28:31.160 --> 28:37.200]  all that information and you don't just think oh I'm the source for the president how about
[28:37.200 --> 28:48.840]  the president's the source people are sick man enemies of everything decent just a group

[34:17.680 --> 34:21.900]  other memos where they admit it's a set up to get the president then we have them perjuring

[38:55.740 --> 39:03.320]  wade has resulted in some of the most permissive abortion laws anywhere in the world for example
[39:03.320 --> 39:10.600]  in the united states it's one of only seven countries to allow elective late term abortions
[39:10.600 --> 39:16.880]  along with china north korea and others right now in a number of states the laws allow a
[39:16.880 --> 39:28.120]  baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the ninth month it is wrong it has to change
[39:28.120 --> 39:34.640]  this is incredible americans are more and more pro-life you see that all the time in fact
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.880]  only 12 percent of american support abortion on demand at any time this is too powerful
[39:40.880 --> 39:47.480]  for my administration we will always defend the very first right in the declaration of
[39:47.480 --> 39:54.520]  independence and that is the right to life wow he's the first sitting president he's
[39:54.520 --> 40:00.240]  actually got one of these events he pledged he would he just continues and their sacrament
[40:00.240 --> 40:04.600]  is this this is the heart of the global stop right exactly one year since i took the oath
[40:04.600 --> 40:09.760]  of law this is the final and i will say our country is doing really well our economy is
[40:09.760 --> 40:15.240]  perhaps the best it's ever been you look at the job numbers you look at the companies
[40:15.240 --> 40:22.040]  pouring back into our country yes you look at the stock market at an all time high unemployment
[40:22.040 --> 40:30.800]  17 year low unemployment for african-american workers at the lowest mark in the history
[40:30.800 --> 40:41.360]  of our country unemployment for hispanic at a record low in history unemployment for women
[40:41.360 --> 40:49.160]  think of this at an 18 year low we're really proud of what we're doing and during my first
[40:49.160 --> 40:56.800]  week in office i reinstated a policy first put in place by president ronald reagan the

[41:29.160 --> 41:34.080]  of dollars don't tell the women that they just want the nation to harvest the baby i signed

[42:14.400 --> 42:19.920]  babies and humanizing families and talking about how humans are good and and then that
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.720]  makes people act good and it makes people have vision and it makes them believe and
[42:24.720 --> 42:31.400]  then you see it happen we've been under conscious demoralization just like a foreign military
[42:31.400 --> 42:39.760]  does to its enemy and stopping and the enemies are just like completely out of control frothing
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.840]  at the mouth not knowing what to do you can see it's a spiritual war and i'm not judging

[47:12.320 --> 47:15.080]  Have sworn upon the altar of God
[47:15.080 --> 47:21.100]  Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.280]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[47:27.800 --> 47:31.640]  They take the tissue of the babies and then they grow the tissue in
[47:32.480 --> 47:34.280]  these fats and
[47:34.280 --> 47:36.280]  Then they harvest it
[47:36.440 --> 47:42.280]  They grind it up into vaccine material into flavor testing for Pepsi into thousands of products
[47:42.280 --> 47:45.720]  We know of we are literally ingesting our own children
[47:46.440 --> 47:52.440]  And it's done not from a position of eugenics even at the base level to get rid of poor people as it's pushed
[47:52.800 --> 47:58.640]  And to make society better. No, no, it's done to dehumanize everything and Trump in the times
[47:58.640 --> 48:01.960]  I've talked to him would say, you know, I know they're targeting churches the IRS
[48:01.960 --> 48:05.520]  We're gonna stop that and we're gonna stop partial birth abortion
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.000]  We're gonna go back to the States and and you know, that's constitutional and we're gonna save children
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.320]  And I said, well, I'm a Christian sir. Yes, I'm really glad that you're saying that
[48:13.600 --> 48:18.360]  But I still kind of halfway believe the media that he was this big liberal somehow and this was rhetoric
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.000]  And I'm like, sir, let's get the tax cut stabilize the country and then I'm sure that's gonna be great
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.680]  But then Trump three or four times I've talked to him brings up the energy at churches and
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.600]  And and and the people praying
[48:34.600 --> 48:42.920]  And he talks like especially was in black churches. He's like, man, you feel the energy in here and he's he gets high off of it and
[48:45.840 --> 48:48.480]  You know Trump didn't used to pick that up in the elite churches
[48:48.480 --> 48:54.640]  He went to and stuff where it's all just a social gathering and and Trump likes the average people and he's in the energy
[48:55.480 --> 48:57.160]  positive energy
[48:57.160 --> 48:59.160]  He's like the opposite of a psychic vampire
[48:59.960 --> 49:01.160]  you know
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.840]  I've only been around Trump a couple times and not even really able to talk to him and it's like you feel the energy
[49:06.840 --> 49:09.040]  same thing was wife was even more energy and
[49:09.640 --> 49:11.200]  You're almost like
[49:11.200 --> 49:16.800]  Can't hardly walk up to him. It's not like any Hollywood stars. I've ever seen any of it. It's like when they turn it on man
[49:16.800 --> 49:22.480]  It's like and the globalists know it and he's been a sleeper cell for 50 years
[49:22.480 --> 49:26.720]  His dad was a big anti-globalist patriot. They have huge amounts of money in the John Burt society
[49:26.720 --> 49:34.040]  He fought napkin gat that he has been literally preparing for this his whole life. This is unbelievable. I
[49:35.240 --> 49:40.320]  Mean this is I just let's say their final thing is abortion
[49:41.120 --> 49:47.760]  It's their whole cult their whole system and when you go after that like he's doing there's no way
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.760]  He's with the Illuminati. There's no way. He's with this system. There is no way
[49:53.760 --> 50:01.080]  No way and he'd be doing this zero zero and of course my gut tells me that too and the churches
[50:01.080 --> 50:03.600]  Their gut tells them that the real churches
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.320]  That's why they oh he liked hot women when he's you know, or most of that's made up
[50:08.320 --> 50:12.960]  Whatever King David, you know had his best friend kills. He'd have his wife. He repented of it later
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.240]  He did it out of the flesh. He wasn't inherently evil
[50:16.840 --> 50:18.440]  Trump hasn't done
[50:18.440 --> 50:22.960]  2100 what King David a man after God's own heart the prototype of Christ did?
[50:24.360 --> 50:30.200]  But what you judge your man by is the fruits and by the man's enemies and by his fruits and by his enemies
[50:30.800 --> 50:32.560]  You know this man
[50:32.560 --> 50:36.760]  So many Christians have said pre-destined to win can't be stopped all this stuff
[50:36.760 --> 50:41.040]  They feel the spirit and I'm kind of like come on. Let's not be that optimistic and now I
[50:41.880 --> 50:46.920]  Mean this they're gonna try to kill him. We already know that they're like demons crawling around their bellies right now
[50:46.920 --> 50:48.920]  Are the pigs running over the edge of the cliff?
[50:49.640 --> 50:50.760]  when
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.760]  you know Christ
[50:53.160 --> 50:55.160]  Tells Legion
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.280]  Not the name of the demon that we are Legion out of him and they were and the demons run into the pigs
[51:00.280 --> 51:02.200]  And they run off the edge of a cliff
[51:02.200 --> 51:07.240]  That's what these people are doing the Democrats the globalist all of them and then they're they're slaves
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.320]  Because they get the left into this elitism that we're the intellectuals everybody else are country bumpkins
[51:14.320 --> 51:19.000]  People that believe in God or idiots blah blah blah and then we're gonna run society and we know best
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.840]  That's your average liberal means well, but above them are really dark controllers who know and
[51:24.400 --> 51:31.040]  Who are into the occult and into dark energy and into death and into being evil and into being selfish?
[51:31.040 --> 51:33.040]  And when you pull back and see them
[51:33.320 --> 51:37.600]  It's sick and you just thank God you're not those people
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.200]  This is so historic. I didn't know this was gonna happen. They've been rumors of it and just boom it pops up
[51:43.200 --> 51:46.320]  So I don't even know if he's still speaking because we were playing it live
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.600]  But but but now we we've got a pause from earlier
[51:49.600 --> 51:54.520]  I haven't even plugged this hour because I'm just just I can't even plug products in the middle stuff like this
[51:54.520 --> 51:59.080]  Please support the show in four store.com. We won't be here. Thank you all for your support. Let's go back, but
[52:00.080 --> 52:08.000]  Presidents delivering you're delivering. There he is today. I'm announcing that we have just issued a new proposal to protect
[52:08.000 --> 52:15.720]  Consciousness rights and religious freedoms of doctors nurses and other medical professionals so important
[52:15.720 --> 52:23.960]  I have also just reversed the previous administration's policy that restricted states efforts to direct
[52:24.520 --> 52:28.640]  Medicaid funding away from abortion facilities that violate the law
[52:29.520 --> 52:31.520]  Exactly what he told me in the phone a year ago
[52:31.520 --> 52:40.200]  Oh, see that we are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society
[52:40.960 --> 52:49.120]  But this movement can only succeed with the heart and the soul and the prayer of the people a pro-human future
[52:49.760 --> 52:52.520]  Here with us today is Mary Anna
[52:53.360 --> 52:58.400]  Donadio from Greensboro, North Carolina. Where is Mary Anna?
[52:58.400 --> 53:01.200]  Hello, come on up here, Mary Anna
[53:02.360 --> 53:04.360]  Come
[53:06.320 --> 53:08.320]  People are the foundation
[53:08.360 --> 53:15.240]  Mary Anna was 17 when she found out she was pregnant at first she felt like she had no place to turn
[53:15.480 --> 53:19.120]  But when she told her parents they responded with total love
[53:19.880 --> 53:21.880]  Total affection total support
[53:21.880 --> 53:27.880]  Great parents great. I thought you were to say that I had to be careful
[53:29.520 --> 53:33.920]  Mary Anna bravely chose life and soon gave birth to her son
[53:34.640 --> 53:37.920]  She named him Benedict which means blessing
[53:38.480 --> 53:45.160]  Mary Anna was so it pause again parents love and support it pause. That's thanks. Did you see Trump just go?
[53:45.160 --> 53:52.920]  Doing good and good energy. That's the secret to Trump. He's getting high off of this
[53:52.920 --> 53:57.280]  He's getting energy off of doing good not off everybody praising him up there
[53:57.280 --> 53:59.760]  But off of delivering on what he said he would do
[54:00.240 --> 54:05.680]  When he signed that the the tax cut that that knocked out much of Obamacare he went
[54:06.360 --> 54:11.720]  When he pushed that thing on every sign that he he see this is this is what being honorable is about
[54:11.720 --> 54:19.720]  It's it's spiritual it's getting closer to God each time you do good and maybe 30 40 years ago
[54:19.720 --> 54:25.960]  Trump wasn't that close to God, but he's getting a lot closer and this is all of our journeys. We're talking about here
[54:25.960 --> 54:27.960]  this is just amazing and
[54:28.560 --> 54:30.560]  Let's go back to the president as
[54:31.800 --> 54:33.440]  fortunate as her
[54:33.440 --> 54:40.640]  She joined with others in her community to start a maternity home to care for homeless women
[54:40.640 --> 54:46.000]  Who were pregnant? It's great. They named it room at the end
[54:46.880 --> 54:56.080]  Today Mary Anna and her husband Don are the parents of six beautiful children and her eldest son Benedict and her daughter
[54:56.160 --> 55:00.720]  Maria join us here today. Where are they? Come on over
[55:00.720 --> 55:09.240]  Praise in families praising real wealth not hollywood red carpets
[55:09.360 --> 55:16.260]  This is the opposite of Satanism over the last 15 years room at the end has provided housing child care
[55:16.520 --> 55:21.160]  Counseling education and job training to more than 400 women
[55:21.640 --> 55:27.480]  Even more importantly it has given them hope it has shown each woman that she has not forgotten
[55:27.480 --> 55:35.600]  That she is not alone and she really now has a whole family of people who will help her
[55:36.120 --> 55:37.080]  succeed
[55:37.080 --> 55:44.200]  That hope is the true gift of this incredible movement that it brings us together said the family's wealth
[55:44.200 --> 55:50.600]  See it is the gift of friendship the gift of mentorship and the gift of encouragement
[55:50.600 --> 55:56.640]  Couragement love and support those are beautiful words and those are beautiful gifts and
[55:57.360 --> 56:01.640]  Most importantly of all it is the gift of life
[56:02.440 --> 56:03.640]  itself
[56:03.640 --> 56:05.640]  That is why we march
[56:05.800 --> 56:12.720]  That is why we pray and that is why we declare that America's future will be filled with goodness
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.560]  peace joy oh my god dignity and life
[56:16.560 --> 56:24.520]  For every child of God it pause again. We gotta go right you to the I told you when I was there a year ago
[56:25.240 --> 56:28.480]  Before I even tweeted out the New York Times government said how did you know what he'd speak about it?
[56:28.480 --> 56:32.520]  I didn't I felt it as he's gonna bring God back into the covenant
[56:32.920 --> 56:35.120]  He's gonna declare that people have value again
[56:35.440 --> 56:41.920]  He's gonna say that families have value that the states have value that the power is the people and that and and and that
[56:41.920 --> 56:50.440]  Again, we're not gonna be transhumanists. We're not gonna go down this road and now he's doing a ritual up there of
[56:51.360 --> 56:58.040]  Loves coming into America decency honor life the family. He's literally engaged in a ritual a
[56:59.680 --> 57:01.680]  Christian ritual
[57:02.200 --> 57:07.040]  Saying we're bringing the light back in we're bringing God back in
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.080]  Last night, I was talking one of the top riders in the country
[57:12.200 --> 57:15.560]  And I was talking about a big project. We're working on
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.440]  That's very very important. I'm just gonna leave it that and and and it's a simple thing, but it's key
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.560]  And it it spells it all out right here I

[59:26.640 --> 59:31.600]  expensive highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate a citrus peel blend
[59:31.600 --> 59:33.600]  I mean this is the next level
[59:33.600 --> 59:39.480]  It's now available ladies and gentlemen immune wall. I think it's beyond seasonal beta-glucan olive leaf and more
[59:39.920 --> 59:45.600]  Immune wall info wars store.com info wars life.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[59:45.600 --> 59:58.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:58.200 --> 01:00:10.880]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.600]  You know the left puts out a lot of different lies they claim the president doesn't mean what he says he's a liar
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.600]  He never keeps his promises
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:30.080]  But that lies kind of receding isn't so ridiculous now. They just go okay. He is keeping all his promises are trying as hard as he can and
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.720]  He's insane
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:39.520]  So continuing with the speech that has been live, but we've been pausing it during the breaks the president at the March for life other presidents
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.080]  Reagan would never go that was seen as too insinuery
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.360]  It's kind of in the back halls of things. Yeah, we don't really want all these black people to have kids do a
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.760]  I'm not saying Reagan was like that, but that's kind of the attitude of the Democrats and the Republicans and oh
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.840]  You know too many brown people or whatever and that's what what Margaret Sanger and the left's all about so they want to manage the left
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.920]  So you make sure they kill as many brown people as possible while using those that live as weapons against the whites to have total control and
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.200]  Then George Herbert Walker Bush wouldn't do it George W. Bush wouldn't do it none of them would ever attend any of these big pro-life events
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.200]  Well, guess what he did
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.080]  He said give me a year, maybe two we'll turn this whole thing around Alex
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.920]  And he's about to go on the attack starting in 48 hours
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:35.040]  In the first two days he was in office he signed executive orders getting us out of the TPP visited the CIA
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.720]  Turned the call back on he did hundreds of things in the first two days. What's he gonna do Sunday?
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.240]  day number one
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.760]  First year is salvage
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.720]  next year is
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.600]  Savage oh
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.840]  And the savaging is gonna begin and they're racing to kill him right now
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.080]  Let's let's play a few more minutes of the president where he was invoking life
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.840]  Humanity having value. We're not trash. We're not ugly. We're not garbage. We're connected to God
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:14.720]  We're beautiful creative creatures and when we believe that we then can have that it's not like Oprah Winfrey's secret that you want
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.720]  A big house or a car you get it
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.000]  It's the secret of we already have it. Let's go ahead and play it
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.440]  The president there as he has just wrapped up his remarks at the March for life
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:30.840]  Of course
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.160]  He's speaking from the Rose Garden and he had next to him a woman named Mariana
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:42.720]  Denadio who was his example of someone who bravely chose life when she found out that she was 17 years old and pregnant that person now has
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  six children married and
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.680]  Helps run an organization called room at the end. The president began his remarks as the first
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.440]  In his position to ever in all of its years
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.960]  That's just reality so epic
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.940]  People over use the word epic, but this is getting epic
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.460]  The that the it's like we had a hundred and seven fever
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.380]  We were falling apart a year ago
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.940]  and now
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.980]  We're out mowing the yard got a nice tan
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.460]  Still a lot of bad things going on in the neighborhood
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.900]  But as a country we're on the mend and it's a dramatic
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.780]  miraculous recovery and then you look at the nastiness of
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:35.540]  The Democrats the nastiness the globalist the the Pope saying open your borders and you know
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:41.220]  Oh and attacking Catholics that the criticized pedophilia on the Catholic Church. He came out and said it's not going on leave us alone
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.300]  Truly evil
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.620]  And Justin Trudeau
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.700]  Puts pro-lipers on notice that their views won't be tolerated in public
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.700]  You're not allowed to put it out on the internet. I'm allowed to demonstrate you have no rights in Canada
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.700]  Man talk about authoritarianism
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:07.540]  That was what Trudeau said yesterday we just print me that and get the video if you can now we've got a blitzkrieg of video coming up and
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.500]  Just incredible breaking news on so many fronts and what's happened with the FISA
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.700]  Warrant and and what was filed to get it they say is
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:26.500]  Exponentially worse than the memos with the deputy director McCabe saying we we got to set the president up
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.980]  We can't let him get into office. We got to have an insurance policy
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.620]  And making stuff up. I mean this is Obama directing
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.920]  Viciously saying stop him. They're so arrogant. They don't even do it the right way if they were gonna be corrupt
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.920]  They're just like get him shut him up
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:50.380]  Here's the order like yes master. Yeah, I mean it's just incredible and all you Democrats that signed on to this
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:56.540]  You don't even get anything out of this. You're just idiots. They'll be back stay with us
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.780]  Top scientists and researchers agree
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:07.540]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat sick and
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.500]  Stupid so what do we do about it? Well for starters?

[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:39.780]  Oh, this is the fight
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.940]  This is how without violence we carry out violence against the liars
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.220]  scum
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:52.820]  The control freaks and their victims think that they're gonna run us over because I feel sorry for the victims of globalism
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.820]  But a lot of them are dangerous
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.020]  brainwashed bug-eyed heathen
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.900]  And I can keep telling them. I don't know how all this is gonna end
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.420]  But if you want to fight you better believe you got one
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.860]  And isn't it funny as soon as decent people
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.980]  Started fighting back across the world evil started falling just like dominoes
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:23.180]  Evil always seems unstoppable when it's running wild taking over
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.060]  Until it runs into real resistance
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.420]  And then it doesn't ever know what to do
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:38.620]  Because it believes its own delusion like CNN and MSNBC and all of them
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.540]  Can we queue up that clip one more time of Anderson Cooper in the New York Times editor?
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:50.940]  Saying I made up the FISA fake warrant and I made up the wiretapping and Comey says I'm crazy
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.700]  You know says Trump's crazy says everybody's crazy that says it
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.780]  When it was already on record then
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:07.060]  That's like they thought they'd tell you Obamacare was free and then once they got it passed they said oh
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.060]  It's as cheap as a cable bill
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:15.340]  Then they said you can keep your doctor and then they said they never said you can keep your doctors lies lies lies
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.780]  lies lies lies lies
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:28.020]  We're putting the articles on screen for TV viewers you want me to subject the audience the radio audience to come his voice
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:34.500]  Let's let's try to grab that because a he said crazy in one and insane in another
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.900]  The one was a March hearing one was like a little bit later than that
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.980]  And then I'm gonna just run through these clips I've got to stop pontificating
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:49.300]  But former Secret Service agent FISA memo will destroy image of benevolent Obama
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:53.420]  Comey to teach ethical leadership course at William and Mary
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:59.180]  That's like Jeffrey Dahmer will teach a course on not being a cannibal
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.700]  Or or I don't know
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.060]  Just crazy
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.700]  Chicago man files a pack called I'm gonna assassinate the president Donald J. Trump
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.820]  California AG says we'll prosecute employers who cooperate with ICE, you know, that's a federal jurisdiction
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  illegals on the border and
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.660]  And so then to say if you follow federal law
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:34.660]  And don't hire illegals or reporter or whatever we're gonna prosecute you that's called racketeering the very definition
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.860]  if you
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.420]  Follow the law
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.220]  And if you don't commit crimes
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.020]  Under our little thing here our little
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.340]  La Cosa Nostra our little thing
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:57.220]  Here in California in these cities. We're going to prosecute you
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.340]  Says the Attorney General
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.940]  See they passed laws in Illinois in California let illegal aliens vote
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.500]  But then the AG's would never sign off on it
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:15.860]  They would just kind of disappear them or the governor would sign them, but now they're so hyped up and crazy
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.380]  They're like listen
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.700]  We're not even going to convict people that shoot women in the back and basically admit they did it
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.860]  And they've got illegal aliens in these hearings was one this week saying when I get out of here
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.860]  I'm going to kill more people
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.940]  And the left's like we're gonna release you because
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.900]  It's such a in-your-face thing
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.500]  That the Democrat sheriff got voted out a black sheriff here in Travis County
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.020]  Just pointing out you know everybody's racist. They was a huge racist
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:49.140]  He went to poor average three people a week rapist arsonist murderers
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:53.980]  He would give them to ice out of hundreds and hundreds of illegals arrested and they voted him out man
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.540]  Democrats said no sir, buddy
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:02.220]  Illegal who killed cops wishes he'd kill more of the mother efforts. I will break out soon
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:08.380]  I will kill more the others video whenever played it. I should have laughing. I'm sorry. I'm digressing
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.940]  The Attorney General says
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.940]  You
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:19.420]  Stand up to that you report somebody who's illegal even if they just raped your daughter. I'm gonna put you in prison
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.260]  Whoa
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.340]  Whoa
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:28.940]  You don't use the proper pronoun for someone man or woman you call somebody man or woman and they didn't want to be called
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:34.380]  You're going to jail. What this sounds like the Tea Party, you know how Allison Wonderland
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:41.180]  But they're not crazy they're overturning everything to create destruction
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:47.700]  Here's that clip from CNN though again last March saying that we made up
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:51.540]  The illegal spying which is all confirmed in triple kid. Here it is
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:12:00.060]  And so this this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:07.180]  right-wing media and then after his tweet storm
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.420]  Info wars then started saying well look it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:16.900]  Misreading our story and now a few weeks later the White House and the president are citing
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.620]  Info wars so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing friends theory to defend another bizarre right wing friends theory
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:29.060]  Both of which there's no evidence to support and just to be clear here. There is and correct me if I'm wrong
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.460]  There's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:42.060]  Wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then candidate Trump correct nothing. I mean if we knew that that is a fantastic story. I
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.460]  Mean those guys look like
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:49.180]  They'd kill you for a stick of bubblegum. I mean they look disingenuous
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:54.340]  But of course there also are disingenuous and make fat liars. Just look at these two
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.140]  Think they're in love with themselves
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.140]  So here is
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:04.020]  Congressman Gates and others are saying that have seen the FISA document. It is
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:09.540]  Something they say is so criminal so over the top that these people are all gonna go to jail
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:15.620]  If the Attorney General does his job here it is. I think that this will not end just with firings
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.180]  I believe there are people who will go to jail
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:24.980]  I was very persuaded by the evidence and it also became clear to me why Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.900]  Felt it so important to refer this matter for criminal prosecution
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:34.820]  You don't get to try to undermine our country undermine our elections and then simply get fired
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.340]  So I think there will be criminal implications here
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:42.980]  And we have to underscore the point that you and Jim Jordan just made every single Democrat on the Intelligence Committee
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:47.940]  Voted against even allowing other members of Congress to see this information
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:53.260]  So you know they're gonna fight against release to the American people. What are the Democrats so afraid of?
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:59.940]  Why don't they want the American people to know the truth about what was going on with the government how that impacted the president?
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:06.660]  His transition his campaign and it just seems interesting to me that Democrats don't want us to know what the entire
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:09.700]  Basis was in the first place for the Mueller probe
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:16.820]  They want to you drag this out through the midterm elections to try to embarrass this president and distract this Congress from the critical
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.180]  Work we've got to do to save this great country

[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.020]  Democrat cabal inside the Justice Department directed by Hillary and Obama
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:40.180]  We had that map last week. We were kept showing her this week
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.580]  I mean it shows like the crime chart and it's all confirmed now
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.940]  Right down to the American people right to the FISA court right to the whole system and
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:56.060]  So just like they had that compartmentalized in Congress the Democrats are like no no no don't don't look at the warrant
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:02.260]  Because it's got El Presidente's fingerprints on it now. There's the map. So you've got Lynch and
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.020]  combing under Obama and
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.380]  Then you've got Sally Yates and you've got Andrew McCabe
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:14.820]  and you've got or and Carlin and Lisa Page and Peter Strock and Baker and

[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.180]  the fraud and
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:35.100]  Then they shovel it out through the media and now the Democrats in Congress like Peter ship and the rest of them fight
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.100]  Like drowning rats
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:45.440]  Scrabbling scrabbling as the water rises and attempt to get out there be rat eyes
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.300]  Rubbing the rat like hands together
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.940]  What are we gonna do politically is the water of truth rises

[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.660]  Cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:09.300]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:16.660]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:23.380]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:28.340]  top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.140]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:38.740]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market the stronger the anti-oxidant
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:44.220]  The better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals

[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:21.420]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones show
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:28.880]  So we talk a lot about how there's parallel universes and the globalist controlled media
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.200]  Claims that
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:41.240]  We are living in some fake echo chamber libertarians conservatives nationalists common-sense people and they're living in the real world
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:48.480]  Well, really this fies a document and the fact that Congress has it and the fact that Obama did order the illegal spying with false info on Trump
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.960]  has been out now
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.060]  For a couple days and there's been almost no news coverage of it
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:59.860]  except on places like drudge report comm and info wars comm and
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.820]  Newsweek is saying that it's a conspiracy theory still
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:11.500]  That none of this existed nobody ever spied on the president or anybody else
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:19.780]  Even when it's now admitted in congressional testimony and Comey's been caught perjuring himself. It just gets crazier and crazier
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:27.820]  And now we've got Hannity coming out saying, you know disband the russia gate. It's a total fraud
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.060]  Then they spent it oh, you're scared of it
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.180]  No, it's a total fraud created by Democrat Party holdovers
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:42.780]  Inside the Justice Department. We now understand it's a total fraud. There's nothing to fear, but I'll tell you this I
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.100]  Say leave it there. It's so embarrassing to the establishment, but
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.460]  President Trump reportedly is agreeing to meet with Mueller
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.900]  I'm sure the president knows what he's doing
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:59.820]  But he better record it because Mueller will come out and tell a lie just like Comey did because Mueller is involved with the
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:06.180]  Communist Chinese the Russians he has been waivers from the Justice Department to do so. These are the bad actors
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.260]  They're really bad people
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:15.540]  This is a very very critical time to be alive right now. Let's play a clip of Hannity talking about this
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.300]  Now at the end of all of this
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:25.340]  We're gonna learn an awful lot beyond any shadow of a doubt that the special counsel Robert Mueller and his band of
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:30.500]  Democratic witch hunters never should have been appointed and they need to be disbanded immediately
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:37.700]  And here's why struck and page are connected to everything. What we're learning tonight is that these two trumpeting individuals?
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.900]  They're at the heart and soul and center of it all. I'll stop right there
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:45.860]  They'll have ninety six hundred texts. Let's put that map back up if we can of the different players
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:51.100]  Hannity, I'm not criticizing Hannity because he's got more courage anybody else on mainstream television
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:53.260]  But this is still watered down
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:59.340]  Most of these people are involved with the Russians and the Chinese and covering up previous Clinton crimes
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:04.380]  So they're not just creating a fraud to derail the election of a patriotic
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.380]  Great president
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:16.540]  They're not just witch hunters. They're not just haters they organized criminal activity to defraud the American voter of this recovery
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:22.460]  So it's much much worse than what Hannity saying the Russian investigation has been dead for months
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:27.620]  It's like shooting an old dead horse 50 more times. It's still it's still a dead horse
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:34.900]  The issue is what are these people gonna dig up next and are we gonna sit there and put up with them? I?
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:40.740]  Know Hannity doesn't want to sound too extreme, but they are extreme
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:45.100]  Obama ran this whole thing. He needs to go to prison
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:50.260]  These people aren't above the law. These aren't Americans. These are globalists. Oh
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:55.100]  It'll cause a civil war. They're already trying to cause one
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:24:03.820]  Justice be done by the heavens fall. We have to attack them legally and lawfully. We have to go after Soros
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.980]  We have to defeat them all they're not going to stop
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.980]  Like World War two you don't just kick Hitler back into Germany. He's gonna reconstitute attack again
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.620]  You don't just kick the Japanese out of the Pacific Islands you got to go all the way to Tokyo
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.620]  They started it
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.500]  You think I want to keep going up against these people when they're after me no
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:35.980]  But whatever has to happen is gonna happen. We're going all the way against these people period. We have to do it
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.980]  There's no other choice
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.020]  They've all got a politically
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.180]  hang
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:44.180]  for their crimes
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.420]  And incidentally
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.420]  You
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.940]  Know what the punishment for treason is
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.740]  These are the foreign individuals that took our country over
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:03.060]  They're the ones that corrupted everything almost the point of the country's death and they're still trying to strangle the country today
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.300]  We must stand against them
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.420]  All right moving along
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:13.500]  Just looking into an area of total fraud
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:20.060]  Total disingenuousness total upside-down world is bono of
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.620]  You too that I guess might have been cool 30 years ago
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.180]  That is the
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:34.260]  Propaganda arm of the UN the globalist every pump and up scheme every scam to go have African aid and then you learn that Bono's
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:40.140]  Charity gives less than 1% and under pressure. He gives 1.2%
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.700]  Bono's one foundation
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:49.780]  Gives under 1% under fire. Go read it for yourself daily mail. You name it
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:57.020]  He's worse than the Clintons they gave like two and a half percent to Haiti and stole all the rest
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:59.060]  Doesn't matter though
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:03.740]  He can virtue signal and have a big music video showing dead kids washing up on the shore
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.100]  It's our fault Muslims are killing each other and showing the KKK
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.100]  Marching
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:21.380]  This guy's so dialed into everything on Spotify or on your car or you have to go in and program it not to force feed you
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.020]  Bono songs
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:30.100]  You look at up the news they default force feed you him I mean they are the biggest
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:33.860]  Globalist whores on the planet and
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.620]  And they're the ones
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:45.460]  Robbing the world and then having graphics of mall off cocktails
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.620]  Telling you to go out and burn down
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:59.620]  Cracker land fight back with a mall off cocktail and
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:05.140]  Stop being a slave of the system
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.580]  That's right. Don't get the tax cuts. Don't don't don't get the health care
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:14.420]  Don't don't get a stabilized economy. Don't get a world built for people that believes in people. No
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:25.340]  And then a bunch of iconography about death oh, but then showing you a bunch of children the world all living together, but under who
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:36.860]  Under who who's gonna run the big world government who's gonna control the big world government who's gonna direct it
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:42.780]  Oh, it's a secret TPP. It's it's a secret directorate. You can't even know what it is kind of like
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:49.460]  Oh, Congress came and see the FISA warrant against Trump because it's the fusing GPS and was directed by
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:54.740]  Obama we know Susan Rice and all them that were unmasking
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.860]  Privately going into everybody's data their phones their emails. They were just sitting in the White House peering over
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:03.260]  Ivanka Trump and
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.540]  peering over Melania Trump and
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:11.180]  Pouring over Don, Jr. And Donald Trump and Donald Trump, Jr
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:14.380]  Just in there
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:15.940]  beavering away and
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:20.020]  Then leaking stuff to the press but 90% false but enough truth in it
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:27.700]  To make it believable in something beyond the East German stausee could ever have imagined and
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.860]  Then they still have the New York Times and
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:36.900]  CNN saying none of it's true none of it's true as they have hearings and admit it's all true as
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.700]  They hang on by their fingernails
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:47.340]  But the wind gets stronger stronger and now they're hanging on by one hand and they're never gonna hang on even if they kill the president
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:48.300]  They're done

[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:49.980]  And that's who they are.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.500]  And they know we know who they are.

[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:44.060]  And we are back live.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:47.860]  You know, Bono and you too have a lot of nerve putting on a new music video
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.340]  saying that the president is a KKK member
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.180]  and that members of the staff at home
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.620]  go home at night to their families
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.780]  and hang up their KKK robes.
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:58.820]  It's simply incredible because there's no proof,
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.340]  there's no truth to it.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.980]  But on top of that, it's defamation and slander
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.700]  to attempt to create race war that we know is in the WikiLeaks
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:08.500]  where the Democrats talk about creating culture war
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.900]  and race war as a way to maintain control.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.180]  But the biggest issue is the Daily Mail and others report
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:22.100]  that you too is on record and Bono keeping 99% or more
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.380]  of the money from mainly African charities they run.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:27.460]  So they have these big music telethons,
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:30.260]  broadcasts worldwide, sometimes they raise over a billion dollars.
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.780]  They keep 99% personally.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.100]  Bono's one foundation under fire for giving little over 1%.
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:41.140]  First it was 0.8, now they give 1.2.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:47.540]  Think about what a monster he is, but lowest black unemployment
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.780]  ever recorded, Trump targeting abortion,
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:52.580]  which targets mainly blacks, 52% being aborted,
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:54.660]  Trump trying to move the factories back
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.420]  into the African-American areas.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:57.460]  All that's the proof.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:01.300]  Doesn't matter, Bono says he's KKK.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:04.820]  Think about how that's a perfect cover
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.300]  for what he is really up to.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:13.540]  Now, Joining Us is an amazing lady with billions of views
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:16.980]  of her videos and articles just on Facebook and Twitter alone.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.740]  Most of you know who she is.
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:19.860]  I've followed her for years.
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:23.700]  And she's able to mobilize conservatives, libertarians,
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:26.900]  Christians, just people that are common sense, activist mommy,
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.820]  to be able to go look at what's happening in the schools
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.980]  where they're teaching children masturbation,
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.500]  where children's magazines are teaching little girls about anal sex
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:42.180]  so that they depopulate just all sorts of incredible things.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.460]  The latest thing is the promotion of sex toys
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:49.780]  to little girls and also prosthetic penises
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:52.740]  so that they can learn to be transgender,
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:54.900]  even Camille Pagley, who's more of a liberal lesbian,
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.020]  says this is child abuse.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.980]  Meanwhile, no leftist criticism of Turkish state
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:04.020]  moving to legalize marrying girls age nine,
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:05.460]  Netflix hosting shows,
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:08.260]  about sex with children and how great it is,
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.860]  Salon pushing it.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.180]  They're not getting banned from Twitter.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:15.060]  She has been banned from Twitter.
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.140]  And we've been contacted by Twitter and they said,
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.940]  if you use the T word,
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.620]  must use transgender,
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:26.900]  if you use the name that that community created themselves,
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.940]  you will be banned.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:29.780]  And I said to the guys,
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:32.020]  we documented it all, took the phone calls, recorded it,
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.060]  told them we were.
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.380]  I said, let's watch the process of this.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:36.740]  When there's new words,
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.740]  they've called, there's new words.
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.100]  So what it is is just training.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.620]  And pretty soon,
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.300]  they'll tell you what you got to do when you're gone.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.060]  But we're making a documentary out of it.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.980]  Let Twitter know that we've infiltrated them,
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:48.900]  as you know, in Project Veritas as well,
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.220]  where they go, oh, we do what the Communist Chinese tell us
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:52.740]  and what the Democrats tell us.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.700]  And we record women naked and we save it on our computers.
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:56.660]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.420]  It's all very, very funny to them.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.020]  And they're the new ruling class.
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:01.060]  They're the technocrats.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:04.580]  So, put into abstention, put into the memory hole.
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.220]  And people say, well, that's their own platform.
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:08.420]  But they're discriminatory.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:09.860]  You have the left, Suzy,
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.780]  if you don't bake a gay couple's cake.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:14.340]  I mean, I do it, because I just think it's free market.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.340]  But the point is, if you want to, it should be your right.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:18.180]  Oh, that's a multi-hundred thousand dollar fine.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.660]  But if you want to say you're a Christian
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.700]  and teaching five-year-old girls how to have anal sex is wrong,
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:24.660]  you're banned.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:27.940]  So the activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, joins us.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:31.060]  Was it Twitter, activist mommy, one, Facebook,
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:33.940]  the activist mommy, Instagram, the activist mommy official,
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.460]  YouTube, the activist mommy.
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.940]  And it's smart to have lots of platforms like she does.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.260]  This is like whack-a-mole as they try to ban you.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.980]  So, so much to get into, so much to talk about.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:44.980]  I don't know if you saw Trump about an hour ago
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:47.220]  giving the first ever Republican speech
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.140]  to the right to life march.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.620]  This is a pretty seismic deal.
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:53.540]  And I, they don't know what to do about Trump
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.260]  because it seems like he's breaking their will
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.020]  and giving everybody else the courage
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.980]  to stand against this cultural jihad
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.140]  to shut down free speech that the left's been on.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.260]  So thanks for joining us.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.020]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:08.900]  That is good to have you.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.860]  Where do you want to start?
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.060]  I mean, the censorship, the latest sexualization of children.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:13.940]  What's going on?
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:16.260]  Oh, you tell me.
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:22.500]  I am banned for four days.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.260]  I did not use the team.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:27.460]  You know, we're going to do something here.
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:30.020]  I know you do big videos and big shows all the time.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.060]  That's probably on our end,
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.260]  but we're going to get your phone number.
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:33.460]  It's great to be able to see you on Skype.
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.780]  We're going to call you right back on backup
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:37.860]  and get you on that way because we're going to check
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.460]  our Skype system here or whatever.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:40.660]  It's been having some issues.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:42.180]  Seems to have to be better in that studio,
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.060]  but maybe it's just me.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.260]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:45.460]  We're going to figure that out
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.060]  and see if we can get her on air with us.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.420]  But I mean, just think about this.
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.420]  I really just wanted to have her on
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.420]  because I don't want her on.
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:58.420]  Because she's someone who's been put into a memory hole.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.460]  She's someone who's been shot off into space.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.460]  And you know info wars is next.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:06.420]  You know Paul Watson's next.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.420]  And we've got video of them saying,
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:10.420]  hey, we're censoring Jones on YouTube.
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.460]  We don't want people to share the videos.
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:15.460]  You just got to go to his Alex Jones channel to find them.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:18.420]  And if we see something trending, we block it
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:21.460]  because they know there's major lawsuit liability for them.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:24.460]  So they had to act like they're still allowing us to be there.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:26.460]  And they have the congressional hearings with the Twitter,
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.460]  Facebook and Google executives where they're sitting there
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.460]  in everyone's face.
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:34.460]  But there's one way you can stop them.
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.460]  And that is to continue to support us on AM and FM stations,
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.460]  local TV stations more and more picking us up.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.460]  That's our big push this year.

[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.460]  Here's a survival shield X2 review.
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:41:00.460]  Excellent to the max says wrongfully accused hippies out of Maryland.

[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:07.460]  It is so vigorous life affirming taste.

[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.460]  Continuing, this is from Candace, none is closed location.
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:17.460]  This stuff is the best.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.460]  Never go a day without it.
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:23.460]  Five stars, five stars, clean and efficient product.

[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:27.460]  And we just print the latest reviews just in order.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.460]  We're not even cherry picking these.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.460]  Here's another one from Jar's law.
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.460]  Five stars.
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:37.460]  He's from a closed location, verified purchaser.
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:41.460]  I purchased this one and I am talking with some other supplements
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:44.460]  from Info Wars and working great, taste amazing.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:48.460]  And now all my family is taking it every morning.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:49.460]  That's on secret 12.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.460]  Here's another one.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.460]  This is never felt better.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:56.460]  Charles undisclosed.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460]  Here's another one.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:00.460]  Leon says love the taste and very easy to take.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.460]  They're all talking about secret 12.
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:05.460]  People say, why does pure B12 taste so good?
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.460]  It's like a precursor to your whole body.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:08.460]  You got to have it.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.460]  X2 is just incredible.
[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:12.460]  I take it in water and take it right under the tongue.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:17.460]  And again, if you want to do something for yourself,
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:20.460]  more vitamin C and more high quality iodine.
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:22.460]  You die without both of these.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.460]  And a vitamin C is plentiful.
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:28.460]  Iodine is just one of the things that people are so deficient in
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:31.460]  and not the bound to iodine, the sodium iodine,
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.460]  the other garbage out there, but the real iodine.
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:35.460]  We've got true atomic pure iodine.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:40.460]  Available at infowarsstore.com or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.460]  Oh, and we have the new pollen block that folks are really loving.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.460]  Check out pollen block.
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.460]  It's a Japanese quail egg.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.460]  The quailer's a special diet.
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:50.460]  They don't know why.
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:43:04.460]  It's so good for seasonal distress, you know, the stuff with the sinuses.
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:23.460]  We've got a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2,
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.460]  SuperMell Vitality and so many others,
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:29.460]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.460]  designed for maximized effects.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:35.460]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.460]  And this part is most important.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:42.460]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:44.460]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:46.460]  That means it's clean.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:47.460]  That means it's pure.
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:50.460]  And rest-secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the M4WAR.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:53.460]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.460]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.460]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.460]  The new product at infowarslife.com.
[01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:03.460]  In a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:06.460]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:09.460]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:12.460]  A new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:15.460]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:21.460]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:27.460]  But it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:31.460]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:36.460]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:39.460]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:43.460]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.460]  to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:48.460]  It is amazing.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:52.460]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:45:21.460]  And your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:26.460]  You can eat protein heavy foods now,
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:31.460]  while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:35.460]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:39.460]  and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:44.460]  Cardivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates,
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.460]  so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:48.460]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:50.460]  Use carnivore by InfowarsLife.

[01:46:54.460 --> 01:47:18.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:22.460]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:26.460]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:35.460]  Live from the Infoworks.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.460]  Look at this report from LifeSite.
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:43.460]  Facebook says group wanting to burn alive Christian mom meets community standards,
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:46.460]  but she's banned from Twitter.
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.460]  So we're going to talk to a lady who's reached billions of people
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.460]  and who they're targeting and who's been banned from Twitter.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.460]  The activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:48:00.460]  So, Elizabeth, let's get into why you're so hated, why you're so feared,
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:04.460]  and why they're trying to ban you.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:09.460]  Hi, Alex. I'm so sorry about the technical problems we've had.
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:13.460]  Look, you know, I don't toe the line,
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.460]  and I am pushing back against some of their pet agendas.
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:23.460]  I push back against the feminazis and the LGBT agenda
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.460]  and the slaughtering of children through abortion,
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:30.460]  brainwashing our children to think Islam is a religion of peace.
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:36.460]  These are the things that I address on my platform through articles
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.460]  and videos that I create.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:44.460]  And, you know, I am being censored frequently.
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:49.460]  Last year was banned from Facebook for first three days
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.460]  and then seven days for clothing,
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:54.460]  just simply what the Bible says about homosexuality.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:57.460]  That was a worldwide story that hit Fox and Friends
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:03.460]  and George Report and The New York Times and, of course, Facebook apologized
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:08.460]  and said that it was an error once the story had gotten to be so big
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:13.460]  that it was a PR nightmare for them and they restored, you know, my account.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.460]  My account, back to me.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:20.460]  And right now there's a story going that there's a group on Facebook
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.460]  called I Will Find Activist Mommy and Burn Whoever Runs It Alive.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:28.460]  And people, hundreds, thousands of people have reported it.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:34.460]  And Facebook said that that death threat does not go against their community standards
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.460]  and they're not going to remove the group from Facebook.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:42.460]  It's amazing and the same stuff happens to me.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.460]  It happens to Trump.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:47.460]  It happens to everybody who's prominently just promoting traditionalist values
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.460]  that are not being tolerated, that are under siege.
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:56.460]  And I noticed they let transgenders use the other T-word that we can't use or were banned.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:01.460]  So it's also very discriminatory that that terms in newspapers.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.460]  And I was reading, it says, Wikipedia says,
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:08.460]  Twitter decided in 2017 that it was a hate word,
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:11.460]  even though it's a word that comes from that very group.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:15.460]  So even if we buckle under and only use words they use,
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.460]  they'll then tell us that we can't use a word, but they can.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.460]  This is true authoritarianism.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.460]  It is George Orwell's 1984 for sure.
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:28.460]  The thing is though, Alex, I don't use that term.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:31.460]  And that's not why I'm banned from Twitter.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:37.460]  The reason Twitter banned me is because I said that a transgender teenager
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:42.460]  who committed suicide, poor child committed suicide,
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:46.460]  claimed it was because the high school that he attended
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:52.460]  did not allow him to change his sex, his name until he was 16.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:54.460]  That was the policy of the school.
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:59.460]  And supposedly that was the reason that this boy was so unhappy and committed suicide.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:05.460]  I made a comment on Twitter with this article four months ago, Alex.
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:10.460]  Four months ago they just found this and decided to make an issue of it.
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:15.460]  I made the comment that the LGBT community is responsible
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:20.460]  and is harming transgender teenagers by not getting them
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:25.460]  the psychological and emotional help and counseling that they need.
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:30.460]  40% of transgenders attempt to commit suicide
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:36.460]  versus 4% of the non-transgender of the general population.
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:46.460]  And it clearly transgenders need to get psychological and emotional counseling.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:52.460]  And it's not being offered to them because the LGBT community
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:56.460]  is enabling these young people and it's making them feel that they are entitled
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.460]  to their sex changes and their game changes.
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:05.460]  I made that type of comment and now I am banned from Twitter for seven days.
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:09.460]  They are in essence putting me through sensitivity training right now.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:16.460]  Wow. And expanding on that, the gay community, which I don't hate anybody,
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:19.460]  on average, diverse group of people, but on average they have the highest level
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:22.460]  of suicide globally of any group.
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:26.460]  And it's not because folks are being mean to them, it's because that community is being mean to them.
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:29.460]  I've seen the studies, I've witnessed it for myself.
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:32.460]  I've had friends, family, neighbors that are gay, you go to their party,
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.460]  they're being meaner than hell to each other.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.460]  A lot of gay people are really mean.
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:41.460]  And let's not lie about that and let's not lie about how they treat each other
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:44.460]  and that lesbians have the highest level of abusing each other.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:47.460]  And I don't hate women that like women.
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:50.460]  The whole point is they don't want to discuss why they have the highest rates
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:52.460]  of drug use suicide.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.460]  And then in that group, the transgenders are even bigger
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.460]  and I'm going into four and five-year-olds in England telling them
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:01.460]  you may be something else and then having major mental illness problems.
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:05.460]  Well, of course, they are sexualizing children.
[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:07.460]  It's a giant experiment.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:10.460]  It's being run by the Tavistock Institute and of course it's creating big problems.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:14.460]  And you point out, as Camille Paglia does, who's a liberal and a professor,
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.460]  that this is abuse.
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:21.460]  It's abuse when you go to anybody and start sexualizing them at age five, six, seven, eight.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.460]  Go ahead.
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:28.460]  Yeah, one of the things, Alex, one of the things that really has drawn a lot of attention
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:32.460]  to my platform, I don't know if you heard about it last year,
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:38.460]  is that I burned a Teen Vogue magazine when Teen Vogue was teaching teenagers,
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.460]  kids, how to stautomize one another.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:44.460]  Oh yeah, tell folks about that.
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:52.460]  Yeah, they printed a tutorial online of how to have anal sex.
[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:57.460]  And I was livid, as were millions of parents.
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.460]  And so I filmed a quick two-minute video, burned a Teen Vogue magazine,
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:10.460]  called it smut and called upon the public to go to their stores and their libraries
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:15.460]  and make sure that Teen Vogue was not being carried,
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:17.460]  that it was being pulled from the shelves.
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:20.460]  We started hashtag Operation Pull Teen Vogue.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:27.460]  And as you probably know, we gave Teen Vogue such a black eye that they have not recovered from it.
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:32.460]  And they actually had to shutter their print edition.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:39.460]  December was their last print edition because we have really done such damage to their reputation.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:42.460]  And by the way, I mean, I totally agree and you've done a great job.
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:43.460]  That's why they fear you.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:48.460]  Look at how the Metro, the biggest paper in London, printed cartoons of children having sex
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:51.460]  and told parents to sexualize their children.
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:56.460]  We've got countless examples of this in the news, in the TV shows, on Netflix.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:02.460]  This is clearly, in my view, a mainlining of pedophilic culture.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.460]  What do you think?
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:05.460]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:12.460]  I'm sure you're familiar with the book written in, I believe, 1958 called the Naked Communist.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.460]  Yes.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:22.460]  They lay out goals of the Communist Party USA and one of their goals, number 40, is discredit
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:28.460]  the family as an institution, encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:36.460]  Goal number 25 is break down culture standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity
[01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:40.460]  in books, magazines, and motion pictures, radio, and TV.
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:49.460]  Our local law enforcement are cowards, straight up cowards, because they will not enforce
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:55.460]  the good and decent obscenity laws that are on our books nationwide.
[01:55:55.460 --> 01:56:02.460]  Every state, every city has great obscenity laws, but no one is enforcing them.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.460]  This has to stop.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:12.460]  Now we have pornographic, graphic interbending sex ed in our elementary schools and middle
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:14.460]  schools and high schools.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:20.460]  That's why we started something called sex ed sit out, and I want to ask all of your
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:23.460]  listeners please to go to Facebook right now.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:30.460]  A bunch of us moms have started a movement called sex ed sit out, and on April 23rd,
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:36.460]  we are going to pull our children out of the public schools in protest of the pornographic
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:38.460]  sex ed in the schools.
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:43.460]  Please go to Facebook search bar at the top and type in sex ed sit out and like our page
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.460]  and get involved in our movement.
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:49.460]  Well please come back on for that as soon as we get our Skype fix for yours or whatever
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:55.460]  it is or phone, because absolutely we see this big push back against this all over the
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:57:00.460]  world, and they always said oh you're just ignorant, you're like Amish or something, you
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:03.460]  don't want people knowing about their body parts, give me a break.
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:11.460]  They are sexualizing, they are trying to teach young people deviant fetish behavior, because
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:19.460]  the left has fetishized sexualizing children, even salon, even the New York Times are promoting
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.460]  pedophilia.
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.460]  That is the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:26.460]  I want to come back in two minutes to five more minutes with the activist mommy about
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:30.460]  where she sees the state of the fight today.

[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:53.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:53.460 --> 02:00:00.460]  Coming to you from the former United States of America.
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:03.460]  From deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.460]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:07.460]  That's right. We've been under globalism.
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:08.460]  Our country was under TPP.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.460]  Really was lost at sovereignty.
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.460]  Trump's turning that around.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:13.460]  Pretty soon we'll have to not play those liners anymore
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:15.460]  because they won't be able to play those liners anymore.
[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:25.460]  But we're in the middle of a civil war right now.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:27.460]  What an amazing lady.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.460]  Dariah, one of our producers said,
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:31.460]  why don't you get an activist mommy on.
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:32.460]  I've been watching her for years.
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.460]  That lady's really on point.
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:35.460]  She leads all these major attacks.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.460]  And they're wanting her dead now.
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:38.460]  I said absolutely.
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:40.460]  So I want to get her on anytime she wants to come on.
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:42.460]  Just an amazing individual.
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:45.460]  And I wanted to ask her in this short segment before Peter Schiff
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:48.460]  joins us on The Economy and for Roger Stonebreak's major news
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:50.460]  on what's going on behind the scenes with FISA
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.460]  and how Obama was behind that.
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:55.460]  He broke that in April of last year.
[02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:57.460]  So next year's news today, that's coming up.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:00.460]  But I wanted to get activist mommy Elizabeth Johnson
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:03.460]  to talk more about where she sees the battle now.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:06.460]  And again, we're not flogging it.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:09.460]  The sleeping majority of everybody out there,
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:12.460]  every race, color and creed that loves just being decent
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:16.460]  and trying to not be overtaken by the leftist agenda.
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:18.460]  We have to get aggressive.
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:19.460]  We have to get out in the field.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.460]  We have to take action.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.460]  So where are we right now at this juncture, this fight,
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:26.460]  and you're really the expert in battled frontline view?
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:30.460]  And what can people do in the culture war?
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:33.460]  Well, Alex, as you were saying, the radical left
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:38.460]  has waged war against the natural family.
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:41.460]  You know, father and mother and child,
[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:47.460]  and has waged war against really all things decent.
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:52.460]  And we must wake up as a culture, as parents,
[02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:55.460]  and push back against this indoctrination.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:58.460]  You know, one person burned a team of magazine
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.460]  and look at the shock waves, look at what happened.
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:05.460]  One person pushing back in your sphere of influence,
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.460]  whether it's going to your city council meeting and saying,
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:12.460]  no, we're not going to have men in the girls locker room.
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:15.460]  Whatever God is calling you to do,
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:19.460]  answer the voice and the passion that he's given you,
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:23.460]  and answer that call and push back against this attack
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:27.460]  on the family, the attack on decency,
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:31.460]  the attack on everything that's made America good,
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.460]  and let's work together to make America great again.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:38.460]  I mean, ultimately, you know, this is a spiritual problem
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:40.460]  that we have in this nation.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:42.460]  We need to return to our Creator.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:45.460]  We need to turn from our sin and our selfishness.
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:50.460]  And we need to get back to the way the founding fathers
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:56.460]  believed our nation should be run as one nation under God.
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:57.460]  You're right.
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:59.460]  And again, they use our strength against us
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:02.460]  that America is open, Christianity is tolerant.
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:04.460]  And then they've gone from tolerance to now.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:07.460]  We have to adopt all the things that the left's doing,
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:10.460]  including hundreds of new bizarre fetishes
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:12.460]  that are even being taught in school,
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:16.460]  like being married to a car, having sex with a car,
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.460]  burning your eyeballs out with Drano,
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.460]  and then the government pays for you to be blind
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.460]  or paying to have sex changes.
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:24.460]  I mean, I don't pay for people's nose jobs.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:26.460]  How did we ever get in this position
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:29.460]  of just these people dictating everything to us?
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:31.460]  And not even the average leftist,
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:35.460]  but these would be cultural kings.
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:37.460]  Oh, yeah, you're so right.
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:41.460]  I mean, Alex, facts and science and truth matter.
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:45.460]  And because I say two plus one equals five doesn't mean,
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:47.460]  it doesn't make it true.
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:51.460]  And this trendy new phrase that people want to say,
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:55.460]  gender is binary and it's on a spectrum.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:59.460]  No, no, biologically, scientifically,
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:02.460]  we are XX or XY,
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:05.460]  or we have a disorder.
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:08.460]  We have an abnormality, either a biological
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:11.460]  or a psychological abnormality,
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:13.460]  and we need treatment.
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:18.460]  Look, what I say, Alex, is we just need some straight talk
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:22.460]  from American citizens and from the mom and dad
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.460]  to the world, and that's why people follow me,
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.460]  is I just shoot straight.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:29.460]  This is stupid. This gender insanity job
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:32.460]  is one of the stupidest moments.
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:35.460]  As you know, they're firing professors that just point out
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:37.460]  men and women in the whole mammal species
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:40.460]  have these chromosomes. It's crazy.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:43.460]  Activists, mommy, please join us again very soon.

[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:31.460]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:33.460]  Roger Stone's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:37.460]  He was the first to report on Obama using Fusion GPS
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:40.460]  to basically illegally fraudulently get warrants
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:43.460]  against candidate Trump, nominee Trump,
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:45.460]  President-elect Trump,
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:47.460]  and then I guess ongoing when he was a president,
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.460]  Trump knew about it as the president.
[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:51.460]  He said it's classified, I can't tell you,
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:54.460]  they've spied on me.
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:56.460]  And we broke all that news last year,
[02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:58.460]  seeing it in a tactics, you name it, said it wasn't true.
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:01.460]  And now members of Congress that have seen the memo
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:04.460]  say it's Obama directly ordering it.
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:06.460]  And just like in the other memos,
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:08.460]  they say we've got to stop Trump.
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:10.460]  They admit it's a fraud.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:13.460]  It's the arrogance of narcissistic criminals
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:15.460]  that always brings them down.
[02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:20.460]  Their boldness is something that makes them successful.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:23.460]  And the fact that they leave a trail of destruction behind them
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:26.460]  and ruin every business they're in or family, they don't care,
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:29.460]  because they're just onto the next scam.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:33.460]  So we're dealing with narcissists, sociopaths,
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.460]  and psychopaths, and then mercenaries that'll work for them.
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:39.460]  And they just ruin civilization.
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:41.460]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:45.460]  Peter Schiff of EuroPak.com, American businessman,
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:47.460]  investor, broker, billions under management.
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:50.460]  I'm not going to get into this by everybody knows him,
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:54.460]  best-selling author, run for Senate, things like that.
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:57.460]  It was Ron Paul's chief economic advisor,
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:59.460]  always liked getting him on.
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:04.460]  I wanted to get him on about the fact that I predicted
[02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:07.460]  that if Trump got in, we'd see the economy explode.
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:10.460]  Because I mean, I knew we had artificial globalist policies
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:12.460]  in place suppressing our economy.
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:15.460]  And I know the whole world's a bubble and all the rest of it,
[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:20.460]  but if you remove the rope tied around us at the dock on the boat,
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:23.460]  it's going to start running out there into the ocean.
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:26.460]  Now, I know that China's a big bubble and we're a big bubble,
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:31.460]  but I got to tell you, we've had some debates here with Mr. Schiff,
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:34.460]  who's also believed that there was some chances of big growth.
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:38.460]  And then we've had some other folks who didn't think that,
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.460]  thought there's no way because of demographic cliffs.
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:41.460]  And I get demographic cliffs,
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:44.460]  but if you've got things artificially suppressed here,
[02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:47.460]  and then built up there, then if Trump comes in and removes
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:49.460]  a bunch of regulations and taxes,
[02:08:49.460 --> 02:08:51.460]  won't that at least in the interim boost things?
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:52.460]  I think you're seeing that.
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:54.460]  Krugman said it would never get above 3%.
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.460]  It's a 3.3.
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:09:00.460]  You see Trump giving his number one award to the New York Times
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.460]  for betting against America.
[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:05.460]  So I agree the fundamentals are crazy.
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:06.460]  I'm not an economist.
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:08.460]  I just study this stuff.
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:12.460]  And at the same time, aren't you glad things haven't blown up yet?
[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:14.460]  The question is, will they?
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:15.460]  What's going to happen?
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:17.460]  And then what's happening with cryptocurrencies,
[02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:20.460]  seeming like that bubble is starting to bust
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:23.460]  as regulators start to go after them.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:25.460]  So we'll find out about this and a lot more
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:28.460]  from Peter Schiff at EuroPak.com.
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.460]  Peter, good to have you back with us.
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:31.460]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:33.460]  And happy New Year to you and your audience.
[02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:35.460]  And I agree with you.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:36.460]  The economy is going to blow up,
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:38.460]  but it's going to blow up like a bomb.
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:39.460]  It's not a good thing.
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.460]  It's a bad thing.
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:46.460]  Unfortunately, that's what Trump has inherited from Obama.
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:48.460]  But it's not even really just Obama.
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:49.460]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:52.460]  It's the monetary policy that has been passed like a baton
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:57.460]  from Clinton to Bush to Obama and now to Trump.
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:59.460]  And we're near the end of the game.
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:02.460]  And unfortunately, Trump's going to be the fall guy.
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:05.460]  This thing is all going to collapse while he's president.
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.460]  And he owns the stock market bubble.
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.460]  He and the Republicans own the economy now
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:10.460]  thanks to these tax cuts.
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:12.460]  They're not going to make any difference,
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.460]  but they are going to give the Democrats a reason
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:17.460]  to blame it all on Trump and the Republicans.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:20.460]  But we are getting closer to this collapse.
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:21.460]  You mentioned GDP growth.
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:24.460]  Last year, the economy, the way they measure at GDP,
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.460]  will probably end up being a little bit above
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:27.460]  two and a half percent for the year,
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.460]  which is about the same as we were getting.
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:32.460]  A little bit better maybe than the average
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:34.460]  of the last four years under Obama.
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.460]  But there were years that Obama had higher than that.
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:40.460]  But the important thing is if you look at what's happening
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:44.460]  in the dollar, for example, last year was the first year
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:47.460]  in five years that the dollar went down
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:50.460]  and it was the biggest decline in 14 years.
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:54.460]  We had the biggest drop against the Chinese yuan in nine years.
[02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:56.460]  And in fact, I think this year we're going to fall
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:59.460]  to an all-time record low against the yuan.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:01.460]  I think we're going to hit record lows
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.460]  against other major currencies like the euro
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:06.460]  and the yen maybe by 2019 or 2020.
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:07.460]  Look at the bond market.
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:11.460]  We're at about a four-year high now in ten-year treasuries.
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:13.460]  But bond prices are rising.
[02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:14.460]  Look at oil.
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:17.460]  Oil is now back at $63, $64 a barrel.
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:20.460]  We've had a huge increase, but we're just getting started.
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:21.460]  Gold is on the verge of breaking out.
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:23.460]  It hasn't really done it yet.
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:25.460]  We're still trading around $1340.
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:28.460]  But what's happening is inflation is rearing its ugly head
[02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:29.460]  in a big way.
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:32.460]  And this is going to help push up interest rates.
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:35.460]  And what Trump has done, or what the Republicans
[02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:37.460]  have done with these tax cuts,
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.460]  they're not going to help the economy
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:41.460]  because the economy has so many other headwinds
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.460]  that are going to hit it.
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:44.460]  But they are going to push up the deficit.
[02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:46.460]  The budget deficits are going to soar.
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:48.460]  The trade deficits are at record highs.
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.460]  They're going to soar.
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:53.460]  These rising twin deficits, increasing interest rates,
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:56.460]  is reminiscent of 1987 before the market crash.
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:59.460]  But the problem is we are more dependent now
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:00.460]  than we ever have been.
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:02.460]  The Federal Reserve made the mistake
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:05.460]  of a huge bubble economy that completely depends
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:08.460]  on extremely low interest rates to survive.
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:09.460]  Peter, let's come back to that in a moment.
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:10.460]  Let's come back to the moment.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:12.460]  I agree with you on the fundamentals.
[02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:14.460]  And you predicted a lot of things accurately before.
[02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:15.460]  But this is what I'm getting at.
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:19.460]  What was Trump supposed to do when they already had it planned
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:21.460]  to go down, admittedly, when Hillary got in
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:23.460]  and kind of organized our collapse
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:25.460]  and used that for social control?
[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:27.460]  What is Trump supposed to do when he's trying
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:31.460]  to end globalist control, NTPP, stabilize the border,
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:33.460]  get people believing in humanity again,
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:35.460]  doing a lot of really good positive things
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:36.460]  to return sovereignty?
[02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:38.460]  He is using a bubble against their bubble.
[02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:41.460]  And I see a lot of these policies actually deploying
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.460]  money back to the people, the average family, $13,000.
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:48.460]  Alex, this is going to backfire.
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.460]  He's like the Jimmy Carter in reverse.
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:54.460]  I think we're going to have an extremely liberal president,
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:57.460]  either a Bernie Sanders or someone like him in 2020.
[02:12:57.460 --> 02:13:01.460]  What Trump should have done is leveled with the American people.
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:03.460]  Like he kind of did when he was a candidate.
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:05.460]  He talked about how bad things were,
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:08.460]  but he didn't really say what needed to be done to fix it.
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:11.460]  But at least he said, we have a bubble in the stock market.
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:13.460]  The economy is a mess.
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.460]  I mean, all that was true, and that's why he got elected.
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:18.460]  But after he got elected, he became a cheerleader
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.460]  for the very economy that he correctly criticized.
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.460]  And now he has set everybody up.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:26.460]  He has raised everybody's expectations so high
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:28.460]  that when everything comes crashing down,
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.460]  not only will he get blamed,
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:31.460]  but everyone's going to be disappointed.
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:33.460]  What he should have done, the moment he was sworn in,
[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:35.460]  is he should have leveled with everybody and said,
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:37.460]  you know what, this is a disaster.
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:38.460]  It is a mess.
[02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:41.460]  I am going to fix this, but it's not going to be fun.
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.460]  The medicine that we're going to swallow right now
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:44.460]  is not going to taste good.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:45.460]  But here's the problem.
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:48.460]  He knows the people were already demoralized
[02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:51.460]  by the globalist, by Obama, and all this other crud.
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:55.460]  And you know, you're saying, oh, the economy's not really
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:57.460]  growing any faster than on Obama.
[02:13:57.460 --> 02:13:59.460]  Well, it does show 3.3%.
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:01.460]  And everybody I know is seeing a difference,
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:03.460]  record low, black unemployment.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:07.460]  I mean, I think exuberance can bring us out of this
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:09.460]  and break the back of the globalist
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:12.460]  and show that they were the ones suppressing things,
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:14.460]  and then we can reorganize things.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:16.460]  I agree you're absolutely right about the Federal Reserve
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:17.460]  and all of it.
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:20.460]  But man, if he came in here and tanked the stock market
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.460]  with a reset like you're talking about,
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:24.460]  they'd really be able to impeach his butt.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:27.460]  No, he campaigned and said it was a bubble.
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:28.460]  It wasn't his bubble.
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.460]  Now it's his bubble.
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:30.460]  That's the problem.
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:32.460]  But if he would have said it's a bubble and it's going down,
[02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:34.460]  it wouldn't have been his fault.
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:36.460]  Because part of the cure for the economy
[02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:38.460]  is deflating these bubbles.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:39.460]  It has to be done.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:41.460]  Someone has to rip this Band-Aid off.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:43.460]  And he was elected to do it.
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:44.460]  Well, isn't he doing that?
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:47.460]  Isn't he doing that, getting rid of the right-off
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:50.460]  for state income tax and for property tax?
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:53.460]  No, he's not coming close to doing that.
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:56.460]  These are gimmicking tax cuts that run up the deficit.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:59.460]  They are not real tax cuts because we're not having cuts
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:00.460]  in government spending.
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:02.460]  You said we have record low black unemployment.
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:05.460]  Black unemployment was falling under Obama too
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:07.460]  because blacks were leaving the labor force.
[02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:08.460]  And that hasn't changed.
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:11.460]  You have record low labor force participation rate.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:13.460]  Hardly any blacks are working.
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:14.460]  I mean, percentage-wise.
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:15.460]  So that's why they're not unemployed.
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:16.460]  Look how many are in prison.
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:18.460]  So this is not some kind of...
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:19.460]  Now wait a minute.
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:22.460]  Black unemployment almost doubled under Obama.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:25.460]  No, the unemployment rate doubled for everybody
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.460]  at the beginning because, you know,
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:29.460]  and then it all started to come down.
[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:31.460]  But the reason it came down was because
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:33.460]  so many people left the labor force
[02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:36.460]  and so many people accepted crappy, low-paying,
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:37.460]  part-time jobs.
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:38.460]  And that is what's going on.
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:39.460]  That hasn't changed under Trump.
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:40.460]  All right.
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.460]  Well, listen, anybody who accuses me of being
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.460]  as a cheerleader for the economy,
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:45.460]  this is the balancing of it out.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.460]  I hope Peter Schiff's wrong.
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:48.460]  You're a smart guy.
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:49.460]  What's going to happen then?
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:50.460]  How will the implosion look?
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:51.460]  I mean, let's war game that.
[02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:52.460]  We'll come back.
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:23.460]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:25.460]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:27.460]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:30.460]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:33.460]  should be using this product as a preventative
[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:54.460]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:56.460]  Could your house go into foreclosure?
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:58.460]  Are you behind on your mortgage payments?
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:00.460]  Does it seem like the bank has no interest
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:01.460]  in helping you save your home?
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.460]  And you feel like you have nowhere to turn for help?

[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:18.460]  have been denied a loan modification,
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:20.460]  or been the victim of a predatory loan,

[02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:04.460]  with iodine and nano-silver,
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:06.460]  designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:08.460]  Enjoy a minty, fresh flavor
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:10.460]  made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:12.460]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste
[02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:15.460]  with the super blue fluoride-free mouthwash
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:17.460]  and super-charge your oral health.
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:19.460]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils
[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:21.460]  and ancient ingredients used
[02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:23.460]  since Aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:25.460]  Instead of containing fluoride,
[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:27.460]  our super blue line is floated
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:29.460]  with a good halogen iodine
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.460]  and an array of other beneficial compounds
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:34.460]  that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:36.460]  Super blue fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:38.460]  are the first and only
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:40.460]  to contain all of these natural ingredients,
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:43.460]  xylitol, nano-silver, and iodine.
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:45.460]  Notice the difference with our
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:47.460]  super blue fluoride-free products.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:49.460]  Refresh your breath and invigorate

[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:25.460]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:56.460]  He's basically up here saying that there's a giant bubble.
[02:20:56.460 --> 02:20:58.460]  Well, you just heard him earlier if you were tuned in,
[02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:00.460]  that Trump's helped pump it up now
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:02.460]  and that he's going to be the fall guy
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:04.460]  when it implodes discrediting capitalism
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:06.460]  and bringing in basically a communist.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:08.460]  Is that what you're getting at, Mr. Schiff?
[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:10.460]  A, and then B,
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:12.460]  how will the bubble go down in different scenarios
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:14.460]  and how far will the market go down
[02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:16.460]  if your scenario's right?
[02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:18.460]  Because I'll be honest with you,
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:20.460]  it gets a little scary when the market's getting
[02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:23.460]  and that does kind of get me a little concerned.
[02:21:23.460 --> 02:21:25.460]  Yeah, you know, this is the same thing
[02:21:25.460 --> 02:21:27.460]  that happened under George W. Bush, right?
[02:21:27.460 --> 02:21:29.460]  He inherited a bubble.
[02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:31.460]  Instead of leveling with the American public,
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:33.460]  he pretended everything was great
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:35.460]  and then the bigger bubble that was inflated
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:37.460]  while he was president collapsed
[02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:39.460]  except that he got a second term
[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:41.460]  because his bubble didn't really pop
[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.460]  until the end of his second term.
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:45.460]  I think Trump's is going to pop during his first term
[02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:47.460]  because this one is much bigger
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:49.460]  and we don't have as much time.
[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:51.460]  Here's how it's going to go down.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:53.460]  So what's going to happen is
[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:55.460]  interest rates are going to keep rising,
[02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:57.460]  commodity prices are going to keep rising,
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:21:59.460]  the dollar's going to keep falling,
[02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:01.460]  so you're going to start to see pickups
[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:03.460]  in the official inflation rate
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:05.460]  and so rising consumer prices
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:07.460]  and rising interest rates are going to start
[02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:09.460]  to be a powerful headwind
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:11.460]  for the economy because Americans
[02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:13.460]  are going to be spending a lot more money
[02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:15.460]  on basic necessities,
[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:17.460]  if they have an adjustment rate mortgage,
[02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:19.460]  credit card debt, auto loan,
[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:21.460]  all this cheap money is going to be gradually going away
[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:23.460]  and the economy is going to be weakening
[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:25.460]  and as the economy is weakening,
[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:27.460]  unemployment is going to start to pick up.
[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:29.460]  Now, the Fed's going to see this.
[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:31.460]  The Fed's going to see the economy slowing down
[02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:33.460]  and if they continue to raise rates,
[02:22:33.460 --> 02:22:35.460]  it will go into recession.
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:37.460]  Now, that is better than the alternative
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:39.460]  but the alternative, if the Federal Reserve
[02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:41.460]  decides that they want
[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:43.460]  to prevent a recession
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:45.460]  or maybe fight off a recession
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.460]  and they don't recognize it in time,
[02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:49.460]  if they want to prop up the stock market
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:51.460]  then what they have to do
[02:22:51.460 --> 02:22:53.460]  is call off the rate hikes.
[02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:55.460]  In fact, I think they have to go back to zero.
[02:22:55.460 --> 02:22:57.460]  They have to launch QE4
[02:22:57.460 --> 02:22:59.460]  in order to keep interest rates from really spiking
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:01.460]  and to prop up the market
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:03.460]  but that will set off a currency crisis.
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:05.460]  The dollar will plunge, not just make new lows
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:07.460]  but destroy the old lows
[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:09.460]  and that will set off an economic crisis
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:11.460]  that's far worse than the financial crisis
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:13.460]  or the recession.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.460]  They say China
[02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:17.460]  some numbers five, six, seven, eight times
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:19.460]  the amount of state-sponsored pumping money into it.
[02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:21.460]  They execute you.
[02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:23.460]  If you criticize the markets over there
[02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:25.460]  China is going to lower their taxes
[02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:27.460]  to basically zero to incentivize companies to stay.
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:29.460]  How can China's bubble just continue
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:31.460]  to go up and up and up and up and up
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:33.460]  when they've got all their problems
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:35.460]  and then you're saying that our bubble
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:37.460]  isn't going to work.
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:39.460]  I really hope you're wrong because
[02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:41.460]  they've got news articles out there
[02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:43.460]  where they call the stock market
[02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:45.460]  and say, wow, why'd the market jump?
[02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:47.460]  Well, Jones came out and said coming admitted
[02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:49.460]  Trump not under criminal investigation.
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:51.460]  Well, he really did say that.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:53.460]  I know this show actually affects markets
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.460]  and I get it's all a house of cards
[02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:57.460]  but good lord, man.
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:59.460]  If they've got house of cards that are much, much bigger
[02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:01.460]  and out of control over in China
[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:03.460]  I don't like trying
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:05.460]  to pull the house of cards down.
[02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:07.460]  Well, remember, China now has
[02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:09.460]  record trade surpluses.
[02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:11.460]  The Chinese people save 30%
[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:13.460]  of what they earn. We barely
[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:15.460]  save 3% our savings rates at a 10 year low.
[02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:17.460]  The Chinese government
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:19.460]  doesn't really, isn't in debt. They have assets.
[02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:21.460]  They got trillions and trillions of dollars
[02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:23.460]  of assets. We have liability.
[02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:25.460]  They're the biggest owners of our debt, aren't they?
[02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:27.460]  They own our debt, but they own other
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:29.460]  debt, but they don't have
[02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.460]  Social Security, they don't have Medicare,
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:33.460]  they don't have all these unfunded liabilities
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:35.460]  the way we do.
[02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:37.460]  Chinese rely on themselves.
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:39.460]  Americans rely on the government.
[02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:41.460]  We have got a much bigger bubble.
[02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:43.460]  They actually have a vibrant economy.
[02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:45.460]  Yes, there are problems in that economy
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:47.460]  but a lot of it has to do
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:49.460]  with their misguided efforts to prop up the
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:51.460]  dollar so they can keep selling
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:53.460]  Americans products that we can't afford
[02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:55.460]  and that will never pay for.
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.460]  By the way, Peter, I'm not
[02:24:57.460 --> 02:24:59.460]  being critical of this. I think investors
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:01.460]  should invest wherever they like. I know you're
[02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:03.460]  Euro-Pacific capital. I know you're all about
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:05.460]  investing all over the world, but are you
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:07.460]  going to turn because you've got more foreign investments?
[02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:09.460]  I am, and actually
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:11.460]  a lot of our strategies
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:13.460]  have beaten the U.S. market over the last
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:15.460]  two years despite the fact that it's gone up
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.460]  and we're beating it again in a lot of strategies
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:19.460]  this year because the dollar is so weak
[02:25:19.460 --> 02:25:21.460]  that gives you a huge
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:23.460]  tailwind when now you're investing internationally.
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:25.460]  So for all the years the dollar
[02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:27.460]  was strengthening,
[02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:29.460]  that was eating away at international
[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:31.460]  returns, but the dollar is about
[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:33.460]  to lose all of that strength and then some.
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:35.460]  So now, if you're bullish
[02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:37.460]  on the stock market, there's no reason to be
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:39.460]  invested in the U.S. market, we're going to make
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:41.460]  so much more money and we are making much more
[02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:43.460]  money in emerging markets,
[02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:45.460]  in commodity. But in your modeling,
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:47.460]  lower dollar brings back more manufacturing
[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:49.460]  jobs. No, it doesn't.
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:51.460]  The lower dollar is going to bring record high
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:53.460]  trade deficits because it's going to increase
[02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:55.460]  what we have to pay to import the things that we
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:57.460]  have to do. Peter, I've got to say though, man,
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:25:59.460]  I think betting against America, I just
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:01.460]  have a gut feeling that
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:03.460]  the best laid plans of mice and men
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:05.460]  often go astray.
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:07.460]  I'm not betting against America, I'm betting against
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:09.460]  the socialists and the central bankers who
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:11.460]  would destroy America. In the long run,
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:13.460]  maybe America is going to come back,
[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:15.460]  but first we're going to have to pay the piper.
[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:17.460]  This is a gigantic bubble, Trump was right
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:19.460]  when he was a candidate, the air is coming out.
[02:26:19.460 --> 02:26:21.460]  No, I know, Trump sounded like he was a candidate
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:23.460]  and then they got mad at him saying,
[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:25.460]  you know, the real estate's too high,
[02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:27.460]  all this stuff hurts average families, you're right.
[02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:29.460]  But I'm just saying, being right
[02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:31.460]  actually is good.
[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:33.460]  But I mean, you're a successful wealthy
[02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:35.460]  guy, the average family and hard
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:37.460]  working people that are working two, three jobs
[02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:39.460]  collapse is going to, at least in the short
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:41.460]  term, hurt them bad.
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:43.460]  But it's going to happen now anyway, it's going to happen worse
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:45.460]  when the dollar collapses, it wipes out the middle
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:47.460]  class, people are going to be impoverished
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:49.460]  and they're going to blame Trump.
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:51.460]  You know, there are a lot of people who voted for
[02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:53.460]  Trump out of frustration, he promised a lot,
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:55.460]  he talked big, he is not going
[02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:57.460]  to deliver and that is going to be used against
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:26:59.460]  him and it's going to ultimately be
[02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:01.460]  used against the country.
[02:27:01.460 --> 02:27:03.460]  Way to see how bad things get, you know, these tax cuts
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:05.460]  they're all temporary, they're all going
[02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:07.460]  away in 2021.
[02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:09.460]  What do you think the Democrats are going to do
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:11.460]  when they have the White House and both houses
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:13.460]  of Congress? How high do you think they're going
[02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:15.460]  to jack taxes up on corporations?
[02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:17.460]  What do you think they're going to do to
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:19.460]  entrepreneurs? This is a disaster.
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:21.460]  We had a chance to diffuse this if
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:23.460]  Trump would have owned up to the problems
[02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:25.460]  of the economy, they weren't his fault,
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:27.460]  they were all on his predecessor and
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:29.460]  he could have finally put politics
[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:31.460]  aside and done the right thing
[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:33.460]  for this country. Instead,
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:35.460]  he acted just like all the other presidents
[02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:37.460]  who have just, you know, continued to kick
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:39.460]  the can down the road. Well, I don't think he
[02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:41.460]  acted like all of them on social issues
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:43.460]  like marching with pro-life, nobody's
[02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:45.460]  done that, the border,
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:47.460]  the veterans, I mean, he's really
[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:49.460]  delivering a lot of fronts. No, no, I'm
[02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:51.460]  talking about big cuts to government spending,
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:53.460]  dealing with entitlements, getting
[02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:55.460]  cutting Social Security and Medicare so we don't
[02:27:55.460 --> 02:27:57.460]  have math. No, no, I agree, that's got to start.
[02:27:57.460 --> 02:27:59.460]  There's been some cutting. No, there hasn't
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:01.460]  been. Government spending
[02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:03.460]  is growing under Bush,
[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:05.460]  under Trump.
[02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:07.460]  They're not cutting anything, they're increasing
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:09.460]  spending and they're reducing revenues
[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:11.460]  to finance that spending. That means
[02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:13.460]  the government is going to rely on inflation
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:15.460]  and debt to finance.
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.460]  Yeah, but models show these have a tax cuts
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:19.460]  a lot of times bringing higher tax receipts.
[02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:21.460]  They're not going to do that.
[02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:23.460]  They never do that. They're not going to be
[02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:25.460]  the tax receipts won't be enough
[02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:27.460]  to cover the decline, but meanwhile the economy
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:29.460]  is going to fall. Higher interest rates
[02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:31.460]  and higher consumer prices
[02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:33.460]  which are constantly
[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:35.460]  going to be a bigger drag on the economy.
[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:37.460]  We got to have you back up soon then to really
[02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:39.460]  flesh this out. Wow,
[02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:41.460]  man, I feel like jumping on a cliff now.
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:43.460]  No, no, seriously, I'll never commit suicide.
[02:28:43.460 --> 02:28:45.460]  Hillary, don't get me, I was just joking.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:47.460]  All right, Peter Sheff,
[02:28:47.460 --> 02:28:49.460]  if he's right, it'll be a great time for investors
[02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:51.460]  to buy stuff up.
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:29:20.460]  Like the communist Chinese, we'll be back.

[02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:13.460]  you are
[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:15.460]  funding the revolution.
[02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:17.460]  I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:19.460]  It is essential that you purchase
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:21.460]  the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:23.460]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best

[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:29.460]  atomic iodide in it. You cannot beat that

[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:35.460]  that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine
[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:37.460]  as well. Infowarslife.com

[02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:47.460]  the globalists and their satanic
[02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:49.460]  pedophile armies. And that's who they are,
[02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:51.460]  and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:53.460]  against us, so we need your support.
[02:30:55.460 --> 02:30:57.460]  Over a year
[02:30:57.460 --> 02:30:59.460]  in the making, produced by one of the top organic
[02:30:59.460 --> 02:31:01.460]  firms in the country, that if you want
[02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:03.460]  proven studies
[02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:05.460]  and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours
[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:07.460]  on the files I have here, of what this is
[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:09.460]  proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:11.460]  This is the ultimate
[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:13.460]  immune system boost
[02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:15.460]  for this time of year, any time of the year, but
[02:31:15.460 --> 02:31:17.460]  immune wall is incredible
[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:19.460]  and folks, other formulas that aren't even
[02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:21.460]  as good are $70-80.
[02:31:21.460 --> 02:31:23.460]  It's a great deal at $39. Immune wall,
[02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:25.460]  beta-glucans, olive leaf
[02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:27.460]  and so much more.
[02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:29.460]  It is concentrated. You need to go
[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:31.460]  read what is in here. The mushroom blend
[02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:33.460]  of the most expensive, highest
[02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:35.460]  quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[02:31:35.460 --> 02:31:37.460]  accelerate. A citrus peel blend.
[02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:39.460]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:41.460]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:43.460]  at Immune wall. I think it's beyond
[02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:45.460]  seasonal. Beta-glucan, olive leaf
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.460]  and more. Immune wall
[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:49.460]  at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com

[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:53.460]  Mike and
[02:31:53.460 --> 02:31:55.460]  Arizona are on the air
[02:31:55.460 --> 02:31:57.460]  worldwide. Go ahead.
[02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:59.460]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:01.460]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do
[02:32:01.460 --> 02:32:03.460]  and being a patriot and doing your best
[02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:05.460]  to save America and encouraging
[02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:07.460]  us as fellow patriots to do that
[02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:09.460]  in our local areas as well.
[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:11.460]  And as a long-time
[02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:13.460]  infowarslistener, I want to say thanks
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:15.460]  for the awesome brain force
[02:32:15.460 --> 02:32:17.460]  Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:19.460]  say thanks for the Anthroplex too. Thank you.
[02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:21.460]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the Super
[02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:23.460]  Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:25.460]  big normal toothpaste fans. The Super Blue
[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:27.460]  is awesome. And thank you so much,
[02:32:27.460 --> 02:32:29.460]  Alex, for the Infowarslife
[02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:31.460]  products. They are quality. I can't
[02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:33.460]  wait to get some more. And thank you
[02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:35.460]  so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:37.460]  Absolutely. Because then we
[02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:39.460]  could all, as educated patriots,
[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:41.460]  help our other countrymen and women
[02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:43.460]  understand that there's a
[02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:45.460]  bigger problems going on and if we can
[02:32:45.460 --> 02:32:47.460]  get our houses in order and be good
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:49.460]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:49.460 --> 02:33:01.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:09.460]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:11.460]  It's Alex Jones coming to
[02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:13.460]  you live from the front lines
[02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:15.460]  of the Infowar.
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:17.460]  Tomorrow's news
[02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:19.460]  today.
[02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:21.460]  Next year's news
[02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:23.460]  today.
[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:25.460]  I'm quite honest
[02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:27.460]  about this. I like Roger
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:29.460]  Stone. I've known him about three years.
[02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:31.460]  I met him at a JFK event like seven years ago.
[02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:33.460]  No, no he is for
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:35.460]  over a decade. He's a best-selling
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:37.460]  author, a whole bunch of best-selling books.
[02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:39.460]  But I knew he worked in a bunch of administrations.
[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:41.460]  But this is not a butt-kissing
[02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:43.460]  operation. When listeners
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:45.460]  think that
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:47.460]  I'm talking about how we're tomorrow's news today
[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:49.460]  to just keep tooting our horn, the globalists
[02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:51.460]  want to control narratives.
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:53.460]  They know what's really going on.
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:55.460]  It's not that hard once you get studied and get your
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:57.460]  mind in the game to know what's really going on.
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:33:59.460]  They just don't want anybody saying it
[02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:01.460]  so they can keep people on the dark.
[02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:05.460]  But we have our listeners, we have our guests,
[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:07.460]  we have our crew, all of us together
[02:34:09.460 --> 02:34:11.460]  our private intelligence network
[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:13.460]  and we're going to be promoting America
[02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:15.460]  and freedom. You heard Peter Schiff earlier
[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:17.460]  about this big bubble we're in
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:19.460]  and oh, this and that.
[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:21.460]  He's heavily invested in China, which is fine.
[02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:23.460]  He thinks that that's going to beat the American economy
[02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:25.460]  because he'd like America to reform. I get it.
[02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:27.460]  But Trump is delivering
[02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:29.460]  in this bubble
[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.460]  real incentives, real jobs, real
[02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:33.460]  build-up in this country.
[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:35.460]  And culturally, he's not allowing them
[02:34:35.460 --> 02:34:37.460]  to censor, he's trying to block them,
[02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:39.460]  he's promoting pro-life, he's promoting taking care of the veterans,
[02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:41.460]  sovereignty, tax cuts for families
[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:43.460]  like Putin's done so people have more kids.
[02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:47.460]  I really don't see any fault
[02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:49.460]  in this man.
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:51.460]  And everybody wants to kill him
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:53.460]  or destroy him because they're playing along
[02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:55.460]  with it and it's easy to take
[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:57.460]  the middle road because things are so volatile.
[02:34:57.460 --> 02:34:59.460]  I'm betting on America,
[02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:01.460]  I'm betting on Trump
[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:03.460]  and I'm not going to let him break my will
[02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:05.460]  especially not now that he did that pro-life march
[02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:07.460]  that no Republican would ever do
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:09.460]  and called for the states
[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:11.460]  to take control of the situation which is
[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:13.460]  constitutional and for an interpersonal
[02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:15.460]  birth abortion. The other presidents don't do that
[02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:17.460]  the other Republicans don't. We are breaking
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:19.460]  their back.
[02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:21.460]  So the money is a
[02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:23.460]  side issue
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:25.460]  and it is all
[02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:27.460]  crazy town.
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:29.460]  But I look at what Trump's doing, he's taking this
[02:35:29.460 --> 02:35:31.460]  mess and trying to
[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:33.460]  get stuff to the people and trying
[02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:35.460]  to make it cool to have a job and work
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:37.460]  and be honorable. Now that said
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:39.460]  that's where
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:41.460]  I stand.
[02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:43.460]  And so I'm just going to continue to even
[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:45.460]  support more. Now
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:47.460]  getting back to Roger Stone. Roger Stone
[02:35:47.460 --> 02:35:49.460]  we looked it up in
[02:35:49.460 --> 02:35:51.460]  January
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:53.460]  in February, in March, in April, in May
[02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:55.460]  in June until the point I said stop it
[02:35:55.460 --> 02:35:57.460]  Shed
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:59.460]  the key is the illegal getting of the FISA
[02:35:59.460 --> 02:36:01.460]  warrant the fake dossier
[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:03.460]  the targeting them lying about it, perjuring to
[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:05.460]  Congress. Comey saying Trump is crazy
[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:07.460]  Quoting saying
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:09.460]  the key is that we have them open and shut
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:11.460]  beyond Nick Sony and who we work for
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:13.460]  the only member of the so called plumbers
[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:15.460]  to not go to jail because he wasn't involved.
[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:17.460]  The point is is that
[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:19.460]  that Roger
[02:36:19.460 --> 02:36:21.460]  is absolutely the person
[02:36:21.460 --> 02:36:23.460]  that broke this all of this
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:25.460]  and now Congress
[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:27.460]  Jim Jordan Gates, so I know
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:29.460]  Roger helping elected is saying
[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:31.460]  they've seen it Obama ran
[02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:33.460]  it devastating they're going to prison
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.460]  they said major officials are going to
[02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:37.460]  prison they sit because they're so dumb
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:39.460]  like the memos reportedly had them
[02:36:39.460 --> 02:36:41.460]  going we can't let him get in he's bad
[02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:43.460]  let's get let's make stuff up we need
[02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:45.460]  insurance policy it's the same it's the
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:47.460]  president saying it and
[02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:49.460]  rice and all them so stone
[02:36:49.460 --> 02:36:51.460]  you have been absolutely
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:53.460]  on target like nobody else I know it's
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:55.460]  just true it's true
[02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:57.460]  I mean I really respect you before but it's getting
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:36:59.460]  crazy how accurate we are
[02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:01.460]  without getting into sources and things is obviously
[02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:03.460]  you didn't just pull this out of your rear end
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.460]  you have advised the president the whole time
[02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:07.460]  this is the proper course
[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:09.460]  so what's the next shoe to drop because
[02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:11.460]  I mean this is amazing
[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:13.460]  the crimes they've committed
[02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:15.460]  well it's the biggest
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:17.460]  abuse of power that we've ever seen in
[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:19.460]  American history by any president
[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:21.460]  it makes what happened in Watergate pale
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:23.460]  in comparison
[02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:25.460]  essentially Barack Obama working with the
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:27.460]  Clintons doctored up a
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:29.460]  phony dossier to use it
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:31.460]  as a rationale
[02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:33.460]  to convince the FISA court to
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:35.460]  issue warrants to conduct
[02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:37.460]  political espionage on the Republican
[02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:39.460]  candidate for president
[02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:41.460]  and his campaign that
[02:37:41.460 --> 02:37:43.460]  is a constitutional crisis
[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:45.460]  like we have never had and now
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:47.460]  they are busted red
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:49.460]  handed back when
[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:51.460]  circa news first reported that
[02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:53.460]  30,000 Americans
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:55.460]  were illegally under surveillance
[02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:57.460]  and the court had even
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:37:59.460]  admonished the NSA
[02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:01.460]  not to do it that it violated the fourth
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:03.460]  amendment and they did it
[02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:05.460]  anyway the great lesson
[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:07.460]  of Watergate as you know Alex is
[02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:09.460]  no person is above
[02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:11.460]  the law or about to find out
[02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:13.460]  because Mr. Clapper
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.460]  Mr. Brennan Ms. Rice
[02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:17.460]  Valerie Jarrett this list
[02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:19.460]  goes on and on of the
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:21.460]  co-conspirators they need to see jail time
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:23.460]  our constitution isn't some
[02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:25.460]  joke we are a nation
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:27.460]  of laws and they cheated
[02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:29.460]  to try to steal an election
[02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:31.460]  that's right
[02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:33.460]  I know some of it was sources
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:35.460]  but the president obviously never told
[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:37.460]  you classified information but once he got in
[02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:39.460]  he knew he was being spied on he even said that
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:41.460]  the boldness of them
[02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:43.460]  on CNN on
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:45.460]  MSNBC New York Times
[02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:47.460]  Washington Post you and I by name already
[02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:49.460]  played the clips twice say I'm not going to play them again
[02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:51.460]  Shane Jones and Stone are liars
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:53.460]  they're the source to the president they were being
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:55.460]  spied on no they said
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:57.460]  when he was president elect they were spying on him
[02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:59.460]  then they pulled that back and said they weren't
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:01.460]  and then acted like they never said it I mean
[02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:03.460]  the level of lying in plain
[02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:05.460]  view is crazy
[02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:07.460]  no I remember when they asked Clapper about
[02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:09.460]  this under oath he started to
[02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:11.460]  say well it's too sensitive
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.460]  I can't talk about it of course that's why
[02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:15.460]  we have congressional hearings they are
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:17.460]  so busted Alex
[02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:19.460]  and the arrogance of it all
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:21.460]  we vowed around the fact that since
[02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:23.460]  Hillary was going to surely win
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:25.460]  there'd be no exposure
[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:27.460]  on their emails that was the arrogance
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:29.460]  they were sure where is it I've got it
[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:31.460]  around here where's my madam president I guess
[02:39:31.460 --> 02:39:33.460]  they're already hung it back up they were so sure
[02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:35.460]  of the madam president that why not just
[02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:37.460]  do whatever they want and run roughshot because
[02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:39.460]  they were planning to shut down the press arrest
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:41.460]  everybody I mean they told folks they were
[02:39:41.460 --> 02:39:43.460]  coming after us as soon as
[02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:45.460]  they got in they were going to go full
[02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:47.460]  authoritarian oh there it is I didn't see it there
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:49.460]  we're going to go full authoritarian
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:51.460]  but it didn't work did it I mean
[02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:53.460]  this is epic
[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:55.460]  and the dissembling
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:57.460]  and the look at the USA
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:39:59.460]  today headline that says
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:01.460]  Trump claim of wire capping debunked
[02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:03.460]  no no it wasn't debunked
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.460]  in fact Judge Andrew Napolitano
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:07.460]  was right on the money
[02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:09.460]  when he said that Trump had been
[02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:11.460]  spied on so
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:13.460]  it is amazing how the worm
[02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:15.460]  has turned and I think in all honesty
[02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:17.460]  huge credit has to go
[02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:19.460]  to Congressman Jim Jordan
[02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:21.460]  Congressman Matt Gaetz
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:23.460]  Congressman
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:25.460]  DeSantis these guys have done
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:27.460]  a great job they have been
[02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:29.460]  dogged while the country
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.460]  club Republicans were too busy at their
[02:40:31.460 --> 02:40:33.460]  cocktail parties talking about how
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:35.460]  embarrassing Donald Trump is these guys
[02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:37.460]  understood their constitutional
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:39.460]  duty as members and they have
[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:41.460]  and trade out he should be at it as well
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:43.460]  that's right they were not sunshine
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.460]  patriots no they were
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:47.460]  they were fighters they know why they
[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:49.460]  got to Congress they didn't get to
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:51.460]  Washington and get lost in the system
[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:53.460]  and decide that it's go along to get along
[02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:55.460]  they were afraid to make waves I think
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:57.460]  huge credits got to go to those and
[02:40:57.460 --> 02:40:59.460]  noon as to all of them are presidential
[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:01.460]  material now but at the same time
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:03.460]  someone needs to examine Adam Schiff
[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:05.460]  because he appears to be part
[02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:07.460]  of a cover up how is it
[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:09.460]  that every Democrat on the intelligence
[02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:11.460]  committee voted against
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:13.460]  the release of these materials
[02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:15.460]  how is it that no Democratic member
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:17.460]  of the House has bothered to go to
[02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:19.460]  a special room that they've set up where
[02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:21.460]  you can examine those that way that's the next question
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:23.460]  that noon as
[02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:25.460]  Jordan they're all trying to get it
[02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:27.460]  released just
[02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:29.460]  release it we know what's the word
[02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:31.460]  on what's in that that file
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:33.460]  well what we know Alex
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:35.460]  is that they went to the FISA
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:37.460]  court in in July
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:39.460]  asking for the surveillance
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:41.460]  of Trump and his team myself
[02:41:41.460 --> 02:41:43.460]  included and they
[02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:45.460]  were shocked when the judge said
[02:41:45.460 --> 02:41:47.460]  no then they came
[02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:49.460]  back several months later
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:51.460]  they didn't tell a different judge
[02:41:51.460 --> 02:41:53.460]  that the court had already denied this
[02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:55.460]  that's the key and they
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:57.460]  buffaloed him into approving it
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:41:59.460]  and then they were actually laughing about
[02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:01.460]  how dumb the judge was afterwards
[02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:03.460]  so it's it's the
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:05.460]  it's the the the connecting
[02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:07.460]  of the dots between the phony dossier
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:09.460]  and the government
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:11.460]  funding of that after they passed
[02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:13.460]  from republican is the organized criminality
[02:42:13.460 --> 02:42:15.460]  of what they did they're paying for
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:17.460]  it lying lying to congress
[02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:19.460]  comey and all of them said that they weren't involved
[02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:21.460]  and said it was insane I mean that there's
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:23.460]  that whole other area
[02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:25.460]  you've got you've had perjury in front of the
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:27.460]  congress most definitely on the part of
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:29.460]  comey extensively
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:31.460]  he sat in the same seat that I sat
[02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:33.460]  in in front of the house intelligence committee
[02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:35.460]  and he lied his
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:37.460]  career off
[02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:39.460]  but it's okay he's about to teach a course on ethics
[02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:41.460]  yeah

[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:51.460]  Obama actually basically ordered the judge
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:53.460]  to do it we'll be right back

[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:22.460]  spreading disease around
[02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:24.460]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere
[02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:26.460]  these are all parasites
[02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:28.460]  tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it
[02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:29.460]  you have the neem in there
[02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:31.460]  you have the organic clove bud
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.460]  the organic wormwood
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:34.460]  I recommend doing a parasite
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:36.460]  cleanse at least twice a year
[02:45:36.460 --> 02:45:38.460]  alright well I'm glad we got some back in
[02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:39.460]  because I'm going back on it today
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:40.460]  it just came back in yesterday

[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:52.460]  thank you so much for all your work
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:54.460]  sir on this great product
[02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:57.460]  Matt and Ohio you're on the air
[02:45:57.460 --> 02:45:58.460]  another Matt go ahead
[02:45:58.460 --> 02:46:00.460]  yeah hey listen I just wanted to say real quick
[02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:02.460]  I'm a long time listener of
[02:46:02.460 --> 02:46:04.460]  InfoWars and I just wanted to say that
[02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:06.460]  the t-shirts that you guys are offering
[02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:08.460]  are absolutely fantastic
[02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:10.460]  and that really is a great way
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.460]  to deal with this battle in the InfoWars
[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:14.460]  it might seem like a simple thing
[02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:16.460]  but they particularly these slogan t-shirts
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:18.460]  that you guys got up right now
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:20.460]  are absolutely amazing
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:22.460]  well thank you my favorite new one
[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:24.460]  is the don't tread on me
[02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:26.460]  but said it says won't tread on me
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:28.460]  and it's a big day glow snake
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.460]  Gadsden snake and then it's got the American flag
[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:32.460]  infowars.com on the right arm
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:34.460]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like minded people
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:36.460]  and spread the word
[02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:38.460]  and also exercise free speech
[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:40.460]  and the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt
[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:42.460]  trigger warning t-shirt
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:44.460]  which is the symbol of a trigger
[02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:46.460]  with a yield sign
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:48.460]  and then infowars.com on the back
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:50.460]  that is the new shirt of the mind
[02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:52.460]  available exclusively at infowars.com
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:47:16.460]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:18.460]  well talking to Roger Stone
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:20.460]  he just got invited to speak to the Oxford Union
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:22.460]  I was invited to speak to that
[02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:24.460]  I was the middle of a contentious divorce
[02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:26.460]  so I just couldn't go I couldn't do it
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:28.460]  I had to be with my children
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:30.460]  but I do want to probably re-accept that
[02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:32.460]  of course there was other invitations
[02:47:32.460 --> 02:47:34.460]  that were accompanying that were more secretive
[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:36.460]  and then Cambridge invited me right after
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:38.460]  that's kind of two warring factions
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:40.460]  little little
[02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:42.460]  little bit of the whole
[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:44.460]  underground stuff that goes on
[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:46.460]  that I'm not involved in that
[02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:48.460]  that's one another reason I'm not got involved in it all
[02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:50.460]  there's a lot of old secret societies
[02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.460]  we'll just leave it at that
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.460]  but Roger Stone joins us right now
[02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:56.460]  ladies and gentlemen
[02:47:56.460 --> 02:47:58.460]  and
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:00.460]  just recapping the bombshell news
[02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:02.460]  that I want to get into
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:04.460]  why in heavens would Trump agree
[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:06.460]  as they're saying he is to meet with Mueller
[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:08.460]  unless it's to chew him out
[02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:10.460]  and interrogate him about how he got a justice department
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:12.460]  waiver to be in business with the Russians
[02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:14.460]  and to chew him out about
[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:16.460]  how he colluded with Hillary
[02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:18.460]  I wouldn't answer any of his questions
[02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:20.460]  if it's to dress him down and maybe videotape it
[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:22.460]  then I would do it
[02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:24.460]  why in Hades would Trump meet with him
[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:26.460]  you know Alex I had dinner
[02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:28.460]  with our mutual friend Judge Andrew Napolitano
[02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:30.460]  the other night and he put it best
[02:48:30.460 --> 02:48:32.460]  this is a perjury trap
[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:34.460]  this is a
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:36.460]  the president would have to have a death wish
[02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:38.460]  to walk into such a one-sided
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:40.460]  inquiry
[02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:42.460]  it's almost suicidal
[02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:44.460]  I don't understand why the president
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:46.460]  as lawyers said they're now negotiating
[02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:48.460]  over his testimony
[02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:50.460]  I am praying that he will change his mind
[02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:52.460]  it's just
[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:54.460]  not in his interest but what it proves once again
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:56.460]  is that having
[02:48:56.460 --> 02:48:58.460]  run the whole gamut
[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:00.460]  on Russian collusion and found
[02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:02.460]  nothing we're back to the firing
[02:49:02.460 --> 02:49:04.460]  of Comey again
[02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:06.460]  as the pretext for Trump's impeachment
[02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:08.460]  oh he obstructed justice
[02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:10.460]  or he perjured himself
[02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:12.460]  well don't give it to the mr.
[02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:14.460]  president they need you to incriminate
[02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:16.460]  yourself that's what they're going to try
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:18.460]  to trick you into doing
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:20.460]  saying something that they can twist
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:22.460]  I am praying that the president changes his mind
[02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:24.460]  well he just knows he hadn't done anything
[02:49:24.460 --> 02:49:26.460]  so he thinks why not
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:28.460]  they'll make something up he's got a videotape
[02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:30.460]  the whole thing I mean Comey made up memos
[02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:32.460]  said he didn't perjure himself
[02:49:32.460 --> 02:49:34.460]  this is a group created by Clinton's people
[02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:36.460]  by Rosenstein it's a joke
[02:49:36.460 --> 02:49:38.460]  they should all be arrested and that's my next question
[02:49:38.460 --> 02:49:40.460]  what is the next shoot a drop with Jordan
[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:42.460]  and Gates
[02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:44.460]  and all of them saying nexus criminal charges
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:46.460]  for high level officials
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:48.460]  I know we don't like to have
[02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:50.460]  internal stuff like this it could trigger a civil war
[02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:52.460]  the democrats are already pushing a civil war
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:54.460]  I mean we have to smash
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.460]  these criminals now
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:58.460]  and I know it's dangerous to go up against these thugs
[02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:00.460]  and say that on air whatever somebody's got to do it
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:02.460]  they'll never going to go away
[02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:04.460]  you don't have Hitler start World War II
[02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:06.460]  and then in 1945 when you're closing in on Berlin
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:08.460]  let him go ahead and stay in Berlin
[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:10.460]  you know he's going to reconstitute
[02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:12.460]  attack again you got to get him
[02:50:12.460 --> 02:50:14.460]  well what I learned yesterday
[02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:16.460]  Alex is that
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:18.460]  Rod Rosenstein the de facto
[02:50:18.460 --> 02:50:20.460]  attorney general of this country
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:22.460]  left a time bomb
[02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:24.460]  they had the president signed a document
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:26.460]  that changed the order of succession
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:28.460]  the order of authority at the justice department
[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:30.460]  so in other words
[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:32.460]  if the president ordered Jeff Sessions
[02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:34.460]  to appoint a special counsel
[02:50:34.460 --> 02:50:36.460]  in uranium one
[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:38.460]  and he declined
[02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:40.460]  he would need to resign
[02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:42.460]  it would then go to Rosenstein
[02:50:42.460 --> 02:50:44.460]  well that's a dead letter
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:46.460]  but the president fired Rosenstein
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:48.460]  it now doesn't go to the solicitor general
[02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:50.460]  as it did under Nixon and the Archibald Cox filing
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:52.460]  goes to a woman named Nancy Brands
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:54.460]  a deep stator
[02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:56.460]  a bush-eyed
[02:50:56.460 --> 02:50:58.460]  then it goes to another bush-eyed
[02:50:58.460 --> 02:51:00.460]  then it goes to another bush-eyed
[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:02.460]  the president would have to get sick deep
[02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:04.460]  in his own administration
[02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:06.460]  to BS to just continually
[02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:08.460]  work against him in the country
[02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:10.460]  well then what does he do about a manifest fraud like that
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:12.460]  I mean this organized Clinton cabal
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:14.460]  that's still involved in mutinous hijacking
[02:51:14.460 --> 02:51:16.460]  well I would fire
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:18.460]  Jeff Sessions immediately
[02:51:18.460 --> 02:51:20.460]  and I'd get myself a fighting attorney general
[02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:22.460]  let's be clear Sessions did this
[02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:24.460]  Sessions just enabled the Cleansanoids
[02:51:24.460 --> 02:51:26.460]  to stay in power
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:28.460]  yeah basically I'm sure they said
[02:51:28.460 --> 02:51:30.460]  we're making some structural changes
[02:51:30.460 --> 02:51:32.460]  at the justice department Mr. President
[02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:34.460]  they're going to sign this
[02:51:34.460 --> 02:51:36.460]  it's unimportant
[02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:38.460]  and they go by the way McCabe's your best friend
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:40.460]  he's real reasonable when he led the cabal against you
[02:51:40.460 --> 02:51:42.460]  and we I mean exactly
[02:51:42.460 --> 02:51:44.460]  it's like McCabe likes you sir he's very fair
[02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:46.460]  and then McCabe's leading the cabal against you
[02:51:46.460 --> 02:51:48.460]  they don't tell him that
[02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:50.460]  it's time for 5 a.m. raids
[02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:52.460]  at their apartments to seize their computer records
[02:51:52.460 --> 02:51:54.460]  Mueller
[02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:56.460]  Comey, McCabe and Rosenstein
[02:51:56.460 --> 02:51:58.460]  all need government
[02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:00.460]  visits from the FBI
[02:52:00.460 --> 02:52:02.460]  there's very honest men and women
[02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:04.460]  who work at the agency at the lower levels
[02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:06.460]  the rotten crowd is at the top
[02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:08.460]  this place needs a house cleaning
[02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:10.460]  desperately
[02:52:10.460 --> 02:52:12.460]  well I know you and Dr. Jerem Corsi have amazing FBI contacts
[02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:14.460]  who help round up in the 80s
[02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:16.460]  a big Russian network and everything else
[02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:18.460]  you were working for Nixon and all these other anti-communists
[02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:20.460]  you're well known for that
[02:52:20.460 --> 02:52:22.460]  you know a lot of FBI agents what is the word from them
[02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:24.460]  on what's happening and going on
[02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:26.460]  well now they're cheering
[02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:28.460]  most of the agents that I know
[02:52:28.460 --> 02:52:30.460]  were dejected during this election
[02:52:30.460 --> 02:52:32.460]  they knew exactly what was going on
[02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:34.460]  and they hated it but they're company men
[02:52:34.460 --> 02:52:36.460]  and they're mid-level and low-level
[02:52:36.460 --> 02:52:38.460]  men and women
[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:40.460]  now many of them are very pleased
[02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:42.460]  to see Peter Stroke
[02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:44.460]  and his lover about to get their
[02:52:44.460 --> 02:52:46.460]  just desserts and to see
[02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:48.460]  that the false clothing of Mr. Comey
[02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:50.460]  and Mr. Mueller has been
[02:52:50.460 --> 02:52:52.460]  ripped away and we can see
[02:52:52.460 --> 02:52:54.460]  that this whole cabal is just a
[02:52:54.460 --> 02:52:56.460]  partisan hit squad of Trump haters
[02:52:56.460 --> 02:52:58.460]  they have no regard for law
[02:52:58.460 --> 02:53:00.460]  and the Constitution
[02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:02.460]  well that's my next question
[02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:04.460]  who is going to go to prison because you don't
[02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:06.460]  nearly hear these congressmen and women saying
[02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:08.460]  folks are going to prison the stuff in this memo
[02:53:08.460 --> 02:53:10.460]  is 50 times worse is what they're saying
[02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:12.460]  than what was in the emails and texts
[02:53:12.460 --> 02:53:14.460]  where they're like let's frame the president
[02:53:14.460 --> 02:53:16.460]  I mean that's incredible proof right there
[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:18.460]  this is way worse and just insane
[02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:20.460]  they're saying what's the word
[02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:22.460]  do you have any intel and who's going to get indicted
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:24.460]  I think the key thing for people to understand
[02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:26.460]  is this is the use
[02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:28.460]  of the US government's authority
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:30.460]  and power for purposes
[02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:32.460]  of partisan political espionage
[02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:34.460]  10 times worse
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:36.460]  than what happened in Watergate
[02:53:36.460 --> 02:53:38.460]  and I have to believe that this goes all the
[02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:40.460]  way to Obama there's no way
[02:53:40.460 --> 02:53:42.460]  that the Obama NSA was
[02:53:42.460 --> 02:53:44.460]  wiretapping Americans surveilling
[02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:46.460]  Americans without the authority
[02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:48.460]  of Obama himself
[02:53:48.460 --> 02:53:50.460]  which means Valerie Jarrett knew
[02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:52.460]  which means Susan Rice knew
[02:53:52.460 --> 02:53:54.460]  Brennan Clapper right on
[02:53:54.460 --> 02:53:56.460]  down the line this entire
[02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:58.460]  nest of criminals needs to be
[02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:00.460]  indicted, convicted,
[02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:02.460]  tried and sent away
[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:04.460]  we are a nation of laws let me
[02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:06.460]  remind you liberals once again
[02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:08.460]  no person is above the law
[02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:10.460]  sound familiar?
[02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:12.460]  you're going to host about 20 minutes
[02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:14.460]  to the next hour then Lee Ann Mackett is going to be
[02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:16.460]  ride the shotgun with you
[02:54:16.460 --> 02:54:18.460]  so we'll be right back to Roger Stone in the fourth
[02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:20.460]  hour I've got a bunch
[02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:22.460]  of emergency issues to deal with
[02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:24.460]  some good some bad and some very ugly
[02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:26.460]  so I will not be hosting the fourth hour
[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:28.460]  and Roger's got big news that he is
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:30.460]  about to be on top of as well
[02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:32.460]  some more with Roger Stone coming up in a few
[02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:34.460]  minutes remember
[02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:36.460]  they are working around the clock
[02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:38.460]  they are working
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:40.460]  around the clock to block us
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:42.460]  shut us down you name it
[02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:44.460]  okay and when the history books
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:46.460]  are written we'll tell you all about the behind the scene
[02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:48.460]  stuff but we can't do that obviously
[02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:50.460]  because the enemy is watching and it helps them
[02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:52.460]  just know this we need your prayers
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:54.460]  we need your support we need everything
[02:54:54.460 --> 02:54:56.460]  Roger Stone is going to come back in two and a half minutes after this break
[02:54:56.460 --> 02:54:58.460]  before I go any further
[02:54:58.460 --> 02:55:00.460]  I hardly even plug I didn't even plug in the first hour
[02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:02.460]  that's my fault if I plug enough
[02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:04.460]  we can find ourselves
[02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:06.460]  I get so obsessed with the info
[02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:08.460]  I'll skip breaks you name it
[02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:10.460]  I just need you to go hey
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:12.460]  Alex is delivered he's standing up
[02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:14.460]  he's under attack he's fighting for us
[02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:16.460]  we're fighting for him he's got great supplements
[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:18.460]  he's got great non-geoma heirloom
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:20.460]  seeds and water filters and books
[02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:22.460]  and videos and t-shirts and you name it
[02:55:22.460 --> 02:55:24.460]  let's go spend some time
[02:55:24.460 --> 02:55:26.460]  economically
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:28.460]  getting great products at great prices
[02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:30.460]  and supporting the info war
[02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:32.460]  we got a big nut to crack
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:34.460]  because I understand equilibrium
[02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:36.460]  we're not going to stay the same
[02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:38.460]  we're going to either shrink or get bigger
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:40.460]  and if we shrink we'll be destroyed
[02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:42.460]  I need to surge this year
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:44.460]  that means I've already told my wife
[02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:46.460]  I'm going to have to start working 18 hours a day
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:48.460]  again no matter what it does to my body
[02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:50.460]  and even though I love my children
[02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:52.460]  more than anything at least
[02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:54.460]  week on week off when my children
[02:55:54.460 --> 02:55:56.460]  one week on and off with my ex-wife some of them

[02:55:58.460 --> 02:56:00.460]  I'm going to work 12 hours a day at the other times
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:02.460]  with her home and so

[03:00:10.460 --> 03:00:24.460]  alright the often amazing always incredible Leanne McAdoo is coming up in the next segment final segment with Roger Stone because he's got big breaking things he has to beaver away at he'll be back on the warm at three o'clock today in one hour
[03:00:24.460 --> 03:00:34.460]  central news wars.com present planet.com I barely plugged during the show today because the bigger the news day the more big things are happening I just can't get focused on it but we need to fund our operation
[03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:40.460]  you talk about brand forged about the products you love Roger but separate from that
[03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:49.460]  clearly we're delivering on bringing back America clearly we're under attack and I'm not bitching I'm just letting folks know we're under attack because we're telling the truth
[03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:59.460]  we've changed the world here but all the things Obama's lawyers suing you all the attacks I mean they're trying to destroy us this is total war
[03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:09.460]  so I want to thank the listeners for their support as we entered 2018 but I want to just remind them as I told you on election night man yeah I'm glad Trump got elected now the fight is on
[03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:21.460]  because we've got to make sure this success happens he gets that too or they're going to destroy his name our name they're going to demonize capitalism Christianity this is the big battle right now a lot of folks are betting on China
[03:01:21.460 --> 03:01:34.460]  they're hoping this stalls out they're hoping to get a Jimmy Carter type elected if you know in a few years if this thing stalls so this is a total death battle so let's do that call to arms for support Roger and your own words
[03:01:34.460 --> 03:01:39.460]  for M4store.com because we need folks to commit
[03:01:39.460 --> 03:01:50.460]  you know what I'm finding Alex is that a lot of people are really liking the expanded program David Knight in the morning with real news the war room that Owen Shroyer and I are doing together and of course they love to tune in for you
[03:01:50.460 --> 03:02:03.460]  none of this is possible without listener and viewer support as I say almost every day some people have the impression that we have rich right wing fat cats writing checks to subsidize our operations and that's not true
[03:02:03.460 --> 03:02:17.460]  we depend solely on our listeners and viewers and the patriots out there who support what we do who support our mission and who know we don't have any corporate sponsors in the background saying oh no Alex you can't report that
[03:02:17.460 --> 03:02:26.460]  notice Breitbart got the fat cats and some of them are good or whatever but notice there was treachery and Machiavelli we don't we get zero of that here zero
[03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:39.460]  we have total independence in M4Wars but that's because the people we work for are the people who buy these products we don't have any one person who determines what's said on M4Wars other than the editor in chief
[03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:46.460]  this is the most independent media operation I've ever worked with and that's why it's so important that people support us at the store
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:03:00.460]  where by the way my book the making of the president 2016 which outlines the role that M4Wars played in the nomination of Donald Trump so that he could become president can be gotten at a better price than if you went to Amazon
[03:03:00.460 --> 03:03:05.460]  so folks please go to the store support us and the expansion will be even greater
[03:03:05.460 --> 03:03:20.460]  when I was in Austin I got a tour of the studio in construction which will be state of the art and it will just make for much better stronger pro-freedom commissions broadcasts from Austin and around the globe
[03:03:20.460 --> 03:03:35.460]  and even though that studio is the cutting edge even Fox News doesn't have one like this $600,000 I don't have a private jet or a mansion it goes back into this it's the satellites we're about to pay for three new satellites we have thousands of TV stations that are literally there
[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:45.460]  we have to do at least three it's a million and a half bucks a year this closed cab seating is $100,000 a year we don't have the money right now so I've got to hustle do some things
[03:03:45.460 --> 03:03:50.460]  we got one satellite right now it's not the one stations want we've already got a bunch of stations picking it up
[03:03:50.460 --> 03:04:00.460]  so we're in a big push right now folks and I'm about to sign big checks and soon I'll be able to talk about the stuff behind the scenes it's been unbelievable
[03:04:00.460 --> 03:04:06.460]  and I don't bitch about the attacks I expected them but it's just if people could see it you'd really support

[03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:25.460]  quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae
[03:05:25.460 --> 03:05:37.460]  and I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the preglinone to it

[03:05:59.460 --> 03:06:21.460]  music
[03:06:21.460 --> 03:06:32.460]  I am Leanne McAdoo coming to you live and last minute from my studio here in Florida so good to be back with you all we've got so much to talk about
[03:06:32.460 --> 03:06:43.460]  obviously the big bombshell right now is this FISA memo everyone's talking about it except of course the establishment media they don't want to talk about this they don't think it's a big deal
[03:06:43.460 --> 03:06:54.460]  something that whispers and rumblings that this could send people to jail very top level people could be facing jail time but that's not important
[03:06:54.460 --> 03:07:06.460]  that's not important to people like Chris Cuomo over at CNN he doesn't want to talk about that you know it's just more of a look over here show that they're putting on is what we're being told
[03:07:06.460 --> 03:07:22.460]  the Republicans have nothing so I'm really interested to find out what's going on and we'll play a little flashback video because just last week we had former secret service agent Dan Bongino saying something is about to happen
[03:07:22.460 --> 03:07:39.460]  that there is something a brewing an explosive scandal ready to burst dealing with this dirty dossier so imagine being Hillary Clinton and the DNC and people who thought this dossier was going to bring down Trump and it's actually backfiring
[03:07:39.460 --> 03:07:57.460]  and man this is a scandal that is they're saying it's going to really finally undo President Obama's savior image once and for all so I want to go ahead and play that clip with Dan Bongino where he's talking about what's breaking this week
[03:07:57.460 --> 03:08:09.460]  Dan why is this problematic? Gosh where do we start with this case this is the biggest mess I'm telling you it's the most explosive scandal it's getting ready to burst with this OIG report coming out now
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:20.460]  but on this specific incident it's about the Trump transition record emails with GSA why not get a warrant I was a federal investigator for 12 years and a local police officer for four
[03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:29.460]  well worked with a police officer for two years as a cop why not get a warrant in the most consequential counterintelligence investigation in American history why not
[03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:40.460]  basically because this is a hoax I said to you for the show we're asking all the wrong questions here the question the juror has been what was the dossier used to get a warrant on Trump
[03:08:40.460 --> 03:08:56.460]  wrong question important question but the wrong one the real question is why get a warrant at all why was the Trump team being spied on nobody has pointed out one single predicate crime to point out why Donald Trump's team is being spied on not one
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:09:13.460]  exactly I mean are the Democrats okay with this are they okay because it was President Obama and his DOJ and his buddies that were actually involved in this scandal and surveilling a citizen a private citizen at that point
[03:09:13.460 --> 03:09:28.460]  President Trump hadn't even clenched the nomination and you know for some reason even with the votes against releasing this and declassifying this FISA memo saying no no no the American people they don't need to know about this
[03:09:28.460 --> 03:09:43.460]  why I mean are they okay with this abuse of power this apparent abuse of power because you know I guess that means that they're they're going to let the tyrant Trump turn around and do the same thing coming up in 2018 and 2020
[03:09:43.460 --> 03:09:58.460]  I mean this is a real problem and that is why people are saying this is huge the American people need to know at the very least release the memo so that it will stop all the conspiracy theories that are going to play out because of this
[03:09:58.460 --> 03:10:13.460]  this is a memo circulating on the hill but it was written by Republicans classified by Republicans why why don't they just get it declassified there they're putting it on the the the Democrats to declassify it so it is kind of a game that's being played right now
[03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:29.460]  a lot of people are also saying well why doesn't the president just declassify that original FISA order in the first place so we can see who you know who was really behind all of this I feel like if the president were to do something like that he would still be turned into the
[03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:46.460]  he would be demonized it wouldn't make as big of a splash and we all know that president Trump has a flair for the dramatic so perhaps he is you know holding out to really really underscore and completely rewrite the legacy of the former president
[03:10:46.460 --> 03:11:03.460]  and his administration and so many people are saying that this is going to be completely devastating and that once and for all it is going to be the toughest pill to swallow for the media who has just really been riding on this Russian collusion narrative and trying you notice when it all sort of
[03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:18.460]  circled back around to the Democrats with this dossier that kind of got pushed away kind of got silenced and so you know it's interesting that this broke last night I couldn't get any sleep because the release the memo hashtag went viral on
[03:11:18.460 --> 03:11:35.460]  Twitter the fact that was even allowed to go viral on Twitter was very interesting in itself maybe Jack must have been asleep or something to allow that to go viral but this this memo is naming and shaming those who sought to deliberately undermine and obstruct
[03:11:35.460 --> 03:11:51.460]  Trump's presidency so this is a big deal and so let's go to another video that we have a rep congressman Matt Gates he's actually talking to Fox News explaining a little bit about this this FISA memo it's a long clip so we'll just try to get into the
[03:11:51.460 --> 03:12:06.460]  meat of it here he's saying that this could end the Mueller investigation once and for all have you seen the memo sir yes or no I have and I share the concerns that have just been expressed by Congressman Meadows and Congressman Jordan our
[03:12:06.460 --> 03:12:22.460]  public is in jeopardy if we allow this type of a palace coup environment to continue to persist and that's why I'm one of the members of Congress who will be encouraging today intelligence chairman Devin Nunes to release the memo we can have a vote in the
[03:12:22.460 --> 03:12:34.460]  intelligence committee a vote of the full House of Representatives and this is a matter of such importance that I think we need to do it immediately I mean listening to some of this reaction characterize what's in the memo
[03:12:34.460 --> 03:12:49.460]  what's it say unfortunately I can't get into the specific details in a top secret document but that's why we have to release it I don't think it's appropriate for just members of Congress to be horrified by the activities that were that were
[03:12:49.460 --> 03:13:00.460]  undertaken during this endeavor and that's why we've got to allow the American people to see it I will tell you this bill if we get this memo into the public square heads are going to roll at the FBI and at the
[03:13:00.460 --> 03:13:15.460]  Department of Justice one comment no way everyone one comment said it was like the KGB this is really strong language is the suggestion that the abuse on behalf of federal government was indeed spying on Americans without their
[03:13:15.460 --> 03:13:29.460]  knowledge and without proper legal authority yes or no again that would get into the specific contents of the memo I can tell you that we can never live in a country where this type of thing happens and particularly
[03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:44.460]  the authentication processes that are laid out in the memo are of such fiction they are so laughable that they would never withstand scrutiny from the public and what I'm worried about is that the cast of characters
[03:13:44.460 --> 03:13:55.460]  identified in this memo is not a group of people who are gone many of these people are still in our government they still wield influence and that's why we've got to get this information out of public
[03:13:55.460 --> 03:14:06.460]  you just said people will be fired at the FBI and Department of Justice possibly worse I think that there could be people who could face criminal consequences as a result of the activities that are laid out in this memo
[03:14:06.460 --> 03:14:20.460]  and it's easy to see after reading this memo why Senator Grassley and why Senator Graham wanted to refer this matter for criminal prosecution laws were broken this is a big deal here will we see it yes or no
[03:14:20.460 --> 03:14:32.460]  yes I have every confidence after speaking with Paul Ryan and Devin Nunes that after we go through the right procedures and provide the adequate notice to the executive branch that we will release this memo
[03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:46.460]  but we need the public to continue to call for it and I'm encouraged that within the last half hour there've been over 20,000 tweets on Twitter with the hashtag release the memo it shows that the American public is demanding more transparency
[03:14:46.460 --> 03:15:00.460]  and that's really how we drain the swamp in Washington DC more transparency more sunshine it's the best antidote to corruption you've said a lot Matt Gaetz the Republican there from the hill we await to see it then absolutely thank you for your time
[03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:20.460]  thank you right the American people deserve to know if there is evidence of illegal FBI and DOJ buying on the Trump campaign at the behest of whom Hillary Clinton president Barack Obama who who ordered this whose heads are going to roll with this memo we do want to know
[03:15:20.460 --> 03:15:36.460]  this is something that's you know pretty incredible and we're going to have more on this in a minute I want to get into Cuomo talking about you can just see the nerves there trying to you know tell us why this is so important why do the American people need to know
[03:15:36.460 --> 03:15:52.460]  now sneaky Diane Feinstein release the whole Glenn Simpson testimony with Fusion GPS because she felt pressured by some person you know American people needed to know that but we'll get into this a little bit more right after the short break

[03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:44.460]  all right welcome back to the Alex Jones show I am Leanne McAdoo hosting the fourth hour and we've got a lot of clips to run through here let's talk about this looming government shutdown that is you know got everyone's feathers ruffled of course we know no matter what it is going to be blamed on the republicans well they just wouldn't
[03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:56.460]  cow to the demands of the democrats we know that's going to happen either way so today at today's white house press briefing this was kind of brought up like
[03:20:56.460 --> 03:21:15.460]  you know you want to say this is a Schumer's shut down because the democrats are refusing to work with the republicans but you know the republicans control the house and the senate and the white house so you know can't the republicans just get this done no that's not really how it works and so the director of the
[03:21:15.460 --> 03:21:27.460]  office of management and budget Mick Mulvaney actually slammed Jim Acosta and said come on buddy you know as well as everyone that's just not how it works
[03:21:27.460 --> 03:21:45.460]  how can it be the Schumer shutdown when republicans control the white house the house and the senate come on you know the answer to that as well as anybody I mean I have to laugh when people say that oh we control the house and the senate the white house why can't you get this done you know as well as
[03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:57.460]  anybody that it takes 60 votes in the senate to pass appropriations no right you know that I know okay so if you only have 51 votes in the senate then you have to have democrat support in order to keep the government to fund the government so that's the answer to
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:22:16.460]  your question. The president asked congress to come up with a solution for the dreamers congress was in the room members of congress room with president last week I seem to be a fairly productive meeting and then the whole process got blown up. It seems that the whole process was blown up by the president's
[03:22:16.460 --> 03:22:35.460]  combat. When republicans tried to add a discussion about Obamacare to the funding process in 2013 we are accused by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of inserting a non fiscal a non financial issue into the spending process in order to shut the
[03:22:35.460 --> 03:22:48.460]  government down how is that not exactly what is happening today there is no reason you have to deal with DACA this week there's no reason you have to deal with DACA before the end of February excuse me the middle of February DACA doesn't expire till March 5th this is purely an
[03:22:48.460 --> 03:22:57.460]  attempt by the senate democrats led by Mr. Schumer it's why we call it the Schumer shutdown in order to try and get a shutdown that they think this president gets blamed for.
[03:22:57.460 --> 03:23:12.460]  Right and of course so if there's no compromise on the budget by midnight this shutdown will be finalized and you know like Mulvaney points out they're trying to push something on DACA and the dreamers and it's just not necessary.
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:27.460]  Now yeah maybe if we were dealing with the former administration and many administrations before this one. It does take forever to get anything done in Congress but the president already said he had that open door transparent meeting all the press was invited
[03:23:27.460 --> 03:23:43.460]  he said look I'm gonna sign whatever you guys send me I'm not it's whatever you send me if you guys are able to work together and compromise I'm gonna sign it we're not going to be going back and forth so we can hold off on dealing with the dreamers we don't need to wrap that up in this in
[03:23:43.460 --> 03:23:59.460]  this budget it doesn't have anything to do with keeping the government open so the democrats are trying to derail and hold the government hostage in order to get their the demands of their illegal immigrants met totally crazy so I was seeing this narrative coming up
[03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:15.460]  on Twitter well you know the republicans control everything why don't they just pass it and that's not how it works but CNN and Jim Acosta was just gonna run with this narrative can you imagine if they would have just ran with this narrative and Mulvaney never would have
[03:24:15.460 --> 03:24:32.460]  checked him and said come on that's not you know that you need 60 votes to be able to pass this through the Senate why would you even put out that fake news that propaganda but that's what we're dealing with here so there's a video actually by John Bowne where he talks about Jim Acosta being
[03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:50.460]  compared to Charles Manson who working for the Cyop organization let's go ahead and roll that President Trump to Joseph Stalin who called by calling the free press quote the enemy of the people well I'm saying you borrowed that phrase it was popularized by Joseph Stalin used by now as well
[03:24:50.460 --> 03:25:05.460]  the enemy of the people nothing to see here folks just more yellow journalism being forced fed you by the Gellin organization offshoot over there at the operation mockingbird headquarters established in the 1950s by Frank
[03:25:05.460 --> 03:25:20.460]  Wissner Director of the Office of Policy Coordination a covert operations unit created by the United States National Security Council as early as the 1950s CBS Newsweek and the New York Times were Wissner's back pocket
[03:25:20.460 --> 03:25:39.460]  Phil Graham of the Washington Post ran the cabal of journalists for Wissner that would control the public mind and operation that continues to this very day Edward Bernays said we are governed our minds molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested are these
[03:25:39.460 --> 03:25:57.460]  Cyop organization not the very definition of an enemy of the people Thomas Jefferson wrote we hold these truths to be self evident so from the very beginning our freedom has been predicated on truth the founders were visionary in this regard
[03:25:57.460 --> 03:26:14.460]  understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America the enemy of the people was how the president of the United States called the free press in 2017
[03:26:14.460 --> 03:26:32.460]  Mr. President it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies it bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase enemy of the people that even the key to
[03:26:32.460 --> 03:26:48.460]  Cruz Jeff forbade its use telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of quote annihilating such individuals unquote who disagreed with the Supreme Leader and if it's okay to compare the president of the
[03:26:48.460 --> 03:27:08.460]  United States to Joseph Stalin who was responsible for the deaths of roughly 20 million people can we now start comparing Jim Acosta to Charles Manson they've both used cultish disinformation to persuade their followers to consider hostile irrationality against the status quote
[03:27:08.460 --> 03:27:21.460]  Mr. President did you say that you want more people to come in from Norway did you say that you wanted more people to come in from Norway is that true Mr. President I want him to come in from everywhere everywhere thank you very much everybody just Caucasian or white country sir

[03:27:42.460 --> 03:28:00.460]  feral cat through the collective consciousness of the United States the Smith month Modernization Act of 2012 passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act will allow the CIA to flood America with more government propaganda Frank church revealed
[03:28:00.460 --> 03:28:26.460]  in 1975 how the establishment media works hand in glove with the CIA I thought that it was a matter of real concern that planted stories intended to serve a national purpose abroad came home and were circulated here and believed here
[03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:46.460]  because this would mean that the CIA could manipulate the news in the United States by channeling it through some foreign country you see sensationalism has always sold paper and of course that cultish disinfo has only increased ever since the repeal of the Smith

[03:35:31.460 --> 03:35:47.460]  just going to sign them and we'll send them out you know i wanted to talk about something that just i couldn't stop laughing really about this very sad gallup poll that is making the rounds today as if we care what the rest of the world
[03:35:47.460 --> 03:36:05.460]  thinks about president trump's leadership style but apparently that's big news for some of these other media outlets out there so it's a poll under trump global approval of us leadership hits historical low it's a historical low of 30% in
[03:36:05.460 --> 03:36:23.460]  2017 this is other nations approval of the us leadership under president trump and so they're saying this measure signals an 18 point drop from just a year earlier when 48% approved of the national influence under former president
[03:36:23.460 --> 03:36:45.460]  barack obama wow so what does this mean this means that nearly half of the world likes it when the us leads by capitulating and cow touting and and you know bowing down to militant isis commanders and bank rolling
[03:36:45.460 --> 03:36:59.460]  state sponsors of terrorists in iran and sending them billions of dollars in unmarked bills and you know say hey guys don't spend this money on acquiring a nuclear weapon or sponsoring any terrorism am i right
[03:36:59.460 --> 03:37:19.460]  you know the strategic patients that the leadership style of obama he exercised that strategic patients with a nuclear armed madman rocket man the baby right and so this is the soft leadership style that apparently nearly half of the the world would
[03:37:19.460 --> 03:37:37.460]  prefer they they like that sell out teleprompter president obama who you know turned us basically into the united states of apologists so it's no wonder that these globalists and these leaders around the world prefer that
[03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:52.460]  obama they prefer the guy that was such a great negotiator that he got the us tied up in all these really bad deals that president trump is now having to undo so what does this say that in just one year
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:38:08.460]  this approval rating around the world could could just tank oh my goodness what could trump possibly have done to to rattle these guys well he's cut funding to terrorists he stopped sending billions of dollars to the united nations to help support
[03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:23.460]  these nations that absolutely do not have our best interest at heart they don't respect us when it comes time to make decisions that are going to serve American interests he's putting America first in these trade negotiations and putting
[03:38:23.460 --> 03:38:39.460]  American safety first with immigration versus you know the demands of illegal immigrants he has allowed our generals to actually decide when to strike terrorists so in just a year we're seeing the near defeat of isis he's
[03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:54.460]  he's bringing jobs back to the united states you know that we got a store in stock market he's he respects the flag the rule of law so no wonder these globalists don't like him they're like wait you're making America great again we had just destroyed you
[03:38:54.460 --> 03:39:12.460]  man so anyway here's the president Trump's approval rating continuing to tank around the globe screw you guys because Obama's gone now I want to go ahead and play this clip that already going the FCC manipulating the response of the masses Alex Jones report
[03:39:12.460 --> 03:39:37.460]  remember F. Lee Bailey the famous corrupt lawyer you're known for big problems a million dollar fines you name it remember F. Lee Bailey on the OJ Simpson trial they had a white guy do it get up and say the N word over and over
[03:39:37.460 --> 03:39:52.460]  and over and over again to the black jury and that's how they got him off he said the N word 41 times I want to go to YouTube and grab it for documentary purposes they aired it on court TV ABC NBC NBC but I remember years later
[03:39:52.460 --> 03:40:07.460]  years later airing on talk radio on the station manager coming and saying you don't do that and that's the big issue CNN MSNBC broadcast you name it on CBS ABC they are saying every 10 minutes they're playing the clip
[03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:23.460]  every time every minute of quoting the president when he says he didn't say it saying these are SH you know what T countries we've got a cost to saying it we've got them all saying it on CNN you name it again just like F. Lee Bailey
[03:40:23.460 --> 03:40:38.460]  saying the N word over and over and over and over again you can't use it but of a liberal fraudulent corrupt lawyer in my view wants to use it to manipulate a jury and let it can you know clearly a guilty man go free as we now know
[03:40:38.460 --> 03:40:54.460]  if you want to do that you are a bad person if you're not the establishment but if you're the establishment you can so CNN to inflame emotions ABC NBC CBS MSNBC they're all quoting the president
[03:40:54.460 --> 03:41:12.460]  as saying this and saying it to get people out of their comfort zone on mainstream TV to suddenly hear them cussing if I cuss or a caller slips through our stations complain we've lost affiliates before because the FCC will selectively find them
[03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:29.460]  or Howard Stern if he wants to say SHIT he had to leave terrestrial radio because sometimes it was slipped through but now mainstream media they can all do it because the executives are saying go full bore do whatever you want take them out
[03:41:29.460 --> 03:41:43.460]  and now they've got former democrat governors on info wars dot com saying they will punch out the president hashtag hunt republicans they'll kill republicans this is what they say and people are getting attacked hot coffees getting thrown on them
[03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:55.460]  they're getting shot they're getting beat up they're getting their families assaulted and they think it's funny as they usher this country towards civil war and notice the left hadn't come out that I've seen and denied the new documents that came out from the
[03:41:55.460 --> 03:42:12.460]  post group trying to trigger martial law and race riots when Obama had only a year left in office see that story up on info wars dot com incredible I believe the president that he didn't say it but we've seen them lie about him over and over again
[03:42:12.460 --> 03:42:29.460]  I could say that sources say the president snorts methamphetamine in the White House off hooker's rear ends not true but if I said it on CNN they would all parrot it to give it credibility and it's the same thing you never hear them say those things on television they're
[03:42:29.460 --> 03:42:42.460]  not supposed to under the FCC but they're doing it because they want to stick the knife in turn the edge and then put salt in the wound total manipulation

[03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:09.460]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:47:09.460 --> 03:47:15.460]  watch me, watch me, I got it, watch me
[03:47:15.460 --> 03:47:32.460]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is the last segment I'll be with you Leigh Ann McAdoo coming live from Florida and right now we are really witnessing the media crumbling they're in a panic the only thing they've got is name calling
[03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:46.460]  there's so much winning with President Trump he's really trying to bring people together and actually attempting to be the most transparent administration ever by holding these open door meetings and Jim Acosta wants to say well you know we could have got DACA
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:48:05.460]  Trump said but then he used bad language so it's off the table now I mean all of these excuses and it's it's people are wearing is wearing us down I mean people are really tired of this and so it's not a wonder that trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low
[03:48:05.460 --> 03:48:21.460]  people know and believe that they are being lied to that stories are being made up that videos are being edited and that's why people couldn't get enough of Trump's fake news awards and they were like yes please do this and so I guess in an effort to
[03:48:21.460 --> 03:48:39.460]  you know undo some of that apparent bias that has earned them top billing on the fake news awards we have the New York Times and CNN other outlets actually talking to real life Trump supporters and not just the crazy circus freaks that they try to find at every rally
[03:48:39.460 --> 03:48:57.460]  to say well look I told you they're all racist no they're actually talking to just your average American educated cares about their country concerned with what's what's happening here and these were done this week Wednesday Thursday in a series of
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:49:13.460]  letters to the editor in the New York Times and they just printed the letters and allowed these Trump supporters to to say and make their best case for why they support the president and why they think he's doing a good job and this is newsworthy
[03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:29.460]  because the paper comes out right and they admit that they've been overly critical of the president and that they are printing all these dark stories about him and admitting they don't normally give a voice to Trump supporters so again and they're doing this in the
[03:49:29.460 --> 03:49:45.460]  period of open debate so all of these these are really great if you've got the ability to access these new york new york times articles and read some of them they make a really good case for giving these president that high marks for his progress they talk about him
[03:49:45.460 --> 03:50:01.460]  and nearly defeating ISIS cutting taxes for middle class families making those great court appointments prioritizing American citizens over illegal immigrants you know getting us out of those really bad deals the TPP on day one before he even went to his parade my goodness
[03:50:01.460 --> 03:50:19.460]  and of course you know putting real pressure on North Korea and Iran you know newsflash not everyone is Hillary Clinton's deplorables of a lot of Trump supporters are well informed and care about the country and so this was you know it seemed as if it's
[03:50:19.460 --> 03:50:33.460]  an effort by the New York Times to be more fair and balanced but that's not what's happening here when CNN goes and wants to talk to those former Democrats who switched and vote for Trump oh well we want to hear how do you feel a year later were you happy with
[03:50:33.460 --> 03:50:49.460]  your decision they don't care I mean it's just like the drive by journalism they did right after the election when they went out to places and painted all the Trump voters as these poor people in these factory towns who just were duped by
[03:50:49.460 --> 03:51:05.460]  this president and he's not really going to do anything for them lo and behold a year later jobs are coming back more money in people's pockets and so what's really happening here is the media is trying to regain a lot of that lost audience
[03:51:05.460 --> 03:51:19.460]  they had and they want to bring in those Trump supporters and say look guys we know we've been unfair we're going to give you a shot we're going to let you air your grievances and print your letters to the editor will be we're going to hire some
[03:51:19.460 --> 03:51:37.460]  conservative columnist like Brett Stevens at the New York Times but what they don't tell you is that these conservative columnists are never Trumpers so even though they're trying to get away from their coastal in the elitist liberal bias that they've really been
[03:51:37.460 --> 03:51:49.460]  dragged with they're trying to say you know we're we're being more fair about it's it's they're never Trumpers so any story that you're going to get out of these outlets even though they're giving a conservative slant they're going to be filtered
[03:51:49.460 --> 03:52:09.460]  through that negative never Trump or bias and so that's what's happening here this is to try to regain some of that objectivity for the 2018 elections coming up 2018 and 2020 they want to try and dupe us into believing that they are now all of a sudden going to be objective
[03:52:09.460 --> 03:52:28.460]  because again after the repeal or the Smith month modernization act in 2012 went into effect in 2013 that was really when you could see the media losing all objectivity they didn't even try to hide the fact that they were support Hillary Clinton and that there's
[03:52:28.460 --> 03:52:42.460]  so much opinion and bias in their reporting I mean it's just incredible if people aren't familiar with that Smith month modernization act that was put in place back in the 40s to stop the CIA and the government from
[03:52:42.460 --> 03:52:58.460]  pushing propaganda on US citizens they were pumping it out to the rest of the world but you know they weren't supposed to be pro pushing propaganda on the United States that was revealed at the church hearings and so then with this Smith month modernization
[03:52:58.460 --> 03:53:17.460]  as defined by you know good old president Obama they're allowed to push propaganda now they don't have to hide it and by golly they sure have been especially with this dirty dossier now I want to go to another clip this one is Rob do and Alex Jones
[03:53:17.460 --> 03:53:33.460]  and they talk about you know speaking of propaganda think about Silicon Valley Twitter Facebook how they're controlling the information that we are allowed to read and to speak it's all a form of that control and that that's
[03:53:33.460 --> 03:53:47.460]  let's go to this this report by Alex Jones and Rob do knowing the power of the people knowing that was coming on the Internet they created these things so people would make it big and then now they come in and censor it while they want to censor any other site these
[03:53:47.460 --> 03:54:03.460]  things that we had us but it's a fraud it's racketeering it's fake advertising it's discrimination we hit them there but like Matt drudge said and as I've said we got to create our own websites like info wars dot com or news wars dot com we've got to create our own platforms
[03:54:03.460 --> 03:54:21.460]  and listeners have to go to those platforms realizing and share that info realizing that it's all up to us if you go to news wars dot com or prison planet dot com and if you go there and if you share those links on the enemies platforms with your own
[03:54:21.460 --> 03:54:37.460]  email your own by hand they can't stop us so at the end of the day it's up to you but they are already ratcheted us down but because we fought so hard we've stayed the same size last year which is completely confounded them so they're in panic mode that's why they have congressional
[03:54:37.460 --> 03:54:53.460]  hearings everything else because it's not working well the answer is sue congressman quickly saying shut us down as fake news for civil rights violations and we're behind the scenes suing people they'll be public lawsuits don't worry but we're doing it
[03:54:53.460 --> 03:55:09.460]  you were ahead of your time by creating you created a social media platform years ago it ended up you know kind of dying well I got infiltrated and it wasn't all fancy with CIA money but right right you didn't have CIA backing you didn't have the push to the front but still it's people that need to make things
[03:55:09.460 --> 03:55:19.460]  like that like their own social media sites to take away and then gab did and google bans it on there and then calls for it to be shut down right they don't want competition
[03:55:19.460 --> 03:55:29.460]  and it's like hey if you don't like what the people are saying on gab don't respond to them or don't put don't follow them but it's way beyond all that we're under total criminal censorship attack oh yeah
