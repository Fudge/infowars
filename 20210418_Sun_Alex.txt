[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  We've got to stay on the street and we've got to get more active.
[00:04.000 --> 00:07.000]  We've got to get more confrontational.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.000]  We've got to make sure that they know that we need business.
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.000]  Info wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  It's Sunday, April 18th. The year is 2021.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  And Maxine Waters, along with major CNN hosts and others,
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  are calling for violence and calling for dead white people.
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  That's right. Cuomo said we need dead young white people
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  before we care about the pandemic of police shooting black people
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  which doesn't exist.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  This is the mainstream media owned by foreign corporations
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  dividing and conquering Americans on record.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  It's even in the WikiLeaks.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  And then Maxine Waters just came out and said from Minnesota
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  that you need to be more controversial.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  You need to occupy the streets. You need to be aggressive.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  She's the same one that said go and confront Republicans getting their faces.
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  And then she's the same person that says everybody should be charged with terrorism
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  that entered the Capitol most of them peacefully.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  This is so hypocritical. It's total fraud.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  We decry all of this offence of violence.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  But we have multinational corporations that are dividing and conquering this country right now.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  And they want to distract us from destroying our borders,
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  from destroying our dollar, from selling us out to China,
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  from the slave camps that Apple runs in China.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  And that's why all the big corporations have given $10.6 million
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  the last year to Black Lives Matter to make that the huge issue.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  And within hours of Maxine Waters calling for violence,
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  the National Guard and Police just got shot at in Minnesota and were almost killed.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  This is a designed civil war they're trying to trigger, and we've got to stop it.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  So on this live special Sunday night broadcast,
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, who's an expert on this,
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  is going to be co-hosting with Owen Shroyer.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  I'm going to be popping in with special reports for the next four hours.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  The Alex Jo Show into Sunday live with Owen Shroyer tonight.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  But to watch Cuomo say this, to watch Maxine Waters say this,
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  while they activate the CIA illegally, domestically against Trump supporters,
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  because a few hundred people went in the Capitol,
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  and a few hundred people might have gotten the fist fight with the cops.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  Now, all of us are guilty while they've burned down cities, police stations,
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  all across the country last summer,
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  and now we're heating up to do it again to hold the city's hostage until local governments,
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  this is the key, turn control their police departments over to George Soros,
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  who already has most of the DA's, who already has most of the blue city mayors,
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  who already has many of the state's attorney generals,
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  who will then prosecute police officers who make a mistake
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  or who are outnumbered and get attacked,
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  to then bully them to politically align with the left,
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  and then they'll be totally protected.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  When the police attack viciously folks for lock-downs, liberals love it.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  When the police shoot a white person wrongly, the media loves it,
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  because it's simple divide and conquer, this is the takeover.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  This is called the Strong Cities Initiative of Obama and the UN,
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  where they had UN summits and said they're turning America over to the UN.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  The UN's in charge of immigration laws, of the refugee laws,
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  and when Biden first got in the election theft,
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  they had a UN meeting with all of them up there,
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  officially turning power over to the UN.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  How do they win this? How do they win this war?
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  They try causing a race war here, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  and they are literally activating so many groups of racist black people
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  to go out and start fights with whites, to kill whites,
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  and the media tries to cover it up.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  The average black person is involved in this,
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  but this is still so sad, and all people, whether you're black or white,
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  it doesn't matter, you've got to decry racial violence
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  or offensive violence of any type.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  So Robert Barnes coming up, Owen Sawyer coming up.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  A lot of exclusive footage we haven't aired from the border coming up.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  Bill Maher coming out, and the wheels are coming off the COVID hoax.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  So is Secretary Carlson. The truth is coming out,
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  but only because we're still on the air,
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  only because you're taking action.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  Don't underestimate how important you are,
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  and don't ever underestimate how important your word of mouth is.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  So take the live feed of this Sunday show,
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  share with everyone you know right now,
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  and let them know that this is the attempt to take down,
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  not just in America, but the whole world
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  by these ruthless, wicked corporate globalists that exploit the third world,
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  collapse the third world under a lockdown,
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  flood through the third world, and then try to trigger a race for.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side with Robert Barnes and more.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  Stay with us.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  What should protesters do?
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  Well, we've got to stay on the street,
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  and we've got to get more active,
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  we've got to get more confrontational,
[04:46.000 --> 05:05.000]  we've got to make sure that they know that we need this.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  Ranny Dewright, Ranny Dewright,
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called,
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  People think I'm 55 years old,
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  and I was already taking your other supplements,
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do,
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation,
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately,
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  but, you know, over a period of time,
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket,
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know,
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.000]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[06:01.000 --> 06:12.000]  MUSIC
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[06:20.000 --> 06:27.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, April 18, 2021.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  Owen Schreuer sitting in the Infowars World headquarters in Austin, Texas
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  to let you know what is coming up here live at Infowars for the next four hours.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  Legal expert, constitutional law expert Bob Barnes
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  is about to host the Alex Jones show.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  I'll be bringing us in and out of some of the breaks,
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  just with breaking news from the live studio,
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  but Robert Barnes will be hosting the Alex Jones show
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  from 4 to 6 p.m. Central today,
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  and then from 6 to 8,
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  I am going to be hosting an emergency broadcast,
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  the Southern Border Emergency Broadcast.
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  For two hours, I'm going to be giving you the expert analysis,
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  my expert analysis of everything that's going on at the Southern Border
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  and the human trafficking operation,
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  but frankly, there's really nobody else out there that knows this like I do.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  I've been on the ground there for weeks.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  There's no other media.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  The only people who may know more than I do about this
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  are the people that are actually running it and or the Border Patrol,
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  but they've been gagged.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  So we have to be the voice of truth here to tell you about Joe Biden's human smuggling,
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  human smuggling operation being run by Joe Biden,
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  the illegal immigration pipeline going through McAllen, Texas, and other such places.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  So for two hours, I'm going to be breaking that down and taking your calls,
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  what your observations have been, what you've been noticing.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Maybe you live in a border town, maybe you are a Border Patrol agent,
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  maybe you know a Border Patrol agent, maybe you're married to a Border Patrol agent.
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  So we're going to do that for two hours from 6 to 8.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  But first, we go to Robert Barnes here to talk about the unbelievable behavior,
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  the criminal behavior of Maxine Waters, in fact, criminal behavior.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  Now, Bob, when Donald Trump made a speech, they said,
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  oh, he's inciting violence, he's inciting violence.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  And they censored him across the Internet and they tried to impeach him.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  But when Maxine Waters goes out in the middle of riots,
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  when Maxine Waters multiple times says,
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  form a crowd, get confrontational, get more confrontational,
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  and then violence follows directly after at the very riots that she's at.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  Nobody seems to bat an eye, law enforcement doesn't seem to care,
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  no calls for impeachment or removal of Maxine Waters.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  So Bob, break down the criminal behavior and the incitement of a violent
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  and crossing state lines to incite a riot that Maxine Waters is guilty of.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  Well, Mad Max has definitely taken a different path,
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  and it's a path that's particularly precarious for justice in the United States.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  Because this is happening when it's happening is the most problematic.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  This is happening on the eve of closing arguments in the Derek Chauvin trial
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  concerning the death of George Floyd.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  And this is happening on the eve of the jury deliberating,
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  and it is happening while the jury is known to be not sequestered.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  It means the jury is going to see this news, see this information, see this,
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  where basically you have a member of Congress threatening the jury
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  that if they don't convict Chauvin, there will be more, quote,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  confrontation, more going to the streets, basically more riots, more threats.
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  And these are jurors, many of whom during the jury selection process,
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  voiced concern about their own well-being and safety
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  if they were merely involved in the case.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  And so the judge made the decision to still hold the jury in Minneapolis
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  with jurors from Minneapolis, even though during jury selection
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  they found out about the $27 million payoff to race baiter, race grifter,
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  Ben Crump and crew for the George Floyd family and others.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  And now they've got seen riots for more than a week based on a misrepresentation
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  of what took place in the death that also took place from police shootings
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  this past week in Minneapolis.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  And now they have an explicit threat from a member of Congress
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  that if they don't vote to convict, then the confrontational tactics will be escalated,
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  then people have been called out to go to the streets.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  Imagine if Trump had said anything even close to this prior to January 6th,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  he would be imprisoned today.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  Instead, here you have someone trying to effectively tamper with the jury,
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  not just incite riotous behavior, but tamper with the jury,
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  tamper with the criminal justice process and the rest.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  And the reason is because they desperately need a conviction in this case.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  The media needs a conviction in this case.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  The Democrats need a conviction in this case.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  BLM, which apparently means by-luxury mansions in fact, needs a conviction in this case.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  And the reason is because the media narrative has been a false narrative.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  The reason why they're scared, the reason why they're nervous,
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  the reason why they're frightened about the verdict is even though this is a jury
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  that's going to have six African-American members extraordinarily diverse
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  from Minneapolis, which normally would have one African-American member on a jury.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  Despite that being a Minneapolis Democratic jury pool,
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  where 80 to 90% of the likely jurors voted for Joe Biden in the last election,
[11:45.000 --> 11:52.000]  despite the fact that almost 90% of Biden voters said that they would vote to convict Chauvin
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  even before the trial started, despite the fact that most of these jurors said
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  during jury selection that they lean towards guilt.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  They're nervous and terrified of a not guilty verdict,
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  especially on the top count of felony murder,
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  because after all, Derek Chauvin was willing to plead guilty to the third-degree murder charge,
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  which is more serious than the second-degree manslaughter charge.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  So they're desperate for a felony murder conviction,
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  which carries up to 40 years of federal prison time,
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  because they need the media narrative to be vindicated in the court of public opinion.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  Indeed, the prosecutors in this case, rather uniquely, rather unusually,
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  chose to pursue the case not based on their best evidentiary theory of guilt,
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  but rather based on the media narrative.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  So they put a lot of false evidence, made a lot of false statements in front of the jury,
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  and what all the Democrats know, and what the media knows,
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  and what those who followed the case in detail know,
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  is the media narrative was a big, fat lie.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  It was just like, hands up, don't shoot.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  It was just like, oh, he just had a play gun, and nobody knows why he was shot.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  Oh, he was shot because he was eating a sandwich.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  Oh, he was shot because he was driving while black.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  He was shot and killed because he went out for some Skittles.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  These are the lie after lie after lie, told of the Michael Brown case,
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  told of the Trayvon Martin case, told of the Tamir Rice case,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  told in case after case after case, and what happened here,
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  in fact, at what the jury saw was a very different story.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  There was a witness that said he was blood choked.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  The government's own state examiner admitted that didn't happen.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  There was a witness that said he was choked out by a respiratory choke.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  The government's own witnesses admitted that didn't happen.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  And leading experts also concluded the government itself
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  couldn't decide on what the cause of death was.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  The government itself, their own witnesses, contradicted each other
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  throughout the entire trial about whether or not it was an even excessive force,
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  whether or not it was even justifiable force.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  And the intent evidence ended up not being anywhere near as strong
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  as the media has pretended it was all along.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  It turns out that Chauvin didn't have his knee on his neck the entire time.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  It turns out he was balancing his weight all the way through.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  It turns out all of the data and evidence shows that that method
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  of prone position bodily restraint rarely or never results in death.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  We'll get into what some of those studies are.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  We'll get in during the show to what some of the expert testimony was at trial.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  But the reason why she's up there extorting the jury into a guilty verdict,
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  into this legalized lynching of Derek Chauvin,
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  is because they know the facts don't support their case.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  And imagine if this person they held up as a martyr,
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  imagine if this case they held up as an indictment
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  of the criminal justice process in America ends up indicting them instead.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  And they can't afford that.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  That's why they're willing to risk mistrials, willing to risk appellate reversals,
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  willing to risk future habeas petitions,
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  just to secure a conviction now to vindicate their narrative in the court of public opinion.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  And that is why Mad Max is saying I will incite riots on the eve of jury deliberation
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  unless you do what I tell you to do.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  And that's why she's been the leader of it.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  And it's not a coincidence she went right into Minneapolis
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  to do so right on the eve of closing arguments knowing the jurors were not sequestered.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  Frankly, they should have been.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  So the defense counsel requested that last week and I'm sure the judge is unhappy that this happened
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  because he really has been trying to establish a fair trial.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  It turns out it just couldn't be a fair trial in Minneapolis.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  When we come back after the break, we'll get into more not only of what Mad Max's dangerous statements are
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  for a legalized lynching in America,
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  but also what some of the damning evidence of the government's own theories were
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  right from the witness stand and play some of those bits as well
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  and get into some of the underlying evidence about the whole mythology that prone position restraint
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  is a high risk restraint when in fact it's far less risk than what can happen
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  when people try to tase as we found out last week.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  So we come back after the break.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  We'll get into more about the attempt of a legalized lynching in the Derek Chauvin trial.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  It's very simple.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  Every household, not just in America but worldwide,
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  should be taking a high quality multivitamin mineral every single day.
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.000]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed, in fact, in many cases, are toxic.

[19:08.000 --> 19:15.000]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.

[20:23.000 --> 20:29.000]  I'm sure you're sitting in for Alex Jones today, but it's legal expert Robert Barnes
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  who is hosting the show.
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  I'm really excited though to be back tonight, breaking down the southern border crisis.
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  Everything I witnessed there taking your calls on it for two hours.
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.000]  But Bob Barnes is breaking down what's happening in the Derek Chauvin trial
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  where Maxine Waters is basically inciting terroristic threats
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  if the Democrats and mainstream media don't get the result they want,
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  which is of course Chauvin being charged with murder.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  Of course all the evidence goes against this, but let's go back to Bob Barnes
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  breaking it down.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  So let's take a look at the context of this Mad Max video we're about to witness.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  The jury, despite defense request, has not been sequestered.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  So they are seeing all of this on their social media, seeing this on newspaper sites, web sites, TV sites,
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  and even if there's not supposed to avoid any coverage of the Floyd Chauvin case itself,
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  this coverage is taking place in a quote unquote different context.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  So it is highly likely to get through based on jurors prior admissions
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  that they saw the settlement news and information,
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  even though they'd been previously instructed to not see or read anything.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  It's just impossible for them to follow that instruction in the modern social media
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  and media-saturated storyline concerning this case.
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  It's in that context and knowing, knowing the jury's not sequestered,
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  that the jury has frequently been exposed to this kind of exposure,
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  that third, that the jury is about to start to deliberate
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  while they've witnessed riots for a week and looting for a week.
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  So in that context, let's play what Mad Max said in a video clip number four.
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  Form reform. And so, yes, I would like to see the bill in Congress passed on police reform,
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  but I know that the right wing, the racist are opposed to it,
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  and I don't know what's going to happen to it, but I know this.
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  We've got to stay in the street, and we've got to demand justice.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  As a black man, despite all of the efforts, I feel like nothing changes.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  And George Floyd is waking so many people up, yet nothing has happened,
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  despite the rhetoric. What needs to happen that's different this year than all the years before?
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  We're looking for a guilty verdict.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  We're looking for a guilty verdict, and we're looking to see if all of the fault
[22:53.000 --> 22:58.000]  that took place and has been taking place after they saw what happened to George Floyd,
[22:58.000 --> 23:05.000]  if nothing does not happen, then we know that we've got to not only stay in the street,
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  but we've got to fight for justice.
[23:08.000 --> 23:17.000]  But I am very hopeful and I hope that we're going to get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  And if we don't, we cannot go away.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  And not just manslaughter, right? I mean...
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  Oh, no, not manslaughter. No, no, no. This is just a guilty for murder.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  I don't know whether it's in the first degree, but as far as I'm concerned, it's first degree here.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  What happens if we do not get what you just told?
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  What should the people do? What should protesters do?
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.000]  I didn't hear you.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  What happens?
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  What should protesters do?
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  Well, we've got to stay on the street, and we've got to get more active.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  We've got to get more confrontational.
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.000]  We've got to make sure that they know that we make business.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  We've got to make sure that they know we make business.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  So here she's demanding the jury convict of the top count, and if they don't,
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  they're basically extorting them that they're going to increase being in the streets,
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  increase the level of confrontation.
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  And this comes in the context in which there have been riots for days,
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  attacks on police for days, attacks on police precincts for days,
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  attacks on local people who can't even get to their own homes in their own neighborhoods
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  for days, looting for days, arson for days.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  In that context, she says that confrontation tactics need to get more,
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  need to increase, and it comes in the context of jurors already voicing concern.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  This is why the jurors are anonymous so far, already voicing concern of their own safety
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  for merely participating in this trial, and it comes on top of a police officer
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  who was involved in the alleged wrongful shooting that triggered this latest stage of riots,
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  which there's controversy over whether or not it was an intentional mistake
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  as opposed to a negligent mistake.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  But putting that aside, her address getting docked to where they had to put police
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  and fences around her home on 24-7 basis.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  So that's the context in which Mad Max is extorting a legalized lynching
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  of Derek Chauvin saying if you don't bring out his head on a rope,
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  then they're going to basically put other people's heads on a rope in Minneapolis.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  That's the mindset and the mentality that is being communicated by a member of Congress,
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  not just a local activist, not just some local city council member,
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  a member of Congress, a long-serving member of Congress,
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  who also chairs critical committees in Congress.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  And you can guarantee she went too manyapolis to make sure this news and information
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  was circulated to everybody, including almost guaranteed the jurors in the case.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  And so this is an extortion attempt to get a legalized lynching
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  because she knows that basically she's been pushing a big lie.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  It's been a lie all the way through.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  It's the, I mean, Mark Dice did a video about Black Lives Matter
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  because Black Lives Matter has often told so many fictions and fabrications about the reality
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  of this case and others.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  In that context, let's just, we're going to show a little bit later on in the show,
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  video excerpts of trial testimony.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  But I'll give you a quick summation of that testimony.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  The first question for the jury is whether or not Derek Chauvin exercised
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  unreasonable, unjustifiable force.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  The force he used was the prone position,
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  where his knee was mostly not on the neck for most of the time period,
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  where he was shifting his body weight and where studies and surveys from Canada,
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  from public, from the United States, from medical professionals and forensic experts,
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  forensic medical experts around the world have shown that one of the safest ways
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  to restrain a suspect, one of the safest ways to control a suspect,
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  one of the safest ways to detain a suspect is to put them in a prone position
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  with body weight controlling them.
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  Why? Because it turns out that it is extremely rare.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  They looked at thousands of cases in Canada.
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  They looked at thousands of cases in the United States.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  And they found, and then they looked at,
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  it gave examples of people putting on more body weight for much longer periods of time.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  And what did study after study after study confirm?
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  It confirmed that being in the prone position with body weight being put on you,
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  even more body weight than was put on Floyd,
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  even for longer time periods than happened with Floyd,
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  study after study came back and found no deaths out of thousands of cases,
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  zero deaths taking place because of that prone position.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  It is much safer than using a taser.
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  It is much safer than pulling your gun.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  It is much safer than using a baton.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  It is much safer than almost every other method and mechanism of force that you can use.
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  In fact, what came out of trial is that the body cam footage that the media has been trying to hide
[28:00.000 --> 28:07.000]  and that the state tried to keep from the public for months after this case originally became public
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  is that George Floyd himself requested to lie on the ground repeatedly.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  He requested not to be placed in the police car,
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  but because of his health condition he asked to be put on the ground knowing what that was
[28:21.000 --> 28:28.000]  and throughout the entire process and was complaining he couldn't breathe before he was ever put on the ground.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  Why? Because he had a severe heart condition.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  Why? Because he had a tumor that released massive amounts of adrenaline.
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  Why? Because he had just taken a sudden ingestion of a lethal amount of fentanyl.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  That was three times the rate that would kill a normal person.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  That's why he had done the exact same thing, sudden ingestion of drugs when caught just a year before.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  And that's the evidence that the media and the press has tried to cover up.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  That's why they're scared of the verdict. That's why they need to extort a verdict.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  We'll get back into more of those details right after this.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  and that is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  Whether you are old, whether you are spanned in quite black, it doesn't matter. You've got red blood.
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  And it's crazier things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and put some message in your heart to support us.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse. God bless.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  I'm going to say it again. I am not lecturing you. I'm lecturing myself.
[30:04.000 --> 30:10.000]  I need to take vitamin mineral fusion every day. It tastes great. It's all natural.
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  It's got all the vitamins, all the minerals that are essential and amino acids.
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  Mix it up in the morning, little quarter scoop, put the whole pitcher with the whole scoop.
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  It lasts you four or five days in the refrigerator. Pour yourself a big glass of ice.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  And it's so good in the morning and noon and night.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  Whatever you do, get in that one glass a day.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  It's been sold out for a while. It's back in stock.
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion, infowarstore.com for your immune system, your body's defenses,
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  but especially your family and friends and old folks.
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.000]  And people with darker skin need to hire vitamin D3 and other things.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  It's all in here, so tell folks about it or give us a gift.
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion, infowarstore.com and Winter Sun, super high quality vitamin D3.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  Back in stock, also discounted. Both of these are 40% off individually.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  50% off together at infowarstore.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:08.000]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website
[31:23.000 --> 31:28.000]  or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link,
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  or a domain you move goes to fund the info war.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.000]  because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.000]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  They're really, really away from the establishment.
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  They're looking for leadership.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  Well, that's where infowarsdomains.com.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  You fund us, you support infowarsdomains.com, you get great products at the same time.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular,
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  That's our job.
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.000]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire,
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  so we can be the shock crews for the information war.
[32:58.000 --> 33:26.000]  Fund us at infowarsdomains.com.
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  Infowar.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  Oh, and so you're here in the infowars world headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.000]  Bob Barnes hosting the Alex Jones show this evening.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  We're going to be going back to legal experts.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  Bob Barnes here momentarily, but quickly, ladies and gentlemen,
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  I wanted to remind you that coming up from 6 to 8 p.m. on infowars,
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  I'm going to be doing a Sunday night emergency transmission
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  discussing everything I witnessed at the southern border
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  and taking your phone calls as well, things that you've observed,
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  dots that you've connected or questions that you have for me.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  I probably know more about what's going on down there than Biden or Harris combined.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Quite frankly, they haven't been down there.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, remember that we're only able to do this type of coverage
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  with your support at infowarsdomains.com.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  It would not be possible.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  I don't have to talk about the hoops that we have to jump through
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  with the censorship and the attack and everything.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  You know that, but it's your support at infowarsdomains.com
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  that makes it all possible for us to go and do these reports on the road.
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  For us to do the live broadcast 10 hours on weekdays
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  and now four hours on Sunday evenings.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  Put up the Saturday emergency broadcast.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  Have people working around the clock here at infowars.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  Shop at infowarsdomains.com so we can keep this momentum going.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  Shop at infowarsdomains.com so we can keep the truth on air
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  and get all the great guests and all the band guests and people like Bob Barnes on with us.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's only possible when you shop at infowarsdomains.com
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  and when you share the links with friends and family and quite frankly,
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  the store is always getting updated with new specials and new t-shirts and everything.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  infowarsdomains.com.
[35:12.000 --> 35:13.000]  Shop with us.
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  Keep the truth on air.
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  Keep the truth alive.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  Keep the fight for America alive.
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  Keep the resistance alive.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  Shop at infowarsdomains.com.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  We go back now to legal expert Bob Barnes.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  The amazing thing about the Chauvin trial is the precedent it's going to set.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Can the institutional media, can the democratic political hacks
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  weaponize the process so extensively, so expansively
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  that they can force feed a lie onto the jury
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  and get the jury to swallow and regurgitate that lie
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  to allow a legalized lynching.
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  It is the political equivalent of what happened to Emmett Till.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  It is the political equivalent to the old Klan lynchings of the South.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  That's what this case really is.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  If they can lynch Derek Chauvin and do so through the legal process,
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  do so by force feeding a lie into the jury
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  and then regurgitating that lie to the world, they can do it to anybody
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  because this case has been a Soviet style show trial from the get-go.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  Derek Chauvin already has problems because of tax and corruption issues,
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  so he was guaranteed to go to prison one way or the other.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  That is why partially he agreed to plead guilty to a crime he likely did not commit,
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  which was third degree murder, which is supposed to be for devious mind,
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  reckless murder where you go in and shoot at a whole bunch of people and kill one person.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  Here they were trying to apply it to him in a constitutionally questionable manner
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  as both Professor Dershowitz and Professor Turley have acknowledged
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  and admitted the legal and constitutional questions with his statutory construction,
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  and yet we're still in this trial.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  Why are we in a trial where someone was willing to plead guilty,
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  likely to a crime he didn't commit and do 10 years in prison?
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  Because they want a show trial that convicts Chauvin of something he didn't do
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  to feed and justify the media narrative, and if they're able to achieve it and attain it,
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  it poses a direct risk to liberty and our justice system in the United States.
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.000]  If they can convert our criminal justice process into Soviet style, Cuban style show trials,
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  then they can do it to anybody, anywhere, at any time, and that's the point that they're trying to make.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  They can use the justice process to vindicate and validate the lies and deceptions
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  they force fed onto the public.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  Now, if you were in the jury room itself and witnessed what happened in the trial,
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  you would know why Mad Max is so mad.
[37:40.000 --> 37:47.000]  Let's take a look at video clip number five, where a use of force expert who has been certified
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  as such by everybody across the board, has been a police officer for decades,
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.000]  including the FBI certified as one of the top experts in the country on the issues of use of force,
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.000]  explain why the reasonable prone position is reasonable force, not unjustifiable excessive force,
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  especially if you're dealing with someone you believe is experiencing excited delirium.
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.000]  He's under the influence of such drugs, and remember he was 6'5", 6'6", 2'30", 2'40",
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  Chauvin is like 5'8", 5'9", he makes Tom Cruise look tall, you know, 140 pounds.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  Given that disparity, usually especially with a mob around you,
[38:25.000 --> 38:32.000]  trying to keep him under control to avoid escalation is often the appropriate protocol.
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  Let's take a look at video clip number five.
[38:36.000 --> 38:43.000]  Now based upon your training and experience and your expertise in the use of force matters,
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  your review of the materials that have been provided to you,
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  have you formed opinions in this particular case to a reasonable degree of professional certainty?
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  I have.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  And can you just briefly overview your opinions in this particular case?
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified, was acting with objective reasonableness
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  following Minneapolis Police Department policy and current standards of law enforcement
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  and his interactions with Mr. Floyd.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  And that wasn't the only big expert to testify.
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  A former high-ranking medical examiner who consulted with more than a dozen other doctors
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.000]  in his analysis concluded that without any doubt, really, that the death of George Floyd
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  was not caused by the manner of being put in a prone position
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  and being put into a physical restraint, just as it hasn't caused death almost anywhere in the world
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  when they've done a survey and study of it.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  Let's take a look at video clip number six.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  How did the heart and drugs contribute to the cause of death?
[39:49.000 --> 40:00.000]  They were significant or they contributed to Mr. Floyd having a sudden cardiac arrest in my opinion.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  That's how I would read it.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  Okay.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  So I'm going to take this down.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  Yes.
[40:07.000 --> 40:15.000]  So in my opinion, Mr. Floyd had a sudden cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrhythmia
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  due to his atherosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease,
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  or you can write that down multiple different ways,
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.000]  during his restraint and subdual by the police or restraint by the police.
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  And then his significant contributory conditions would be,
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  since I've already put the heart disease in part one,
[40:41.000 --> 40:48.000]  he would have the toxicology, the fentanyl and methamphetamine.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  There is exposure to a vehicle exhaust,
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  so potentially carbon monoxide poisoning,
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  or at least an effect from increased carbon monoxide in his bloodstream
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  and paraganglionoma or the other natural disease process that he has.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  So all of those combined to cause Mr. Floyd's death.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  All right.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  So let's walk through.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  And by the way, when Floyd had been pulled over a year before,
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  he did the same routine.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  He initially refused to comply with police requests,
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  did sudden ingestion of drugs, admitted he did sudden ingestion of serious drugs,
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  and he rushed to the hospital and almost died because his blood pressure was so high.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  So what the expert testimony and other documentary evidentiary testimony
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  that came out at the actual trial was that the media narrative was one big fat lie.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  And Mad Max and the media need the world not to know that.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's why they're extorting the jury with these selectively targeted,
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  selectively released statements on the eve of jury selection.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  And it is critical and essential if this jury is going to uphold the rule of law
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  in America and avoid our trials becoming show trials that are nothing more than legalized lynchings,
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  is that they come back with acquittals, especially on the top felony murder count.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  In fact, if Chauvin is convicted of the other counts, it's kind of irrelevant
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  because Chauvin was willing to plead guilty to those counts.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  So the big count is felony murder.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  And hopefully the jury upholds the justice process.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  If not, hopefully the appeals court or the trial court set aside the verdict
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  based on the insanity of trying to do a trial in this context where members of Congress
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  are threatening the jury pool.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  And last but not least, the public continuing to speak out about these issues,
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  about the consequences of these issues is going to be critical and counterbalancing
[42:44.000 --> 42:50.000]  the threats of riots, the deluding, the burning, the arsoning, the criminality
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  that Mad Max is trying to unleash to extort the jury.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  When we come back, we'll be talking about a little bit more of this,
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  but also Sleepy Joe wants to go to war.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists,
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  They are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign,
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  set the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  It's very simple. Every household, not just in America, but worldwide,
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  should be taking a high-quality, multi-vitamin mineral every single day.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed,
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  in fact, in many cases, are toxic.
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.000]  But the vitamin mineral fusion in stock right now, 40% off at M4store.com,

[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  natural offensive immune system, you're funding the M4 War.

[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  The people are awakening.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments,
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially,
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  for more than a decade.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  Now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.000]  They're Faraday cages.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  They work absolutely great.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  and power over your identity when you are traveling
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[45:56.000 --> 46:21.000]  Or is it m4store.com today?
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  I've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get it, me too.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  that is so essential.
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  And so that's what m4store.com is really all about.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  Thank you for spreading the word about m4store.com.

[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  Our daily and weekly monthly purchases will be taken off the air.
[46:57.000 --> 47:03.000]  So thank you for the support m4store.com.
[47:03.000 --> 47:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Sunday show.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  Robert Barnes here, guest hosting the show.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  Let's get into some of the more of the detail of what is happening in the Chauvin trial
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  and why it is more consequential than just the trial itself.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  So even Jonathan Turley, a left-leaning professor, a law professor from George Washington University,
[47:43.000 --> 47:49.000]  wrote a detailed article this week explaining why the media narrative is completely out of whack
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  with what's actually happening inside the courtroom.
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  They're trying to create a fake narrative that they know the jury would reject
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  if the jury could make it on its verdict, thus Mad Max's sort of insanity.
[48:01.000 --> 48:08.000]  But it's not the only example of the kind of media-narrational bias that is taking place in the press
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  to give other illustrations of it.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  In the Chauvin trial context, they have actually had medical experts get up and testify.
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.000]  There are many absurdities from the Chauvin trial that the government has tried to put on the world in the jury.
[48:20.000 --> 48:28.000]  One is that smoking won't bother your lungs 90% of the time according to the government's experts in the Chauvin trial.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  According to the government's experts in the Chauvin trial, having an enlarged heart can often be good for you.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  According to the government's experts in the Chauvin trial,
[48:39.000 --> 48:46.000]  it's also the case that having 90% blockage of different parts of your heart can be completely fine.
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.000]  According to the medical experts in the Chauvin trial, that taking three times the lethal dose of fentanyl
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  and sudden ingestion of it, well, you could actually just get out and drive your car normally,
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  according to the government's experts in the Chauvin trial.
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  But those aren't the only absurdities they've tried to feed the jury and, by extension, the world.
[49:08.000 --> 49:15.000]  They also had a use of force expert testify about national standards that don't even really exist.
[49:15.000 --> 49:22.000]  According to this use of force expert, if someone's arrested and voices some concerns about their health,
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  then what you're supposed to do is not handcuff them and call them an Uber.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  Don't even put them in the back of the car where the scary isolation could bother them,
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  and you could never put them in a prone position on the ground.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  Notice what happens when police officers think that they can't use physical force
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  to put someone on the ground in a prone position?
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  They go to tasers instead.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  And what happens when they go to tasers instead, you get Dwayne Wright,
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  where the officer thinks she's pulling a taser, instead pulls a gun.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Why does she pull the gun?
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  Well, in part because the local community, the local politicians,
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  went and bought tasers that looked and felt like guns.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  But the media won't cover that side of the story.
[50:04.000 --> 50:12.000]  Instead, race grifter, race bater, Ben Crump, is saying that the person was shot simply for, quote,
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  driving while black when actually he was pulled over for basic violations of traffic rules.
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.000]  And the only reason they tried an arrest is because he had an outstanding warrant for prior felony armed robbery.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  Another example of these sort of fake news narratives in the BLM context also came out this week,
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  when it turned out with court filings in the Ahmad Arbery case that you may have remembered from last year,
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  where, again, he was supposedly shot and killed, again, according to Ben Crump and his pals,
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  for jogging while black.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  And some of his voice at the time, including right here on Infowars at the time,
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  was that that is unlikely to be a true story,
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  that the true story was likely that he was out casing places for robbery
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  and using jogging as an excuse and a pretext.
[51:00.000 --> 51:05.000]  Because it's not normal and customary for young men of any race to just go out jogging
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  and constantly just wander into abandoned homes and properties for about 10 or 15 minutes
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  and then come back out over and over and over again.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  Well, it turned out from court filings this week that, in fact, Ahmad Arbery had a long history
[51:18.000 --> 51:24.000]  of using jogging as a pretext to engage in repeated robberies,
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  over and over and over and over and over again.
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  Another BLM narrative that proved to be a lie, that proved to be a fraud.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  That's why they are so desperate.
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  George Floyd is supposed to be the Rosa Parks of the BLM anti-police politicized movement
[51:42.000 --> 51:49.000]  to racialize American criminal justice and racialize American politics in ways that do not conform to reality.
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.000]  They are desperate to have George Floyd upheld as that martyr,
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  so much so that they built statues to him inside Holocaust Museum.
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  The fact that he has an extensive criminal history has been hidden from the court of public opinion.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  The fact that he has a history of violent crime has been hidden from the court of public opinion.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  They tried to hide, even from the jurors, the fact that he did the same thing a year before
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  and almost died then from sudden ingestion of drugs.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  For example, the narrative has been that George Floyd was only at risk for being a misdemeanor,
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  minor misdemeanor of a $20 fake currency.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  That's not what George Floyd knew and there's a reason why George Floyd painted,
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  because what George Floyd knew is when they came up to the car,
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  he's sitting there with his drug dealer with felony possession of drugs in the car
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  and he doesn't know what else they have on him.
[52:36.000 --> 52:44.000]  That's why he engaged in felony obstruction by consuming in a sudden manner the drugs themselves.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  What was the prosecution's excuse for that?
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  They claim that even though there's a photo of the pill on his tongue
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  that was later found in the back of the squad car with his saliva and DNA on it,
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  that it was partially chewed and digested and then the rest spit out,
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  that that really wasn't what was in his mouth.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  That that somehow it came off his shoe that randomly was present.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  Instead, they were claiming it was gum or maybe food.
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  That's how ludicrous the state has gone to make the claims they've made.
[53:14.000 --> 53:20.000]  They've made claims I have never seen the government make in a comparable context in history.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  They're doing so because they need to gaslight the jury into a certain conclusion,
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  gaslight the world into a certain conclusion in order to get there,
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  just as they tried in the Zimmerman case, just as they tried in the Michael Brown case,
[53:33.000 --> 53:38.000]  just as they tried in the Tamir Rice case, just as they've tried in case after case after case.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  Almost all of these are rising since 2014.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  Indeed, if you use the imagery of BLM,
[53:44.000 --> 53:49.000]  you'll notice that they use a particular kind of fist that looks almost identical
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  to the kind of fist used by the color revolutions that began in Serbia in 2003
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  and maybe that's not a coincidence.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  That maybe this is part of an ongoing regime change effort to displace American police
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  with anybody that is politically loyal to American ideals
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.000]  and instead have a politicized, stasi-style police force that is willing
[54:11.000 --> 54:18.000]  with politicized prosecutors and politicized courts to engage in Soviet-style show trials
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.000]  to intimidate and terrorize the public into a certain concessionary mindset
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  where they self-censor and do not assert their rights and remedies,
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  do not assert their voices and speech and instead bow to the mob
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  that the rioters that the Mad Max is trying to unleash on the jurors if they don't conform.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  And that's what the Derek Chauvin trial is really about.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  It's not about a simple death-in-police custody case.
[54:45.000 --> 54:52.000]  It is instead about political revolution to change the nature of prosecutions in the United States,
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  to change the nature of policing in the United States,
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  and to send a message to the broader world not only to uphold the media gaslighting narrative
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  of what's been happening and occurring in the police context,
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  particularly in the racial interaction context,
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  but also to empower future Soviet-style show trials.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  It's the same reason the Soviets engaged in such show trials.
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.000]  It's the same reasons the Cuban government did it almost immediately after they seized power in the Castro's
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.000]  in 1959 and 1960, because it was meant to send a message to the broader public
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  that you better keep your head down and do what you're told,
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  or you're going to be purged, purged from the police, purged from the military,
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  purged from civil society, purged from social media,
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  purged from any ability to make a difference with your voice.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  Now, the fact that they are so scared of what a jury might do,
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  the fact that they are so scared of what you the ordinary person might do,
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  is a reminder just as the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he did not exist.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  The greatest trick the deep state ever pulled was convincing you that you could not resist.
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  Indeed, you can find constitutional legal means to push back in the court of public opinion
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  by doing things like supporting networks like InfoWare,
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  which you can do at infowarestore.com.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  Why does that matter? Why is that significant? Why is that consequential?
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  Well, ask yourself, before they were waging these wars on police departments,
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  on the prosecutors' offices, on the justice system,
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.000]  on the military before we had these politically weaponized cases in the Capitol Hill context,
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  who was the number one target?
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  The number one target of the institutional actors, the gatekeepers,
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  these clericy of corruption that would like to impose their wills upon the rest of us
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  was Alex Jones and InfoWare.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  And that's not a coincidence. That's not mere chance.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  That's not mere circumstance. That was deliberate.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  Because you are the tip of the spear for keeping accurate and honest information out there
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  that can keep the public informed, keep the people awakened,
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  and keep activism alive because it is the perception of power.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  Those same color revolutions taught based on the Albert Einstein Institution
[57:01.000 --> 57:08.000]  that it is the fifth pillar of perception of power that is key to the other four pillars of power.
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  You remove that perception of power and the whole system collapses.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Tyranny falls apart overnight.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  And that's what you can do by continuing to support InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  and continuing to be able to be part of the process of keeping information alive and the revolution awake.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  I use products like Winterson every single day.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  I use products like Ultra-12 every single day.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  I use products like the Coffee every single day.
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.000]  And because they're good products, it's the one place you can get healthier, wealthier, and wiser in one clean step.
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  When we come back, we'll talk about the next big issue.
[57:46.000 --> 58:15.000]  Sleepy Joe wants to go to war with Russia.
[58:16.000 --> 58:35.000]  He wants to go to war with Russia.
[58:35.000 --> 58:44.000]  He wants to go to war with Russia.
[58:44.000 --> 58:53.000]  When I tell you to supplement your natural diet,
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.000]  so you'll be healthier and funnier for it at the same time,
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  I'm not lecturing you.
[58:58.000 --> 58:59.000]  I eat too much red meat.
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  I drink too much.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  I work too much.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  I have my own issue of stress.
[59:03.000 --> 59:08.000]  But I can tell you, without Winterson, without VitaMemeralFusion, without LungCleanse,
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  all three of which I take every day, I would not be able to continue on what I do.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  These are amazing products.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  And if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals,
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  if you're not going to be able to function, in fact, you're going to die.
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  That's what we will starve for lack of food.
[59:24.000 --> 59:31.000]  These products have it all concentrated in one place for you to make sure that every essential vitamin mineral you need,
[59:31.000 --> 59:38.000]  you get the D3, the K, in Winterson, and all of them together with amino acids in VitaMemeralFusion,
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  and then LungCleanse.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  Research with yourself, it's amazing.
[59:41.000 --> 59:47.000]  They're all 50% off together, 40% off individually, at infowarstore.com,
[59:47.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  back in stock for a limited time, and at FUNCION 4.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Well, Owen Schreuer was down at the border and met some very interesting personalities and people,
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  including someone who had a famous photogenic moment at the border some years ago.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Let's take a look at when Owen Schreuer met AOC at the border.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Hello, I am Alexandria Owen Cortez, and I am down here at Biden's cage facilities.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Kids in cages.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Look at them.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Look at all these kids in the cages.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Nobody else cares except Alexandria Owen Cortez.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  Why?
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Why, Joe Biden?
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Why, Kamala Harris?
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  Why do you do this to the kids?
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  The poor kids?
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Why?
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  The kids are being raped.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  You saw the girls 12 years old, they're coming in, they're pregnant, Joe.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  They're pregnant, Kamala.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  What do you think happened to them?
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  They got raped by your illegal immigrants.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  They got raped by the people you told to serve the border.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Rape 12-year-old girls, dozens of them, raped on the journey that you told them to go on, Joe.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  You did.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Why do you do this, Joe?
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Why do you do this, Kamala?
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Why do you hate kids?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Why do you hate the youth and the innocent, Joe?
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Where do they go, Joe?
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Why are you doing this, Joe?
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Americans are suffering, Joe.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  And you just don't even care.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  You're stacking the kids in cages like sardines.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Like sardines, they're sleeping on top of one another.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  They're being put in hotels with strange men and you don't even do DNA testing.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Why, Joe?
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Why, Joe?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  I've seen your cages, Joe.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I've seen the cages that you put the kids in, Joe, while you're child-trafficking, Joe.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  I saw it all and Kamala's covering it up, Joe.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Why?
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  I've seen your cages, Joe.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  There's dozens of your cages, Joe.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  It's the kids, Joe.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And they're all being raped and molested.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  And then they're re-enacting the rape and molest in the cages that you put them in, Joe.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  You put them in, Kamala.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Why?
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Why?
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Why?
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  I'm just shooting a video.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Don't worry about it, man.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Why, Joe?
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Why?
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Nobody cares about the kids except me, Alexandria Owen Cortez.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Nobody is down here wailing against the system.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  I'm wailing against the system.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Only me.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Nobody else cares about the kids.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  How many kids will be sex-trafficked by Joe Biden's pedophile agenda?
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Why is it only me, Alexandria, okay, Joe Cortez?
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  The kids.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  The kids.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  The media gaslighting that is occurring in the Chauvin trial is not limited or constricted
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  to it, nor is it limited or constricted to the issues surrounding immigration either.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  The other aspect in which it is occurring on a major scale, which we'll get into after
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  we come back from the break, is potentially World War III.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  There has been a wild contradictory set of messages sent because of an internal battle
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  within the deep state due to sleepy Joe not being any kind of governing president at all
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  with any kind of clear directive set of policies beyond ones of triggering war.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  In this particular context, it is in Russia, though it is only the latest hotspot to be
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  a potential place to trigger war.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  There have been controversial positions taken by the Biden administration in Venezuela,
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  in Bolivia, in Ethiopia, in Iran, throughout the Middle East, and in China and Taiwan.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  But the one that has been drawn the most attention justifiably so is the effort to escalate the
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  conflict in Ukraine.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  One day, the Biden administration wants Putin and Russia to bail them out of the concerns
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  involving Iran or China or North Korea.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And in the next minute, they want to escalate conflict.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Why is that?
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  Well, it might be because of the people who are behind the Biden administration.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  The internal deep state fight that is occurring that can only occur because sleepy Joe usually
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  has to wait for nap time before he can come out to play.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Indeed, it was so bad this past week.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  He wasn't even there for the Japanese prime minister when he arrived at the White House.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  He was apparently asleep again.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  So he is constantly asleep in such a way that may endanger, not only our future freedom,
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  but that might bring us closer to the doomsday clock than we've been since 1961.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  When we come back, we're on war with Russia.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  The equation is very simple.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  The megabanks control the media.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  They control big pharma.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  They control academia.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  They control big tech.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  absolute total despotism and de-immunization.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted,
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  turned it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  and the free market that threatens them and obviously still control.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  Every double your efforts, we're all on this together.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  Welcome back to Sunday's Alex Jones show with special guest host today, myself, Robert Barnes.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  The next aspect we're going to get into is while they're doing deep damage to our criminal justice system,
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  not only what's happening in the Chauvin trial, but also what's happening in Capitol Hill cases.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  We had Ashley Babbitt who was killed right on the spot.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Someone who was killed without warning, killed without notice, summary execution style
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  or what appeared to be mere trespass and damage to state property.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  There was no evidence she was threatening anyone's life at the time.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  She was trying to go through a door and while that was wrongful conduct, criminal conduct,
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  it was nowhere near as dangerous as what Dwayne White had done.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  It was not as felonious as what George Floyd was in the process of doing.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  It was not the pattern of criminal behavior that Ahmaud Arbery was involved in.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  And yet in each of those cases, there was a media outrage demanding the maximum criminal prosecution.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  Here we have an officer and still whose identity has been hidden from the public,
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  summarily executing a person for a very minor offense without notice or warning and with now without consequence.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Because that's the nature of our criminal justice process under this president in Joe Biden.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  And it is a problem that has been gurgling up and burgeoning for some time,
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  but it is reaching new and perilous heights as we are witnessing in both the Ashley Babbitt case
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  as contrasted to the Dwayne White, the Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd cases.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  In the same context, we're having the drum beats of war from the deep state start to come back
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  and continue to get louder and louder after President Trump has exited from office
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  and been replaced by Sleepy Joe.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  In this context, there are a couple of people who have done some really good analysis
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  on what the backstory and what the background is.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Why do the neoliberal deep state elites hate Russia so much, so irrationally, so unjustifiably,
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  so without sound foreign policy reasoning, no matter your perspective on Russia in general?
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Well, here's a good episode or a good part of an episode from a show that you can find on YouTube
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  and rumble in other places called The Gaggle, hosted by Peter Lavelle and George Sanuelle,
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  two longstanding international foreign policy observers who have a deeper and broader understanding
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  than the institutional media does, particularly when it relates to matters of central and eastern Europe.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  Let's take a look at video clip number one about how Russia's conservative moral and social values
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  and opposition to wokeism is a key reason why Biden administration hacks
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  want to undermine it and sabotage it even if it has the risk of causing and triggering World War III.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  They abhor Russia because people here are nominally religious.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  The family is the center of all social interaction.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Russians are fervently patriotic.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  And because of the last 30 years, they've traveled the world.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  They have seen what the world can offer, the good and the bad.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  And I'm very happy about that because then they come back and say,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  well, why can't we have good service in restaurants?
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  Now they do.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  Why can't we have quality beef?
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Because when I first moved here, it was like leather shoes, OK?
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And now they have steakhouses all over the place.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  The world's top of them.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Take the best practices.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  But your postmodernist ideology, no, thanks.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  No, thanks. We see enough of it on your Netflix, which is translated into the Russian language.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  No, it's fun to watch from afar.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  We don't want that.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  We don't want your ideology.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  That's why when they talk about Russia's malign influence and Russia's malevolent influence,
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  because there are other countries that may not like Russia's geopolitics,
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  but they kind of like its cultural outlook.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  I mean, the most explicit prediction of that is obviously Viktor Orban of Hungary.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  But there are other countries.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  I mean, Poland kind of goes along with the social and cultural moral values of Russia,
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  even though they have this obsession about geopolitics.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  But the thing goes for, you know, the Czechs, the Slovaks, you know,
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  basically they kind of like those conservative values.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Seriously, it's like up to 30, 35% of French people feel that way.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  Exactly. That's right.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  And it's one of the interesting things is that during the FIFA World Cup,
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  the U.S. team didn't do well enough to qualify to come to Moscow.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And I truly regret that because I don't know anything about football slash soccer.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  I'm not interested in it.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  But I really had wished thousands of Americans could have come to Moscow
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  because I would go to the main streets during the weeks of the matches.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And I would ask people, and particularly Brits and Germans, you know,
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  and I'll tell you, George, almost without exception,
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  I say, well, what do you think as opposed to what your expectations were?
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  And almost to the person.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  They lied to us.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  It's kind of nice here.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  People are nice.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  All the menus are in English.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  All the signs are in English.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And the girls are really pretty.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  That's right.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  No, I think it's very interesting as to what will happen if...
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  I mean, there's a chance of this.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  I mean, I'm saying it's a good chance.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  But the chance that Macron is replaced by Marine Le Pen and Merkel,
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  who is definitely going to be replaced by a German leader
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  who is not at all hostile to Russia.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  I kind of wonder what kind of a cultural influence then Russia made over Europe.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  We don't know.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  I mean, there's a long time to go before then.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  But, you know, you can see why Russia's malign influence.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  No, but see, there's something that is never said,
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  and you won't be allowed to say it,
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  is that Russia has a cultural attraction.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  And they fear it.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  They fear it, okay?
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Because you can live a different way.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  I mean, there is no political correctness here at all, okay?
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  And the society isn't falling apart.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  Precisely.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Russia provides a counter example to what the neoliberal George Soros inspired
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  West of intellectual left would like the world to be.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  As Ann Coulter used to joke, one of the reasons why they hate Russia so much
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  is they're still mad that Russia rejected communism and statism.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  But it goes beyond that.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Basically, Putin is Russia's version of Trump,
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  someone who believes in national boundaries,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  someone who believes in national sovereignty,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  someone who tries to avoid war and conflict where possible,
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  someone who doesn't see the entire world as an empire to play games with,
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  someone who values who is one of the great defenders of the Christian faith
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  in the modern world,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  someone who's not going to be having men play in women's sports,
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  someone who's not going to engage in racialized politics for its own sake
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  and its own purpose to divide his own country,
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  someone who has gone to great lengths to avoid that
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  by relying upon national identity,
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  someone who pushes back on the neoliberal order
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  and provides a critical example to it,
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  someone who's pushed back against the state centralized bankers as well.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  And it is that combination of activities that makes him such a threat
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  to the George Soros vision of the world,
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  which so many of the administrative aparatics
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  of the Biden administration are so eager to enforce on the world.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  And that is why they want to undermine Russia, sabotage Russia,
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  cause unnecessary conflict with Russia,
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  even if it entails a potential war throughout Europe,
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  even if it entails a potential triggers a world war.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  I mean, just weeks ago, Joe Biden was going to send US ships into the Black Sea
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  to be right next to Russian ships in the middle of a conflict zone with Ukraine.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Imagine how that could go wrong. Just go back and study your history of World War I
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  and you can know how easily that could get out of hand.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  And this perspective is coming from both the left and the right
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  from those people who oppose unnecessary wars.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  It was the whole real reason for Russiagate.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Half of it was to discredit Trump and Trumpism,
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  drag his entire administration and his key allies and aides
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  into unjustifiable criminal investigations
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  while covering up the illicit and illegal spying that took place
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  against President Trump, both during the campaign and while he was president.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  But it was also to prevent Trump from aligning with Russia
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  to create a cultural detente, political detente,
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  that could re-recommend conservative moral values,
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  theories of nationalism, sovereignty, Christianity,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  core good ideals against the George Soros neoliberal order.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  And that is why they are so eager to be able to try to instigate
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  another color revolution in Russia,
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  which is what the Navalny matter is really about.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  He is not who the media would have you believe him to be.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  But it's also becoming incredibly precarious
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  because as we get closer and closer to a potential armed conflict,
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  when this goes from just another Cold War into a potential hot war,
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  then the safety and security of everybody around the world is at risk.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  When we come back, we'll take a look at some other clips from other experts
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  as the world increasingly concludes that Sleepy Joe is asleep at the switch
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  and someone else might push it.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  It's very simple. Every household, not just in America, but worldwide,
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  should be taking a high-quality, multi-vitamin mineral every single day.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed,
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  in fact, in many cases, are toxic.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  But the vitamin mineral fusion in stock right now, 40% off at infowarstore.com,

[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  natural-definition immune system, you're funding the infowar.

[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Oh, and winter sun's back in stock, 40% off as well, at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person,
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity,
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure,
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  but just give me a break. The Satanism's out in the open.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  And I get it. A lot of you have been turned off by big churches,
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  a lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system,
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  and I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them,
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  that is so essential, and God created the universe for us to have communion with God through,
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  and to have life. And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  Thank you for spreading the word about InfoWars,
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taking off the air.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  So thank you for the support, infowarstore.com.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  to create superior vitality in males.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses,
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology,
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Super male vitality at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can,
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back here on the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday,
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  Owen Troyer sitting in studio. Bob Barnes about to take back over.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  Really excited to host Sunday Night Live tonight.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  We're going to be taking your phone calls.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  I'm going to be answering your questions.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Any observations you've had at the crisis at the southern border?
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  There's a couple new updates that I'll be breaking there as well,
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  talking about everything I experienced.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  And again, phone lines will be open with any questions or concerns or observations that you've made.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  What an incredible journey it was.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  And I came in today after getting in, I guess, early this morning.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  Some of the rest of the crew arrived just a few hours ago.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  And guess what? We're all here working again.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  Some of the crew that was on the trip is in there working.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  I'm up here working, and the crew never gets a day off.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  But that's our commitment.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  So we just ask that you help support us. Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Do your shopping with us. Get all the great supplements there.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  You're already probably taking supplements.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  You've probably already got a bunch of supplements in your pantry.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Why not shop with the good guys by getting your supplements at infowarstore.com?
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion is one of my favorites.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  It's one of the crowd's favorites as well.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Give it a try.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  Most people that try vitamin mineral fusion never look back.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Rocket rest back in stock and 40% off.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  And we still have the t-shirt deal,
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  where all info wars apparel and t-shirts are $17.76 on all t-shirts,
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  including there's some new ones up there that we don't even really promote much.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  We just make them, put them up on the website, and hope you enjoy them.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  $17.76.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Again, everything we do here at Info Wars is only possible with your support
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  And of course, your word of mouth telling your friends and family about the transmissions.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  Now is the time.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Populism is in.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  Telling the truth is in.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  The mainstream media is completely discredited.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  Politicians are completely discredited.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Info wars has never been more vindicated than ever.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  So now's the time to support.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  Now's the time to share.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  We go back to Bob Barnes breaking down how the Biden administration is causing a collapse of the third world
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  and soon America that could result in World War III.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Bob Barnes, take it away.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  For folks that like it, I like to use the Info Wars Tumblr.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  The reason is because I have it on for a wide range of media interviews
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  because for those people who want to pay attention, they can get it.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  And it doesn't necessarily cause any flags amongst the censors.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  And it keeps drinks very cold and keeps them warm.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  So it's one of my daily things.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Increasingly, we're going to need to be ready to survive in a world where so many people
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  or so have such itchy trigger fingers around the potential to trigger World War III.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  In this context, it has been particularly problematic that nobody in the world really knows
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  who is actually governing the United States of America right now.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  That at times 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue appears to be absent, appears to be empty.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  That it's either tea time or nap time or party time for Sleepy Joe.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  And a recent breakdown of this was done from the show The Durant,
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  which often covers international news and foreign policy,
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  particularly from a deep state skeptical anti-war perspective.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  Let's take it as we break down the problematic aspect of administration's foreign policy.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  Well, it looks like we're having some problems there with the connection of Bob Barnes.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  That's why I'm sitting here in studio in case we do have any of those problems.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  So we're going to get reconnected with him.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  You know, speaking of exactly that, what the Biden administration is up to right now,
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  they're now having to admit, and I think this has a lot to do with our coverage,
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  they're now having to admit that there is a crisis at the southern border
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  because they gave no bid contracts to their friends for hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  And of course, we've been down there as the media showing the crisis as it is.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  So now the Biden administration has finally had to come out and say that that's exactly what's going on.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  You also have the UN ambassador from Biden saying that the founding fathers are like the Chinese communists
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  and how they treat the Uighurs.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  So, wow, they're admitting about the Chinese communist treatment of the Muslims in the concentration camps,
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  but comparing them to the founding fathers whose founding documents of this nation are just proving to be total works of genius
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  at this point, total foresight with that.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Of course, the Biden administration doesn't like the Bill of Rights.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Joe Biden even said that the Bill of Rights isn't permanent.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  There's nothing absolute about the amendments.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Now, Joe Biden, a president saying that you don't have a Bill of Rights as an American citizen.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  That's kind of a red flag.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  That's kind of a big deal.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  That's kind of a panic time.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  And as Bob Barnes was just explaining, where is Joe?
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Seems to be AWOL.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  In fact, Devin Nunes is asking that exact question in an interview on television.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  He's saying, where is the president?
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  We never see him.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  We dealt with Trump every day.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Half the time with Biden, we don't even hear anything.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  We have questions.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  Nothing gets answered.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  What is he doing?
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  And then they claim, oh, Biden went and had around a golf.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  I don't believe that for one second.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Joe Biden couldn't complete nine holes of golf, let alone 18.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  And by the looks of the golf shoes that he was wearing, they haven't been worn in decades.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  The spikes on Biden's golf shoes have not been used in decades, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  In decades.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  He's literally using decades old spikes.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  I don't know anybody that wears those spikes still.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  And I've never seen anybody with golf shoes so clean.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  I've never seen golf shoes so clean after around.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  But apparently if you're Biden, maybe for Biden, that golfing just means riding around in the cart.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Maybe that's what golfing means.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  So Joe Biden isn't even the president, but he pretends to be.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  He rides along.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  He's on the course.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  He's in the White House.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  So Joe Biden probably didn't actually hit any golf balls.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Joe Biden probably didn't actually swing a golf club.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  But he put on the golf shoes and he put on a polo and he rode around in the golf cart.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  And the media said, look, look at Joe.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  He can play golf.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  Look at him go out there.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Way to go, Joe.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Just like he's pretending to be the president.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Yeah, there's the spikes.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  I'm telling you right now.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  I don't know anybody who still wears those spikes.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  I don't see them on the professional tour.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  I don't see them on the golf courses here in Texas.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  I don't see it when I go golfing with friends.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  I just don't see it.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  Oh, is that a nice photo shot there?
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Nice photo out for Joe.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  Wonder how many times he had to practice that lob shot.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  There's no way that he's actually playing golf on a steep ledge that deep.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Give me a break.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Show me the video of Biden driving a golf ball.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  If you've ever been to, you know, like the driving range.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  You know, there's always the individual out there that you can tell just they're just not going to.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Yeah, it's just not good show.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  It's not good for them.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Try to play golf.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  That's probably how I imagine it would be with Biden.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  We've seen Trump strike a golf ball.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  It's an ugly, horrific swing, but he can get it.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  He can get it up and down the course.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  So is that Joe riding along playing golf?
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  We want to Joe's on as long as Biden is on the course that counts as playing golf.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  As long as Biden is in the White House that counts as being present as long as the media says he won, he won.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  As long as the media says Joe Biden can ride a bike and Joe Biden can run with his dogs and Joe Biden can play a round of golf.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Look at him. He can barely walk.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  They're trying to tell you Biden played golf today.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  He can barely even walk, man.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  Now, what sort do I go to?
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Oh, that's not my vehicle.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Sorry.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I don't even know what vehicle I'm in and I'm huffing my own carbon dioxide.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  So I'm a little confused out here.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Joe Biden playing golf.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Who buys that?
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  And it really does come down to that.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington, DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  It's hard to believe that we're already into the middle of April and our borders collapsing and world governments being announced that Joe Biden's coming after our guns and trying to start a war with Russia.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  But told China they could take over Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  So China's done a blockade around Taiwan and is threatening to invade Hong Kong.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  They already sent troops into Hong Kong.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  This is madness.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  And our government's been hijacked now by these globalists and they're trying to shut us down.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  They took our sponsors away a long time ago.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  But you sponsor us by buying products direct.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  So these are already great products you need, whether it's vitamin refusion back in stock or whether it's winter sun or whether it's lung cleanse.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  They're all 40% off individually, 50% off when you order them in combos or together.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  But regardless, it funds the M4 with some things that you win.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  It's a critical time in history with all this crazy happening. I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  I want to remind you these are products you and your family already need and they fund the M4.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  A true 360 win.
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  So take advantage of these products today.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  Fight of an M4Store.com.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  You go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  You get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  Then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  They're looking for leadership.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  Well, that's where infowarsdomains.com.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  You fund us.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  You support infowarsdomains.com.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  You get great policy at the same time.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  What the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet the shock groups in the information war.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  You fund us at infowarsdomains.com.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Welcome to the Sunday Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  I'm your guest host, Robert Barnes.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  We're discussing the issues of ranging from Mad Max and the media campaign to gaslight us about our own criminal justice process to Sleepy Joe's willingness and readiness to start a new war and maybe even trigger World War III by the chaotic carelessness of his administration.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  Let's take a look at a clip from a show called The Duran, which like the gaggle that we referenced earlier is often a useful and critical source for independent thinking and critical thinking about foreign policy.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  Let's take a look at video clip number two.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  There is no such thing really as a Biden-Harris administration. There are various factions fighting it out in Washington. There's a very powerful neocon faction who knows who they are.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  We can guess they're probably in the CIA, they're probably in the State Department, possibly Secretary Blinken is one of them, certainly Victoria Newland is. They want confrontation with Russia just as they want confrontation with everyone everywhere to the greatest extent they possibly can.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And then there are other people more shall we say level-headed people like perhaps the new National Security Advisor Andrew Sullivan, perhaps the new CIA director William Burns, who was previously the US ambassador to Moscow.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  And they say, well, hold on, we can't really go all the way. I mean, if we really get into a confrontation with the Russians, it could turn very bad indeed for us. Ukraine certainly would be destroyed.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  We would be utterly and completely humiliated. The sanctions weapon is to all effects exhausted. And what we need to do is concentrate on China anyway instead.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  So you're having these two different forces pulling in different directions. Sometimes a sleepy Joe goes with one, sometimes sleepy Joe goes with the other.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  He telephones Putin and talks peace. He signs executive orders, which talk Cold War. He sends the fleet to the Black Sea one day. He pulls it back the next.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  He tells the Lenski, you have my unwavering support. One day he says through his secretary of state, well, actually, you won't get to get it after all the next.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  So it is a complete mess. And what we have is a bureaucratic war in Washington, which is wrecking whatever is left of relationships and which the Russians are deciding makes the United States, as they put it, agreement incapable.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Indeed, in other words, the United States is not considered reliable or even predictable in the current realm or in the current time. And that poses a risk to the rest of us.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  In the same context, it appears there's been another attempt at another quote unquote color revolution, except it just failed abysmally, but that hasn't stopped the Biden administration from propagating it and trying to push it, as was detailed in an article in the gray zone about Mr.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Navalny. For those who don't know, Mr. Navalny has deep state ties that go back more than a decade. He's been propagated and promoted in the same way you had people held up as potential leaders of Georgia or potential leaders of Ukraine or potential
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  leaders of Egypt or potential leaders of Iraq in prior time periods. And when you dig in, what you find is that these people are simply being pushed by deep state actors with bad faith intentions who do not have true support within their local population.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Indeed, Navalny is about as popular in Russia as Lyndon LaRouche is in the United States. In fact, LaRouche is probably more popular. He has been repeatedly convicted of multiple fraudulent crimes, like his buddy and other political propagandists, Bill Browder.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  So the fact that you're seeing the West make a big deal about Navalny should be a red flag, because it is not a sign of a legitimate authentic opposition within Russia. He's someone that is a convicted criminal for fraud, for real fraud.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  He's someone who's engaged in very dangerous and perilous political proclivities throughout his decade plus history. He is not who the West has tried to make him out to be.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  In the same context, we see that the other method of foreign policy oppression taking place is through the Chinese model of lockdowns that got exported under the guise of a pandemic.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  And increasingly, it is becoming relevant. Increasingly, it is becoming evident that this lockdown from the COVID-19 was the product of potentially even a deliberate, but at least an accidental leak from a Chinese bio weapons factory that was in part funded and protected by Mr. Fauci himself.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  Let's take a look at video clip number 14.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Let me just say that there are several different kinds of evidence, all of which are, and I'm not arguing that this is conclusive. This is still a hypothesis, but I would argue that it is the preponderance of the evidence clearly now points to a lab leak.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  The evidence is of four different kinds. There is molecular evidence, that is to say the sequence of the genome of the virus suggests editing of a kind that we know was taking place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  There is phylogenetic evidence, that is to say the group, the Sarbeco viruses to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs are known not to have foreign cleavage sites, and yet this foreign cleavage site shows up phylogenetically out of place in SARS-CoV-2.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  There is epidemiological evidence. We have a virus that did not show any evidence of evolution early on. It arrived in human beings perfectly adapted to spread at a high rate, whereas we would have expected a period of evolutionary adaptation that we cannot find.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  And then fourth and maybe most important, there's a tremendous amount of circumstantial evidence surrounding the way the Wuhan Institute of Virology has dealt with the question of a possible lab leak.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  Initially, the laboratory in question acknowledged that a lab leak was possible. In fact, the leader of that lab, Zhijing Li, said she didn't sleep a wink for some time, thinking that maybe the virus had escaped from her lab, so we know that such a thing is plausible.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  We also have the case of them having renamed a sample in a way that contravenes scientific protocol, so RATG-13, which is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2, turns out to have had a prior name in that laboratory, 4991.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  There's no reason to have renamed it. It effectively suggests keeping of two sets of books. So in any case, all four types of evidence point towards a laboratory leak that is now being obscured.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  So I fully admit I am wildly out of my depth on this topic, but I just want to offer, so one of the pieces of evidence that has been offered against the idea of a lab leak. This is from Science News, and it's based on a report that was published in Nature Medicine.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  They say that this virus has components that differ from those of previously known viruses, so they had to come from an unknown virus or viruses in nature, and this is a quote from the study.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  It says that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone, meaning that if you're creating something in the lab, you're using an existing known virus and then you're modifying it. They're saying this is coming from nature because this isn't anything that we've ever dealt with before.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  What do you make of that piece?
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  You know, at some level we are now dealing with a kind of narrative theater surrounding this virus. That argument doesn't make any sense, and nobody who is in this community could imagine that it does for the following reason.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  When we say that the virus may have been modified in the lab, we are not necessarily talking about edits where someone sits down to introduce a sequence. That is certainly possible, that is something that we do, but we are in general talking about a type of gain-of-function research that uses a process called serial
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  passage in which we do things in the lab that we live in. We'll be right back after the break.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience. They have massively expanded their factories. It's made right here in America, and they're ready to ship it to you right now.

[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed, in fact, in many cases, are toxic.

[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  But let's just say this. We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWareStore.com. They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  You've got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Welcome to the Sunday Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host, Robert Barnes.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  As we discussed, we're seeing media gaslighting at an extraordinary scale.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Just as we saw that the Derek Chauvin trial in the death of George Floyd, we are being repeatedly and routinely gaslit by the media and by politicians and prosecutors alike into believing something that's not reflective of what's happening inside that courtroom.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  We also saw how the way in which the drumbeats of war being propagated by deep state actors who are using the chaotic presidential administration and the absent AWOL president of our derelict dementia candidate Joe Biden to help potentially trigger World War 3 and build a fake media narrative about what is happening and why.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  We also saw how Professor Brett Weinstein, a very left leaning professor, you can research what happened to him at Evergreen College, but one of the top medical experts in the world detailed how we have been gaslit and lied to about the source of COVID-19.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  In the role of a bioweapons lab, that's what use of function is all about. If you are a Info Wars audience member for any substantial time period, then you know that it is something that Alex Jones has been talking about for more than a decade and had some of the top bioweapons experts in the world.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  But the great danger these people present is that it is an invisible weapon in the words of President Trump that can be far more damaging and devastating, not only in the sense of what it can do to people biologically, but as we've seen what it can do to the body republic of our constitutional liberties, which have been stripped from us in record setting ways over the last 12 months and so.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  In the same context, we can see a simple micro example of this in the media's collusion to try to propagate and promote the story of Hunter Biden.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  We've seen Hunter Biden recently released a book, which often looks just like laundered bribes. You see these people getting ridiculous sums of money to write a book and then you see the book sell nowhere near the amount that it needs to sell for and it justified the millions of dollars that are being paid.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  In order for the media to propagate the mythology of Hunter Biden, they had to collude in propagating his new book and pitching his new book and do so by having him interview in a controlled environment that would try to suppress his natural deceptive and dishonest manners.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Well, a group of four human lie detectors, four of the best body language and statement analysts in the world do analysis of this type every week on something called the behavior panel.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  They broke down the Hunter Biden interview and you can see the whole about two hour show available on YouTube and other locations at the behavior panel.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  But let's just take a look at their summation. Their summation, which these are not political people, they don't have a political bone in their bodies as it relates to this matter.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  They're just doing their human body language test. What's their conclusion about the credibility of Hunter Biden and the media gaslighting? Let's take a look at video clip number 16.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  As far as though we're talking about him being from a percentage being deceptive or being truthful. Greg, you want to go first?
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  Yeah, I'm not going to give you a percentage. I'm going to say he avoids truth at many, many, many opportunities. He always goes to the high ground.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  He had he Haskell's, in fact, kicked back to Ken Osmond. He had he Haskell's every opportunity when there's somebody in authority and then when there isn't, all that goes away.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  So I don't trust that he's being truthful. I also, guys, I'm going to say this and we're going to put the disclaimers in here, but this has nothing to do with Joe Biden.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  This is Hunter Biden. We're talking about Hunter Biden and what he does in this interview. So don't take it as politics. Take it as what we're looking at.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  I don't believe he is trustworthy because of the there's so much deviation between what's normal and what he's doing. That's me. Chase, what do you get?
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Yeah, again, this isn't politics. This is a human. What we're looking at is a human, not a Republican or a Democrat. We do that with everything.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  And if we are biased, we'll be the first to tell you if we have some kind of vested interest in something. This was mostly dishonest, slightly deceptive and hardly truthful. Mark?
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Yeah. So I know, you know, some of you watching out there, you'll feel like you've got a horse in this race because of the relationship with his father, very important man. Absolutely.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  So, you know, in order to not offend, I will say I feel at some points that he is obfuscating somewhat. There you go.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  I don't care if I offend, but I really don't. But I'll tell you, politically, you guys know me. I don't care. But I think we're seeing more being untruthful than we are seeing being truthful in these things.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  When the questions get hard, that's every time, not every time, most of the time he's being deceptive. It looks to me like. So I would chase. I think if you wait it out, it's going to be deceptive.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  It's pretty heavy. And he goes a bit light on the being truthful.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  As they also break down in their video, what is extraordinary is the degree to which they still come to the conclusion that this guy is Hunter Biden is extraordinarily dishonest, extraordinarily deceptive, extraordinarily deceitful.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  As they put it, rarely truthful, despite, as they detail in their analysis, the media's attempts to cover for him the extraordinary editing occurring that they can break down.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  In particular, Scott Rouse breaks down because he has an audio background and he's able to hear it's edit after edit after edit after edit.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  They couldn't even cover for the degree and the scale and the scope and the severity of Hunter Biden's just pathological prevarication.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  And not only that, throughout the interviews, the media is doing things like that, trying to shake their head, no, you're supposed to answer no now, Hunter.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  So answer no. And then when they want Hunter to answer yes, they're like, make sure you say yes, Hunter. This is a 51-year-old man. And yet they're having to treat him like a hopeless reprobate three-year-old.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  That is the mentality and mindset that's the degree to which the media will go to cover up the corruption that we have in the White House first family.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  That is the embarrassment that our country currently faces, but it is compounded by the corruption of our criminal justice process.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  It is compounded by the self-destructive and implosive foreign policy we're engaging in, whether it's our lack of respect for the borders and encouraging a surge of illegal immigration and child trafficking,
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  or it's trying to trigger a world war in Russia and Ukraine over political nonsense from George Soros' inspired ideologue.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  In that same context, however, there has been inadequate pushback from the institutional Republican Party.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  A friend in a long-standing public intellectual, Jeremy Carl, put up this video on Twitter, reminding everybody of what happens when voters try to bail out the Republican Party
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  and how the Republican Party tends to reward those voters. Let's play the sheet video.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  There you go. See, you're working hard. You're going to save the Republican Party and Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and all of them.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  All right, got it back out. And here goes the Republican Party. What do they do? Yep, that's what they do.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  That's the Republican Party in a nutshell. And that's why we have the administration we currently have, because too few smart populace activists and advocates are part of the process.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  We're still relying on the Kevin McCarthy's and the Mitch McConnell's of the world.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  But what is key is the efforts of ordinary people like you to continue to fight back smartly and intelligently.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  And you do so by helping to support independent media broadcasts like InfoWars.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  That's why I recommend and I use InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  See, I got the bone broth behind me, but I also got Brainforce. It's good for the brain.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  Also, I have Ultra 12 and Everyday Winter Sun. In fact, that's how I start every day.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Start with a fresh orange juice, freshly made oranges, way to go.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Combine it. I take two Brainforce pills and then I put the Winter Sun and the Ultra 12 and two mare.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  That's how I start every single day, along with InfoWars coffee, because even though I'm a coffee snob, it's because I'm a coffee snob.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  It's one of the best coffees I've ever tasted.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  On top of that, if you want to chat with me any further during the week, you can always go to VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  And that's where you can find us and find me on a daily basis.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  Let me end. In the capacity of independent journalism, few have been better at it than the next Alex Jones, and that would be Mr. Owen Schreuer.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Owen will take you through where he's been recently and what's coming up next.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  That's right, Bob. We had quite an interesting week here at InfoWars.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Myself included down at the southern border, mostly in McAllen, Texas. We learned an awful lot.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  I'm going to be breaking all of that down coming up on InfoWars Sunday Night Live here, starting in just three minutes from 6 to 8 p.m.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  And I'm also going to be taking your calls on the border emergency that's now been declared by Joe Biden, perhaps because of our reporting that he gave out illegal no bid contracts.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  So your calls, your observations, your questions on the border crisis, and I'll be breaking it all down.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  Bob Barnes, great work. We'll let you close this one out.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  It's always a privilege and always a pleasure to be on InfoWars because it's one of the critical broadcasts that keeps freedom alive in America.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  And really, that's thanks to you, you the audience. You are what keeps the flame of liberty lit so that no matter what the politicians do, they can't snuff it out.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  You keep the Liberty Bell heard for the world to hear.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients like real peppermint oil, thyme oil, xylitol, and of course, high quality charcoal.
