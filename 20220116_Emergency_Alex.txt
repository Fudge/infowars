[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  This is truly an emergency Saturday broadcast.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]  Saturday, January 15th, 2022.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  In just the last 24 hours, Mike Lindell's MyPillow has had its banking and credit card systems taken away,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]  and they even recorded the bank saying it was because of the FBI.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  Then, minutes ago, we got confirmation, it's now in the news,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  that One America News has been taken off DirecTV because of their questioning the election.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  The censorship that we've seen from big tech, to start with Alex Jones three and a half years ago,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  is now expanding across the board, and like Jews in Nazi Germany,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  people are literally now being put in electronic and now physical ghettos.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  We're going to lay this out and so much more on this emergency Saturday evening broadcast.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  I don't know how long News Wars can stay up, or InfoWars, or Bandot video.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  So download these reports, share them.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  We are going into a very serious time.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  The globalists are taking over.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  We're already under martial law.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  They're just intensifying the level of it and trying to push us into a physical confrontation
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  because they know they've intellectually and spiritually and economically lost the American people.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  They're losing, and so they're doing what tyrants do.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  They are bringing in an authoritarian state and not letting you question elections
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  because as Biden said on Friday, I don't care who cast the votes.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  I care who counts them, quoting Joseph Stalin again.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  So take this report, share this live feed, get everything you can out there now
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  because they don't want us to have real elections in 297 days,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  and they are closing the door on the American Republic.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  Stay with us.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  It's Saturday.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  It's Saturday, January 15, 2022, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  Well, it is beyond surreal to have been on air 20 years ago
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  and to have had Jonathan Turley and many other constitutional lawyers on
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  decrying the Patriot Act and warning that it would be used against the American people
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  and that they would be establishing a domestic terrorism bureau
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  where if the Justice Department designates a terror group, a terror group,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  if you even unknowingly aid them with giving them a sandwich on the side of the road
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  or loaning them a dollar, you go to prison for decades.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  And to be here in the year 2022 and to be the subject of that
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  in the January 6 investigation that is a counterterrorism investigation
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  where you have CNN and MSNBC and all of them calling for my arrest
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  saying clearly I was in a plan with Trump and others.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  It's like a mafia investigation from the protesters, you know, on up to the captains,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  on up to Alex Jones and President Trump.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  Absolute bull.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  I have a responsibility here to admit when we've been wrong about things
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  and to be honest because that's my superpower is being honest.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  That's why it's very upsetting to me to see the talking point they use all over the corporate media
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  who are the professional liars that I'm a known liar.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  I'm a known liar. Really, is that why the Internet has the saying Alex Jones was right again?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  Alex Jones tip jar is overflowing. Alex Jones is never wrong.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  And of course, I've really corrected that it has the best ring to it, but it's not true.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  I've made a lot of mistakes. I've been wrong quite a bit because I make thousands of decisions every week
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  on things I say and things I do and things I look at. And sometimes I get exhausted.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  Sometimes I get tired and sometimes I go on autopilot
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  and the autopilot Alex Jones is not as nice as the bright-eyed mushy-tailed Alex Jones.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  And so I'm gonna make this announcement right here an announcement of an upcoming announcement.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  I have decided to take off a lengthy period of time in the next few weeks.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  I always say I'm gonna have a vacation and then I've worked the whole time as you know,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  but I'm talking about two, three, four weeks just because of where the world is everything that's happening.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  And I think when I come back Owen and Harrison and others they'll deserve a two or three week long vacation
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]  because here's why I have to do it.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  You can't just drive a car's engine for 10 days straight it'll blow up.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  And I've been driving my engine for about nine days straight to use that metaphor.
[00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:18.931]  Where the world's going is so dangerous and so many truly evil things are happening by
[00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:25.532]  design right now, via the New World Order scientific dictatorship takeover, that I absolutely
[00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:35.832]  must just stay home with my wife and children and exercise and pray and meditate on things
[00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:43.272]  to get myself ready personally for what's coming in the next 397 days.
[00:05:43.272 --> 00:05:47.632]  And of course, the instant some massive event happens like a war with Russia or a giant
[00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:51.751]  earthquake hitting the San Andreas fault or something like that, I'll be here.
[00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:56.152]  But barring a catastrophe, and they did have a big tsunami hit a bunch of South Pacific
[00:05:56.152 --> 00:06:00.991]  islands today, so those things happen, barring that, which is a good chance something bad
[00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:05.312]  will happen that's so big I have to come, new power outages, you name it, I'll be here.
[00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:10.852]  But I've got to unplug and so do you.
[00:06:10.852 --> 00:06:15.991]  But the real reason I have to do this is, all I do is work now.
[00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:18.912]  You know, I have burned out repeatedly.
[00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:22.991]  And a lot of people burn out and you can't ever get off the couch again, I'm the opposite.
[00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:26.352]  When I burn out, I just stop sleeping and work all the time.
[00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:33.392]  I worked, no exaggeration, 20 hours yesterday, 20 hours, 20 hours.
[00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:37.392]  And I tried to go to bed, couldn't sleep, slept about an hour and a half.
[00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:41.032]  And I have just massive energy right now.
[00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:43.251]  But I know this is not good for me.
[00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.551]  This is not good.
[00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:50.512]  And so I've got to just totally turn the phone off, turn the computers off, hide everything.
[00:06:50.512 --> 00:06:52.592]  I have to hide my phone for myself.
[00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:53.231]  And just...
[00:06:53.297 --> 00:07:00.737]  I mean I plan to probably pray an hour a day.
[00:07:00.737 --> 00:07:04.417]  That's what I really need to do, I need to get close to God.
[00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:10.197]  Now I'm never going to quit, I'm never going to back down, I'm never going to give up.
[00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:14.857]  But I do need to pivot, and all of us need to pivot, and really understand the world
[00:07:14.857 --> 00:07:18.817]  we've been through and what the globalists are trying to establish and what they're war
[00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:24.117]  gaming and then not play the game like the 1983 film War Games.
[00:07:24.117 --> 00:07:26.837]  It's a strange game.
[00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:29.577]  The only way to win is not to play.
[00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:36.017]  And I've done about an A- over the years overall not being played by the globalists, but I've
[00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:44.497]  gotten sucked in, I've been manipulated, and I really think it's important to really admit
[00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:47.017]  it when we've been wrong.
[00:07:47.017 --> 00:07:50.037]  Because that's why we have credibility, and that's why the globalists don't have it,
[00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:51.037]  and I wish they did.
[00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:55.297]  Because I have children, I want a better future, and I don't want evil running the planet.
[00:07:55.297 --> 00:08:01.017]  But in my fighting them, I have gotten down on their level some, and that's not good.
[00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:05.937]  And really, history shows it, intellectual research documents it, and a connection to
[00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:10.437]  God confirms it, but I need to be more Christlike.
[00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:16.737]  And I've gotten more Christlike over the years, but far from a saint, so I wanted to just
[00:08:16.737 --> 00:08:20.457]  share that information with you.
[00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:50.502]  We are in the countdown to the end of everything that you've known and everything I've known and I don't think again you need me to tell you that and I consider and try to define this for people but just now world leaders are talking about the great reset just now senators and people are talking about this is a UN global corporate takeover we're two years into this attack and just now we forced you forced us to
[00:08:50.502 --> 00:08:55.822]  forced those talking points about what we're up against who's attacking us into the main discussion
[00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:03.070]  and I have a responsibility to continue to move that ball forward because it's the truth
[00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.110]  even though the more I move it forward the more I ensure
[00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:15.659]  intensified attacks against me which have gone parabolic publicly and behind
[00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:26.499]  the scenes and it's a calculus that I have that at a gut level if I don't feel
[00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:34.539]  like I'm doing good risking my life doing this I won't do it and again I'm
[00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:40.179]  not saying I'm gonna quit it's just that
[00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:47.689]  these times are so bad and so horrible that I'm gonna have to admit soon that
[00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:52.088]  I failed it doesn't mean I failed in my main work we woke a lot of people up
[00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:56.049]  people know what's going on now but that's just caused the new world order
[00:09:56.049 --> 00:10:01.209]  to triple and quadruple down and then if they quadruple down and and and and then
[00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:04.489]  we don't have a peaceful way to fix it
[00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:08.269]  we're informed slaves
[00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:13.755]  so I want to spend some time today
[00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:25.158]  talking about what really happened on January 6th and why I'm having so many problems with
[00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:33.918]  it because it was a giant fiasco and what I originally thought happened is basically
[00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:38.118]  what did happen and I got a lot of criticism back early on
[00:10:38.434 --> 00:10:45.634]  for saying no there was real federal provocateurs and anti-fun larpers out
[00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:52.093]  there but there were some Patriots that think it's time for a physical fight to
[00:10:52.093 --> 00:11:00.154]  call themselves Patriots and who did piggyback on all of it and we're hoping
[00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:07.113]  they could trigger a physical revolution off of the events we were having trying
[00:11:07.113 --> 00:11:10.113]  to get attention and have a 10-day investigation in the Senate which is
[00:11:10.113 --> 00:11:13.113]  constitutional and totally normal and the Democrats have called for it and done it
[00:11:13.113 --> 00:11:19.713]  before themselves but I have a lot of resentment for some of those groups that
[00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:28.353]  did that if it's true and I've read now the Stuart Rhodes indictment three times
[00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:28.768]  and
[00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:38.991]  I can see some of it and imagine that that could be true from things I saw and things
[00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:42.411]  that went on that I really noticed the time but in retrospect I think about the problem
[00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:50.011]  is they've lied so badly in Owens arrest filing and then and then responses in court we get
[00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:54.411]  them great lawyers you support them you you you got them great lawyers listeners and
[00:11:54.546 --> 00:12:05.266]  they lie in the court filings in just ball face lies like saying alex jones does not have a
[00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:09.826]  statue of liberty behind him on today's show no i have a statue of liberty behind me on today's show
[00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:16.546]  or alex isn't wearing a brown jacket but i am wearing a brown jacket i mean it's
[00:12:17.906 --> 00:12:21.266]  and it doesn't make me even want to be enemies with the justice department i'm like
[00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:27.826]  legitimately freaked out that that i mean lying of this level because i followed criminology
[00:12:27.826 --> 00:12:32.306]  and crime and news forever loved watching on court tv when i was in high school college like
[00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:36.386]  most of you you know a news junkie and i've read a lot of indictments and see stuff and a lot of
[00:12:36.386 --> 00:12:41.826]  times it turns out exactly what they say is true this is a whole pivot away from being somewhat
[00:12:41.826 --> 00:12:47.826]  corrupt some good prosecutors some bad prosecutors to the prosecutors and the judges and the whole
[00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:50.066]  system being a bunch of liars
[00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:58.829]  and then you lose the ability to have any confidence in what they say when you read it
[00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:08.074]  though my gut tells me
[00:13:08.435 --> 00:13:20.234]  that in the main this indictment is somewhat accurate that said though if
[00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:23.795]  you're gonna arrest these people for fantasizing about an overthrow and then
[00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:27.994]  really just running around warping and pushing some doors open that that's as
[00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:33.474]  far as they went and bumping into a cop and then fantasizing about other stuff
[00:13:33.474 --> 00:13:39.555]  they did well then what are you gonna do to Chris Cuomo saying it's mostly
[00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:43.354]  peaceful to burn down billions of dollars of stuff or black lives matter
[00:13:43.354 --> 00:13:47.035]  leaders on TV saying give us what we want or we're gonna burn down New York
[00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:51.194]  City I've got the clips right here because I don't care if you're a
[00:13:51.194 --> 00:13:56.755]  Christian a conservative a liberal a Muslim you shouldn't be saying the
[00:13:56.755 --> 00:14:02.275]  police in New York better not prosecute serious crimes or we're gonna burn the
[00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:09.035]  effing city down on TV and the news anchors agreeing with it I'm not saying
[00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:12.994]  go burn down police stations I'm not running around attacking federal
[00:14:12.994 --> 00:14:18.155]  buildings and Kamala Harris is the one who bailed people out that assaulted
[00:14:18.155 --> 00:14:22.795]  police one guy we have the video with a hatchet they're breaking into a federal
[00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:26.875]  courthouse attacking people with hatchets and Merrick Garland gets asked
[00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:30.074]  about it he doesn't have a comment
[00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:34.189]  so all I'm saying is
[00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:42.815]  I'm done with this and I sincerely am not going to be associated with violent
[00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:47.915]  uprisings and with violence and with civil wars and all this I've been
[00:14:47.915 --> 00:14:51.195]  warning about civil war that the global is trying to start because it's in their
[00:14:51.195 --> 00:14:54.756]  own battle plans and now it's public and I'll show you that here in a few minutes
[00:14:54.756 --> 00:15:00.795]  I'm trying to stop this and I'm not trying to be a Republican leader I'm not
[00:15:00.795 --> 00:15:05.376]  trying to live in LA or New York or DC and be part of the power structure and
[00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:09.256]  feed it the trough yes I live in the most popular city probably in the world
[00:15:09.256 --> 00:15:13.376]  I love Austin it's a little bit overrated sometimes but that's because my family's
[00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:17.896]  from here I've been here family's been here since the 1820s on the mom's side
[00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:21.856]  and the dad's side so people ask why are you in that communist city well it's
[00:15:21.856 --> 00:15:25.756]  where I'm from and you're right I'm I had the money to move our studios I'd
[00:15:25.756 --> 00:15:30.856]  get out of here I don't have that show
[00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:34.266]  here we are in Mordor and
[00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:42.995]  we're watching the purposeful collapse of our society and of our civilization.
[00:15:43.955 --> 00:15:47.715]  So I don't know what the truth is about Stuart Rhodes.
[00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:52.915]  I don't know what the truth is about any of the groups that went in there.
[00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:56.115]  I do know there was some feds, some provocateurs, a rapid reaction force,
[00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:02.275]  a thousand armed people with the FBI and the rest of it that sat there and watched it all happen.
[00:16:02.275 --> 00:16:06.435]  While I'm sitting there freezing my ass off watching Trump give a speech a mile and a half away
[00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:09.235]  thinking we're just about to have another demonstration like we always have,
[00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:14.035]  the feds are encamped around the Capitol, half the police are there that are normally there,
[00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:22.115]  80 of them, and then here comes a giant mob of a million people, the couple hundred thousand that
[00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:26.915]  were freezing and bored that went down, a mob of good people, bad people, happy people, you know,
[00:16:26.915 --> 00:16:30.835]  crazy people, most of them good people, but being provocatored into the building.
[00:16:35.555 --> 00:16:39.555]  And I've got another report here with a Republican congressman that was going to be on the Jan 6th
[00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:44.595]  committee who was briefed the day before Jan 6th by the Capitol police that we believe there's
[00:16:44.595 --> 00:16:48.195]  going to be an attack tomorrow, they're going to try to force their way in. They knew that.
[00:16:49.555 --> 00:16:55.955]  And so why did they say oh go to traffic control? Why did they refuse Trump's National Guard request
[00:16:55.955 --> 00:16:56.835]  that's now been confirmed?
[00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:04.830]  There was a stand down just like on 9-11, bare minimum.
[00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.150]  January 6th was a stand down, period.
[00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.030]  Bare minimum.
[00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.030]  Of course they were surveilling Stuart Rhodes and all those people, of course they were
[00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.830]  reading their signal stuff, of course that was all going on.
[00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.870]  And that's another reason in the back of my mind I thought if any of these crowds even
[00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.350]  think about getting out of control.
[00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:29.449]  There's going to be feds everywhere except I didn't imagine they would actually fully
[00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:32.209]  stand down and then let just a few police get overrun.
[00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:36.050]  I mean it's just it's crazy and it was a disaster.
[00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:42.169]  We wanted like any big demonstration to put legal political pressure as citizens for the
[00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:46.610]  government to have a 10-day investigation to show our numbers to show we were upset.
[00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.929]  That's why Martin Luther King went and had hundreds of thousands of people and other
[00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:54.010]  marches in DC was to say, hey, we're upset.
[00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.169]  We want this done.
[00:17:55.169 --> 00:17:56.870]  We're showing you our numbers.
[00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.929]  That's in the First Amendment.
[00:17:57.929 --> 00:17:58.570]  That's a good thing.
[00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:06.690]  But by leaving the Capitol completely undefended, I mean 80 cops is undefended.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:15.860]  They knew exactly what they were doing and they even bragged in that article in Time magazine
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.860]  about how we did it. How a group of Republicans and Democrats worked together to you know make
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:28.660]  sure Trump was taken out and on January 6th that no Antifa was there and that we knew that they
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.740]  were going to come and do all this and we just let them do it. I mean they're telling you right
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.420]  there what they did and it needs to stop. And we need congressional investigations
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.740]  on the stand down and who did what and why they did it. And then again I'll be completely fair.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.420]  I'm not throwing Trump under the bus because I think oh if I'm mean to Trump you know the
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.820]  political system will leave me alone. No I'm mad at him about his pardons. I'm upset at him
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.580]  about going along saying the vaccine totally works when it doesn't and all the rest of it. But
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:06.180]  the reason I'm upset with Trump is he makes any opposition to spying or corruption or open borders
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:12.660]  about him. It's all about Trump now. The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, Americana, anti-globalism
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.780]  and Trump is a very poisonous figure with half of America and then it becomes a way for them to
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.460]  drive a wedge into the country. And so that's my issue with Trump.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.480]  And Trump, I tried to do the timelines. It's hard to know, but it's not exact, but they
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:36.120]  say it was 187 minutes from the time the attack started, until he took action. And now it's
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.760]  more about like 90 to a hundred minutes. Cause they were already attacking when he's up there
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.040]  giving the speech. And then he goes in a limo and watches it and doesn't know what to do
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:51.560]  and is confused. And you could say there was some negligence there. It was not very presidential.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.480]  It was not very decisive. Cause I'm trying to go to the police after I'm there five minutes
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.280]  saying, I know you have huge PA systems for emergencies and evacuations. Get on it and
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.120]  say, get out of the building, get out of the building. Well, they've been ordered to open
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.440]  the building up. Well, let's have an investigation of that. And then I'm like, give me your commander.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.920]  I'll get on the damn thing. Tell them, get out. We're going to have a Kent state here.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.760]  And we'd have a Kent state.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.600]  Four citizens died.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.600]  One cop died.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.639]  Maybe the injuries after, but they turn it, you know, Merrick Garland turned it into something
[00:20:24.639 --> 00:20:25.639]  worse than 9-11.
[00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:29.040]  And I'm sad those people died, both the citizens and then the cops and everybody.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]  We're all citizens.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.040]  The issue here is that
[00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:43.650]  I walked into a trap and I shouldn't have just counted on Trump and the police and everything
[00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.650]  and it should have been more paranoid but you're there in a sea of people and you've already had a
[00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.930]  bunch of events in DC and you're just thinking hey this is great you know let's uh let's you know try
[00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:59.170]  to have the senate investigate this because nobody really has yet and you are in the middle of this
[00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:05.649]  and you ask yourself because i'm not measuring myself by trump i'm not trying to say oh look
[00:21:05.649 --> 00:21:11.970]  how good i did but i mean i instantly was like what the hell get off there don't do that this is
[00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.290]  horrible any moron would know that
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:24.560]  and Trump is sitting there at the White House for almost an hour almost two
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:33.600]  hours almost 100 minutes and I just I just can't even understand how he would
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.240]  do that and then I just start wondering why did they ask me to leave that March
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.160]  what why did I mean is Trump really the super 4d chess player does he really
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.880]  work for them
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:51.780]  I don't think so I think he was taken off guard and didn't know what to do and and and and
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.860]  you know I mean they reported in the Jan 6th committee if any of it's true but it sounds
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.980]  like Trump that he re-shot his thing like four or five times was throwing fits and and and and and
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.379]  they didn't think it was strong enough what he was saying so he had to keep re-shooting it I don't
[00:22:05.379 --> 00:22:13.139]  know if that's true I just know that for close to him a hundred minutes that's that's about the
[00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:20.419]  number I come up with 90 to 100 minutes he sat there in the White House letting this fiasco go on.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:31.620]  Now the Republicans have to understand something and this is a huge issue.
[00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:45.410]  Your party is going to be outlawed in the next year effectively and the Democrats are
[00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.410]  already saying that.
[00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.570]  I said that months ago they're now saying that too because I know what their next move
[00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.730]  is it's already pre-canned you can see the next part of the script this is this is like
[00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:59.610]  bad comedy this is like you've seen one three stooges episode you've seen them all you know
[00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.610]  what's coming next okay now he's going to slap Curly in the back of the head then he's
[00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:08.930]  going to punch Moe in the nose I mean you know what's happening they're literally declaring
[00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:15.210]  being an American terrorist we now are in the Justice Department ran the branding to
[00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.370]  say that parents peacefully protesting at school board meetings are terrorists and that
[00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.930]  didn't come from the school the school board that came from inside their system trying
[00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.890]  to roll that out and of course if the Justice Department weren't a bunch of lawyers that
[00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.690]  think they know it all and think that they run the planet when they don't there's a scientific
[00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:38.050]  group above them they would be smart enough to go you don't think whoever's giving you
[00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:44.690]  guys the orders to try to outlaw parents and demonize parents you don't think the people
[00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.530]  giving you this advice are actually on your side do you?
[00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.590]  no
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:58.460]  the great reset wants to destroy the western world and the idea of wealthy westerners because
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.820]  they don't want the third world to aspire to that and they want to build this horrible
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:09.980]  dystopic great reset on record so i don't want to participate in civil war 2 i don't want to fight
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:19.500]  you i don't want to be part of this idiotic bs hollywood has collapsed the left has collapsed
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:25.899]  america is rotting we are falling apart our children are in crisis i don't care if you're
[00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:29.659]  black white a democrat a republican this is not good
[00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:35.670]  and everything the great reset does everything they push in their own words
[00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:42.230]  is to fully bankrupt civilization and to fully collapse things and on the ashes of it build
[00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.350]  this robot technocracy for those that are even allowed to survive this is going to be a hell
[00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.110]  for 99% of people
[00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:56.129]  this is a design collapse where they rebuild the world in their image you
[00:24:56.129 --> 00:24:59.570]  don't want to be part of this and I'm gonna go to a very important report and
[00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.169]  come back into the meat and potatoes of all this we've got a very important
[00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:06.770]  constitutional lawyer joining us who just caught singing in and another huge
[00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:13.370]  lie concerning us and we have all the proof so that's coming up but Greg Reese
[00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:18.330]  always does really powerful reports and he said have been randomly on Monday or
[00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:23.370]  Tuesday or Wednesday or Friday but right before we started taping here tape to
[00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.330]  air we're usually live in the weekdays but this is on Saturdays a lot of us we
[00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:31.330]  tape like it's live then air that whole whole piece that whole compendium what's
[00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.689]  the equivalent of live it's just not actually live and I was already coming
[00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:41.129]  in here and telling them get me articles about the Senate legalizing human animal
[00:25:41.129 --> 00:25:46.590]  clones last year and get me articles about drinking Bill Gates wants you to
[00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.470]  drink sewage and and not have any beef and have 3d printed meat out of bug
[00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.790]  parts and get me this and get me that and get me how they're burning up
[00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.750]  aborted baby parts to heat hospitals as what a disrespect that remains and think
[00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:11.230]  of ourselves as a commodity and then here comes his latest video dealing with
[00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:14.740]  what the Democrats are up to
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.160]  and what the deep state is up to
[00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:29.310]  and and how america's food supply is fertilized with human remains and coated with toxic nanoparticles
[00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:35.550]  now this has all been done and and i was already gonna come here and say there is a revolution
[00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:42.430]  against biological life there is a corporate scientific takeover of everything from the crops
[00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:49.790]  to the air to your food to to your medicine to every aspect not just 5g bombardment but filling
[00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:55.630]  us full of nanoparticles that the patents all say that that now these systems can resonate
[00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:59.630]  with and track you and even affect you and and of course it's very toxic
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:09.560]  and that's what I'm saying I sit there and I try to talk to people
[00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:13.490]  who are very successful in their fields
[00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:19.210]  and they don't even understand all this stuff they don't even know about the technocracy
[00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:24.170]  that Eisenhower warned about in his farewell address in 1961 they don't even understand
[00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.830]  any of this they don't know the internet was invented in the late 1950s they don't know
[00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.210]  it had a they had a whole planet arpa for this
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:38.120]  and when i sit here and i tell people what's already been on the shelf for decades they
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.840]  literally think it's a science fiction movie because they show you all this in science
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.240]  fiction so you think it's entertainment so you think oh i've just seen this in movies
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:53.400]  but really you're being prepared for what is already going on the ethics of a second
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.400]  chance pig heart transplant recipient
[00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.430]  stabbed a man seven times years ago
[00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:12.210]  so the washington post doesn't make it about this part human part pig clone heart they
[00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:18.490]  make it about well he stabbed somebody what does that even mean that psychological warfare
[00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:24.650]  where they change the subject to you oh clone pig heart part human no big deal oh is it okay
[00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.890]  that he got you know the transplant or whatever
[00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:34.950]  yeah guys pull the article up just about the straight up thing about the guy getting
[00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:42.110]  them the pig the human part part human pig heart last week the point is is that this
[00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:47.750]  is all going on while everybody else is busy just watching football and and the globalists
[00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:54.149]  have made the decision that the general human population is a drag on things and it's pointless
[00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:58.830]  and it's dumb and it's worthless and it's getting stupider and stupider and stupider
[00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:08.710]  just like the intro to idiocracy so they've decided to get rid of us and then you've got
[00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:13.149]  all these people trying to take the big pharma money and take the propaganda money and show
[00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:18.030]  themselves how compliant and how robot like they are to the system just so they'll get
[00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:22.149]  a chance to get some more credits in their bank even though the globalists are bringing
[00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:26.230]  down civilization itself and by the time they get to the people that helped destroy
[00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.710]  our civilization there'll be nobody there left to help them
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:35.800]  and so I don't want to
[00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:41.870]  contribute to any of this and I certainly have not been perfect but I've done everything I've
[00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.070]  done from a place of trying to wake people up and trying to do a good job and I've been angry
[00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.629]  and I've tried to get people out of their trance but I know this intellectually and
[00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:53.950]  at a gut level and at a spiritual level mind spirit body
[00:29:54.190 --> 00:30:03.030]  that we gotta stop race riots and election riots and any type of craziness and that we
[00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:07.890]  disavow any offensive violence and we don't want mass shootings and we don't want bombings
[00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:13.590]  and we don't want to have anybody attack Pfizer or anybody attack the Justice Department or
[00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.270]  anybody attack judges or anybody do any of that because you read Klaus Schwab you read
[00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:22.670]  the globalist behavioral psychologist plan they say we're creating an angrier world we've
[00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.430]  got a powder keg going we're going to absolutely make everybody be fighting and killing each
[00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.910]  other so they won't notice while we devalue their currencies implode their borders and
[00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:37.030]  deindustrialize them and by the time the transition to being a giant third world globalist system
[00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:45.110]  is here it'll be too late and it is a very small number of globalists at the top that
[00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:49.030]  are pulling this off and that are actually doing all this and if we just get the general
[00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.910]  intelligentsia aware of it and to understand that they have no future if they don't and
[00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:58.230]  that if they go along with what the left's doing they're not going to let America have
[00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.790]  a two-party system anymore you'll still have a vestigial Republican Party but but but because
[00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:07.110]  the Democratic Party is failing because the Democratic Party is falling apart because
[00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:12.030]  people know the Democratic Party clearly represents a foreign globalist occupation of the nation
[00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:19.630]  and an assault on all of our basic rights they now have to actually extinct the Republican
[00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:26.430]  Party and and make sure that it's fully discredited and destroyed and and make it not the party
[00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:33.950]  of the KKK as they've lied text the Democrats but the party of terrorism and Mitch McConnell
[00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:38.670]  came out this week and said the president is saying that all Republicans are terrorists
[00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:43.390]  and they're saying that all white people are bad this is asinine this is evil this is wrong
[00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.950]  you're trying to cause a civil war because there's a stack of news every day with Democrats saying
[00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:52.910]  we're in a civil war and they've got to lock all of us up so they're the ones saying burn things
[00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:57.950]  down whoever said protests are peaceful mostly peaceful protests they're the ones saying kill
[00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:05.550]  cops all of this and then they point at people pissed off about a stolen election being provocateured
[00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.630]  and in a mob mentality a tiny minority of a million people in DC going into a building
[00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:14.110]  and having a riot and doing some things that were wrong with sedition and terrorism
[00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:21.909]  and then try to leverage that into, oh, the main threat, as I told you, as they've been
[00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:27.310]  saying since Biden got in a year ago and now it's official, is people that question vaxes
[00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.750]  and people that question open borders and people that question lockdowns and people
[00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.709]  that question fraudulent elections when all of that is your right and all that I would
[00:32:34.709 --> 00:32:35.550]  say is your duty.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:42.899]  So, I should have started the show today with this.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:33:04.530]  But, I have talked to some folks that were recently extremely senior in the Justice Department, and one is a more classical liberal, one is a conservative, just to bounce off of them through some contacts I have.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:13.080]  Am I right about all this, branding Americans terrorists, they're going to take over Homeland
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]  Security and all this?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]  And they're like, no, absolutely.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.080]  That's what it's doing.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.560]  It's unprecedented, it's unhinged, it's dangerous, it's third world stuff.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.800]  And so, you know, I mean, there's that going on.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.639]  People that were extremely senior, like right up the top, top 10 people, are like, this
[00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:32.480]  is crazy.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:41.260]  So, Mitch McConnell's starting to get it, I think the rest of mainline conservatives
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.420]  better get that the Democratic party is like a bad case of cancer.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:51.380]  And they know they've lost the hearts and minds, they know they're losing intellectually
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380]  and politically.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.920]  So they want to overturn the tables because that's the only option they've got.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:56.920]  And
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:05.879]  they've got cnn hbo and pbs documentaries airing all the time alex jones a terrorist alex jones
[00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:09.880]  wants to kill you you know they've now moved from he's a racist and he's mean to the sandy
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.040]  hook people and all that stuff they've now moved on from that baloney to oh he's an extremist as a
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.840]  terrorist
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:23.259]  and that means we're two minutes to midnight that means they're closing the door on everybody
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.580]  that means they're going to go ahead with all this and the republicans better freak out
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.300]  they better push back because they're all the real targets
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:38.940]  Quite frankly, the system coming after me will only make me bigger, and if my mission
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.140]  is to get the truth out and fight these people and expose their agenda in a nonviolent way,
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.640]  then we're very successful.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.220]  But I don't have a lot of confidence in the Republicans and just the level of decadence
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.220]  that's going on.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.660]  If you look at cycles throughout history, and all I'm announcing here is, is violence
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.940]  is not the answer, and rioting is not the answer, and attacking people is not the answer,
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.260]  and having a shooting war is not the answer.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.620]  And I want to warn conservatives and liberals and everybody else who have just gotten crazy
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.540]  on all this corporate money who've been paid off to go along with the system.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:17.460]  If you had any history research in your life, you would look at what's going on and realize
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:23.940]  that it's the establishment waging war on anyone that opposes them and anyone that wants
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.340]  to have any of their own power that is endangering the elite.
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:33.420]  The establishment in their mad, crazy rush to try to consolidate power and to try to
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.140]  play God.
[00:35:34.230 --> 00:36:04.230]  Is is what's going to destroy civilization and cause massive new wars and you name it and the fact that they see collapse coming so they want to organize their own controlled collapse is just it's just insanity you cannot play God this is not going to work and it's out of control by its very nature it destabilizes things and collapses it so I am my own worst enemy and my own best friend
[00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.990]  and so are you and you should just ask yourselves all of you out there
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:15.500]  are we going to turn back now before it's too late because i was already going to come
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.500]  in here and talk about up front before i had all this news about how this is all a distraction
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.940]  terrorism and domestic terror units all this crap from the real terrorism going on toxic
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:32.100]  nano particles that the fda has just ruled no one has to research they can just do whatever
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.240]  they want and put whatever they want in your food they announced three months ago they're
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:44.080]  doing it now including melting down uh liquefying a human sludge and then spraying it on crops
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.880]  which is how you get mad cow disease in cows or humans the prions get into the food the
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:57.160]  prions grow in the soil and the prions grow in the brain and when you liquefy people into
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.160]  what they call in the uk awful sludge
[00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:08.470]  or goop hits and then you dump it out there that's where they found the original nano protein
[00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:14.790]  and these are protein crystals that if they get in you and they start growing well that's it
[00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:21.670]  so here's greg reese's report i'm going to come back and hit this news and then we've got uh some
[00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:26.550]  amazing news concerning cnn and just the next level of how they're just corrupt liars on the
[00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:32.630]  face of it not even caring they get caught so here is the amazing new report from greg
[00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:45.190]  reese about the dehumanization we all face the fda has allowed nanoparticles into the food supply
[00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:50.470]  under the generally recognized as safe provision because they claim that they are no more dangerous
[00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:56.230]  than their larger counterparts titanium is generally safe therefore nano titanium must
[00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:01.590]  be safe but they also admit that known materials can exhibit new or altered
[00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:08.070]  physiochemical properties at nano scale dimensions including unknown safety hazards that they will
[00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:14.710]  continue to monitor for in other words the human trials for consumable nanotechnology
[00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:20.230]  is currently happening in the public without their knowledge nano particles can be absorbed
[00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:26.630]  into our immune defense system and into our bloodstream and just like the fda admits materials
[00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:32.710]  at the nano scale can cause unknown changes in a person's biological system animal studies have
[00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:38.230]  proven that nano particles are changing the way our bodies absorb certain minerals such as iron
[00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:44.790]  fda chemist timothy duncan wrote that nanotechnology in the food supply is being held back
[00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:50.870]  because the food supply industry is afraid of public backlash and argues that nanotechnology
[00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:57.030]  will somehow make food healthier the fda is far more concerned with pushing more of these
[00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:02.790]  experimental nanoparticles into the food supply than they are with safety like they said about
[00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:07.670]  giving the dangerous experimental vaccines to your kids we're never going to learn about how
[00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:14.150]  safe the vaccine is until we start giving it at least 20 products are adding laboratory made
[00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:19.990]  nanoparticles into the ingredients and they are getting ready to coat bananas in new nanotech
[00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:25.670]  but companies are not required to disclose nano sized ingredients so we don't know how prevalent
[00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:33.510]  it is along with being a proponent of population reduction forced vaccinations and genetically
[00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:40.310]  modified foods bill gates is also the biggest private farm owner in america does anyone doubt
[00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:45.350]  for a second that bill gates is allowing this dangerous nanotech the fda is pushing for
[00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:53.270]  into america's food supply in related news 10 out of the 19 states in which bill gates owns farmland
[00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:59.430]  along with at least another 10 have recently made it legal to dispose of human bodies into
[00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:05.910]  the municipal water supply allowing human remains to be added into biosolid sourced fertilizer
[00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:12.550]  it's called alkaline hydrolysis and is referred to in pop culture as being very very green
[00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:18.550]  spiritual leaders have strongly objected to alkaline hydrolysis because they say it is
[00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:24.790]  disrespectful to the human body the vessel of a divine soul and it's understandable why they say
[00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:31.750]  this in alkaline hydrolysis the human body is liquefied with lye and poured down the sewer to
[00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:38.310]  mix in with the community's excrement and if that weren't bad enough this biosludge is then
[00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:44.390]  collected from municipal water treatment plants and used as so-called fertilizer on factory farms
[00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:50.630]  the official excuse is that it saves the government money for expensive toxic waste disposal
[00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:57.110]  meanwhile we are all being sold food that has been grown with a toxic biosludge made up of
[00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:02.790]  human remains and excrement which is then loaded with new and strange nanotechnology
[00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:09.430]  interestingly the dystopian movie Soylent Green took place in 2022
[00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:16.070]  they're making our food out of people next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle for food
[00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:23.030]  you gotta tell them you gotta tell them promise tiger i promise i'll tell the exchange you tell
[00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:31.430]  everybody listen to me hatcher you gotta tell them soylent green is people reporting for
[00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:43.430]  info wars this is greg reese america's food supply fertilized with human remains and coated with
[00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:49.030]  nanoparticles and as terrible as that short four-minute report is it's much worse than you
[00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:54.870]  greg even got to i'm not putting him down i'm just saying uh you understand that it's changed
[00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:59.670]  the chemistry of almost all the fish that are downstream uh from those water treatment facilities
[00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:06.070]  and is a cosmos the shrimp in the gulf of mexico uh to be exhibiting all sorts of mental illness
[00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:11.110]  and suicidal behavior where they just swim right up to fish and things can get eaten
[00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:16.790]  and they're aggressively attacking people now just like prozac does to us all the thousands
[00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:21.590]  of drugs people are on in these big cities and when somebody dies they're all full of those
[00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:29.030]  chemicals and then they just dissolve it and then mix it in with all the other feces and then put
[00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.910]  that on the crops
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:39.299]  and that's what they did in the UK that caused all the mad cow disease
[00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:47.710]  so we are bioloaded with so much toxic waste and now they're going to add nanoparticles
[00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:51.930]  that go right through your cells right through your gut lining and the Davos group says isn't
[00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:57.310]  it funny that they're going to colonize us is the word with all this nanotech through
[00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:01.390]  the food and it's going to be their revolution and they don't care again we don't change
[00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:06.310]  the environment we change you he said we put the nanoparticles in you as far as you wear
[00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:12.830]  the chips and you take the chips and the nano migrates to the brain and then we can
[00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:19.150]  mean that these are quotes by Schwab and that Israeli futurist and all of them you're like
[00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:26.430]  oh well that's just you know the big Israeli futurist they're doing it they're doing it
[00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.510]  and again if you're a new viewer and you heard me when I first heard the show oh yeah they
[00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.710]  heat hospitals in the US and the UK with dead babies it sounds like bull doesn't it
[00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:41.430]  in fact I want to end the show today we're not ending it right now with that
[00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:46.910]  Soylent Green video from like eight years ago that Darren McBrain myself and
[00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.910]  the great David Knight put together it is it is absolutely something else
[00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:58.230]  ladies and gentlemen okay let's get right down to brass tax here ladies and
[00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:03.150]  gentlemen because I need to go to the break a little while and come back with
[00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:07.750]  Norm Pattis because CNN contacted us Norm Pattis is basically moved down here
[00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:11.470]  from Connecticut we got so much going on in so many fights and he's a great
[00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:14.190]  lawyer famous lawyer one of the best criminal and first-time lawyers out there
[00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:18.470]  I mean he's in the top five at least and I'm sitting there in the little
[00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.750]  makeshift office he's got one of the little conference areas and he's going
[00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.790]  you want to respond to the CNN you want to respond to this you want to respond to
[00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:30.549]  that and I'm like yeah respond to the CNN writer and it's this guy
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:35.140]  with well what are you making your rhetoric in the past did it contribute to what happened
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:41.420]  on January 6 we responded back we're going to show you the email saying
[00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:50.290]  well basically I read the exact quote but he wrote what I told him to write about I'll
[00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:55.450]  show you when he gets in here in a few minutes I was like first you need to basically put
[00:44:55.450 --> 00:45:01.470]  in your article quotes by Kamala Harris saying rioting is good and then bailing out rioters
[00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:06.549]  looters and arsonists because that's what the Democratic Party's done why don't you
[00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:12.590]  do some articles about CNN saying burning down public housing eight-story buildings
[00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:17.630]  and burning down gas stations and robbing mom-and-pop stores and burning down black-owned
[00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:23.070]  businesses and shooting black off-duty police officers guarding pawn shops why don't you
[00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:30.509]  do a report on that and then I'll respond and say if I have any blame they raised the
[00:45:30.509 --> 00:45:35.370]  threat they raised the temperature all the way up to the top with all their rhetoric
[00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:41.290]  and billions of dollars of burned cities and dozens of dead and the Justice Department
[00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.650]  has basically prosecuted no one they just let them go
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:51.440]  last time I checked they dropped the charges on the Antifa guy who's at
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.920]  breaking into the Portland federal courthouse with a hatchet and hacking at
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.860]  the federal police with a with with a hatchet because he's breaking in the
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:06.000]  cops are there the federal security and then the cops come out right here and
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.280]  try to push the guy back and he has a freaking hatchet they should have pulled
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.200]  a gun and shot him oh but he's an Antifa guy so we don't
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.840]  Ashley Babbitt's coming through a window and they kill her in cold blood don't
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.100]  even have an investigation that's okay because she's a woman and she's a
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:25.380]  conservative she's a white person but when an Antifa person is a hacking
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.640]  police with a hatchet at their head
[00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:35.470]  do the cops pull their gun and kill them oh no because they've been told you better be extra
[00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:43.390]  sweet to the little commies and that's what i'm talking about yes i talk about info war yes i
[00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:48.670]  talk about how information is a war and how we use the truth to counter their lies and how there's
[00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:52.910]  a war on for your mind now we're going to fight against the globalist and and and they've got a
[00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:57.630]  one hell of a political fight on their hands but not that we are violent and everybody knows that's
[00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:03.390]  where i stand can cnn you'll have one word here three words there edit them together to try to go
[00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:10.510]  oh look jones is a terrorist arrest him you know get him yeah they can do that and i'll tell you
[00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:17.150]  if they do indict me for sedition or terrorism or any of these things i am completely innocent
[00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:24.750]  and we are going to win because the truth will come out there is not one micron of evidence
[00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:29.470]  that i wanted to attack that capital or that all the other capitals we went to and the vigils we
[00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:34.110]  had inside and went out and at governor's mansions you name it nobody got arrested
[00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:39.710]  at our big virginia open carry event with over 20,000 armed people nobody had any problems when
[00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:44.910]  we went and stopped the steel in georgia and went in there and posed for a photo or all the other
[00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:53.070]  places around the country and it is asinine to claim then oh but on january 6th that was different
[00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:59.150]  absolutely ridiculous i actually went and tried to stop the people going in i actually tried to say
[00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:06.030]  another kent state don't do it while over a thousand 300 something hrt and they said over
[00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:13.230]  700 other armed federal police watched while 80 police got surrounded and overrun by hooligans
[00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:19.870]  in any big soccer championship and especially in england they know to have thousands of police
[00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:24.270]  there because when it lets out at night there there are groups when you got 100,000 people
[00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:28.830]  there to see a soccer game there's going to be 10,000 people or 5,000 people that come there to
[00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:33.710]  have a fight and they're going to go out in the streets and they're going to attack the police
[00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:40.590]  and they're going to try to burn stuff so you got to have the police ready 80 cops at the capital
[00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:45.710]  when they knew that was coming and that's because trump wasn't even in office anymore when this
[00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:52.990]  happened 99 of his staff had quit on record he he was he was sitting there with only vestigial
[00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.510]  people around him and he thought it was all set up and it was all great because
[00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.230]  he just shows up gives a speech like he just done at the ellipse
[00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:13.029]  so i did more i did more than the fbi and the hrt and all of them i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that they're
[00:49:13.029 --> 00:49:17.270]  toward to stand down or whatever didn't know what to do or well that's a crowd of them you know 100,000
[00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:22.790]  people they we can't take on 100,000 people that may just antagonize the crowd more i'm not even
[00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:27.589]  second guessing exactly what went on there i'm just telling you that if you'd have got on the
[00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:31.990]  loudspeakers that are all over that building they were using that night they activated the pa system
[00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.470]  that night and said this is an emergency area anyone out here will be arrested this is a civil
[00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:42.230]  emergency everyone must be off the streets get out of here there is a curfew at eight o'clock you will
[00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:46.870]  be off the street i mean it was like three blocks away five blocks away you can hear those giant
[00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:48.790]  systems they have in the freaking capital
[00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:57.090]  but did they activate those and the answer is no did i try to get them to do that yes
[00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:03.090]  am i upset with the fbi and with the justice department for not doing that and for the
[00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:08.130]  capital police yeah am i upset that their surrogates are all over the news saying i'm
[00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:13.010]  guilty and and i really wanted to attack the capital yes i'm upset about that am i upset
[00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:19.890]  about trump sitting there for almost 100 minutes at the white house wasn't 187 like they say it's
[00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:26.930]  around 90 to 100 still that's a long time yeah i don't know what happened quite frankly and i'm
[00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:31.490]  honest enough to tell you that i said day one was a bunch of q people that thought this was the storm
[00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:36.610]  and leftists and provocateurs were posing as q and encouraging morons to go and you know think
[00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:37.810]  this was the big takeover
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:45.240]  and then clearly some of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys who I think are good organizations
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.800]  overall but people got into mob psychology and went in is that terrorism do they actually
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.720]  beat anybody up no they're not even really saying any of the Oath Keepers or anybody
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.000]  beat anybody they said they shoved past the police or something that's that's not good
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.480]  okay give them six months in jail not years in solitary confinement not you don't don't
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.240]  terrorism but my point is
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:11.700]  that this is all a microcosm of our larger society and how under the Great
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.740]  Reset if they just don't fix the reactors and they don't fix the
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:18.220]  electrical systems and they just don't people mine coal or they don't let
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.540]  people have gasoline refineries you'll just slowly see everything turn off and
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.520]  transition into a post-industrial world and that's what the UN and the Club of
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.460]  Rome and the Bilderberg group said in the 60s they were gonna do by the year
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:34.260]  2030 it would all be in place and in the year 2020 they launched it and they had
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:43.620]  a whole meeting in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro called agenda 21 and by the 2021 they
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.260]  would launch the collapse of civilization and by 2030 it would be
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:55.220]  basically complete I mean that's real stuff here you think federal prosecutors
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.580]  are gonna be safe from that you think judges you think school teachers you
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:06.300]  think Hollywood people know this is a dystopic nightmare this is not good
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:16.420]  this is absolutely out of control and I'm concerned and it's bigger than the US government
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:21.200]  it's bigger than your state government it's it's a big global corporate takeover with
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:27.100]  its philosophy and its systems that is now going into place and if we don't wake up about
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:32.860]  it really quickly and say no to it we're going to be in a prison planet that looks like Australia
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:43.220]  on a mass scale and by the way I am in total information overload here I am in total absolute
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.420]  information overload
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.160]  and I have some really really really big news that details exactly what I'm

[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.720]  you
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.720]  Reset wars
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.480]  I've been listening to the reset wars watching it while I clean my dad's place. My father just died
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.720]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.040]  And I just think it's a great course and anyone who's going through loss or anyone who's going through
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:22.279]  Or knows what's going on and wants to do something really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:29.600]  That doesn't necessarily go across political lines or religious lines, but about all of us as a human species coming together
[00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:33.759]  I'm a combat veteran and I mean that brought me close to God
[00:54:33.759 --> 00:54:36.759]  But what Alex goes through brought me even closer
[00:54:36.759 --> 00:54:42.100]  I can feel God in my life now the viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:46.980]  Programmed into your brain and how to erase those programs and install new
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.919]  I don't wear this shirt because it's popular or trendy
[00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:52.060]  I wear it because over the last year and a half
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.779]  I've done my research on Alex Jones and I've come to find out that Alex Jones has been right
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:59.980]  Reset wars is a concise version of Alex's thoughts where he's been where things are going
[00:55:00.379 --> 00:55:05.180]  Reset wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:11.520]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious and self-determined life
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.819]  If you're on the fence about reset wars, it's time to get off the fence join reset wars today
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.959]  Hey in four warriors
[00:55:26.959 --> 00:55:27.640]  If you're like me
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:33.899]  You've been a longtime listener of this program and you're fed up with everything going on in the world inside you like me
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.879]  The fire is burning something needs to change and yet we feel helpless
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.120]  Almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.459]  It's time for us to break free from that system reset wars is a game-changer
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.240]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim so much of the stuff
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:02.120]  We look at today is low vibration low energy and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there when they feel
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:08.799]  Their lie-cheat-steal plan to enslave and rob the people there is an awakening reset wars has helped me
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:13.600]  Navigate and to pinpoint and lock on to the deep-rooted
[00:56:14.279 --> 00:56:20.200]  Psychological tactics that were being used against me and now I'm not scared anymore. I have to say I was blown away
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:28.319]  So much better every day listening to it to Alex. Thank you very much for putting the course together. You're absolutely right. We are
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:35.000]  Reflections of God we are emanations of that and we can use that God energy to do really anything
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.479]  We want to do in this life Romans chapter 12 Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind
[00:56:40.479 --> 00:56:44.560]  And that's a process most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.160]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things you can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:58.299]  In this process we need to have a concerted active effort physically and mentally to reprogram that subconscious mind
[00:56:58.399 --> 00:57:03.680]  That's what this series is about is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our mind
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:09.919]  He's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening
[00:57:09.919 --> 00:57:16.000]  And I encourage everybody out there if you haven't gone there yet go to reset wars calm. That's where your journey begins
[00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:30.330]  You
[00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:00.330]  You
[00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:16.009]  Info wars the most banned network in the world
[00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:23.710]  All right, norm pattis is here with us on the saturday evening emergency transmission
[00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:31.230]  And as I promised at the very start i'm gonna hit the biggest news right now and there is so much of it
[00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:34.190]  And we've got a surprise guest popping in. He just got off the plane
[00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:37.630]  From maryland where he was being interviewed by tim pool
[00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:45.549]  We have dr. Darren j bt who's been at the tip of the spear exposing federal provocateur involvement in january 6th
[00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:51.390]  He'll be joining us coming up here in just a few minutes. But norm pattis is again constitutional lawyer criminal lawyer
[00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:55.950]  First woman lawyer and he's here working on so many of these political cases. They've got
[00:58:56.509 --> 00:58:58.750]  Against us and and preparing for potential
[00:58:59.549 --> 00:59:00.830]  criminal
[00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:06.190]  Stuff with us as well because the news is saying arrest the terrorist, you know, alex jones obviously attacked the capital they say
[00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:12.110]  Uh, so he's here burning the midnight oil. I was up here at eight o'clock with him last night working
[00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:16.350]  I was with him at eight a.m. This morning working and here we are. But here's the big
[00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:19.549]  Breaking news direct tv cancels oan
[00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:26.670]  After joe biden orders media outlets and tech giants to banish voices that deviate from the regime's official narrative
[00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:32.670]  Uh joe biden called for it to be taken off a week ago and it was done. I mean this is
[00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:35.790]  this is historic stuff this is
[00:59:37.049 --> 00:59:39.049]  unprecedented
[00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.069]  Continuing
[00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:48.990]  I was sent audio clips and talked to the chief of staff for mike lindell yesterday and I decided to
[00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:53.230]  Wait and cover it
[00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:55.230]  sunday
[00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.430]  But
[00:59:56.430 --> 01:00:01.790]  We'll go ahead and cover it now. Uh, they recorded the the head of the bank they've used for 20 plus years
[01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:07.549]  Saying well, we just can't have the fbi in here at the bank. And uh, so your bank's gone
[01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:10.350]  Now they have backups but
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:13.870]  That's what i've not told the listeners of what's going on here the last year
[01:00:14.509 --> 01:00:18.110]  Uh, but when I tell you info wars is is hanging on by its fingernails
[01:00:18.509 --> 01:00:22.830]  And that's why I laugh at these people showing us. They're gonna hear all this money and they just make up these numbers
[01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:27.150]  it's it it's it's like a little sick joke i've got because
[01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:30.830]  If you want a book if you want to film if you want a t-shirt
[01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:34.910]  If you want to get supplements, they're all in stock. They're ready to ship
[01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.910]  But I mean, I don't know if swat teams are going to blow the doors off next week and we'll be shut down
[01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:39.790]  Okay
[01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:44.029]  And I haven't told you one tenth of the stuff going on and again people say well, how are you taking it?
[01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:47.950]  I mean, how am I taking it? The country's being overtaken i'm not taking it
[01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:54.029]  Well not sleeping at night. I'm really upset and i'm worried about myself, but I i'm really my real pain is that
[01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:58.430]  the country's really been taken over by high-tech criminals and
[01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:02.990]  We need everybody I don't care of your black white old young
[01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:08.509]  Conservative liberal. This is not good for anybody to have the checks and balances being flushed down the toilet
[01:01:08.509 --> 01:01:09.870]  So we'll have more on that
[01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.590]  But let me hit this other big news and get norm paddocks's take on it
[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.790]  And then dr. Beatty's gonna pop in for about 10 minutes. We're gonna continue on
[01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:20.750]  Djokovic was detained a week and a half ago. He is the
[01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:27.310]  Multi-time all-time winner. I think it's nine times of the uh, australian open
[01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:29.390]  He's the best
[01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:34.430]  Tennis player probably ever lived. I don't even follow tennis and I know that I know my wife's a huge fan
[01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:36.830]  And so i've watched him in my house
[01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:41.069]  And many times and they say yeah, go ahead and come in. You got a waiver. You have natural immunity
[01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:42.750]  You have the antibodies that's that's gold
[01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.630]  They hold him literally in a fleabag hotel for a week and a half
[01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:50.050]  Then they let him go and now they've arrested him again and said you're being deported
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:53.470]  Because you're not allowed to criticize the injections. He'd even do that
[01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:58.270]  So now they admit it's purely political remember three weeks ago a senator
[01:01:59.069 --> 01:02:04.910]  Was criticizing the lockdowns and the tyranny and the boosters and saying it, you know, obviously this is tyranny
[01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:11.069]  They grabbed him and last time I heard he'd been in for three weeks. They said because of his views
[01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:18.990]  They're now saying in legislation in in oregon and in washington and in new york that if you criticize them
[01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:21.150]  Or you're being politically bad
[01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:27.470]  You will be held in these camps or if you're not inoculated so they're now see segwaying directly these being real
[01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:31.150]  political camps jokovic detained in australia again
[01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:38.830]  Authorities argue his anti-vaccine sentiment could spark civil unrest in australia. This ain't north korea folks. This is australia
[01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:43.009]  So yeah, the american people are terrorists terrorism
[01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.550]  uh is now protesting
[01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.910]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on and now this is happening and then it gets even worse
[01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:57.710]  So norm pattis, you're gonna be here with this ride to shotgun as we lay all this out. We got dr. Beatty about to pop in but
[01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:03.950]  Just as an american not as a famous constitutional lawyer. What would you call this period of time? We're in right now
[01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.990]  Scary as hell it's troubling times
[01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:12.190]  We are on the cusp of we're a penstroke or two away from a totalitarian takeover
[01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:14.430]  And I realize that sounds extreme
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.670]  But it is extreme consider what merrick garland a failed candidate for the u.s
[01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:22.029]  Supreme court and now attorney general said a week or so ago
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:29.069]  Uh, what if you un if you unknowingly contributed to the events that led to january 6th? You're a criminal
[01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:33.150]  Well, not so fast, but then take a look at what happened
[01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:38.029]  Yet this week with increased indictments as to as to some of the folks involved in january 6th
[01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:40.270]  They may well have been involved in
[01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:44.350]  In seditious actions i've read the indictment carefully. Alex has read it carefully
[01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:47.630]  You know if there were if we were over our skis the other day we were
[01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:52.750]  And if they are outside the bounds of the law a jury will tell but what is merrick garland winding up to say?
[01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:54.910]  Look at in june of last year
[01:03:54.910 --> 01:04:02.270]  The fbi created a domestic terrorist group and we were told that domestic terrorism is the number one threat to the security of the united states
[01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:09.790]  Look at extant existing federal statutes and there is a criminal law that says if you provide support to a
[01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:17.710]  Terrorist organization as registered a foreign terrorist red organization as registered by the state department. You're guilty of a crime
[01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:25.009]  How easy would it be to change that statute to say if you support a domestic terrorist organization?
[01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:28.830]  Registered by the justice department you're guilty of a crime
[01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:37.630]  And if you don't think it can happen here ask yourself why we are being habituated to criminalized dissent with the suspension of oan
[01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:45.550]  With the debanking of of my pillow with the ongoing assault on info wars and at the margins with the um
[01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.750]  with garland's
[01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:52.830]  Promise to prosecute people who unknowingly, uh were near an event that may or may not have broken the law
[01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:56.370]  But that involved petition for redress of grievances
[01:04:57.009 --> 01:05:03.250]  Is it going to soon become against the law to question the official narrative I guess it is in australia
[01:05:03.569 --> 01:05:08.450]  So from my perspective, I heard you use the expression alex earlier today dystopian nightmare
[01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:11.990]  Absolutely. This is worse than 1984
[01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:16.770]  Because the technology is more intrusive than what was imagined there in
[01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:21.490]  1984 big brother could watch you in your bedroom through your television screen
[01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:25.970]  You didn't know if he was behind the screen or not at a particular moment. Guess what?
[01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:31.009]  He's in your pocket now. He's in your cell phone. He's in every move that you make
[01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:37.090]  He's in your credit card and as the economy transforms to a digital rather than a cash basis
[01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:44.850]  Every purchase is going to be monitored and will there come a time that if you're disfavored if you don't follow the prevailing orthodoxy
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:48.770]  You'll be prohibited from purchasing the goods and services necessary to live
[01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:53.650]  Well, maybe that's the way it's going to break because after all go to your grocery store right now
[01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:59.890]  You're seeing interruptions in the supply chain and we have to wait longer for goods and services pay more for such things
[01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:04.550]  That it's covids the reason things are expensive. No, it's the inflation
[01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:09.170]  Let's go ahead and put back on screen and watch the post. This is everywhere. This is on cnn. You name it
[01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:15.810]  Anti-vaccine is terrorism that that's just crazy. That's a headline. You are a terrorist now
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:20.050]  that's that's on cnn msnbc kathleen zibillius former head of
[01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.290]  Health and human services said that too when everything becomes terrorism
[01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:29.330]  Then there's no such thing as freedom and if it's terroristic to believe in your own values
[01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:34.690]  If it's terrorism to say the bill of rights says to the government hands off my body then count me a terrorist
[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:36.529]  But don't declare war on me
[01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:42.850]  We need to come together as a people shake hands across the partisan aisle and say to the government enough is enough
[01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:44.850]  That's right norm. You're like the classic liberals
[01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:48.370]  I grew up around that I would disagree on a few issues with but we're really smart and
[01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:53.330]  Informed and we're anti-war and we're good people. I don't even recognize these leftists now. They're like
[01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:57.330]  They're the nazis. They act like jackbooted nuts. We are
[01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:02.290]  We are coming we're winding up in the name of goodness in the name of virtue
[01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:07.890]  We are creating a smug a smug public a smug republic filled with self-righteous people who know
[01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:12.210]  What's good for us and want to cram it down our throats regardless of whether we want it
[01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:19.170]  To be anti-vaccine is not terrorism. It might be discordant and I might disagree with you
[01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.170]  But if you choose not to have a vaccine
[01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.970]  I don't think I have the right to tell you you must have one or you'll be imprisoned or locked up
[01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:31.490]  As as a tennis star as being in australia apparently because he doesn't toe the party line
[01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:36.290]  So, you know, it's a it's a dismal time to be an american. It's a frightening time to be american
[01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:41.009]  It looks a little bit like a new mccarthyism in the name of public health and you know
[01:07:41.009 --> 01:07:45.009]  That makes me proud to support info wars and proud to support you alex
[01:07:45.009 --> 01:07:50.450]  And I hope your listeners and viewers will do so, you know this place you you've been in our finances
[01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:55.890]  You've been in all these suits. We turned everything over to them just spin because we're not whining but but explain kind of
[01:07:56.290 --> 01:08:01.410]  You've been you've given us a very close examination. Are we rolling in extra cash?
[01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.130]  Did we plan to attack the capital?
[01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.770]  Um, if you're rolling in extra cash, we need to talk later now
[01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:11.330]  I mean look this is an expensive operation to run
[01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:17.250]  I've been in television studios throughout the country most often in the northeast and this is an expensive operation to run
[01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:23.170]  You are listener supported by way of info war stores. There are not secret caches of cash
[01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.250]  There are not foreign contributors
[01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:30.850]  There are not um billionaires in the wings writing you checks to engage in a propaganda campaign
[01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:37.250]  This is a people funded popular network where people come to hear truths expressed here
[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:42.050]  They can't find in the mainstream media. They come here to find people questioning the narrative
[01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:47.090]  That is becoming authoritarian and you support yourself by selling products that people want to use
[01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:53.730]  The place is on the on edge and not withstanding recent media reports
[01:08:54.770 --> 01:09:01.650]  About documents the confidential court documents that were leaked from years ago info wars is not a cash machine
[01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:09.250]  Infowars is a struggling ongoing concern dedicated to fundamental american principles relying on you the people
[01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:14.770]  We sold tens of millions of dollars of food last year, but we make 30 on it and then we spend it
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:19.090]  It's not the gross numbers like a car dealership could sell 20 million dollars for the cars
[01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:22.050]  But the car dealership owner will tell you he made 300 000
[01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.450]  And his salesman made about 50 to 100 a piece
[01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:28.210]  And anybody a good thing is conservatives and people know about businesses
[01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:30.850]  So they know when they see these headlines that it's manipulative
[01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:34.530]  It's bs to you know to take three of our best years from years ago and say oh look
[01:09:34.690 --> 01:09:36.690]  The gross amount is this this is what's going on
[01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:41.410]  I'm, just shocked when we're talking to the even the lawyers on the other side and like come on guys
[01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:46.290]  Let's just they're like we know you've got hundreds of millions of dollars and it's just it's crazy because they've built me up
[01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:50.130]  Like this super villain and the truth is we're more like mayberry
[01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:55.650]  Rfb here. Um, it's it's it's it's just I don't know how you do it
[01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.930]  I thought I had a stressful life until I started spending time around you
[01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:02.050]  This is a non. This is a struggling ongoing concern
[01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:09.430]  But so is the american republic as to the claim that info wars had anything to do with planning aiding or abetting an insurrection
[01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:17.330]  Excuse my language. This is bs and I won't put out the the unexpurgated version because this is a family network. I
[01:10:17.889 --> 01:10:20.710]  You mr. Jones received a congressional subpoena
[01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:22.690]  And that subpoena
[01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:28.630]  Requested certain documents relating to financing of the of a protest of communications between jones and others
[01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:36.070]  And I believe the committee is hoping to make a case somewhere somehow someday that donald trump orchestrated all of that based on
[01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:40.710]  My comprehensive examination of the documents here
[01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:46.790]  And I believe that I was given full and complete access to everything I asked for and I got it within hours
[01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:53.690]  There is no evidence to support that mr. Jones or anyone at info wars ever supported armed insurrection
[01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:59.510]  Did they organize an event that was expensive to produce? Yes. Did they help finance it?
[01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:05.830]  Yes, did they appear and plea for peace when things got out of control? Yes, and in the run-up to that protested mr
[01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:10.550]  Jones expressed anger frustration and sometimes rage. It's what's going on in this country
[01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:15.590]  yes, but to leap from there from those statements to a conclusion that he
[01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:22.470]  Aided abetted fomented or was in any way criminally or even morally responsible for the violence that
[01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:27.430]  Undisputedly took place on january 6th is a lie and what happened reckless this morning
[01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:31.830]  You made the right point about a soccer game now a hundred thousand people show up at five thousand getting a fight
[01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:35.110]  You don't blame the owners of the soccer field or the team
[01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.830]  It's just some people come to these big things and cause problems
[01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:40.309]  I thought trump supporters were so awesome
[01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.670]  And a lot of our provocateurs
[01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:45.350]  We know that we had so many events that were totally peaceful with like hundreds of thousands of people
[01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:52.630]  We were just naive thinking it would be like past events. It could be and you know, I mean reading the roads at al indictment
[01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.550]  It suggests that if the information in it is it is true
[01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:59.750]  There were some folks that planned to engage in violence
[01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:04.550]  And if they planned it and if they did then they're going to be held accountable in a criminal court
[01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:08.790]  But I don't see any evidence to support a linkage of you and then
[01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:15.110]  And what I do see however is mainstream media's attempt to inspire prosecutors to draw the linkage
[01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:19.270]  There was a report I believe in news week this morning and cnn and see well
[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.870]  Let's talk about cnn in a moment
[01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:27.910]  But the claim is that somehow because you hosted roads and because roads engaged in sometimes violent rhetoric
[01:12:28.389 --> 01:12:33.350]  And that he sometimes used speech to motivate patriots to come forward and fight for their country
[01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:37.430]  To suggest that that's terrorism to suggest that that's sedition
[01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:43.510]  That's to suggest that that maybe king george should have strung up thomas jefferson before the revolution occurred
[01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:49.270]  We were born in revolt against government and you know to suggest that hatred of government as a crime
[01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:55.990]  Is to is to conclude that unless we love government unless we become a nation of bootlickers. There's something wrong here
[01:12:56.150 --> 01:13:00.470]  Well, that's never been the american way free country is going to have very very vocal dissent
[01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:07.350]  And it is the declaration of independence that if we see fit as a people to abolish this government and form a new one
[01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.910]  That's not just our right. It's our duty if it's done bad things
[01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:14.550]  But the way that stuff is set up right now and the way that the dominoes are laid out
[01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:20.470]  They want a violent operation because we're actually winning peacefully and intellectually. So I don't want violence
[01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:27.430]  I think it's not an option. I think it's a bad option and i've continually said that but it's an information war
[01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:31.510]  So that's why I use that rhetoric of it is a fight and you fight by getting politically involved
[01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:36.389]  You fight by speaking up you fight by filing lawsuits you fight by civil disobedience that's non-violent
[01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:41.750]  That's what you do you go up to the line, but you don't go past it because I believe that's the best course
[01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:48.389]  So i'm not against a physical revolution because I don't think that there aren't times when those are needed and right
[01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:53.510]  I mean hell who couldn't say you should have a revolution in north korea or communist china or nazi germany or soviet
[01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:55.670]  Russia or in venezuela today or cuba
[01:13:56.230 --> 01:14:00.309]  But I don't want this fight now because this is behavioral psychologists running it
[01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:05.590]  It's globalist manipulating it there that they admit they want a civil war. It's the democrats saying
[01:14:06.389 --> 01:14:11.350]  In the news, there's going to be a civil war and we got to round up the republicans. They want the civil war
[01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:16.230]  I'm fighting the civil war. I've never wanted a civil war and so
[01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:22.550]  That's our enemy is them starting a civil war because our fight is not between americans and americans
[01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:28.070]  It's globalists and out of control corporations that have come in and bought off the media bought off big tech and bought off government
[01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:32.710]  That are now engaged in a combine to overthrow our republic and our separation of powers
[01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:37.750]  So instead of the legislative the executive the judicial all fighting with each other and the people fighting with each other
[01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:39.910]  It's time for us to unify
[01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:41.590]  Along with the independent press
[01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:48.150]  So those five bodies to then kick out the globalist corporate influence and get these corporations back on the short leash
[01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:53.110]  Something's going on and I when you talk globalism, you're looking at it from the top down
[01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:55.350]  I'm, just a people's lawyer fighting one case at a time
[01:14:55.350 --> 01:15:00.790]  But I do know what happened with cnn yesterday. We were sitting in a small conference room here and a cnn reporter
[01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:06.230]  Contacted us and basically said, you know, do you want to make con you do want to make a a comment?
[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.389]  About about mr
[01:15:08.389 --> 01:15:14.870]  Jones's hosting of stewart roads and and you know was his tolerance and encouragement of that violent rhetoric
[01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:18.470]  You did not answer it. We answered it together. Yeah, we did answer it
[01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:20.230]  Well, and it was a playful answer, you know
[01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:23.430]  I mean cnn has a lot of nerve to come with its self-righteous
[01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:29.590]  Unctuous gore when it could um and and say to mr jones because you were involved in
[01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:32.870]  hosting someone who questioned the official narrative
[01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:40.389]  You're a terrorist when cnn would post pictures of burning cities under the kairon mostly peaceful protests as though the flames were a barbecue
[01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:45.910]  Rather than people's hard-earned property and livelihood being exposed and ruined. Um, so we and by the way
[01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:50.710]  We're gonna put that email on screen. We have that email. We're gonna put that email on screen for you now
[01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:56.790]  Where this is the rider, this is the article they ask you a question we answer it about kamala harris
[01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:01.430]  And so you'll see in the email, um that you know, they asked for a comment
[01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:04.550]  So our comment was look, you know, how about what are you going to say about?
[01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:10.230]  Why don't you direct a question to kamala harris about why she thought bailing out people who burned
[01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:14.070]  Cities and looted businesses were entitled to her support
[01:16:14.389 --> 01:16:18.470]  Um with bond relief and how that was consistent with the democratic party platform
[01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:25.270]  Violence comes in many forms there can be state-sponsored violence and I would take the position that locking people up
[01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:31.830]  Or that threatening to lock people up as domestic terrorists because they don't support your vision of virtue
[01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:35.430]  Um, that is state-sponsored. That is state-sponsored violence
[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:38.950]  standing by while cities burn and
[01:16:40.389 --> 01:16:46.470]  And refusing to police those cities for fear that that would inspire more violent violence is condemnation of the violence
[01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:52.309]  I was stunned when I saw hawk newsome on fox news. I believe this was um about a year ago
[01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.910]  I'm saying that unless the black lives matter movement got what it wanted
[01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:58.870]  There would be more violence then he was quick to say i'm not saying there will be
[01:16:59.270 --> 01:17:02.550]  But i'm saying there might be and he said we'll burn and loot and everything
[01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:09.430]  Well, and and and and that and I defended his right to say that because he was not that was not classic incitement
[01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:14.790]  Um, but it was it was it was puzzling that that there was no consequences for him you mr
[01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:19.270]  Jones and others have said far less but yet the the the mantle of a federal or you know
[01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:24.470]  The threat of a federal prosecution hangs in the air. Um, you know, here's what I wanted to say earlier
[01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:28.710]  What you say is incredibly important. We're going to talk about it more if we talk to professor. Darren beanie
[01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:31.830]  But
[01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:32.870]  banning
[01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.870]  la n off of
[01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:39.190]  Direct tv a week after biden calls for it. Uh, my pillow losing its banking
[01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:43.190]  And i've heard the recording of the bankers saying well the fbi, you know the fbi here
[01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:48.230]  This is real gestapo stuff and it's incredibly dangerous and that's ahead of the midterms
[01:17:48.309 --> 01:17:53.270]  They want to shut down all the independent press so that nobody's on air to challenge what's coming
[01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:57.030]  And and the message is if you jones keep challenging us
[01:17:57.030 --> 01:18:00.950]  We're just going to indict you as a terrorist and my answer is you people are crazy
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:03.430]  and and and so i'm just gonna
[01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:05.830]  Dial my rhetoric back as much as I can point out
[01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:06.950]  We should all come together
[01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:11.590]  But i'm still going to oppose what you're doing because what you're doing is wrong and you guys have gone crazy collectively
[01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:16.550]  Just like the nazis or other corrupt groups that all convince each other you're on the right and you're going to do this
[01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:20.950]  And you can historically see how dangerous all of this is everywhere. Let's go to a clip
[01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.150]  Of dr. Beatty who was an advisor
[01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:29.110]  To president trump one of the speech writers who heads up revolver news
[01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:31.510]  Who's been really the tip of the spear with tucker carlson?
[01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:34.070]  Exposing january 6th and federal involvement
[01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:38.550]  He's got a lot to say about stewart-rhodes and this new indictment a lot of connections and a lot of sources
[01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:42.630]  We'll talk to him in just a moment via the telephone, but first here's what he said last night on tim pool
[01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:49.510]  Ironically except for so just two more really important points about roads in particular in this charge
[01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:57.030]  One is the timing. Okay, part of the timing was the whole, you know feds erection narrative was at its absolute apex
[01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:59.110]  I think more important than that though
[01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:03.430]  Is just like a week before roads was charged
[01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:10.090]  An attorney for another oath keeper subpoenaed roads and was getting him to testify
[01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:16.710]  In the oath keeper's case and one consequence of actually charging roads
[01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:21.350]  Is it clears him off the table so that he has a perfect excuse not to testify?
[01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:25.110]  Because he just pleased the fifth and this is part of the playbook
[01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:27.910]  In fact, it happened in the michigan case
[01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:33.430]  One of the big informants in that case was named steve robeson once he was outed
[01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:40.309]  The government immediately slapped him with an unrelated gun charge that clears him off the table
[01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:44.950]  So that's one aspect that I think is really important in relation to the timing
[01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:48.389]  Another thing is this is if I were the feds
[01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.430]  And I wanted to cover up the perfect crime
[01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:56.870]  I would do precisely what they just did with the seditious conspiracy charge for the following reasons
[01:19:57.190 --> 01:19:59.350]  Think of what the charge achieves one
[01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:05.910]  He gives a big headline that for lower information people or people don't really understand the argument
[01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:09.670]  They say oh he's hit with this charge. He must not be a fed
[01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:15.690]  So it quote unquote debunks the right-wing people who say oh feds erection
[01:20:16.309 --> 01:20:17.590]  on the other hand
[01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:23.270]  It assuages and satisfies all of these left-wing people who have been furious that he hasn't been charged for a year
[01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:30.070]  Because in their minds the government is protecting him because the government's a bunch of trump-loving nazis so it assuages them
[01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:35.350]  But thirdly there's a problem if they hit roads with a serious charge and roads is a fed
[01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:40.070]  Then roads has leverage over them and can say i'm gonna go rogue if you guys betray me
[01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:45.110]  But I think they have the perfect cover story for that too because they could go to roads and say look
[01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:48.790]  We're gonna hit you with a seditious conspiracy charge. It's gonna sound serious
[01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:55.030]  But the public story is you are going to cooperate and get tell us what you know about alex jones
[01:20:55.350 --> 01:21:02.470]  Tell us what you know about roger stone just smear a bunch of dirt on trump's inner circle, which is what the media wants
[01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:06.870]  Inside you like me
[01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:13.590]  Fire is burning something needs to change. I just want to reach out and uh give a recommendation to reset wars
[01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:19.110]  It's really powerful reset wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and
[01:21:19.809 --> 01:21:25.350]  Revolutionary if you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this alex
[01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:30.630]  Thank you very much for putting the course together. I found it to be awesome. It was worth it to me
[01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:37.190]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.990]  This isn't about alex jones. So what you're about to see is a lengthy
[01:21:42.389 --> 01:21:50.950]  Powerful well-documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is definitely
[01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:56.150]  Afraid to think the way we were intended to think by god. That's what this series is about
[01:21:56.470 --> 01:22:00.889]  Reset wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:04.790]  My hope it's been helping me a lot
[01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:07.110]  With a lot that's going on in my life
[01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:13.430]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far and wide there's an awakening
[01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.230]  Join in to help yourself
[01:22:16.309 --> 01:22:18.309]  And others to wake up
[01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:23.190]  Reset wars has been a great tool in both recapping what i've come to already know
[01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:29.350]  And also learn new material. I'm not disappointed. I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible
[01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:33.990]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more it's moving me
[01:22:34.309 --> 01:22:36.309]  We need to have courage and
[01:22:36.309 --> 01:22:41.190]  Focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like I got a lot of that from reset wars as well
[01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:46.630]  The confidence and hope gained from reset wars is priceless. This isn't magic
[01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:53.670]  This is the real code of the universe or what max plank 120 plus years ago called the matrix
[01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:58.630]  Start your journey to true freedom now at reset wars dot com
[01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:06.070]  Well, I hope that dr. Darren j bt is incorrect because I sure as hell wasn't involved in the attack on the capitol
[01:23:06.389 --> 01:23:08.630]  And just feel like i've been totally set up
[01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:12.950]  But uh, he's here with us as a former professor of political science at duke university
[01:23:13.190 --> 01:23:17.110]  Who went on to serve in the white house as a speechwriter and policy advisor to trump?
[01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:20.150]  He's now the founder of revolver news revolver dot news
[01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:25.430]  At darren j bt on twitter, I guess still for now, but markdown revolver dot news
[01:23:26.389 --> 01:23:29.190]  Uh doc, thanks for joining us. I know you just got off a plane
[01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:34.950]  Uh from going to visit there on the right on the borders where tim lives of west virginia and maryland beautiful area
[01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:38.710]  Uh, but you just got back. So thank you as you drive in your car for talking to us
[01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:41.510]  Give us the latest and tell us more about what you think's going on
[01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:50.230]  Well, uh, you captured a lot of it in that in that clip and I would only uh emphasize that this is you know
[01:23:50.389 --> 01:23:53.270]  I think the most elegant solution if I were
[01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:58.710]  Advising the feds if I were a strategist for the feds I would suggest
[01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:06.470]  Precisely the solution that I described because what it really does is it gives a nice headline to shut up all the people
[01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:10.950]  Including revolver news suggesting that roads is likely a fed
[01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:15.430]  They'll say oh it was charged with the distance conspiracy is not a fed
[01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:20.389]  it'll shut up the people on the left and there's a large constituency on the left that was
[01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:27.510]  Just as puzzled as anyone's so why did it take why why is it almost a year and they're not touching roads?
[01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:30.650]  When in their minds roads is this big bad militiaman?
[01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:35.990]  They say oh, well, it must be this must be the nazi sympathizers in the government
[01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.670]  So it shuts them up
[01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:42.950]  And also the liability here would be if rose is a fed that he would go rogue on them
[01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:46.309]  And as you know that happens sometimes there are a lot of precedents for that
[01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:49.190]  Yeah, tim mcveigh
[01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:55.590]  Right. Well carol howe is a case. Oh, she's a better example elaheem city in the southern property law center. Yeah
[01:24:56.309 --> 01:25:02.950]  Exactly. So there you know, we we've seen these various permutations before and one option is that the
[01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:08.970]  Informants or agents who can go rogue and so in order to quell that possibility
[01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:16.870]  Whoever his handler might have been could have proposed to him. Look, I know it's going to be scary. It's a it's a serious charge
[01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:18.550]  but
[01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:24.389]  You're going to quote unquote cooperate with us and give us what you know about various inner circle people
[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.070]  It might be you might be roger stone
[01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:27.510]  That's just speculation
[01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:35.030]  But he's going to cooperate in some capacity and that will be sort of the cover story for why the charge isn't ultimately pursued
[01:25:35.670 --> 01:25:37.670]  I don't think that the charge will be
[01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:42.150]  Uh pursued to the point of trial much less conviction
[01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:48.150]  I think the option that I described would be the most elegant option from the government's point of view
[01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:49.990]  I don't know if that's
[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:54.790]  Actually what the plan is, but I absolutely do not think you know revolver dot news
[01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:58.470]  We've done fairly extensive investigative reporting on roads
[01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:03.670]  The arrest only intensifies many of the questions that we asked and well
[01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:06.470]  Let's expand on that because you talk about this has been done by the feds a lot
[01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:11.190]  Where they will do a charge on their informants and then drop them later or lower them down
[01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:16.870]  Exactly, we saw the jail guards that basically, you know were mia when ebstein got killed
[01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:23.430]  I predicted they would drop their charges as soon as uh, as uh, the other lady got uh, got convicted
[01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:25.750]  And of course that happened
[01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:29.110]  And so we've seen this over and over again, but i'll just go ahead and just get this out in the open
[01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:35.830]  Uh, because people say don't talk about this god they'll twist it but my own security by around january 6th
[01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:39.670]  Was like we don't like Stuart Rhodes that guy's creepy as hell
[01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:43.670]  Uh, and then even after january 6th, you're like I wouldn't have that guy on the air
[01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:45.910]  They thought he was probably a fed
[01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:49.510]  Uh and trying to set us up just from all the weirdness we saw and what happened after that
[01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:53.270]  I just couldn't believe i've told you this privately professor doctor, right?
[01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:58.710]  You know six months ago on the phone, but I and i've told tucker carlson this off there and everybody
[01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:02.250]  I just don't want to accuse somebody before we know but I know this
[01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:13.630]  I know this they clearly are betting everything on this sedition rollout and and and because
[01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:19.270]  Ted Cruz and because Tom Cotton and because everybody were bringing up Ray Epps and your
[01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:23.630]  articles and Tucker Carlson the rest of it I was even saying in the office the day it
[01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:27.510]  happened that morning I was on air before hours before the news broke saying it's imminent
[01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:30.790]  it's imminent they're gonna they're gonna bust a bunch of people and say it's terrorism
[01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:37.510]  because they had to do this and then boom it happened can you speak to that yes again
[01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:43.830]  I think the timing is very suspicious certainly in light of the Ray Epps and the broader sort
[01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:52.070]  of FBI involvement question you know becoming getting such national attention I think as
[01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:58.230]  far as the timing goes I think it's probably much more relevant the subpoena issue and
[01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:04.190]  the issue of removing Rhodes from testifying in the various trials as you point out there
[01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:09.470]  are many many parallels to that throughout the entire history of the government using
[01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:15.430]  informants and there are also several questions proposed in the original revolver dot news
[01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:22.390]  investigative reports that make no sense in light of the recent seditious conspiracy charge
[01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:31.630]  is that Rhodes up to this point up to just days ago had not even been searched the full
[01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:38.690]  extent of any search that that he was subjected to was they took a single cell phone from
[01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:44.830]  him four months after January 6th so here's the guy who's getting all of this press as
[01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:50.470]  the big bad boogeyman leader of the most prosecuted and dangerous militia group that they're all
[01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:56.910]  making a fuss about because of this stupid like stack that went in the capital and they
[01:28:56.910 --> 01:29:01.870]  don't think oh here's a guy that might destroy evidence we're going to give him four months
[01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:07.230]  to destroy evidence and then take a single cell phone from him and then after that they
[01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:13.310]  don't search anything of his for eight months and and they're building so they're allegedly
[01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:18.950]  building this ultimately serious seditious conspiracy charge and they bother to take
[01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:26.030]  a single cell phone four months after January 6th compare that to the case of Thomas Caldwell
[01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:34.150]  who is a 60 something disabled that he spent 60 plus days in solitary confinement thank
[01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:39.150]  god he's out he was finally released on bond the government actually tried to deny him
[01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:44.030]  bond and if you look at the government's argument for why he should have been denied bond it's
[01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:49.030]  littered with references to Rhodes and in fact the charging documents in relation to
[01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:54.390]  Caldwell he was charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding the entire
[01:29:54.390 --> 01:30:01.710]  conspiracy in the government's case rests on Stuart Rhodes's statements in action which
[01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:06.510]  is a suspicious thing in its own right given that Thomas Caldwell the 60 year old he's
[01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:11.070]  almost 70 former naval commander because somebody in Oak Keep were sending him a text calling
[01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:17.990]  right that's that's so crazy they know he didn't have a boat they know he wasn't trying
[01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:22.990]  to attack that's all that there's that now they've charged him again that's crazy right
[01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:29.190]  no but that's right it is crazy and it's outrageous but it's specifically important in relation
[01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:36.310]  to these questions about Rhodes because what first of all given the fact that Rhodes wasn't
[01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:40.590]  searched at all except for a single cell phone four months after January 6th that's the full
[01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:44.750]  extent of their search as they're building a seditious conspiracy case throughout an
[01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:50.950]  entire year that doesn't make any sense Thomas Caldwell so you don't think he could be a
[01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:55.150]  useful idiot they were just manipulating who thought he would start a revolution no I don't
[01:30:55.150 --> 01:31:01.790]  think I don't think I mean if he were an useful idiot why didn't they search him Thomas Caldwell
[01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:07.630]  who was hit with his conspiracy to obstruct charge very early on he had the feds swarm
[01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:14.430]  his house and take every bit of electronics that he could have had mid-January and yet
[01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:18.910]  and and they base their whole conspiracy charge against him on the statements and actions
[01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:24.670]  of Stewart Rhodes and yet they wait until May to take a single cell phone from Rhodes
[01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:29.110]  and then wait until now to hit him with a charge if they're serious about building a
[01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:36.110]  serious charge it makes zero sense no I understand Dr. Darren J Beatty's here with us but I'm
[01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:40.270]  asking you as don't you think this came out because they admit they they impaneled the
[01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:44.830]  grand jury last week and got the indictment right as all the ray up stuff was breaking
[01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:51.310]  I mean I knew big stuff had to come once that began well yeah they they needed to clear
[01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:56.590]  him off the table as I pointed out but that it's it doesn't make sense this idea of a
[01:31:56.590 --> 01:32:02.870]  serious charge secondly there were two very easy charges they could have given him very
[01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:07.990]  early on if they were building a more serious one one is the same charge that they hit Caldwell
[01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:12.630]  that they charged Caldwell with on the basis of Rhodes's statements and actions and that's
[01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:18.310]  conspiracy to obstruct and the other one that they could have gotten for was a trespassing
[01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:23.510]  charge which is a ridiculous charge but they've done it to other people if they wanted if they
[01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:28.150]  wanted to they did it to Owen Schroyer who's on video bullhorning saying don't attack the building
[01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:33.270]  exactly they've done it to Owen Schroyer they've done it to Mark Ibrahim they've done it to a
[01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:38.310]  number of people and it's a stupid charge but it goes to show if they wanted him they could have
[01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:43.670]  gotten him from day one just the way that they got other people on the same charges and they
[01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:49.270]  didn't so the fact that the government ignored Rhodes to the point that they didn't bother
[01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:53.830]  to really search him in any meaningful sense a single phone compared to the full scale
[01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:58.550]  said raid taking every bit of electronic let me just raise this then because you intrigued me with
[01:32:58.550 --> 01:33:05.670]  what you said on Tim Pool clearly CNN hundreds of publications are now saying get Jones this proves
[01:33:05.670 --> 01:33:10.550]  he's in charge he's the next one and and and we see that coordination with them with your theory
[01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:14.710]  that then Rhodes will make something up or something along those lines and you know some
[01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:18.630]  people are like well you better be nice to Rhodes he'll make something up make it up I'm not involved
[01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:23.990]  in this I am pissed if this indictment is real and he was hoping to hijack our thing
[01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:28.310]  and cause a civil war I mean I could be in prison or dead or we could have the country
[01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:33.750]  burning right now so well you know what Alex this ridiculous conspiracy theory that you had
[01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:40.790]  an involvement or Roger Stone had an involvement this ridiculous conspiracy theory this very theory
[01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:47.670]  is actually propounded by the chair of the January 6th committee Benny Thompson in his personal
[01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:55.990]  capacity did a lawsuit and he did a lawsuit against Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, Donald Trump
[01:33:57.670 --> 01:34:03.670]  and in in this lawsuit his theory of the case was that there was this kind of bizarre coordination
[01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:10.710]  between Rhodes and various members of Trump inner circle including Roger Stone and others so this
[01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:17.830]  theory has already been propounded by the chair of the January 6th committee and which which is
[01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:24.230]  interesting because as Revolver pointed out if Stuart Rhodes played a key role in the theory of
[01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:31.510]  the case embraced by the chair of the committee why did it take the committee until November
[01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:37.270]  to bother to subpoena Rhodes at all only after Revolver published a report pointing out how
[01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:42.550]  bizarre that was absolutely and for those who don't know they finally responded about Ray Epps
[01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:47.270]  oh they secretly met with him but none of that's on record oh yeah they said that's another
[01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:52.470]  ridiculous thing so we're supposed to believe the Epps thing is debunked too because the January 6th
[01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:57.830]  committee says he made a statement they don't give us the statement they don't tell us whether
[01:34:57.830 --> 01:35:03.750]  the statement was made under oath or what the circumstances were nothing all they say is don't
[01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:10.230]  worry guys Ray Epps told us that he's not a member of any law enforcement organization which
[01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:16.310]  by the way opened the door to DOD and there are a lot of government agencies that are not or Southern
[01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:23.430]  Poverty Law Center that they use that as a go-between sure exactly so it's really the the
[01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:28.870]  Ray Epps quote-unquote debunking is even more ridiculous than the than the Rhodes one and so
[01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:35.430]  it's clear that the regime is desperate exceedingly desperate to control he's like a carnival
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:42.550]  barker for three days saying attack the Capitol right and then he doesn't get arrested right no
[01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:49.430]  I mean that also makes zero sense and just to offer a specific example they're saying oh Epps
[01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:53.670]  didn't go in the Capitol well Thomas Caldwell didn't go into the Capitol oh and gentlemen I
[01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:58.070]  mentioned earlier there are roads for that matter didn't go into the Capitol a lot of people are
[01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:04.310]  charged didn't go into the Capitol in the case of Ray Epps who was the only person I think caught
[01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:10.310]  on camera just saying we need to go into the Capitol there was an individual called George
[01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:18.630]  Taneos who months and months ago was charged with a conspiracy to I think it was a conspiracy
[01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:23.910]  to murder an officer it may have been a conspiracy for serious assault but it was a very serious
[01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:29.910]  charge and the government based this entire charge off the fact that his friend wanted to
[01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:38.310]  grab bear spray from him and he told his friend no no not yet on the basis of that yet at the
[01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:46.390]  end of no no not yet he was charged with conspiracy to assault or maybe even murder I forget which
[01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:52.230]  but Ray Epps who's caught on camera among other things telling an individual another suspicious
[01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:58.950]  individual by the way was in charge he tells him put this away when we go in leave this here when
[01:36:58.950 --> 01:37:07.510]  we go in leave this here you don't want to get shot when we go in and so the parallels there are
[01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:12.550]  pretty astonishing well we also have Jay Nets telling the CNN reporter I told when they break in
[01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:16.870]  I told you this was going to happen I told you what's going on let's let's let's bring in Norm
[01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:21.430]  Pettis constitutional lawyer working he also represents a bunch of the January 6 people
[01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:25.830]  including Owen Schroyer you're talking to Dr. Beatty here you've got a lot of notes and
[01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:30.950]  observations hey Dr. Beatty it's Norm Pettis nice to meet you hi great to meet you I'm just a lawyer
[01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:35.430]  from the ground up you're looking at it from the top down I need I've got some what's your take then
[01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:41.430]  with respect to um uh you're drawing a blank on the name I'm having a senior moment right now
[01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:46.950]  what's your are you are you saying that you that Rhodes was a was it was a was a plant and
[01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:54.150]  by the government and if so for how long well I mean to to answer that question is to go into
[01:37:54.150 --> 01:38:00.390]  speculative territory I think I still think that the most compelling answer to the questions that
[01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:06.790]  I raised in uh just now in this interview and that are raised more extensively in Revolver's
[01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:13.510]  investigative work on Rhodes that the most parsimonious and likely explanation for that
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:19.190]  is that Rhodes had some relationship with some federal agency or some cut out for a federal
[01:38:19.190 --> 01:38:23.990]  agency but here's where here's where I had trouble following you and and I'm this isn't a cross
[01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:28.470]  examination it's not a trick question um he didn't need to be charged effectively to be silenced
[01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:32.710]  because you know Mr. Jones hasn't been charged and he's going to take the fifth on the 24th of
[01:38:32.710 --> 01:38:38.950]  January before the congressional committee um um so what the charges are surplus um in terms of
[01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:46.230]  adequate on the fifth how do you having said that I also agree that your points about you know given
[01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:50.310]  the centrality of the role they're now asserting as against him it makes no sense that it took four
[01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:56.630]  months to get his phone um but you know what did they really need to charge him in order to silence
[01:38:56.630 --> 01:39:01.990]  him because a prudent lawyer wouldn't let him testify in any case well the thing is this is that
[01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:10.390]  a prudent lawyer that's that's a good remark because Rhodes who always claimed always postured
[01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:16.070]  as though oh they're seriously going after me they're seriously going after me he volunteered
[01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:25.270]  himself to the FBI for three hours which is a bizarre thing it is why would he do that why
[01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:33.910]  would he do that well that's well he clearly was not concerned that they were really gonna get him
[01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:38.310]  and I think that's okay got that so that so he's playing the card that he's got he's he's playing
[01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:45.190]  the get out of jail card in his pocket I've heard his lawyer say on the air that he has incontroversial
[01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:49.670]  and controversial documentary proof that Rhodes is innocent do you have any idea what that is
[01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:55.830]  what that incontrovertible proof is I mean I would love to see it yeah look I hope it's true
[01:39:55.830 --> 01:40:01.510]  I mean here's the deal I've read this indictment now three times but by the way let me just just
[01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:07.670]  finish the answer on this sir in a legal in a legal sense you can always you know uh I think
[01:40:07.670 --> 01:40:13.830]  testing me you're the lawyer but correct me if I'm wrong he was subpoenaed uh a defense lawyer for
[01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:21.830]  Kelly Meg's subpoenaed him uh and apparently got him to agree to testify as a witness and
[01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:29.430]  it was shortly after a week after that that he was hit with a charge I think it's certainly
[01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:35.750]  a good excuse if you've been hit with a charge like this to say okay all of my buddies that I
[01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:42.630]  claimed that I was going to testify on behalf of I'm just not able to do that right now maybe
[01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:47.910]  you know it makes me pine for the days of jury nullification in this country because
[01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:53.270]  if the feds are manipulating charges to silence potential witnesses or to cover their tracks we
[01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:57.990]  ought to be able to say to jurors you decide both the facts and the law and when the government
[01:40:57.990 --> 01:41:02.230]  starts playing pocket pool with justice and starts hiding the truth from jurors jurors ought to be
[01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:06.870]  able to ask questions of what's going on here here's my question to the dockhole join us again
[01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:11.030]  on monday and and nora pattis where we got some more to say and some news hit after he leaves
[01:41:12.710 --> 01:41:16.550]  what about because you've talked to your sources i've talked to my high level justice department
[01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:21.270]  former but very recently in saying this is unprecedented it's a domestic rollout the
[01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:26.070]  american people are terrorists it's an attempt basically to unofficially ban the republican
[01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:29.430]  party and say it's terrorist and then biden's even giving speeches going i don't think the
[01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:34.550]  republican party will exist in 2024 and and you've got mcconnell saying hey don't brand
[01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:39.510]  your opposition terrorist this is crazy so so i think republicans are finally getting that
[01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:44.390]  the democrats know that they've lost the public's will there's been a major political realignment
[01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:49.430]  doesn't mean republicans are our saviors but my god the democrats have gone to seed they're on
[01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:54.070]  foreign payrolls with the chinese communists and others and i don't think just like venezuela
[01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:58.390]  people tried to vote out hugo chavez you saw what happened i mean this is a real authoritarian
[01:41:58.390 --> 01:42:02.630]  takeover not just shutting conservatives and nationalists off the internet now taking their
[01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:08.070]  businesses their bank accounts taking them off cable tv i mean you can see that it's already
[01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:13.030]  here and now i've got a stack of news we'll show up for the professor leaves with them literally
[01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:20.150]  saying we're in a civil war we need to arrest all the republicans uh the former deputy director of
[01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:25.750]  the fbi said all the republicans are basically terrorists this is apocalyptic you've got the
[01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:30.230]  the attorney general as you quoted if you don't even know you're in a conspiracy but you ate it
[01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:37.030]  you're going to jail that's not in the statutes yet so so you know i i i was stunned i i hadn't
[01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:41.670]  paid any attention to what mary garland said um on the anniversary of the january 6th event and
[01:42:41.670 --> 01:42:46.150]  it was brought to my attention just the other night so i looked at it and and i was in shock
[01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:50.950]  i'd always felt bad for garland i thought that his vote or his nomination of the supreme court
[01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:56.070]  was at least owed the courtesy of a vote and it was cowardly not to give him one but when i saw
[01:42:56.070 --> 01:43:01.830]  him shaking in his boots as it were in fake rage on national television basically calling everybody
[01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:06.790]  who didn't agree with him as a terror a terrorist i thought he was unhinged so i called a friend of
[01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:10.950]  mine who recently had been in the justice department in a high at a senior position
[01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:16.550]  and i said what's your take on this guy is he out of his mind and how do you unknowingly
[01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:23.190]  participate in a conspiracy that makes zero sense it just yeah no it is it just can't happen
[01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:27.430]  there's a scienter a mental state requirement to conspiracy it's what's known as a specific
[01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:31.350]  intent crime you have to have the conscious objective to join in a criminal enterprise
[01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:35.910]  you don't do that unknowingly period in order to commit a crime in the united states two things
[01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:39.990]  are necessary you have to have a prohibited you have to have a mental state first of all
[01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:44.230]  a culpable mental state and you have to commit a prohibited act what's a culpable mental state
[01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:50.470]  intent in some crimes recklessness and other there is criminal negligence but unknowing not
[01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:57.670]  doing anything is not going to support a conspiracy charge well he does he really did
[01:43:57.670 --> 01:44:03.270]  so this friend of mine said look the mainstream media is not covering this he knows this this
[01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:07.750]  friend of mine that i work for mr jones he's no supporter of mr jones but he said you guys gotta
[01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:14.550]  get the word out the the media needs to cover this the criminalization of dissent appears to
[01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:20.790]  be on the justice department's menu so this is an unprecedented power grab darren why do you think
[01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:27.030]  this is happening well i mean the larger context of it for the false narrative of january 6th and
[01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:33.590]  otherwise is to advance this domestic war on terror i think that's been clear for a long time
[01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:40.470]  and so january 6th to the extent that they can frame it as this trumpist insurrection and not
[01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:47.350]  the fed's erection which fundamentally i think it actually was um they can effectively smear
[01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:54.390]  over half the country as potential or de facto domestic terrorists and therefore marshal the full
[01:44:54.390 --> 01:45:02.390]  weight and force of the american national security apparatus to silence and crush them perfectly
[01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:07.030]  said so the outlawing of your opposition the classic authoritarian move yep
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:13.880]  indeed all right doc finish up on that point i should have interrupted then we're gonna let
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.800]  you go and i'll talk to you monday we really appreciate your work at revolver nose well i i
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.800]  think i've said uh all that i would you know wanted to say on that but i look forward to
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:27.400]  coming on monday and further discussing some of these some of these cases because let me ask you
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:33.800]  this if you really get my go ahead yep you really got my attention though are you predicting uh
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.840]  that uh that they're gonna try to like get some of these people to now lie about us to get out of
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:47.000]  jail i wouldn't be surprised i think that's one possible avenue that they can use to justify why
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.679]  they're not ultimately pursuing the seditious conspiracy charge to trial and conviction
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.559]  all right doctor thank you so much in the case of stewart-rhodes i think the others
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:01.320]  are different stories so i'm talking specifically about roads
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:06.040]  yeah because most people on oath keepers are great folks and i and i think stewart's still
[01:46:06.599 --> 01:46:11.240]  innocent until proven guilty and uh we're gonna have to suss all this out thank you so much
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.679]  thank you thank you all right norm i really appreciate you spending so much time with us
[01:46:16.679 --> 01:46:20.200]  i'm gonna try to give you the floor right now because i'm always interrupting you have so much
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:24.840]  to say and then i've got some articles and things i want to go over here with you uh but i mean this
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.040]  is just an unprecedented surreal time to be alive for me i know that personally and just the news
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.679]  today of my pillow getting their banks taken away because of the fbi i mean that i mean i've
[01:46:34.679 --> 01:46:40.519]  heard the report the bankers saying and the and and all of this and you've got uh direct tv taking
[01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:45.400]  off oen like a week about a week ago biden said they shouldn't be on tv they didn't take them down
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:50.920]  i mean i mean i guess he just says i don't who will rid me of this terrible person i guess it
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:56.440]  goes back to shakespeare's uh rendition of julius caesar i mean this is really obvious what's going
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:02.200]  first they came for alex jones then they came for my pillow then they went for one american news and
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:08.040]  they'll come for you next that's how i feel um and you know i mean if we are all terrorists
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:14.120]  unless we tow the party line that's a dystopia and when you know and you know you and i may
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:19.320]  disagree about some of the vaccine politics but my view is people have a right to consent or not
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.160]  about what gets pushed into their bodies and the government ought not to have the right to tell
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:29.160]  people you must do it but there is a republic of virtue taking place and there is a new requirement
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:33.880]  for orthodoxy and the bill of rights isn't threatened you know there's a fascinating new
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:40.679]  book that just came out involving the new civil war by stephen marsh m-a-r-c-h-e i encourage all
[01:47:40.679 --> 01:47:45.000]  of you to read it it's a light read you know i read it on an airplane ride on the way here from
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.760]  the east coast to mr jones's office and one of the things marsh is a canadian author author and one
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:56.519]  of the things he said in the book is um he um you know maybe we need to have a new constitutional
[01:47:56.519 --> 01:48:02.760]  convention in the united states now that might have sounded like good news to you but i think
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:08.519]  what marsh meant is we needed to abandon the bill of rights that the bill of rights stands now as a
[01:48:08.519 --> 01:48:14.360]  principal barrier to what's necessary for collective action in the name of existential threats in his
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:21.480]  view such as climate change and so forth but here's the agenda um there are public health
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:26.360]  emergencies have been declared in any number of states including the in the northeast where i'm
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:33.400]  from um connecticut and under these emergencies governors have asserted broad executive powers
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.800]  um other things and those powers um include the ability to require mask mandates to close schools
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.360]  to shut businesses to restrict commerce in the name of the health education and welfare of the
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:50.440]  people joe biden tried to do it with a national vaccine mandate as to employees private employees
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.240]  the supreme court put a lid on that for the time being there'll be full briefs and argument later
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.840]  in the year what's at stake here what's at stake here is saying that for the sake of the collective
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:07.639]  the individual must bend that is what the debate is about right now that is the next wave in
[01:49:07.639 --> 01:49:11.880]  constitutional law and if you look at the history of constitutional law in the united states you'll
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.880]  see there have been several waves the founding of the republic and the creation of the bill of rights
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.120]  that's wave number one um the reconstruction amendments 13 14 15th amendments that's wave
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:28.040]  number two the creation of the new deal state or the administrative state in the 1930s that's wave
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:33.880]  number three the fourth wave our wave is the creation of a national police power in the name
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:40.760]  of the public good and it will be justified to empower government to deal with collective threats
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:47.960]  such as global warming or climate change um in some people's minds guns in other people's minds
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.599]  so-called systemic racism and you'll see a move for reparations which i predict will reach the
[01:49:52.599 --> 01:49:57.800]  floor of congress in a significant way within the next two or three years and the claim will always
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:03.639]  be that in the eyes of some elite there are things that are necessary for the collective
[01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:07.639]  good that must be done and we must empower government to do it regardless of what the
[01:50:07.639 --> 01:50:13.880]  individual thinks now when i listen to alex when i come down here mr jones you know i hear him talk
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:22.360]  about globalists and global norms and there is a gathering tide of thought among elites technocratic
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:30.120]  elites scientific elites uh un elites policy elites that says there is one right answer
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:34.760]  to questions that if those questions are properly framed that right answer can be
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:41.719]  determined by an elite and the public welfare is assured by assuring compliance with those answers
[01:50:41.719 --> 01:50:48.519]  that i take to be globalism and think about it this way as luck would have it in 1776 when our
[01:50:48.519 --> 01:50:54.040]  republic was created adam smith also wrote the wealth of nations and he warned against centralized
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:59.559]  power with respect to the economy he said that the utility the happiness the satisfaction of
[01:50:59.559 --> 01:51:05.719]  individuals was better served by the invisible hand the metaphor he used of the marketplace
[01:51:05.719 --> 01:51:13.080]  distributing things globally are we in an era now where artificial intelligence permits us to do
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:20.200]  things that make the individual the invisible hand an outdated metaphor in other words does
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:25.240]  big data now have the power to crunch the infinite seemingly infinite number of data
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:31.160]  points associated with us all to come up with an algorithmic solution to how best we should live
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:36.040]  the optimal speed limit so to speak now you're saying wait wait a minute ai give me a break
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:40.920]  where are you going take a look at henry kissinger's new book on artificial intelligence it came out
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:45.240]  last year he co-authored it with two other individuals and i don't recall their names
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:50.599]  but look up henry kissinger artificial intelligence and you'll see it it's a fascinating intellectual
[01:51:50.599 --> 01:51:56.040]  history about what's going on with ai artificial intelligence machine learning the ability of a
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:02.200]  machine to teach itself to do things that we don't know or we can't do ourselves what you will learn
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:09.400]  in that book is that we are now governed we are now live in a world where many decisions are made
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:16.280]  or many solutions to problems that policymakers must decide are resolved by machines by machines
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.960]  that are crunching enormous amounts of data coming up with solutions but we don't know how the
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:27.639]  machines are doing it and we don't ask too many questions about how the machines are doing it
[01:52:27.639 --> 01:52:32.519]  because we're satisfied with the answers give me enough to eat and i won't care what the delivery
[01:52:32.519 --> 01:52:38.840]  algorithm looks like um keep me warm enough and i'll be happy with however the house gets heated
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:45.240]  but i think that what individuals crave and the genius of the american system has been the ability
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:50.679]  of individuals to decide for themselves what makes them significant to decide for themselves whether
[01:52:50.679 --> 01:52:56.360]  they want to be vaccinated to decide for themselves as casey versus planned parenthood once put it
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.800]  their own fundamental conception of existence or meaning in the universe when you get the state
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:07.800]  and you get policy elites at the state local and national levels on international levels making
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:14.040]  those decisions for us that my friends is dystopia and that is what we're seeing as we enter the 22nd
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:20.280]  uh the 20 2022 absolutely beautifully said norm and that's why you do your own great podcast tell
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:23.960]  people about that we're gonna hit some more news and wrap this up for this incredible saturday
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:30.760]  broadcast but uh wow the one thing i would add about ai they'll talk to some of the high level
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:36.200]  google people and some other folks the pentagon about this and they said listen everybody says
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.240]  that no one knows how it works and everybody says we're not sure how these chips are getting made
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.280]  or whatever because it is the computers figuring out how to make it better better
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:52.440]  but we program these for the outcome we want and so it goes back to enron now 30 years ago
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:57.080]  in california and other areas had all fake computer trading and fake screens there's real
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.000]  screens but fake data and they would go although this is what's happening we're energy trading
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.040]  they were in the back just making up whatever they wanted stealing sometimes three billion
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:09.880]  dollars a day well so what i'm saying is a lot of this is is like the wizard of oz the curtain
[01:54:10.519 --> 01:54:15.400]  and so they're telling you it's ai and and they're and they're telling you it really did this
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:20.360]  but really they're just behind the scenes and and here's a great example of that and i told
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.280]  one of the top um ai experts in the world this when he was down here in austin recently uh
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.519]  visiting uh i'm not name dropping it's trying not to say the guy's name i had one of the top
[01:54:30.599 --> 01:54:35.320]  ai guys the world had dinner with him and joe rogan and uh he was going the next day with
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:42.599]  elon musk out of his space base and uh i said you know steve was the act one of the founders of
[01:54:42.599 --> 01:54:47.000]  apple says that an ant's brain is more powerful than the best ai he said well yeah currently
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.040]  because it knows how to read pheromones and has everything programmed in it and it's all
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:55.160]  incredible and such and such but you know and he had his answer about how but but what the
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:59.799]  ant the ants doing is not you know overall that important and i was just basically like yeah just
[01:54:59.799 --> 01:55:04.120]  like bloomberg says what's a farmer do they just take a seat in the ground it comes up it's a lot
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.599]  harder than that folks okay and i mean you've got the perfect land and all the rest of it yeah okay
[01:55:08.599 --> 01:55:12.440]  it might be great but most places it's hard it takes a lot and there's a lot you deal with and
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.680]  you deal with the corruption of who you're selling it to and how to get it there farming farming's
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.320]  hard okay that's why most people can't do it but i would honestly you know what the most powerful
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:26.599]  ai is it's the most simple ai that interfaces with humans and i said what is the most powerful
[01:55:26.599 --> 01:55:31.160]  system in the world separate from the internet itself that humans are interfacing with and
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.559]  working with and that we're having great success with and i said it's a system that's 100 years
[01:55:35.559 --> 01:55:41.160]  old is the traffic lights yeah and i said the best ai is a system that knows how to interface
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:45.960]  with humans and make our lives better and it's simple and works but also doesn't take our liberty
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.559]  and the traffic light system is the perfect example of individual organisms in a group
[01:55:51.559 --> 01:55:57.480]  collective colony organism interfacing with the machine to make our lives better but instead of
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:01.080]  these ai systems they're pre-programming them for the outcome they want and then saying to
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.960]  everybody else oh it's science just do what it says well it may be but i think of it in a more
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:13.080]  homely way if you say to your computer i want to be healthy wealthy and safe those are goals that
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:18.360]  we all want and the computer goes out and arranges your life such that you wake up the the following
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:25.719]  morning strapped to a gurney in a bomb shelter with an opium drip in your arm after the machine
[01:56:25.719 --> 01:56:30.920]  has robbed a bank and put all the money in your account you got everything you asked for you just
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.000]  didn't get it the way you wanted to and you got it in a way that makes life together impossible
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.880]  that was beautifully said say that again because that's the old i don't know if i can
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.480]  you would you would you would ask a genie can i have 50 000 pounds of gold and it would jump it
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:48.920]  on top of you guys say i want you to place over there away from me the 50 000 pounds of
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:53.880]  gold you can't take from people the right to have them make their own decisions and have them be
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:57.639]  sad because it turns you into an idiot a zombie yeah and that i think that was the appeal of
[01:56:57.639 --> 01:57:01.639]  the zombie movies not too long ago there's something happening there what it is it's
[01:57:01.639 --> 01:57:06.599]  becoming clear enough to us this election cycle um but we're becoming zombies and we're living in
[01:57:06.599 --> 01:57:12.200]  a world that we're living in a digital dystopia where we're delivered um items and expected to
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:17.000]  be happy i've noticed they could they could have three degrees or no degree they choose to just
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.680]  decide what they want to believe and just be lazy they go no no no i'm not listening you know i spent
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:26.440]  a lot good part of the spring during the pandemic when we were locked down in new england rereading
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.480]  1984 brave new world margaret atwood's the handmaid's tale and others and what i learned is
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.040]  the following in every dystopia what the author does is he takes some element of experience and
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:41.719]  exaggerates it and makes it become the dominating factor in a particular society and in each of these
[01:57:41.719 --> 01:57:47.480]  novels what's interesting is the protagonist decides if i went along i could be happy but
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.680]  going along isn't good enough i want to make my own way and that's what the american way has been
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:57.799]  and that's what the bill of rights is dystopia is both real and fictional try to give you rewards
[01:57:57.799 --> 01:58:03.960]  if you submit if you really look at this you you you submit and then it gets worse well maybe it
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.960]  does maybe it doesn't right now it looks better because you get the bing bing bing bing bing points
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:13.799]  in the great electronic censorship meeting no 10 minutes hey norm let's go over some articles
[01:58:13.799 --> 01:58:18.280]  together okay that sounds great you like this commercial free format it's a lot of pressure
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:22.599]  because we got to keep talking and we don't get a chance to say how am i doing more we're taking
[01:58:22.599 --> 01:58:28.920]  ash thank oh all right all right i wrote some notes up here that i wanted to go over um i wrote
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:34.360]  these up friday but never got to them on air it's just a quick outline because this isn't
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:38.120]  this isn't me after talking about myself this is what they're coming at you with
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.280]  everything that's being done is what they're trying to normalize prior to dc events
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:50.760]  august 28 1963 mlk and more than 200 000 demonstrators took part in a march on washington
[01:58:51.799 --> 01:58:58.040]  for freedom and jobs the march was successful in pressuring jfk's administration to initiate
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:03.880]  a strong federal rights bill in congress this is not domestic terrorism we were wanting to
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:08.040]  have a 10-day review that senator cruz was putting forward that was legal and lawful
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:13.960]  that pelosi proposed before four years earlier they didn't get it either of this senate review
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:17.240]  that's legal and lawful they're saying it's terrorism to put pressure on government to
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:21.080]  get what you want no it's it's terrorism to threaten groups and individuals with violence
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:26.360]  if if they don't do what you want but but we're not doing this so how do you balance declaration
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:30.040]  of independence says i have a right to stand up and fight back if i decide this government's bad
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:37.000]  versus uh the the line of well i'm gonna go peacefully demonstrate and say what i want
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.960]  and then now a system saying if you protest that's terrorism because there's kind of a compendium of
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:46.519]  ideas there well there's a line and that's the that's the fundamental concept i think appear it
[01:59:46.519 --> 01:59:50.840]  used to be the case that you could appear in washington and march without fear of governmental
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:56.840]  recrimination um but you what you could never do was go and become a hooligan and break into the
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.000]  building and threaten to kill somebody that has never been permitted what this administration
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.840]  appears to have done is say everybody is a hooligan and that's the frightening thing about
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:10.360]  what garrett marlin merrick garland has 700 people went in and a couple hundred attacked police you're
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:14.760]  all guilty yeah so let's ban soccer in europe because who knows what might happen if somebody
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:20.200]  gets drunk and goes to the bar uh that's just not the way it is um you know protest is as american
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:25.559]  as it is apple pie i mean we used to there used to be people burned in effigy in public squares
[02:00:25.559 --> 02:00:29.559]  in the united states if you did that now it would probably be called incitement
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.360]  when the government fears the people there is liberty when the people for the government there
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:39.480]  is tyranny i don't want to make people fear me but they're trying to make me for them well and
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:43.719]  that's what's called in from a first amendment context chill its context chilling you in the
[02:00:43.719 --> 02:00:49.400]  exercise of your first amendment rights if you become afraid to speak um then we all lose and
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:55.240]  so the the the call to patriots now is to not be cowed um and to have the courage of your convictions
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:01.080]  you know civil disobedience is often misunderstood well sometimes people disobey the law to show that
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:05.559]  the law is wrong that was the point of martin luther king's arrest and his famous letters from
[02:01:05.559 --> 02:01:10.760]  a birmingham jail is the next round of protests in washington going to be deemed uh civil
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:15.400]  disobedience are we going to have to submit to arrest because we merely went to washington with
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:22.760]  well you saw the washington post saying protesting um the the vaccine mandate is terrorism i yeah i
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:27.080]  saw that but that's illiterate i mean if for the washington for the one of the nation's premier
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:33.320]  newspapers to say a nation a newspaper i think that said as part of its advertising banner
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:38.920]  democracy dies in darkness in the bad old days of donald trump for that newspaper above it what's
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:43.960]  crazy think of the oxygen there it is yeah no democracy dies in darkness but close your eyes
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:48.280]  everybody and roll up your sleeves and get the vaccine or we'll call you a terrorist screenshot
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:54.040]  of the just as a meme and say no caption needed i mean democracy dies in darkness don't you protest
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:01.080]  that opinion is absolutely asinine and when tom cotton wanted to write something about
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:06.519]  use of the insurrection act during 2020 there was virtual palace revolt inside the new york times
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:14.280]  double standards matter people um if you can't feel free to speak your mind without recrimination
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.719]  why live here well i mean a lot of the left has become so radicalized and they're a minority now
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.799]  that they feel like oh we're fighting nazis and evil we've got to do whatever it takes to beat
[02:02:23.799 --> 02:02:27.639]  them and then we'll we'll bring the freedom back later but that's not what this is this is corporate
[02:02:27.639 --> 02:02:32.440]  behavioral psychologists getting you on board with doing bad things and they're not going to ever put
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:38.280]  it back in pandora's box i hope i hope you're wrong let's get a few more i hope you're wrong
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.400]  number two when info wars attended prior rallies in capitals and the governor's mansions in austin
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.559]  baton rouge atlanta georgia where representative vernon jones invited the crowd into the capital
[02:02:47.559 --> 02:02:52.519]  of over 500 and it was peaceful columbia south carolina richmond virginia not to mention two
[02:02:52.519 --> 02:02:57.480]  prior large rallies in washington dc there was no violence at any of these events in richmond
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:02.760]  virginia 20 000 armed protesters were outside the capital and held a completely peaceful rally
[02:03:03.719 --> 02:03:08.920]  that was attended as well none of these events were conspiracies or sedition or domestic terrorism
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.240]  and i'll just be honest i traveled so much then did so many rallies it's a little scary being in
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.160]  a crowd of a million people or 200 000 or whatever and you kind of just switch off and you just think
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:22.599]  well the police land order we're all here but january 6 was different and they were there and
[02:03:22.599 --> 02:03:27.559]  they were waiting and they provocateur bare minimum and the police were half man that day
[02:03:27.559 --> 02:03:32.280]  and then the fbi had a huge team there watching the capital they stood down and let a handful of
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:37.960]  people attack the first police i mean come on you got you send out like 15 police to try to stop a
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.160]  crowd of thousands trying to come in the capital this this was obviously bare minimum norm stand
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:49.559]  out i don't know enough i mean i'm reading into all this um to prepare for owens defense and you
[02:03:49.559 --> 02:03:54.840]  know given the events of the last week and garland's attitude in the public and the mainstream media's
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:59.559]  attempt to whip up vitriol as to you we're preparing for a bigger fight to come and i'll know
[02:03:59.559 --> 02:04:06.760]  more as time goes by i my my take on what happened on january 6th in the capital is there's a crisis
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:11.160]  of public confidence in institutions in the united states call it a crisis of legitimacy
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:16.120]  we've got red states blue states families that cut their thanksgiving and holiday dinners short
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:20.280]  and didn't talk politics because they can't bear to look at one another across a table
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:25.320]  that's wrong and if you've been and so we had an election that many people were deeply disappointed
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:31.080]  in um donald trump got a record number of votes but lost joe biden got the biggest record so here
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:34.840]  we had the one of the highest turnouts in the nation history in the nation's history more people
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.320]  voted there was a lot on the line and many people were deeply disappointed and thought the election
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:46.200]  was stolen i don't fault donald trump and his legal team of which i was not a part for pressing every
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:51.320]  lawful avenue that they had to contest the election and if part of that involved putting
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.799]  pressure on congress to ask for a 10-day hold or a 10-day freeze while irregularities were
[02:04:55.799 --> 02:05:00.840]  investigated ladies and gentlemen that's part of the democratic process and you have a right to go
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.960]  to congress and say hey hell no something's wrong here i think the election was stolen
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:09.559]  you have a right to have that opinion and democrats always did that it's crazy how
[02:05:09.559 --> 02:05:14.760]  everything they called for now they say is illegal here's another one we tried to stop the violence
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:20.840]  on january 6th it's all on camera and again i'm not setting myself up as a hero but compared to
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.280]  the fbi that was you know again i see a thousand armed ones were all secretly there i saw them as
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:29.880]  soon as they wanted to boil out as soon as the main crowd got the message from trump to leave
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:33.639]  as soon as that was happening i was already leaving i saw all these paramilitary coming in
[02:05:33.639 --> 02:05:38.280]  i said we got to get the hell out of here they clean that place up very quickly i mean they had
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:44.680]  like seven or eight state police at the georgia capital who just threw then it was a nice crowd
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:48.120]  but they still didn't want stuff to get out of hand just a few rowdy folks caused a problem
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:53.960]  those guys had such marine corps drill sergeant uh uh presence that that i mean everybody didn't
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:59.160]  even think about anything imagine if they'd have had of all those paramilitary there that day
[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:03.160]  they just showed up when 20 dudes were breaking through five cops this wouldn't have happened
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:06.760]  i'm not sure i've ever been able to tell this story on the air for you but you know right
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:10.599]  after january 6th your office called me it might have been you for all i know i was sitting in
[02:06:10.599 --> 02:06:15.639]  new haven in my office the wall street journal reported that alex was inspiring and inciting
[02:06:15.639 --> 02:06:20.040]  people to tears six that's the evening yeah my people called i don't recall the date but i and
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:24.760]  you had video to prove otherwise now i happen to know the reporter who i won't name here who was
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:28.519]  one of the people who reported this at the wall street journal and i had his number i called him
[02:06:28.519 --> 02:06:33.400]  up i said yeah what are you doing read the quote from memories like the coward jones
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:38.200]  stood on a vehicle which i was on a vehicle hundreds of yards away out of the rubber bullet
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:43.080]  and tear gas telling them to attack and so i said you know i i've got a video that says otherwise
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:47.080]  and so i sent them the video and they called and they were at least honest about it they said we
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:54.120]  were right there we thought we heard him inciting people that is the classic example of confirmation
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:59.639]  bias and the classic example of what's wrong with the mainstream media's treatment of alex jones
[02:06:59.639 --> 02:07:05.559]  alex jones is not a monster he's not a terrorist um he's asking questions that if you're listening
[02:07:05.559 --> 02:07:10.920]  to this you want answers to well he does have a potbelly though but i mean seriously and i get
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:16.040]  some of their quotes where they go why does he say usa usa you're great now leave they wouldn't
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:22.440]  listen i'm like leave leave don't go on you're gonna get killed huh i'm like usa usa let's go
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:27.559]  see trump on the other side you and the left goes he was directing him to attack the other side no
[02:07:27.559 --> 02:07:32.680]  that's where we had a well and that's where the you know the coverage in the last 24 hours becomes
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:36.840]  particularly concerning because what they're what they're what i suspect people like media matters
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:42.440]  are doing and hi guys nice to see you is trolling through everything that that that mr jones has said
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:47.480]  and looking for the incendiary rhetoric so that they can say look this reflects his true motives
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:52.840]  his actions however those were the false flag so if mr jones claims something's a false flag
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:58.040]  he's a conspiracy theorist when they say it well that's a larger truth my whole history is not being
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.120]  violent i don't think there is any history of violence now you know some have said well you
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:06.840]  know but what about that half track you wander around in um that is a dramatic prop and it catches
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:10.040]  people's attention but there have also been occasions when when you've been out in public
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:15.320]  and you've been attacked and so you know you don't shrink from expressing your point of view that
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:19.639]  doesn't mean they're planning terror attacks well you know so the crazy world crazy times here we
[02:08:19.639 --> 02:08:24.599]  go so the number four jayden x is still walking around supposedly waiting trial over a year after
[02:08:24.599 --> 02:08:29.400]  he was inside the capital and on camera clearly trying to incite the crowd pelosi defended maxine
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:34.280]  waters when waters called for protesters to be confrontational in restaurants at gas stations and
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:41.400]  malls uh and derrick chauvin is acquitted 2016 pelosi guaranteed that trump would not be president
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:46.840]  many democrats under obama deferred uh defended rioting looting and arson as nothing more than
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:52.760]  peaceful protest kamala harris supported a bail fund for bail riders who had committed
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:59.799]  looting arson and uh hacking people with hatchets she got them out of jail i'm not bailing out
[02:08:59.799 --> 02:09:06.840]  arsonist uh now attorney general garland to say the goj will come after any patriotic americans
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:12.120]  whether they were in washington on january 6th or not and whether they knowingly or unknowingly
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:16.680]  participated in what garland and the doj called conspiracy i know you already covered this but
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:21.480]  i had to watch this clip like 10 times when he said it this is unprecedented what the he didn't
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:26.280]  just put that when he reads off a teleprompter in there for no reason what does that mean that
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:32.840]  sounds like a total declaration of war it's legal behavior um here i'd ask it i'd return garland's
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:37.639]  comments with a rhetorical question why not apply that standard to the people who have routinely
[02:09:37.639 --> 02:09:42.840]  attacked the federal courthouse in portland oregon i mean there's far more violence against federal
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:49.160]  property in portland on a weekly basis than took place in washington on january 6th i get it the
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:54.920]  capital is a special shooting up the seattle ones and shooting up the border patrol i get it the
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:10:00.120]  capital the united states capital is a sacred symbol of our democracy i get it the peaceful
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.760]  transfer of power in this country is one of our distinguishing characteristics i get it if
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:11.719]  somebody tried to use violence to stop that there should be legal consequences but there is ongoing
[02:10:11.719 --> 02:10:17.960]  regular coordinated planned concerted violence in some of our cities to this day where's the
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:24.040]  doj on that and is nancy pelosi too busy pulling the gelato out of her out of her freezer to pay
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.760]  attention to what doesn't serve her i don't really want to hear about that desiccated scarecrow i
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:34.680]  want to see some federal action to protect federal property on the west coast i totally agree well
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:38.200]  and obviously that's about the collapse of civilization that's why they're doing it i'll
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:46.519]  be back tomorrow four to six p.m and sunday live and as i you and i had a breakfast this morning at
[02:10:46.519 --> 02:10:52.920]  my house and you really agree with my plan to take off up to a month it just got to be done and uh
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.120]  well i mean are you you really want me to talk about what we talked about this morning that's
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.040]  the attorney client privilege you're out we're on the air here i if you have announced that you're
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.920]  going to take off look here's my what i said to you and you've invited me to say it take care of
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:10.040]  yourself alex um you know right now you've become a lightning rod for controversy in the united
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.480]  states if you don't take care of yourself you can't take care of others many people look to you to
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:20.280]  stand at the barricades and say look what about this what about that take a little bit of time
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:25.480]  to reassess do you do your own reset because we're going to need you in the months and years to come
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.920]  absolutely well i'm going to take some time off very soon it'll be this week or the next few weeks
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:34.200]  but i've got to do it just to totally put the phone away the computer do nothing not respond
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:41.000]  to anything because i need to decide what i'm going to do uh because i mean it's so dangerous now
[02:11:41.559 --> 02:11:46.200]  everything we do and any mistake we make they're going to use to really destroy the country
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.639]  because we do have so much power and as they say in spider-man with great power comes great
[02:11:49.639 --> 02:11:54.200]  responsibility i am recognizing that and i told joe rogan this morning i'm going to give him
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:59.559]  details of it but i said i'm going to do a pivot here and i'm going to even take off some time to
[02:11:59.559 --> 02:12:03.480]  show people how i never take off when i take off a week it becomes a huge national news story like
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:08.120]  horny dogs jones i'll probably take a month off folks and it's about me getting ready me getting
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.400]  prepared but it's also about the seriousness for everybody to say this isn't about just being on tv
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:18.599]  or the radio this is dangerous times we're in folks and we all should be having a gut check
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.920]  everybody and asking ourselves what are we going to do because if they're able to trigger a civil
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.080]  war like they're saying they're going to do then it's going to be the smoke stream for the
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:32.760]  financial collapse that they are trying to cover up jesus spent some time in the wilderness before
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:39.000]  he ultimately accomplished what he was sent here to do take some time alex i won't compare myself
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.760]  to that but i i think i think all americans should i mean here's some of the headlines right here
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:47.320]  i've got a whole stack of news here norm where they were openly saying that that i mean their
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:51.000]  civil war is imminent and and they're gonna have to arrest all the trump supporters and now they're
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.080]  putting concrete barriers up behind the fence at the at the white house i mean what are they
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.080]  getting ready for well there was a time in this country where a member of the public could walk
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.760]  right into the the white house i remember reading a story about somebody wanting a job from andrew
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:09.960]  jackson and they walked in to talk to him now you can't get within a couple blocks without a passport
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:15.480]  um and in clearing armed guards um we're becoming strangers to ourselves and that's dangerous
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:20.680]  cicero once said that a republic wasn't just any collection of people it was people bound together
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:25.160]  by common conceptions of right and common interests we've lost our common conceptions
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:29.960]  of right we need to refine them we need to regroup we don't need violence we need reason
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:34.680]  and we need to come together and we need to call out the elites who are attempting to divide us for
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:40.360]  profit and say to themselves this is our country not yours absolutely all right norm pettis we're
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:46.599]  going to end this transmission with a seven eight year old clip about dehumanization and
[02:13:46.599 --> 02:13:50.760]  soylent green because now a bunch of states have passed soylent green laws where they grind up the
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:55.320]  humans and then put them into the produce and help grow crops with them and they're putting
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.440]  nanoparticles in the food we covered that two hours ago now here but it's very very important
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:05.000]  so we're going to end with that and again if i'm able to be on air tomorrow you never know these
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:12.599]  days i'll be back at 4 pm central standard time please remember resetwars.com got a big sale going
[02:14:12.599 --> 02:14:16.920]  on that it's a great two-part course we did really powerful fundamental information and it
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.559]  keeps us on air so i want to thank everybody that is supporting us at resetwars.com and separately
[02:14:22.599 --> 02:14:29.000]  i said friday or thursday that the sale of vitamin mineral fusion would end because it is selling out
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.240]  but i've been too busy to cut ads or do the new sale so we didn't get one of our other products
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:38.200]  back in that i haven't put back on sale yet but but survival shield x2 is also 50 off that's
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:46.360]  going to end in a week i will cut ads on monday and we will no longer have this sale by tuesday
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:50.200]  so i want to thank you all for your support vitamin mineral fusion and fullworkstore.com
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:54.200]  literally everything we're able to do on air despite all the censorship and the attacks
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  of the deplatforming of the debanking and the subpoenas and all of it because when the fbi
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.880]  shows up to go through your bank accounts they're like what's going on we're not going to tell you
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:08.680]  but it's a terrorism investigation you know boom you're off the air we've been able to
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:15.160]  survive that because we were already waiting for this and ready but we are in entrenched back to
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:20.200]  our final redoubt and and that's okay because we knew we'd be here in this time and it'll probably
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:25.480]  be a big wake-up call not because i take off a month on my own that's kind of me foreshadowing
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:31.000]  to everybody that hey this is the end folks uh and so i may and so i am going to take off at
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:37.880]  least three weeks very very soon uh and uh it's gonna cause a big hubbub and we intended to but
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:43.960]  it's also because i need this time to really meditate and focus and pray and decide what
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:48.840]  the best course is and uh they got human cloning going on they got human animal cloning going on
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:53.160]  they they created the bioweapon they're injecting our children with this garbage i mean this is a
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:58.360]  very very serious time and i i've got to get right you know with god everything else so i

[02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:02.039]  silent green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people but now children are literally being
[02:17:02.039 --> 02:17:07.880]  passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the uk they're being sacrificed
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:11.000]  on the altar of efficiency and prosperity
[02:17:16.119 --> 02:17:22.039]  the powdered flesh from dead babies some people believe they can cure disease because of its
[02:17:22.039 --> 02:17:29.160]  enormous popularity silent green is in short supply remember Tuesday is silent green day
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:34.440]  the supply of soil and green has been exhausted you must evacuate the area
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:43.320]  the federal court ruled that the shareholders of pepsico big builder group company are not
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:48.920]  allowed to know uh what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we already know
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:54.279]  so enjoy the flavors we're going to get the real solution which is going to be a combination of
[02:17:54.279 --> 02:18:00.760]  death panels and and sales taxes i'm consistently pro-death i'm for assisted suicide i'm for regular
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.920]  zoos and i'm for whatever gets the freeway movement is spending a million dollars on that
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:11.720]  last three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the those 10 teachers
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:17.480]  and to make that trade up in medical costs but that's called the death panel uh and you're not
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:23.720]  supposed to have that discussion they told me to uh to say that they were sorry but that you had
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:37.240]  become unreliable is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:43.800]  do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents that kind
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:49.240]  of society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:55.400]  quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:03.160]  the scoops are on their way the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:10.520]  you will find out why soil and green means life you will find out why soil and green means death
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:19.720]  we've got to stop them
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:29.880]  next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle for food you gotta tell them
[02:19:30.090 --> 02:19:39.530]  You must understand the groups in control know that we are awakening
[02:19:52.170 --> 02:19:58.650]  Their plan to create a society where everyone is controlled by a singular force or power against
[02:19:58.650 --> 02:20:04.730]  our free will in that way you're forced to follow their rules or else you're stripped of whatever
[02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:10.890]  rights you still have they want you to think that you don't matter and that's exactly what
[02:20:10.890 --> 02:20:16.170]  these sick and twisted elites with a demonic agenda want you to think but if enough people
[02:20:16.170 --> 02:20:23.530]  make the decision that they can fight back against corrupt powers in charge then without a doubt
[02:20:23.530 --> 02:20:31.450]  we can defeat these power hungry elites now the question is how do we do this
