[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  Big, big, big, broadcast lined up for you today.

[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  Red alert, ladies and gentlemen, Deep State Dems launch plan to outlaw Republican Party, arrest political opposition.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  This is what a coup looks like, we are live.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  Wednesday, July 19th, 2023.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  And we're going to have open phones yet again today to break all this down and more.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  Now remember, the Democrat Party lawyers ran all over the country in eight states, more than 10 members of Congress and filed lawsuits saying Gozer, MTG and others because they were at the Capitol on January 6.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  They were part of it.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  And so by extension, they can't run for office because they're so popular.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  That's called election meddling.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  That's called outlawing your political opposition.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  The State Department working with Lula in Brazil this year and late last year, stole the election from him and they've now had the courts there outlaw Bolsonaro running for office for eight years.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  So it's just outrageous election meddling.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  And what are they saying?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  Oh, Jack Smith's getting ready to indict Trump for questioning the election.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  They say for raising money saying the election was stolen.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  They say that's fraud.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  And they say for ordering people to attack the Capitol, which he didn't do.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  He did the opposite.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  And for getting alternate electors ready.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  Something Barack Obama did when he ran for office the second time.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Something Democrats in the New York Times bragged about.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  If you remember, even before the November election, and I remember making a big deal about this article.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  And sure enough, John Podesta, Hillary's chief advisor, was the chief advisor working with Obama for Biden.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  And we have the quotes from the actual Democrat Party war games where they said, we're not going to accept the election.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  We're going to have a new inauguration, probably in Colorado.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  And we're going to have alternate electors that we've already prepared that if Trump wins in such a big landslide,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  we're going to contest it with alternate electors.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  And they did this or tried this back with Al Gore versus George W. Bush.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  It's gone on.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  And we can play countless videos of Democratic Party.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  But we should play them again.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  Guys, go get me compilations of Democrats challenging elections, challenging electors.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  Hell, they took the electors away from in the primary.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  It's the same thing from Bernie Sanders and gave it to Hillary when Bernie won a bunch of states, including California by like 65 percent.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  They said, well, you know what?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  Hillary gets those.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  And we even talked to some of the Democrat Party electors.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  And they said, oh, we're just going to hand the votes from Bernie to Hillary.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  That's just the way it is.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  The delegates, the superdelegates.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  That's what they call basically the electors during the primary.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  So the idea that what Trump did was illegal when it didn't approach 10 percent of what the Democrats have done,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  I would argue taking the electors away, the delegates away from Sanders,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  and then having the superdelegates vote after the ballots are cast and say, well, it's really for Hillary.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  I think that should be illegal.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  But the point is Democrats went a thousand miles further than Trump.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  Nothing Trump did even approached illegality.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  And it is standard procedure.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  And so Jack Smith, again, is just that much bigger of a fraud.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  And now they've had the attorney general of Michigan, who's literally run by Soros,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  indict a bunch of Republicans for being alternate electors.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  That's banning your political opposition.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  It's been three years since we had it.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  We got it back in stock.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  The amazing 30 parts per million.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  Highest quality colloidal silver and all the great things and all the great uses.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  Back in stock.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  Limited supply.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  Infowarsstore.com 30 percent off.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  And it's a very limited supply.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  But we have it back.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  Infowarsstore.com silver bullet colloidal silver.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  Infowarslife silver bullet colloidal silver has returned.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  Silver bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  that utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  It is amazing.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  It's got thousands of reviews, five star reviews.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  Infowarsstore.com silver bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  some brain force and some brain force ultra.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  Well, just last week, Sheila Jackson Lee in Congress said,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  you don't talk bad about George Soros.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  You don't say he did anything wrong.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  It should be illegal, she implied,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  because that causes violence towards the 91-year-old master criminal
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  and his hard little demonic son.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  But if you look at the 900-plus district attorneys and county attorneys
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  that he literally controls and the 22 state attorney generals
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  and, of course, the Justice Department and his son,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  50-something times in the White House the last two and a half years,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  meeting with the national security advisors and all the rest of them,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  these people are running our local policy in most areas, our federal policy.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  Very sick.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  And you're not supposed to talk about public figures
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  famous for raiding pension funds and imploding nation's currencies.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  You're not supposed to talk about billionaires heavily involved in public policy.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  You're supposed to sit down and shut your filthy, dirty American mouth up
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  while Soros tries to finance your children's testicles being cut off
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  and having your guns taken while they defund the police,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  while they live behind barbed-wired armored fortresses with troops with machine guns.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  Well, guess what?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  Soros-backed Michigan AG targets pro-Trump alternate electors.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  Remember that last year?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  She literally used to work for him in his organization.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  And, of course, they run their little false flags there
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  with Whitmer and the fake kidnappings and all the rest of it.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  And so here is the Soros operative, the AG,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  moving to ban Trump from being on the ballot in Michigan.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  That's what this is all really about.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  The only thing constitutionally is insurrection
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  that can ban someone from running for president.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  And that is exactly what they're trying to ram through before the election.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]  In fact, how many days?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  Can we look how many days we are from November and Election Day next year?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  How many days?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  We're about 11 and 6 months.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  This won't do your math.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  We're about 17 months out.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  17 months out.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  Give me the numbers.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  And this is the countdown, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  474 days.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  In fact, let's start having a countdown every day.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  474 days.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  Our country has had a coup by multinational corporations
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  that have taken over the intelligence agencies
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  and the Justice Department,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  and they're now moving to create a one-party system like Venezuela,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  North Korea, or Communist China, or the old Soviet Union.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  So you think two-party systems are bad.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  The founders believe they're the best
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  because a parliamentary will have dozens of parties,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]  but when one clearly wins,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  the others will team up to override the people.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  So in a two-party, it's evenly divided,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  and the will of the people is more expressed.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  But the worst is a one-party.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  And the two-party is a terrible best house in a bad neighborhood.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  It's the best option of a lot of bad options.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  I agree with the founding fathers.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]  Now, you say, well, how do you replace a corrupt party?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]  One party fades and implodes, and a new party moves forward.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  I believe the Democratic Party is so evil
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  and so corrupt and so KKK-ed and just so bad in its history,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  it needs to be on its own just a chord
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  because it's so disliked and so disreputable,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  fade away, and have a new populist party
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  that can be more leftist on social issues,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  if that's what people really want.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]  Or we should have a right-wing conservative party
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  and a more libertarian populist party.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  That's really what I think the people should want
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  and what, through our voting and through culture, we should demand.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  But if you want to go parliamentary, that's better than one party.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  A lot of people are sick of two-party.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  Okay, you think parliamentary is the way to go?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  Makes a lot of sense to you.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  The globalists actually prefer it,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  even over a one-party,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  because a one-party can always turn on the globalists,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  kind of like China has turned on the New World Order.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  But they'll go with a one-party over a two-party.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  So this is America going to a one-party system.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]  You'll still have vestigial Republicans in some regions, in some areas.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  And the Democrats have said, Podesta has said,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  Carville has said, Soros has said, they want that.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  They want to abolish the Republican Party.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  They want the Republican Party to basically fade and be a regional party.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  Look that up.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  Democrats say Republicans will be a regional party.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  Democrats say the Republican Party is dying.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  That's their wish.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  There's been a beachhead of populism
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  with the Tea Party and Infowars and you
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  and then Trump and all the rest of it,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  that now everybody's on the bandwagon,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  the Joe Rogans, the Tucker Carlsons, which is great.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  And of course, people like Joe Rogan.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  As all this comes out,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  and as we get a major beachhead in the Republican Party,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  it's becoming more and more obvious
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  it's being reproved.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  It's being remodeled.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  It's being rehabbed from the inside.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  You can have an old rotting house.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  You can tear it pretty much down and rebuild it,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  or you can just burn it down and totally have a new structure.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  We're gutting the old rotting structure,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  the old beautiful lady, grand old party,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  and rebuilding it from the bottom up.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  Like Trump bought all those old beautiful buildings
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  and had them redone like the U.S. Post Office.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  He turned it into Trump Hotel, beautiful place.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  He sold it in D.C.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  Well, the Democratic Party,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  it is a rotting, termite-filled, swaying in the wind,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  stinking mass of rats and feces and pedophilia,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  and it's going to collapse regardless in the next wind,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  the next big storm blows by.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  Hell, you might blow at it and it'll fall down.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  And the whole rotting corporate zombie media,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  they have almost no viewers.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  They're already gone, folks.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]  The Democratic Party is gone.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  Now it's a globalist instrument coming out to take over
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  and shut down what's left of the republic
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  and create a system of poverty to control the population.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  So we have a whole slew of alternate electors,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  something that Kennedy did, something that Obama did,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  something that Podesta said they were going to do
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  if Hillary looked like it was losing.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  And now they have indicted them.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  Kathy Brendan, 70, no criminal record.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  I mean, all these people are just good people.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  William Hank Choate, 72,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  and it just goes through the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  Michigan residents, politically involved, good people,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  following the law, indicted.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  You ask, how could a Soros DA or Attorney General do that?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  I mean, they do whatever the hell they want.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  How could Soros judges and people similarly just tell a jury
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  I was guilty and that I had $400 million
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  and they had to give them $400 million?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  And then the judge says, shut up, you're a liar.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  I'm like, I don't have $5 million.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  Shut up, he's a liar.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  He has hundreds of millions, the judge said,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  and you will give all his money to them.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  And he peed on their graves.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  Where's the proof?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  It doesn't matter.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  Shut up or I'll have you put in jail for six months.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  And they get up and they go, yeah, we saw him.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  He zipped his pants down.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  I mean, this is the level of this.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  Anything goes with these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  Anything.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  Anything.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  And this is not the sign of a strong group.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  This is the sign of a collapsing, rotting, corrupt political dynasty.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  They had congressional hearings last week and on Friday,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  and they admitted that over $10 trillion is missing at the Pentagon.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  61% of their budget in the last two decades is unaccounted for.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  That's just one agency.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  That's trillions of dollars.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  It's a total robbery.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  Just like you read about Panama and how Manuel Noriega
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  had $500 million palaces and castles around the world,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  and he was just intended one day to just leave and go there
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  after he'd looted his country.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  They've already done that to us.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  But their rearguard action is outlawing political opposition
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  and arresting everybody and putting us in the prisons
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  that they're emptying out of violent criminals and putting us in them.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  They've said that.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  So that's where this is, and that's what they're doing,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  and it's totally illegitimate.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  It's totally insane, and it's not going to work.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  But it is going to be extremely destructive.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  So we're going to come back and go through all of this here today
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  and so many other huge issues.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  I mean, it just gets wilder and crazier.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  We're going to be opening the phones up on this subject
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  and more, InfoWars.com and on video.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  and self-defense.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  and learn how to use if you haven't,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  and I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  This is something you need now,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  and we've got it in the food department
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  InfoWarsStore.com is running a special right now
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.

[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  designed by my father, a dentist,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com that don't have fillers,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  We have the Tumor Toothpaste.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Coral Calcium Toothpaste.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  And we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]  They're very, very strong.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  Ours don't.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  So, it's now back in stock.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  It became a bestseller.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  The Tumor Toothpaste is available again at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  We're selling out of the Tooth Whitening Toothpaste.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  We've got some of that left.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  And we also have some of the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  in stock, but it's running out as well.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  of the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  The allowable level the government admits
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  into a feminized mutant.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  Look it up.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  It's rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  It is amazing.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  It's great for your home, your business.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]  and counter the globalist onslaught.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  Get yours today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  That is a huge discount.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  It's already the lowest price out there.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  You need this filter.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  for the public health service at the time.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]  and a remedy to this madness.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  Available now at infowarestore.com
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:27.430]  If the Democratic Party does not establish a permanent coup and dictatorship and high
[00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:34.150]  tech police state, complete with camps, torture chambers, the whole nine yards, they will
[00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.990]  be out of power and America will have a new renaissance and the world will have a much
[00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.910]  better chance of peace and prosperity and security into the future.
[00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.870]  Now, when I say that, that's not an exaggeration.
[00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.510]  Mainline analysts are saying that, President Trump is saying that, and that's a very good
[00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.510]  thing.
[00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.430]  It's not a good thing that we have these horrible hijackers in control, but it's a good thing
[00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:58.110]  that people can now look at it square in the eye and say, wow, this country has cancer.
[00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.850]  It's basically stage three.
[00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.830]  It's still operable, but we got to cut the damn thing out now and it's not going to
[00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.030]  be fun.
[00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.030]  It's that or die.
[00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.830]  Soros back to AG targets pro-Trump alternative electors.
[00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.830]  That was last year.
[00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.990]  I said, watch, they're going to indict him.
[00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.550]  She did it.
[00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.710]  Michigan AG must not weaponize her office.
[00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.390]  That's the Detroit news.
[00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.830]  When she got put into power by Soros, I mean, look at this woman used to work for George
[00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.470]  Soros himself directly.
[00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.470]  Look at her.
[00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.070]  It's like she's 12 years old.
[00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.510]  She's like that woman that was going to have the disinfo board that was singing Little
[00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.630]  Mermaid songs.
[00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.590]  Here is the Soros connection to attorney general supporting Mexico gun manufacturers
[00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.110]  lawsuit in the U S guess who it is.
[00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.190]  It's her working with foreign countries to get our guns when it was Obama that shipped
[00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:52.590]  the guns into Mexico left us from the rise of lawlessness across America and the one
[00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:58.710]  they're most proud of is Leticia James and this woman, Dana Nestle, how George Soros
[00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:05.110]  funded progressive illegal arsonist DAs by the U S crime surge, Newark post, Michigan
[00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:11.230]  AG must not weaponize her office, Detroit news, Michigan lawyer who led vote fraud suit
[00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:19.710]  to challenge Soros tied attorney general in 2022.
[00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:28.630]  And it goes on Dana Nestle, Michigan dim who ranted in favor of COVID mandates, hold super
[00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.150]  spreader wedding.
[00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.150]  Yep.
[00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:37.110]  That's her Michigan dim who ran it in favor of COVID mandates held the super spreader
[00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.110]  wedding.
[00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.390]  That's who this woman is rules for the, not for me.
[00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:49.110]  There she is so much fun, Dana Nestle.
[00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.590]  There she is.
[00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.990]  And here she is.
[00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:58.390]  Well, first let's play the clip from a few days ago of Sheila Jackson Lee saying you
[00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.150]  don't talk bad about Soros.
[00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.550]  He bankrupts governments.
[00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.590]  He collaborated for Hitler.
[00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.830]  He funds open borders.
[00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.910]  He funds having your children's genitals cut off.
[00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:08.950]  He funds all of it.
[00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.790]  He funds the human smuggling.
[00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.310]  He funds putting in attorney generals and County attorneys to run your life.
[00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.870]  District attorneys, he defunds the police that you get murdered or your wife gets raped or
[00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.430]  your business gets robbed.
[00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:27.550]  Hey, don't you talk about a public figure literally involved in all policy and attacking you.
[00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.830]  He's a wonderful man.
[00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.830]  Here it is.
[00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.310]  Let me ask you this.
[00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.590]  First of all, we have a accusatory commentary of Soros.
[00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:42.590]  The A's let us not put an individual that is not here, a contributing American and jeopardize
[00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:47.350]  his life for always throwing his name out in the most ugliest way.
[00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.670]  I am offended by that as a source does not deserve that.
[00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:56.470]  He is an American and a patriot, and he also comes from a minority community.
[00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.270]  One might say, and you create a dangerous situation.
[00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.070]  One might say a dangerous situation.
[00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.070]  My goodness.
[00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.070]  That's right.
[00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.430]  He's Jewish, so we can't talk about him.
[00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.110]  But half the Democratic Party can say Israel shouldn't even exist.
[00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.150]  And then the ADL fawns over it.
[00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.670]  Oh, thank you for saying we shouldn't even exist.
[00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.830]  But Alex Jones is bad.
[00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.350]  We'll shut him up immediately.
[00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.550]  A bunch of baby Hitlers, in my view.
[00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.590]  So let's continue here.
[00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.790]  Here she is, not supposed to talk about it.
[00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.310]  By the way, look at her bio.
[00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.550]  She worked at the Soros Foundation.
[00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.590]  And she worked for the Democratic Party in censoring people.
[00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.590]  I mean, go read her pedigree.
[00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.470]  It was like Fiona Hill was on 60 Minutes.
[00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.750]  She goes, Leslie Stahl is talking to her.
[00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.910]  She goes, what did Alex Jones do to you?
[00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.030]  She goes, he was mean to me, and he said I worked for Soros and that I'm a globalist.
[00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.110]  I don't even know what a globalist is.
[00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.470]  She ran the newspaper and still does, called theglobalist.com.
[00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:04.030]  Again, it's like saying Hitler doesn't know what a Nazi is, or Jaws doesn't know what
[00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:09.150]  a great white shark is, or Tom Brady doesn't know what an NFL quarterback is, or Lex Luthor
[00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.230]  doesn't have a shaved head.
[00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.510]  I mean, it just is unbelievable.
[00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.950]  Like two men can have a baby.
[00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.270]  What a cult of whackazoids.
[00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.750]  That's a new word, whackazoids.
[00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.630]  They are some whacked out lunatics.
[00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.630]  Look at that whackazoid.
[00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.830]  Oh, but she's a woman, so she's allowed to be a tyrant.
[00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.830]  She's allowed.
[00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.070]  And again, saying it's illegal to create alternate electors.
[00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.790]  They're going to have kangaroo juries in key jurisdictions they've chose.
[00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.030]  They'll never let the jury know that RFK did this, or JFK did this.
[00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.190]  They'll never let them know that Obama had alternate electors.
[00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.590]  They'll never know it's standard.
[00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.350]  They'll never allow them to see any of the clips in Congress just a few years ago, Democrats
[00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.670]  saying they have alternate electors.
[00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.750]  If Trump won, Podesta, I'm going to show you all that coming up next segment.
[00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:01.590]  No, they'll just have a totally controlled judge, totally controlled info, and again,
[00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:07.470]  they could send a newborn baby to the gas chamber or lethal injection if it's a woman
[00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:14.790]  telling Democrats they will do anything they're told.
[00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.430]  In my civil cases, Alex Jones is a liar.
[00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.470]  Alex Jones has $400 million.
[00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.390]  Alex Jones peed on people's graves.
[00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.390]  None of it's true.
[00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.390]  Take his money.
[00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.270]  And then the joke is, I don't have any of that money.
[00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.270]  So I'm like, okay.
[00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.270]  I wonder why I was laughing.
[00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.030]  And they said, 1.5 billion is not enough, your honor.
[00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.030]  He'll make that back easily in a few days.
[00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.310]  Yes, yes.
[00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:43.270]  We want 2.75 trillion, the GDP of India.
[00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.710]  I was telling my co-writer, Kent Heckenloy, that we're finishing up the book.
[00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.350]  The other day, we're almost done.
[00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.190]  We were working on it all weekend here in person, finishing up, going over, fact-checking
[00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.190]  everything.
[00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.430]  And I added a whole bunch of stuff I'd written and things, clips I want put together.
[00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.990]  And I go, yeah, and you got to put it in there if you're going to write about that.
[00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.270]  They wanted 2.75 trillion.
[00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.270]  And Kent's a lawyer.
[00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.950]  And he goes, come on, Alex, I know everything you've told me is going to end up being true,
[00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:08.950]  but that's not true.
[00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.470]  And I said, no, Kent, it's true.
[00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.470]  He said, really?
[00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.470]  He types in, he's Bloomberg.
[00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.470]  And he goes, excuse...
[00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.230]  He was like, that's the GDP of a major?
[00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.070]  Yeah, the GDP of India, Kent.
[00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.990]  And it's like when I told him, I said, you know, it's worse with Epstein at the Zorro
[00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.990]  Ranch.
[00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.750]  They were growing kids to then suck their stem cells.
[00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.230]  And he's like, yeah, I found some of that.
[00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.070]  And I go, yeah, Peter Nygaard had it done with his own kids.
[00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.070]  He goes, really?
[00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.070]  I go, yeah.
[00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.590]  He goes, I did find an article, even the New York Times admitted his girlfriend claimed.
[00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.550]  I said, no, you don't need to claim.
[00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.350]  Let me show you a bunch of videos with him bragging he loves to suck his own children
[00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:50.830]  dry and then has them injected into his veins, their blood, and their stem cells, including
[00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.790]  their umbilical cord and their spine.
[00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.750]  They rip the baby's spine out and drain it, inject it in him.
[00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:03.230]  And he went and saw the video and his eyes were like this, yeah, man, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.230]  These people are out of their minds because they've got the power, they're in the position
[00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:09.630]  of power, and they've gone...
[00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.350]  You wonder why Caligula married his horse, the Roman emperor.
[00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.950]  Nero burned down half of Rome because he wanted to expand his palace.
[00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:22.710]  And later, as men, evidence is overwhelming, he didn't commit suicide, they killed him.
[00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.110]  But you ask, why would you marry your horse and fire the Senate?
[00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:33.150]  As an insult, I'm going to fire the Senate, make my horse regent, deputy king, emperor,
[00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:40.870]  and I'm going to have sex with it inside the Senate building, and that's the way it is.
[00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.110]  And you're like, wow, that's crazy.
[00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.230]  Like two men having a baby?
[00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.270]  Like cutting little girls' forearms off and creating giant fake rotting penises and attaching
[00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.389]  them to them with PVC pipe as a urethra?
[00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:55.070]  Kind of crazy like that?
[00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.630]  Caligula was nothing compared to these people, we'll be right back.
[00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:06.070]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:10.990]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view, if you don't
[00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.350]  get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.750]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.750]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't, and I'm
[00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.310]  preaching the choir on that.
[00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.230]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.230]  filtration.
[00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.350]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the
[00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.430]  high-quality water filtration department.
[00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.710]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find
[00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.270]  and still get quality.

[00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:31.830]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:36.910]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.630]  inductive to pain.
[00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.910]  There's major research behind this all.

[00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.150]  the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's
[00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.350]  the same formula.
[00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.350]  It boosts men.
[00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.350]  It boosts women.
[00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:36.710]  It works great, but women like pink labels, men like different color labels, so it works
[00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:37.830]  for men as well.
[00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.910]  It's the same formula.
[00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.470]  It's an incredible formula and it funds our operation, and here's another important part

[00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:58.470]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 and the answer for energy is BrainForce.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:30.320]  Why would lawyers ask for $2.75 trillion from somebody that didn't have $2 million in the
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.560]  bank at the time and now has basically nothing?
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.120]  Why would the government fire professors all over the country that say two men can't have
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.159]  a baby and that X and Y chromosomes exist?
[00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:49.200]  Because they're waging war against logic and common sense and that's the nature of power.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.639]  When it gets out of control, nothing makes people go more insane than more power and
[00:33:56.639 --> 00:34:00.120]  then more power makes them go more insane.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.679]  What's the famous saying by Lord Acton?
[00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:12.000]  Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.600]  The quote is misquoted all the time, but that was him in parliament hundreds of years ago.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.360]  You can pull up the actual quote.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:28.480]  He said, power tends to corrupt, but absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.799]  And because the Justice Department and the local controlled courts and the universities
[00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:37.160]  and the banks and the media, they all feel invincible and they're just like, two men
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]  can have a baby.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.840]  We're going to chop children's genitals off.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.520]  We're going to put fake penises on little girls that have chopped up meat off their
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:48.279]  body that doesn't even work and rots off and we're going to ship in children in child traffic
[00:34:48.279 --> 00:34:53.080]  and we're going to ban movies that criticize it and we're going to start war with Russia
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:35:00.840]  and we're going to do, because no one is stopping them.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.400]  And the big powerful central banks were very smart.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:08.200]  They taught liberation theology and leftist wokeism, chip on your shoulder the last hundred
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.040]  years in this country really by increment.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.360]  And so if you look at almost everyone that is commanding the heights of tyranny, it's
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.860]  quote minorities and women.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:24.819]  But behind him is always old white men, technocrats controlling him, two a man, has a few Asians,
[00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:33.180]  but they're German, they're French, they're Jewish, they're Italian, they're British.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.779]  Some are Protestants, some are Catholics, some are Jews, but they're all old white men.
[00:35:37.779 --> 00:35:44.960]  But their front people are Sadiq Khan in London and Governor Whitmer in Michigan and the anomalies
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:51.240]  are people like American psycho Gavin Newsom.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.680]  But he's just too psychotic and evil.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.240]  They're like, well, he's a white guy, but he's just too evil.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.240]  We've got to have him out front.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.720]  So that's what's crazy.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.160]  And you've got these women with chips on their shoulders.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.440]  I'm going to send everybody to prison.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.000]  That shows them how powerful I am.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.680]  These judges, I'll lie and corrupt and do whatever I want because I deserve to.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.000]  I'm going to show everybody how powerful I am.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.480]  So this is a very, very serious situation.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.000]  And obviously last night they raided a bunch of Trump lawyers.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.520]  That's a bridge too far.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.480]  And then again, and took their phones from January 6 and they're getting ready to indict
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:34.720]  the president for fundraising saying the election was stolen, which is his right to do whether
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]  he's right or wrong.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720]  And of course he was right.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.720]  My goodness.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.000]  So out in the open, by the state department's own standards, the U.S. elections are some
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.880]  of the most shoddy ones held in the world.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.360]  We send the state department around the world to police everybody else's elections, but man,
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.440]  you don't police them here.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.880]  You don't ask questions here.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:02.240]  And it's not ties between Alvin Bragg and Dana Nessel and Whitmer and Soros.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:10.560]  Nessel and Bragg go to the special schools that you have once you have law degrees that
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.360]  Soros puts on where you go stay for a month at a lavish facility at a five-star hotel
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.160]  and go to conferences every day and get taught how to run the scams, how to control people.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.560]  And you got the Dabos group.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.640]  I mean, look at Newsom.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.440]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:38.040]  So this is organized crime.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.640]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:47.720]  You can play games with it if you want, but this is organized evil that's super confident
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.759]  and that thinks it's going to eat our lunch completely.
[00:37:51.759 --> 00:37:53.920]  And so you're living in a coup.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.880]  You are the victims.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:01.000]  You are the veterans of a biological weapon attack and then a biological and chemical weapon
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.520]  attack through the shots.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.920]  You're the victims of Pentagon illegal psyops they wouldn't even use against the Afghans
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:12.360]  that came out in the news two years ago, scientific weaponized propaganda, mind control.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360]  That's even mainstream news.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360]  They admit that.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.920]  They're proud of it.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.279]  You are veterans of a fentanyl war with the government helping ship it in.
[00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:24.880]  You are veterans of living in a country that's now an open slave market of men, women and
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.440]  children, particularly children and women kidnapped and shipped into the country.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.560]  We are all living in the end of America.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.720]  America is already a collapse burning wreck.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.720]  Sure.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.720]  Your house still gets electricity.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.560]  You can still get food at the grocery store, but you ever notice you drive around, you
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.200]  don't see the police anywhere, especially if you're in a woke city and you notice homeless
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.759]  everywhere and crime everywhere.
[00:38:47.759 --> 00:38:52.160]  We're being positioned for the final blow.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.000]  And I just want people to know who did it, why they did it, and to understand that a
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.680]  lot of you won't listen now, but as things get worse and worse and worse and worse and
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:14.060]  worse and worse and worse, and as these plastic rubber face psychos continue their attacks
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.680]  against us, you will come to a point where you're forced to admit you were conned, you
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.240]  were wrong and they're lying to you and they're out to get you.
[00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:27.560]  And I am still reaching out to the prodigal sons out there who are still under the enemy's
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.440]  control to realize you're not part of the power structure.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.560]  Please put Newsome and Hillary back up.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.520]  If you have the Holy Spirit or any discernment, you would look at those two fake people and
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.960]  you would run.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.840]  Those are predators.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.240]  Those are fake people.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.240]  Those are demons.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.880]  Those are monsters.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.520]  When you know, you know, you look at Brian Stelter, you look at Naval Noah Harari.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.840]  You look at Klaus Schwab.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.840]  You look at Bill Gates.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.440]  You see that rubber look because that's an avatar, folks.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.600]  That's not human.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.160]  I don't mean they got rubber faces and there's a space alien under there.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.600]  I'm saying their spirit is Satan.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.800]  They are possessed by an anti-human energy that has one mission, destroy you and your
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.960]  family.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.920]  So you heard Sheila Jackson Lee.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:22.200]  We're not supposed to talk about public person, public figure, George Soros.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:29.560]  We're supposed to just bow to him and let him defund the police and attack us and everything
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.840]  else.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.400]  And so let's go ahead and play a clip of her and her indictment of alternate electors and
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400]  we'll go to break.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:44.360]  I'm going to come back and show you Obama did it.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.600]  Hillary tried it.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.120]  It happened over and over again.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.520]  Biden had them ready.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.120]  If Trump had won, they couldn't steal it.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.800]  And I'm going to show you where they said it in the New York Times, their own documents.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.360]  Just remember that they're indicting people for something that's completely legal and
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.960]  that they themselves did.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.000]  That's how much control they think they have over the juries.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]  Here's the clip.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:12.040]  As part of the orchestrated plan, we allege that 16 Michigan residents met covertly in
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:18.040]  the basement of Michigan GOP headquarters and knowingly and of their own volition sign
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:25.759]  their names to multiple certificates stating that they were the duly elected and qualified
[00:41:25.759 --> 00:41:32.040]  electors for president and vice president of the United States of America for the state
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.200]  of Michigan.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.960]  That was a lie.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.680]  They weren't the duly elected and qualified electors and each of the defendants knew it.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.520]  They carried out these actions with the hope and belief that the electoral votes of Michigan's
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:52.400]  2020 election would be awarded to the candidate of their choosing instead of the candidate
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.120]  that Michigan voters actually chose.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.279]  No, that's not how it works.
[00:41:58.279 --> 00:41:59.920]  There's going to be a contested election.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:05.359]  You've got to get your electors signed up and ready to go so that they're ready to go
[00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:08.200]  in at the state house and vote.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.560]  And that's why Kennedy did it.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.840]  That's why Obama did it in Hawaii.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.440]  And I've got all the documents and everything when we come back, we'll show you that.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:22.520]  But again, she knows that 80% of Americans will fail a civics test.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:27.160]  And so she's up there acting like it's the Republicans trying to steal the election.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:32.000]  The Democrats are trying to outlaw questioning elections.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.960]  They're trying to block Trump being able to run by indicting him and then sitting around
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:41.040]  indicting people for trying to stand up against that.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.000]  But they'll fail like all other tyrants in history, they will fail and they will be brought
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]  to justice.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.760]  Some of us are going to have to hit the barbed wire to get this done.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.000]  That's why I'm really thankful that all of you spread the word about the broadcast because
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]  you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]  Stay with us.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.800]  It's been three years since we had it.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.560]  We got it back in stock.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.800]  The amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal silver and all the great
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.880]  things and all the great uses back in stock.

[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.840]  It is amazing.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:51.080]  It's got thousands of reviews, five star reviews, Infowarsstore.com silver bullet returns to
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.080]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:58.120]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.120]  and some brain force.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:05.279]  Ultra hydrofluorosilic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:44:05.279 --> 00:44:08.000]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.480]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480]  Period.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480]  Case closed.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.760]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.720]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.000]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.359]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:44:26.359 --> 00:44:31.560]  that sells for twice the price and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.240]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240]  two or three times.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.120]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.520]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.520]  competitor.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:49.760]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.520]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.080]  It's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.560]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.080]  The point is you get the filters at Infowarshore.com.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.080]  They're discounted right now.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.080]  Finally back in stock.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.160]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.120]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.120]  It is.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.600]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.960]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.840]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.040]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.520]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.240]  Krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.240]  And I'm sorry.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.240]  You want something like this?
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.240]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.240]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.240]  It's so good.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.240]  In my view.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.319]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:45:33.319 --> 00:45:36.080]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.600]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:47.080]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.520]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know, as I just obsess, because whatever
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.920]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]  I just can't do it.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:04.520]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars Store and Infowars Life not at a probiotic
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.520]  for more than three years?
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.920]  And the answer is simple.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.840]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.319]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:18.200]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.760]  Jones anymore.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:25.680]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:07.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:25.730]  Coming up next hour, NASA and NOAA, the federal agencies that watch the weather, say the sun
[00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:31.490]  is going into a very hot period right now, and blasting the earth with giant coronal
[00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:37.250]  mass ejections, and that's why the earth is hot right now.
[00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:43.770]  Yes, it's the sun. I know that's shocking to a lot of leftists out there. The sun
[00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:50.810]  drives about 95% of the temperature on the planet. If there wasn't a sun, it
[00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:57.850]  drives about 99.999%. Again, the sun goes into our atmosphere, then the
[00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:01.890]  atmosphere contains some of the heat, but if you remove that atmosphere, you remove
[00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:10.450]  the sun, we would be beyond absolute zero, or at absolute zero. Okay, I want
[00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.010]  to open the phones up again today on the subject of the coup that America is
[00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:20.010]  under, and the fact that this illegal, bureaucratic, intelligence agency, corporate
[00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:24.210]  coup is getting more intense, and is now trying to outlaw its opposition because
[00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:30.010]  we're using what's left the Republican Party as a beachhead to try to retake
[00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:35.050]  the country peacefully from them. How do you respond to a tyranny like this? How
[00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:39.450]  do you get the general public out of their stupor? Well, the public's starting
[00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:43.810]  to come out of their stupor, and three US senators who are Republicans, in name
[00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:49.530]  only, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski and others, have said they're getting ready
[00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:54.890]  to switch to Democrat because the Republican constituents are bad people.
[00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:59.690]  They've always been Democrats. They vote Democrat, but I told you they're getting
[00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:04.890]  ready to outlaw the Republican Party, basically, where it'll be in a few
[00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:11.170]  regions, and here and there, and like a vestigial ceremonial opposition. We're
[00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:17.010]  going to a one-party system. Do you disagree with me? Do you agree with me? If
[00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:20.050]  you disagree, by the way, we don't screen your calls other than the fact we want a
[00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:26.010]  clean phone line, and you have your topic ready to talk about it. So if you
[00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.130]  disagree with me that they're trying to outlaw political opposition, which they're
[00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.290]  doing, and think everything's wonderful, maybe you like the shots, maybe you got
[00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:37.570]  ten boasters, thought it was wonderful, maybe you love open borders and human
[00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:41.290]  trafficking, I want to hear from you as well. Maybe you think Trump needs to be
[00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:46.290]  locked up in jail, that's gonna be a great thing. Whether you agree or disagree, I
[00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:51.370]  want to get your take on this constitutional crisis, 877, the number is
[00:49:51.370 --> 00:50:03.730]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex. And we're gonna take a lot of your calls
[00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:11.370]  the 2nd, 3rd, in to the 4th hour today. I've already spent most of the hour,
[00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:16.770]  five-tenths of the hour, on this disgrace that's happening, and this whole
[00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:22.050]  concerted effort, and I expect to see indictments at the state level out of
[00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:27.490]  Georgia very soon, I expect to see indictments out of Arizona very soon,
[00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:31.930]  indictments out of Pennsylvania, they're just gonna indict, and indict, and indict,
[00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:37.690]  and indict, and indict, and indict, and indict, and indict. Because that's all they
[00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.850]  know how to do, and it won't matter if Trump goes up to 90% in polls with
[00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:47.530]  Republicans, and 40 points ahead of Biden. Because they're outlawing free elections,
[00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.250]  they're getting ready to steal the next one, and they're letting you know, if you
[00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:55.970]  challenge us when we steal an election, we're gonna lock your ass up. You know,
[00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.730]  they had elections when Stalin was dictator of Russia, he said, I don't care
[00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.770]  who casts, I don't care who counts them, and you can cast votes all day long, but if
[00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:09.570]  you spoke out and said Stalin stole the election, you went for five years the
[00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.770]  first time to a forced labor camp, and they let you vote because they wanted to
[00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:18.530]  see how you voted, so most people didn't like Stalin, but they went in there, and
[00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:21.930]  or Lenin, they went in there and voted for him, because they didn't want to get
[00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:27.610]  sent to a forced labor camp, or worse.
[00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:33.370]  So we know how this story goes, it's been happening in hundreds of other
[00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:38.090]  countries, and now we got it. You always hear about grandma getting cancer, your
[00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:43.250]  dad, or your cousin, and then one day you get this big swelling in your throat, or
[00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:48.210]  wherever it is, you go there, yeah, you got esophageal cancer, and it's like, you
[00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.970]  know, I'm just telling you, we got tumors all over us, it's like, that's who we are
[00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:56.170]  now, and we have to admit we have cancer, we have to admit as a culture, we're
[00:51:56.170 --> 00:52:00.130]  pretty sick. Oh man, wait till you get to the pedo stack, I covered it some
[00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:05.650]  yesterday, Bloomberg, Rolling Stone, you name it, defending pedophilia, and attacking
[00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:09.810]  sound of freedom, and now they're censoring sound of freedom everywhere.
[00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:14.850]  YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, you name it, they're censoring the actor, the
[00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:22.010]  director, Tim Ballard, the hero, and that shows you, the film's good, the
[00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:27.170]  film's real, Disney blocked it being released for five years, and then it gets
[00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.170]  the other opposition, because anytime somebody fights the new world order, oh, it's
[00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:34.530]  got to be corrupt, it's got to be bad, it's got all the other opposition out
[00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:39.130]  there, but let me tell you, the left's pissed about this movie, they're super
[00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:45.730]  upset, and people get upset because Carlos Slim has been involved trying to
[00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:49.170]  save kidnapped kids, I don't know why Carlos Slim's involved in that, but the
[00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.810]  kids are being kidnapped, we have a responsibility to expose it, and so the
[00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:57.050]  film is doing a lot of good, raising awareness to that, so it's being attacked
[00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:01.010]  by pedo promoters, pedo apologists, I'm going to show you next hour, and it's
[00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:06.970]  being attacked by the holier-than-thou Liberty Movement, and look, I'm not
[00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:11.290]  saying we shouldn't investigate and look at all the groups, but at the end of the
[00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:15.490]  day, the film is a good film, the film's a true film, the film deserves to be seen,
[00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:20.370]  and the system's pissed, folks, it's been seen, it's made over a hundred million
[00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:24.170]  dollars, it's not about how much money it makes, but that's an example of winning,
[00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:31.050]  more than all the movies out this summer, the only other film in ten years that
[00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:34.410]  made more money its second week than its first week, and they're scared it's about
[00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.970]  to smash that week in the third week, and do something nobody's done in decades,
[00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:42.690]  setting the precedent that not only is Hollywood dead, but Christian films, and
[00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:47.370]  patriotic films, and films that attack tyranny are wildly successful, and then no
[00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:53.330]  matter what the dead Hollywood system does, a new system of media and culture
[00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.530]  will be born, and if we do that, we've recaptured America intellectually right
[00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:02.210]  there, so this is a major beachhead, that's why if Infowars should stay on
[00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:07.650]  air, and if Tucker Carlson can get back on air, and if we can get the Tulsi
[00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.930]  Gabbards, and the R.O.K. juniors, and the Joe Rogans to be on our side, we've won,
[00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:16.410]  and the Elon Musk, maybe they'll turn on us at some key point, but no,
[00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.650]  they're not jumping to our side because they got paid off to do it, they're
[00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:24.130]  jumping to our side because they can see the new old orders going down, we got to
[00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:29.490]  get ready to win, and lead, and build a new future, and that's why Infowars is
[00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.530]  so critical, I'm so thankful to all of you over the years, that spread the word
[00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.570]  about the broadcast, that pray for the broadcast, and that bought product, and
[00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.850]  let me give you this quick note, we'll start the next hour, get to all the other
[00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:46.330]  big subjects, and your phone calls, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539,
[00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:51.930]  we're talking about one big subject, the coup over America, expanding, outlawing
[00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:58.690]  their political opposition, we're gonna break it all down, all right, so we've

[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000]  you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]  This is something you need now.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.

[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:27.000]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.000]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000]  All right, we love you.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]  Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:57.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  German banking economist Richard Werner was selected as a global leader for tomorrow by the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2003.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Here, he tells us an insider's view of what to soon expect and says the only way to survive the Great Reset is for us to immediately begin setting up our own banking system.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  In each domicile, they should be locally set up and authorized by the local regulators, and it's a profitable investment.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Banking is profitable.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  So the investors would get a return while the local community would get a return, and it's a way of delaying, perhaps even preventing, the introduction of CBDCs.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  They have literally delayed their agenda because I think it's so important to them.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  They've been very careful about the timing, and they've, oh, let's wait a little longer.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Let's wait a little longer.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Let's have this crisis first.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Oh, let's have COVID first, soften them up.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  But they've delayed because the technology was already ready around 2015 to roll out.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  And what people don't mention is what do these CBDCs actually look like?
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  At the moment, there's a bit of talk about this being phone-based apps, and yes, that is the initial phase.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  But what was already ready around 2015 is the ultimate goal, what they really want.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Apparently, I was told by a central banker, is CBDCs looks like a small grain of rice that they want to put under your skin, which is, in my view, a violation of human dignity.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  And they realize there is a hurdle.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  So to get people to accept this, there will be, you know, why suddenly are the billionaires saying let's have universal basic income?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Because the story is going to be, oh, now we've created this vast unemployment and disruption and crises.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Well, we need universal basic income.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  You will get 2,000 euros into your account every month.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  But, of course, to run this efficiently, we need to use the latest technology.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  So, you know, you need a CBDC chip implant.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  But how many people will say, okay, fine, 2,000 pounds, 2,000 euros, you know?
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  A surprising proportion, shockingly, obviously, to me or yourself.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  But we've seen years ago in Sweden there has been a substantial small minority take-up of what's currently much larger.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  It's kind of like a little cylinder in stainless steel, I guess, maybe titanium or something.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  And they are doing it because they just want to.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  They want to be early adopters of this nonsense.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  So if anyone's listening and that sounds fanciful or conspiracy theorist, the fact is in Sweden they are taking it up and in other places.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And that's not coming out of nowhere.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  The Bank for International Settlements recently published a report called Blueprint for the Future Monetary System, Improving the Old, Enabling the New.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  This report proposes that a central bank digital currency will serve as the new reserve currency and calls for the digital confiscation of all physical property by assigning every real-world item its own unique digital token,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  which will contain rules on how each item can and cannot be used so that each person can be controlled and conditioned directly by the central bank.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  All right, callers, I'm loaded for bear.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  I know you are as well.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  We're going to go to break for 60 seconds.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Join us at the station.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  I'm going to write to you.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  We've got a ton of news.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  It's been three years since we had it.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  We got it back in stock.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  The amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal silver and all the great things and all the great uses.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  Back in stock, limited supply.

[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, silver bullet, colloidal silver.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  InfoWarsLife, silver bullet, colloidal silver has returned.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  Silver bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  that utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  It is amazing.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  It's got thousands of reviews, five-star reviews.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, silver bullet returns to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  You know, I was never a good bull rider.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  I never really got involved in rodeo.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  But I was around it some, and I knew people that were so into it,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  they had, like, rodeo pens at their houses.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  So, like, if the daughter rode barrel racing, they'd have a barrel racing thing set up.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Or if the son did calf rubbing, they'd have that.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  Or if they had bull riding, they'd have that at the house.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  And I had a lot of friends in East Texas and places,
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  and I worked down there quite a few summers at one time for a whole year
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  when I was kicked out of high school for fighting, working for large animal vets.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  So I got to see a lot of it.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  And only twice did I go over to a friend's house,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  and they said, Hey, we're about to do some calf roping,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  and we're going to go ahead and ride a couple of bulls here today.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  And these aren't that mean, but would you like to do it?
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  These are bulls we ride all the time, and they're kind of halfway broken a little bit.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  And I did it once and totally got racked, as they say, your testicles crushed,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  and said, No, thank you.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  Got talked into it again, and I said, You know what?
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  This is not for me.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  But I tell you, people do it because of the excitement of getting in there
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  with a wild animal that's in your archetypal instincts to take down elephants,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  take down bison, you name it, with a spear.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  And so when you do it, it's like hunting.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  It's not that you want to kill animals.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  It's that you're feeling something extremely intense and instinctive
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  that's like deep down in you.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  Now, I'm not going to risk my life to play football and get run over and hurt
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  just to play a game.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  And I did pretty good at football for my size.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  I was a freshman, and they said, Now you're on varsity,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  and you're going to play with these guys.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  And I got run over a bunch.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  I said, You know what?
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  I quit.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  This is not fun.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  I don't care about this.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  Nothing against football.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  It's not that I was a wimp.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  I'm not going to get hurt for that game.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Sorry.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  You guys go do it.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  You go kill yourselves.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  I respect you.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  I'm not doing it.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And I'm not going to break my back and my arm and everything else
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  for riding bulls, though I get the adrenaline.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  But I will get hurt to fight tyrants and pedophiles.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  I'll get killed, put in prison, anything it takes.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  But I do it because it's the right thing to do,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  and I don't like these people.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  And the innocents deserve to be defended.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  That's the number one reason that God's watching.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  That's the most important point.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  The children are number one,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  and the fact that God's watching even overrides that.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  But there is an excitement to this, though.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  Taking on psychotic globalists, which you're all doing,
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  if you're even listening to this show, you're showing interest in that.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  That's the first big step.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  And then when you know they're really going to try to put this super popular
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  American who's done nothing wrong in prison,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  this isn't some movie where, like the Green Mile,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  where they kill the innocent black guy.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  That's a movie.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  That's a Stephen King novel.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  This is real, folks.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  This isn't fiction, and they love to confuse in our minds
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  so many incredible events in fiction.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  They hang their hat on that, that when real stuff's going down
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  and really evil things are happening,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  that people can't differentiate between what's fiction and what's reality.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  So I don't know how anybody says they're living in a boring time.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  I don't know how anybody could sit back and say,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  man, I just feel totally depressed.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  There's nothing exciting to do.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  You can walk outside and look into the universe at night and the planets.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  You can see beautiful trees, thunderstorms.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  You can go people watch, and you can read literature,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  and listen to great music, and you can paint,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  and you can explore the universe, and you can think,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  and you can worship God, and you can sing,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  and there's so many cool animals and creatures and things.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  I went over to have breakfast with my dad earlier this morning
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  after I went for a hike, and we never go get breakfast anymore.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  We used to a long time ago.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  We went out in the yard, and this French bulldog is running around the woods.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  My dad lives on four acres.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  He got decades ago right in the middle of Austin.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  It's a great place.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  It's like a nature preserve.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  And I hear this, and I'm like, what is that?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  My dad walks in and he goes, that's the fox that the dog, Tina,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  has cornered over there, and she's got babies.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  And I go over there, and I see the fox looking out of the hole,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  and it's wild.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  The bulldog's got this red fox cornered, and it's got babies,
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  and it's just like what an incredible planet.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  What an amazing place.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  And then back in the woods where my dad's house is a 150-year-old blacksmith thing.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  My dad bought that house in like 1992 for nothing in the middle of Austin.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  It had an old orchard on it and a shack and a blacksmith thing.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  So this old grandpa died like 102, and his grandson had gotten it
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  and sold it to my dad.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  And it's just an amazing little piece of property.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  It's four acres, and he built a little house on it that's three stories tall
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  because it's a little house.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  My dad didn't want to cut anything down, so he has this little three-story house.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  When I say little, it's little, but it's three stories.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  It's still got the blacksmith thing back there in the corner and all of it.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And it's just like that's just four acres of this planet,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  and it's a French bulldog chasing a fox around.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  And it's just amazing.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And it was hot outside, so the French bulldog's tongue was just giant
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  and all looking like a wild clown.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Let me show you a photo of this dog.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  I'll do that.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  But, I mean, it's just a magic planet, man.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  And we've got to remember – here, overhead shot, please.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  This is once we got back in the house.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  This is such a magic planet, and there's just so many amazing things.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  Look at that creature.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  That's Tina.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  What a ridiculous name for a dog.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Look at that.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  I mean, just that alone, like you're born, and you wake up on a planet in space,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  and things like this are running around chasing a red fox.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  And it just gets cooler and cooler and more awesome from that point on.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  There's even audio of the dog.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  You don't know what to do with it.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Look at that.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  Oh, my God, what a ridiculous animal.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  I mean, look at it.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  It's a magic creature.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  I just want to go do that, man.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  I mean, I just – all right, all right.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  I said I'd take your calls.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  I said I'd cover the news.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Why did I go off into bull riding and French bulldogs and all the rest of it?
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Let's skip this break so we get to more of the callers.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  Let me do this.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Let me just settle down for a minute.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  Things are already busy at 7 o'clock in the morning over there.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Now, I would rather be sitting around a fishing hole somewhere with that dog,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  but I'm not going to be doing that.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  I'm not fighting the globalists because they are literally the most evil,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  out-of-control people the planet's ever seen,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  and they must be defeated, ladies and gentlemen, because believe me,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  they're not going to give you any place to hide, any place to run.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  They want full power and control over everything.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  They are the worst of the worst of the worst,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  and it has been us being naive about the way the world works,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  laying down to them that has allowed the situation to get like this,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  and we cannot allow it to happen.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  I know I'm stating very simple things.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up after your calls.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  We'll go to John, James, Mike, Hammer, Aaron, Rich, Eben, John, Curtis,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Donald, Jim.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  We'll go to all of you in just a minute, actually,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  because I'm not going to break, actually.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  So let's talk about this.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  Recapping for stations that joined us, the Soros protégé, Dana Nessel,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  in Michigan, one of 22 Democrat attorney generals he controls
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  that are going to indict everything they can, including the kitchen sink,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  has indicted 16 innocent Republicans that met at the Statehouse,
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  believing that was a normal thing to do, at the Republican headquarters,
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  and created alternate electors, which is something RFK's brother, JFK,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  did, something that Obama did, and I've got all the articles,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  and something Podesta said they were going to do if Trump's landslide
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  was so big they couldn't steal it.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  They were going to have alternate electors and not accept that
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  and go through the congressional battle with them.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  So playing on ignorance of how the law works and how government works,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  they believe they can get a jury to convict these people.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  So they're not just trying to put Trump in jail.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  They're trying to put his supporters in jail.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  And I love how this woman's a big leftist, anti-American,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  wants the American flag taken down and all this stuff,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  but now she stands in front of it.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  She's got a chip on her shoulder, even though she's funded by a guy
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  that bankrupts countries and steals old people's pension funds.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Soros backed Michigan AG targets pro-Trump alternative electors.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  That was last year, and now she's indicted 16 of them,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  breaking FedC's Trump advisers' phones in January 6th's investigation.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  And here is John Podesta's role-playing Joe Biden transition integrity project.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  This is public documents, summer 2020, simulation to ensure Biden presidency,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  even if Trump won the election.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  This was funded by Hillary Clinton, Obama, and Joe Biden.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  This is public, openly plotting.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  It was in the New York Times as well, sending a separate elector slate.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  So here it is.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  They talk about having their own inauguration, even if this was overridden by Congress
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  and still not accepting it.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  That's not something Trump did.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  There's a hundred times worse than anything the DOJ is alleging the Trump faction did.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  It's all right there.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Read it for yourself.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  The Biden campaign, and this is a war game, encouraged Western states,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  particularly California and also Oregon and Washington,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  intellectually known as the Cascadia, to secede from the union.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  They were going to have a civil war and break the country up.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  Did Trump say secede to other states like, hey, Texas and Florida and Mississippi,
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, all these other majority states?
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  You didn't vote for this.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, you didn't vote for Biden,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  so secede to me.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  In fact, the show should have started.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  Democrats planned secession, civil war if Trump won.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  He just goes, hey, I'll have alternate electors because you're supposed to have them ready
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  if Congress rules and the states rules there was fraud.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Oh, my God, you're indicted.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  George Soros, this person says, but don't talk about George Soros.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  You're not allowed to.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  He's a good man.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  The Biden campaign, this is from John Podesta when he's not in the swimming pool
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  with the five-year-olds, or I'm sorry, with seven-year-olds.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  The Biden campaign encouraged western states, particularly California and also Oregon
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  and Washington, to collectively known as the Cascadia, to secede from the union
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  unless Congress and congressional Republicans agreed to set of structural reforms
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  to fix our democratic system to ensure majority rule, ending the electoral college,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  letting the most populous states dominate the rural states.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Eliminate the federal electoral college to ensure that the candidate who wins the popular vote
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  becomes president.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  So that was their cover to break the country up.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  One of the most consequential moves was that the team Biden on January 6th,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  this is before that, they're working on January 6th, they would do this,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  provoked a breakdown in the joint session of Congress.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  So this is what Trump tried to do.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  He got it from them.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  You've got to love this because January 6th is the date they do that.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  Listen to this.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  One of the most consequential moves that the Trump-Biden,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  one of the most consequential moves was that the team Biden on January 6th
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  provoke a breakdown in the joint session of Congress by getting the House of Representatives
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  to agree to award the presidency to Joe Biden based on the alternative pro-Biden submissions
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  sent by pro-Biden governors.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  That's the alternate.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  But Trump didn't want them to take the alternate people then.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  He wanted them ready in case the states overturned it and in case the Senate did.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  He properly followed the Constitution and wanted a 10-day investigation in the Senate.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  And he said if he lost that, he would then cede the election.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  Jack Smith doesn't care what reality is.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  He's got juries dumber than a box of rocks.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  You know the judge isn't going to let the jury see this, right?
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  No.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  They go on.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  This is a war game they were having, the Democrats.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  Pence and the GOP refused to accept this, declaring instead that Trump was reelected
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  under the Constitution because of his electoral college victory.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  So they were going to ignore the law here.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  This is criminal.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  The partisan division remained unresolved because neither side backed down.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  As of January 20th arrived without a single president-elect entitled to the commander-in-chief afternoon that day,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  it was unclear what the military would do in the situation.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  If I'm pausing, this is written by Podesta.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  It's badly written.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  So again, as January 20th arrived without a single president-elect entitled to the commander-in-chief afternoon that day,
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  it was unclear what the military would do in the situation.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  And so Trump's reading all this about their war game, and he's trying to constitutionally with his lawyers decide how to counter their plan.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  Now he's being indicted for reading their plan and then trying to counter it.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  And now a bunch of innocent people that were alternate electors under the law have been indicted.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  I mean, if that isn't crazy town, I don't know what is.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  The good news is even DeSantis knows this.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  This is making Trump more popular.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  DeSantis hopes Trump doesn't get charged in January 6th probe.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  Here's Trump on that day.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  I'm asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  No violence.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  Remember, we are the party of law and order.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  Respect the law and our great men and women in blue.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  Thank you.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  That's what I said before I even got to the Capitol.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  Please support our Capitol police and law enforcement.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  They are truly on the side of our country.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  Stay peaceful.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  That is Trump leading the attack.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  And of course, before any attack started, saying march peacefully to the Capitol.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  But they don't care, folks, because they'll go get a bunch of homeless people on the jury pool.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  And then offer them money afterwards, like, hey, we're going to take care of you.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  He goes down.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  That's how it works.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  Corrupt jurisdiction, corrupt judges, rigged juries.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  Texas, Austin, Texas, one of the most corrupt the country.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  D.C., New York, San Francisco, and areas of like Connecticut, Delaware, you name it.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  I mean, they've got their people in and they don't care what reality is.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  They're going for broke.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  All right.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  But let me just mention what else is coming up.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  But I've just spent an hour and 20 minutes, first hour and 20 minutes of the show on this.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  This is constitutional crisis, historic desperation of the deep state.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  Balls-to-the-walls craziness.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  It's going to make Trump more popular.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  They'll just file more charges.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  And they really think they're going to clap him in irons or gag order him or accelerate the D.C. trial.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  And try to put him in irons to then get us to do something violent, which we shouldn't do.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  And even when we don't do something violent, they truck bomb the federal buildings.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  They cut the power off, martial law, shooting war starts.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  The Soros' move to Switzerland while we all kill each other.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  And, you know, I'm sad that's probably what's going to happen.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  I'm not going to be a part of the offensive war because it's our own infrastructure.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  You don't beat the globalists going out and fighting these people.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  You beat them building a new country, not complying, not being part of their system
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  and speaking out against them.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  But I got to tell you, at a sick level, all the candy-ass lawyers, all the candy-ass preachers,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  all the candy-ass academics, all the people that want to sit on the sideline and play golf
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  and polish their Porsches, because you sat on the sideline, because you acted so weak,
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  the evil people that run this government believe they can go all the way now.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  And under this scenario, I'd say there'll be an 80% drop in prosperity in the country
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  and that's all you people care about.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  So I'm not talking about our audience, but globalist minions that want to just pay lip service
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  to the globalists and get away with it.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  You're not getting away with this.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  You have just killed the golden goose, screwed the pooch, burned the house down,
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  sold out your birthright.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  I mean, you're just fools, but I mean, I get it.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  Hard times make strong men.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  Strong men make good times.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  Good times make weak men.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  Weak men make bad times.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  And then bad times make strong men and strong men make good times
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  and good times make weak men and weak men make bad times.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  I mean, it's just the cycle.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  It is just the way it is.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  So, oh, the left is so into appeasing power.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And they've already jumped through so many hoops and stood on their head
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  and stood on one foot.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  When they said jump, asked how high, all the little compliant chicken neck liberals
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  with their rainbow hair and their pinot love,
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  they have been just begging the big AI system for power.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  And notice they've not been given power.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  And they're not going to be given power.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  They are going to be so destroyed and turned inside out during this period.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  I mean, they are going to beg their mommy government for their goody goods,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  and they're not going to get them
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  because this is an extremely fascist right-wing New World Order.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  I know people go, wait a minute, you're right-wing.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  No, I'm not.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  I'm a Christian.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  I'm pro-human.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  I'm pro-Renaissance.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  I'm pro-prosperity and competition and pro-human.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  These labels, you hear, mean nothing.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  A liberal today is an authoritarian, fascist, psychotic, transhumanist, devil worshiper.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  But so is the right-wing of the New World Order.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  And you call it right-wing.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  It's not that.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  But what the left would call, what they fear is the right-wing is actually their boss.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  The globalists detest their minions the most.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  The globalists see themselves as avant-garde and transhumanist and master planners
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  that work 18 hours a day and are very fastidious and neurotic
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  and all into OCD organization of things.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  And they look at the average professor or the average leftist,
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  and they just want one thing to kill you.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  And they will kill you.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  So I just want to promise all the minions of Satan,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  you will be given your just rewards.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  And so it's guaranteed.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  So that's our little sick enjoyment.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  And I'm not a Satanist, so I actually don't enjoy it.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  But I can war game it and experience it.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  And just think, oh, you think you're winning.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  While you flush due process and chivalry and common sense and checks and balances
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  down the toilet.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  And then you think you've come up with some new plan no one ever thought of.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  No, we all know about breaking the rules and killing people and going crazy
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  and using power against people and no checks and balances.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  It creates the end of civilization, dumbass.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  And some of us kind of like our children enough to want civilization.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Yeah, it makes our children a little soft.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  But because we are barbarian stock,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  it'll cut your head off, scoop your brain out and eat it,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  and use your skull as a wine glass.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  I mean, I'm just as comfortable doing that as I am being a nice guy
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  because I will destroy you.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Because I know how to kill a thousand of you before you get up in the morning
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  and wipe your ass.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  You people that serve Satan have no idea what you're releasing,
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  no idea what you're opening up, no idea what you've done.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  But don't you worry.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  You're going to meet all the death you've been looking for
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  and you're going to enjoy it.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  You're going to be sat down in front of a table of death and destruction,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  all-you-can-eat buffet.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  And then I'm going to say,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  get to eating.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  You like it so much.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  You love death so much.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  You like to hurt little people so much.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  You like to be a bully so much.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  Get going, son.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  Here's your machine gun.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  Put the rural population in a death camp.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  See how that goes for you.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  There's so much news.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  I've covered one stack.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 other stacks.

[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  Whoo!

[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Infowarsstore.com, Silver Bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality,
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  So let me get this straight.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  an event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  is because of you.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com

[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  Please take action.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:35.900]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:41.940]  Imagine the spiritual blindness, the deep mental illness to go against your own self
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:48.620]  interests and to go against God's incredible plan of free will and total completion.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:57.420]  Imagine carrying out attacks against basic freedom and checks and balances that allowed
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:02.420]  you to live and to have prosperity and freedom.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:07.179]  Imagine pulling the rope up, pulling the ladder up from people below you while you
[01:34:07.179 --> 01:34:12.740]  pose and are funded by the most powerful, ruthless, evil groups while you pose as a
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:23.500]  liberal, loving, healthy person and then you engage in censorship and attacks and imprisonment
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:29.059]  and lawfare and wars that warriors would never do because they've been at war and knew how
[01:34:29.059 --> 01:34:34.940]  dangerous it was, but you do it because you're chicken-necked or you're a woman or you dress
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:38.820]  up like a dog so you can control the nuclear weapons.
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:43.700]  This is the total sabotage of our country.
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:46.220]  They got to bring America down to bring in their world government.
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:50.380]  Yeah, America helped build the world government, America helps run the world government, but
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:55.740]  the final ladder being pulled up from everybody else is America being demolitioned.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.380]  And that's what this is all about, destroying our military.
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:01.099]  I've got stacks on that, oh my God.
[01:35:01.099 --> 01:35:07.460]  If you're transgender, you get full paycheck, don't have to work or do anything in the military.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.660]  So that's like men convicted of rape go, I'm a woman now, and they get put in a woman's
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:11.660]  prison to rape more women.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:16.220]  So now the military goes, say you're transgender, you can't be court-martialed, you can't be
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.900]  investigated, you just get a free paycheck forever.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:26.660]  And you go, that'll destroy the military.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.660]  Like open borders?
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:33.500]  Will hurt the country or, oh really?
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.179]  Or like breaking up the family might actually hurt the country too.
[01:35:36.179 --> 01:35:40.700]  Yeah, man, they're destroying the country, they've already sucked dry, they're done.
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:44.059]  So they know the dollar's about to die, America's about to implode, and they want you to think
[01:35:44.059 --> 01:35:45.900]  it's a race war when it all goes down.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:51.019]  Oh, it was the black people and the white people killing each other in the year 2024,
[01:35:51.019 --> 01:35:56.139]  that's why America went down.
[01:35:56.139 --> 01:35:58.179]  Are we dumb enough to let this happen?
[01:35:58.179 --> 01:36:04.220]  And I'll ask the average government bureaucrat or person that works in academia or the average
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:10.420]  state police officer or just anybody, do you think you're going to do well in a system
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:11.420]  like this?
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:14.540]  I mean, maybe you don't have kids, maybe you're a selfish person, still, do you think cutting
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:19.380]  off the gas pipelines and having a man that says he's a woman in an admiral outfit saying
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:23.139]  we've got to cut your children's genitals off, I mean, do you think any of this bodes
[01:36:23.139 --> 01:36:24.139]  well for anybody?
[01:36:24.139 --> 01:36:29.099]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls, I'm going to shut up now, but I kind of over-prepared
[01:36:29.099 --> 01:36:30.099]  today.
[01:36:30.099 --> 01:36:34.980]  I stayed up late last night studying and I got up really early this morning, like 5 a.m.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:38.340]  Let me tell you the other stuff I'll get after I take every one of these calls to the board.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:42.580]  I'm going to take every one of these calls, probably take an hour, and then I'm going
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:52.740]  to hit the newest attacks on Sound of Freedom by actual PETA promoters and actual pedophiles.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.019]  And the media's like, look, pedophiles don't like it.
[01:36:55.019 --> 01:36:58.780]  So pedophiles say it's not real.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:04.099]  Like foxes say no one ever attacks, foxes say coyotes don't ever break into their houses
[01:37:04.099 --> 01:37:05.099]  either.
[01:37:05.099 --> 01:37:08.500]  It's like, well, I mean, the coyote, I mean, look, the big bad wolf says the big bad wolf
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.500]  doesn't exist.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.500]  Well, I mean, absolutely.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:14.139]  I mean, it's like, again, it's all about logic destruction.
[01:37:14.139 --> 01:37:16.620]  You know, I'm a pedo and I don't like this movie.
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:23.139]  Well, let's put you in Bloomberg.
[01:37:23.139 --> 01:37:24.139]  And you're like, that doesn't make sense.
[01:37:24.139 --> 01:37:25.139]  No, it does.
[01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:31.780]  They're attacking with psychology the neurons where when they show you a lion and say this
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.620]  is not a lion, they show you a lion eating somebody and going, lions are safe.
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.820]  Put your children in cages with lions.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.180]  It's all because your brain goes, what?
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.460]  And see, because they're getting you ready to accept carnage and death and your power
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:49.420]  being cut off and mass suicide and fourth euthanasia.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.420]  And so it's a lot of tech asylum.
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:57.099]  And the people doing it, the psychologists, psychiatrists that run it, they're crazy,
[01:37:57.099 --> 01:37:58.099]  too.
[01:37:58.099 --> 01:38:00.260]  I mean, they can hold on enough to know they're doing it.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:03.940]  But it's like pyromaniacs that want to burn buildings down.
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:07.380]  They know how to go in the building and pour gasoline and light it on fire and then watch
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.800]  the fire department come.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:09.800]  But they just can't help.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.800]  I'm going to burn a building down.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.139]  I'm going to burn it down.
[01:38:12.139 --> 01:38:13.460]  It's just saying that I'm going to burn it down.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:15.860]  You understand the criminology?
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:17.700]  And so we go, well, they're in charge.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.980]  They're in charge because we let them be in charge.
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.980]  And they're burning everything down.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.180]  OK, I'm going to shut up now.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:27.300]  Oh, man, there's so much here.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:32.139]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:38:32.139 --> 01:38:33.139]  Who's holding the longest?
[01:38:33.139 --> 01:38:39.099]  John in Oklahoma, U.S. Air Force vet says it's too late to save America.
[01:38:39.099 --> 01:38:40.099]  Go ahead.
[01:38:40.099 --> 01:38:43.420]  Well, I served many places in the world.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:50.500]  My first duty station was Loring, Maine, where I was involved in the UFO Loring incident.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:58.559]  My second base was Yokota, Japan, where I overheard officers contemplating killing Carter.
[01:38:58.559 --> 01:39:01.540]  That wasn't too long after Kennedy was killed.
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:02.700]  I was only 19.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.580]  I had no idea what to make of it, but it freaked me out.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:10.660]  Then I was stationed in England, South Korea, a few others.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:15.460]  My last duty station was Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:19.120]  At that time, we had three combat communication groups.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.740]  We went in with the Marines.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.300]  They needed air cover.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.180]  They needed air traffic control cover.
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:26.780]  They needed a lot of stuff.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.300]  At that time, I didn't know the Bible.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:34.180]  I've since realized that the Bible is 100 percent accurate.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.500]  I have ripped apart the Koran.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.219]  I've ripped apart the Zilda.
[01:39:38.219 --> 01:39:41.300]  I can't rip apart the Bible.
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:42.700]  That thing is bulletproof.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:47.740]  So anybody who doesn't believe the Bible, your problem, not mine.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:53.700]  I learned research after I left the military for some very, very, very big, important people
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:56.380]  that very few people know about.
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:58.780]  Tex Morris is one of them.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:04.700]  Joyce Riley was an Air Force captain and nurse that exposed a lot of stuff.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.660]  You put a lot of my information up on your front page.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:13.940]  I sent you the stuff on the little blue pill, the CIA and the Afghan warlords.
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:17.580]  Today you have a couple of my articles up on your front page.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:23.620]  I am doing what is called in the military a recall roster.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:34.139]  Recall roster is when somebody at the top makes a decision and then some butthead in Washington
[01:40:34.139 --> 01:40:36.260]  D.C. decides they want to do something.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:41.139]  So they write an order and they send it out and some general gets it and he gives it to
[01:40:41.139 --> 01:40:45.059]  the colonels and they give it to the lieutenant colonels and they give it to the majors and
[01:40:45.059 --> 01:40:47.620]  they give it to the captains, and it goes on down.
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.019]  It's called a recall list.
[01:40:49.019 --> 01:40:52.620]  If there's a war, everybody gets recalled.
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:58.820]  I'm using the Internet today as a recall roster for God.
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:02.940]  There are so many good websites out there that are misleading people.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.660]  Yours happens to be one of the exceptional ones.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:11.620]  As a U.S. Air Force professional, I fixed radar and computers.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:16.420]  I can do binary, octal, hexadecimal mathematics in the head.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.019]  It's not important.
[01:41:18.019 --> 01:41:19.900]  It doesn't make me a good person.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.900]  The Bible taught me one thing.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:22.900]  Don't lie.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:32.300]  The book of Revelation says every liar, not some, not the pretty ones, all liars are going
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.580]  to have their place in the lake of fire.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.219]  So all I'm doing is sending out information, trying to guide people back on the right path.
[01:41:39.219 --> 01:41:40.219]  Well, that's beautiful, brother.
[01:41:40.219 --> 01:41:41.219]  Tell me real quick, John.
[01:41:41.219 --> 01:41:42.219]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:42.219 --> 01:41:43.219]  I think you called in years ago.
[01:41:43.219 --> 01:41:48.300]  What's a good website for folks to find your work or any other tidbits?
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.500]  You cannot find my work.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.980]  I supply you guys.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.340]  All right, sir.
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.820]  I appreciate your call, John.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:54.820]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:55.820]  All right.
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:56.820]  Let's go to Mike in FEMA Region 10.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:57.820]  You're on the air.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:58.820]  Go ahead.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:41:59.820]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:00.820]  Longtime listener.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:07.340]  I really love what you've done over the years.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.340]  You're a command of history.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:09.340]  Well, I'm trying, brother.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.139]  I mean, I wish it wasn't all coming true.
[01:42:11.139 --> 01:42:12.620]  I mean, I just read the Globalist documents.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.620]  They said they would do this.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.620]  They've done it.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.740]  And the rest of the story is killing 90 percent of us.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.900]  Are we going to put up with that next phase?
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:21.620]  Well, this has all been done through history.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:28.180]  I mean, powerful people who are evil have always oppressed and treated good people terribly.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.700]  JFK was murdered.
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:30.700]  We know.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.099]  RFK was murdered.
[01:42:32.099 --> 01:42:33.099]  We know.
[01:42:33.099 --> 01:42:34.099]  MLK.
[01:42:34.099 --> 01:42:40.440]  You've talked to the King family, and they are unified that the FBI—MLK.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.460]  So we know that the deep state does what it does.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.300]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:49.180]  What are we going to do in reaction?
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:52.340]  And I think just sitting on our hands is not the answer.
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:57.660]  I guess that's the one little—and listen, I've listened to you for over 10 years.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.139]  I was down in Bunkerville with the Bundys.
[01:43:00.139 --> 01:43:05.460]  I was down there on the ground, ran into David Knight back then.
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.460]  I'm a patriot.
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:09.019]  I've worked in the government.
[01:43:09.019 --> 01:43:14.700]  And one of the things, though, that just sitting here and taking it punch after punch in the
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:17.500]  gut and the chin isn't the answer.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:20.620]  We have to have a plan, and there is a plan.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.620]  And I think, you know, everybody has their favorite founding father.
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.440]  We all love George Washington, et cetera.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:29.920]  But Jefferson was absolutely right on.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.840]  Well, you know, he was the information warfare guy.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840]  He was.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840]  He was a PSYOPS guy.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.080]  I could talk to you all day about PSYOPS.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:40.080]  I did it over 30 years in the Army, okay, and talk to you about that.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:45.160]  But Jefferson was a PSYOPS guy, but he was also tapped into God.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.480]  And when you read the Declaration of Independence, basically when you get into that part where
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:56.240]  it says the long train of abuses, which has an object to reduce you to absolute tyranny,
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.880]  it is not only our right, but it is our duty to throw off such corruption.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.800]  Let me be 100% clear with you, and I'm going to give you the floor, Mike, because you're
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.680]  a great caller and everybody else on the floor, too.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.480]  I understand that if we had some perfect general that knew what to do, it's our right now to
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480]  be aggressive.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.480]  We've been under attack so long.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480]  We're defensive.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.840]  We're not offensive at this point.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:21.320]  The problem is, I know in my own life, it's good to have conceptual ideas.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.519]  It's another thing to actually lead an attack that they would then turn around, they're
[01:44:24.519 --> 01:44:25.519]  ready for.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.440]  They may want an attack because they think that's the best option to get martial law.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.480]  I know it's hard like Gandhi or Martin Luther King to take these attacks.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:39.120]  What I'm saying is being Christ-like, there's a time, and we may fail in this endeavor,
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.080]  and then a new lockdown, they're taking us to FEMA camps, and then it's all going to
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.080]  go.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.080]  Okay?
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.240]  All I'm saying is, is that it's not my fear of death that keeps me from saying, let's
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.639]  go to the mattresses, let's go to war.
[01:44:50.639 --> 01:44:57.400]  We're in an information war, and we don't have the caliber of people and the organizational
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.400]  thing we had in 1776.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.880]  We have more people than they had.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:06.880]  We just don't have ... The country's so big, the world's so big, it's so complex.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:13.840]  There's so much ignorance that it's an educational operation.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.880]  Our enemies know they're losing.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.639]  That's why they're doing a final coup and arresting our leaders and coming after us.
[01:45:19.639 --> 01:45:24.559]  I agree that they know they're losing because we've been peaceful, so they're about to get
[01:45:24.559 --> 01:45:28.800]  even more physical to push us into that realm, so what do we do at that point?
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:33.160]  Because again, it's one thing to theoretically sit here and be a general.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.519]  It's another thing to actually go out.
[01:45:34.519 --> 01:45:36.400]  Does that make sense?
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:42.719]  It does, but really, our government was designed to be powerful at the local level.
[01:45:42.719 --> 01:45:48.240]  If we are looking for a leader or a savior or somebody ... Jesus Christ is our savior.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:54.000]  We're not going to have any human ... Jesus Christ is our commander in chief.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.719]  That's right, but we got to do it at the local level, and that's what Jefferson tells us.
[01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:02.120]  When you're reduced under absolute tyranny ... He said, go back to the farmers, go back
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.719]  to the absolute land.
[01:46:03.719 --> 01:46:07.519]  Yes, and there are certain areas of the country we just can't control.
[01:46:07.519 --> 01:46:11.639]  Detroit is not a place where patriots are going to control, all right?
[01:46:11.639 --> 01:46:17.519]  Philadelphia, our old capital, but the hinterland, the farming land, the productive land, those
[01:46:17.519 --> 01:46:18.760]  are ours.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.440]  If you look at those electoral maps, they're red.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.519]  It's the blue areas that are highly populated that we don't know.
[01:46:25.519 --> 01:46:30.040]  Who live in fantasy land, yes, and just as Jefferson predicted, he said, Terry will come
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.160]  to the cities, liberty will come from the farming.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.599]  That's right, but we can't be cowards.
[01:46:35.599 --> 01:46:40.120]  We're all going to die someday, and nobody here is looking to do anything violent, but
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:41.680]  I'll be damned if we're going to be pointed around.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:42.680]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.760]  I just hope everybody understands, and it's not an ass-kissing thing to the FBI or the
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.200]  police, the military.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.840]  The enemy wants us to wipe them out, so they'll bring in their UN troops as the next force.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.639]  I don't want anybody to be violent.
[01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:55.880]  I'm just saying, the enemy is the leadership of the new world order.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:01.400]  I'm just going to leave it at that, and so it's real easy to just go out and start shooting
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:02.400]  people.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.440]  The left's going to do that and blame it on us very soon.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.320]  I mean, you know their next move is to false flag and blame us, right?
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.200]  Absolutely, but here's the thing, if we're on defense all the time, we're going to lose.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:14.080]  The left has a plan, right?
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.080]  We have no plan.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.040]  We're always reactionary, and if you're on defense 100% of the time, you're 100% of the
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.040]  time going to lose.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.040]  I don't know.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.040]  I don't know.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:27.160]  I mean, Mahatma Gandhi was on defense and let the British act like total jerks, and that
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.080]  turned the entire population against him.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.760]  You know, again, I'm going to explain something again.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.760]  People can...
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.920]  I'm not mad at you, but I appreciate your call.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:35.920]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:42.800]  You can call in and say, we need to be on offense, which means violent stuff.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:52.380]  And then, you know, I mean, we're sitting here talking about real stuff, and it does
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:53.559]  nothing.
[01:47:53.559 --> 01:47:57.340]  If somebody killed the FBI Director Mara, make them stronger.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:59.920]  Somebody blows Biden's head off, they're probably going to do it themselves.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.280]  That makes them stronger.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.400]  Kill Hillary, any of them.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.400]  They've got a huge evil bureaucracy.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.440]  We got to remove the ESGs.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.960]  We got to remove the gender reassignment surgeries.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.599]  We've got to remove the federal...
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400]  We are doing that.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.800]  We are literally educating the public and exposing what controls us politically, culturally,
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:23.960]  spiritually, economically, and we're removing it right now.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.000]  So I get these calls about, when are we going to get...
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.559]  Hey, go march with me on January 6th, try to stop the violence.
[01:48:31.559 --> 01:48:33.639]  Go out and have Andy Philip attack you in your vehicle.
[01:48:33.639 --> 01:48:35.440]  And I'm not saying you haven't done that, caller.
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.840]  I'm saying, I go out there with no body armor.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.360]  They're like, please, sir, wear this body armor.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.760]  I'm like, nope, not wearing it.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.760]  Because I don't want to die.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.440]  But at a sick level, it's like, just get me right in the head, please.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.080]  I got to complete this mission, never back down.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.080]  That's my goal.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:57.160]  And a sick part of me is like, you know, believe me, I'm not scared to death, but I am scared
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.519]  of failure and being tricked.
[01:48:58.519 --> 01:49:00.680]  And I already trusted the government.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.400]  I knew the government was bad, but I would never imagine Trump says, we're going to speak
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.240]  at this and we're going to go to the Capitol and the feds all stood down and set him up.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.940]  And I was like, oh my God, that's so obvious.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.240]  We walked right into a trap.
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:17.340]  And so I'm saying, without the intel and the surveillance and the operations, even if
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:22.019]  I had all that, and 20, 30 years of military training and historical training, which I've
[01:49:22.019 --> 01:49:26.940]  got more than most people that are actually generals, I still cannot confidently try to
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:30.740]  actually pull the trigger in a civil war.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.700]  It's just not reality based.
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:36.059]  But I want to warn the feds and all their dumb ass minions and people.
[01:49:36.059 --> 01:49:37.059]  Let me tell you something.
[01:49:37.059 --> 01:49:38.219]  I've looked at every avenue.
[01:49:38.219 --> 01:49:40.340]  It just gets worse for you.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.340]  Okay.
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.660]  But I don't want you to get killed.
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:44.900]  I don't want to see everything burn.
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:45.900]  Okay.
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.219]  But I'm just telling you, you've lost.
[01:49:47.219 --> 01:49:50.540]  I want Soros and Alexander Soros to know.
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.180]  I have immersed myself in this.
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:53.940]  This is all I do.
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:56.500]  And even mainline analysts agree with me.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.860]  You guys are done.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:03.139]  The best thing you could do is go away.
[01:50:03.139 --> 01:50:06.700]  And then maybe you could creep back in and try to get control later.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.620]  And you're like, well, why would you say that?
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:13.700]  I guess I am kind of a nice guy.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:16.460]  Your only hope is to go away and come back and attack later, but you're not going to.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:17.460]  So just get it on.
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:18.460]  Fine.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:23.460]  I'm just saying, I'm not going to be the one that sends other people to die.
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:27.500]  And I'm not going to be the one that sits back and plays God with people like you guys
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:28.500]  do.
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:32.180]  And I'm telling the globalists, you've reached a point where you don't get away with this
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:33.180]  stuff anymore.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:38.880]  But the way this stuff interacts, the way it chain reactions, like it's so dangerous.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.019]  It's like a giant warehouse of explosives.
[01:50:41.019 --> 01:50:45.780]  And you guys have gremlins running around, you know, pissing on it and lighting firecrackers
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:47.980]  and shooting flamethrowers in the air laughing.
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:52.340]  And I'm just like, backing up going, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:58.420]  And some patriots are like, shotgun that gremlin on top of explosives.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:50:59.420]  We'll hit the damn explosives.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:02.260]  I mean, this is a disaster.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.620]  We're all screwed.
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:04.620]  Okay.
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:05.620]  We better get right with God.
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.620]  That's all I'm telling you.
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:15.100]  And Katie bar the door, ladies and gentlemen, because once this stuff goes downhill, there's
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:20.580]  no putting it back together again.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:27.940]  And they think they're going to arrest Trump, blow some stuff up, blame it on Trump, embarrass
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:30.820]  all of us and make us feel bad and go away.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.420]  They thought indicting Trump would do that.
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:33.420]  It didn't work.
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.299]  None of that works anymore.
[01:51:36.299 --> 01:51:38.299]  They can release footage of Trump raping children.
[01:51:38.299 --> 01:51:39.500]  We know it'd be fake.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:42.260]  And no one's going to buy it, even if it was real.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.260]  You're done.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:51.980]  I mean, and again, the globalists have mental deficiencies.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:53.799]  There's something wrong with them.
[01:51:53.799 --> 01:51:57.700]  They have some level of intelligence, but not long term intelligence.
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:01.139]  And they certainly don't have any type of genuine humanity.
[01:52:01.139 --> 01:52:11.740]  And so don't think that I'm holding back here because I'm scared to go to war with the globalists.
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:13.100]  They're not even human.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.940]  They don't even exist.
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:21.500]  And they want to destroy the infrastructure and a physical war will do that.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.740]  They're smuggling children in mass.
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.580]  They're dissolving the borders.
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:26.580]  They're killing the dollar.
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:27.580]  They're launching World War III.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:31.460]  We need to politically stop all of that.
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:32.460]  What do they want?
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:36.580]  Burning cities, defund the police, mostly peaceful protests, antifa.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:37.740]  They want discord.
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:38.940]  They want hysteria.
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:42.340]  They want warfare.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.740]  You could go out and kill a thousand prominent leftists tomorrow and they would be more emboldened
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:51.620]  by it because the leftists behind them, their own people hate them.
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.940]  They all hate each other.
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:56.900]  They're just waiting for their boss to die or waiting so they get in power.
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.460]  Most of the time, the one behind them is even worse.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:01.460]  That's how evil works.
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:05.780]  It gets worse each generation.
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.700]  You have to spiritually kill them.
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:12.260]  You have to change yourself and then others see that change in you and then you don't
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:18.860]  comply with them with civil disobedience and you do not let them physically attack you.
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.820]  And don't worry, they're coming.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:33.500]  But it's like Colonel Jackson said when he went and took out the British in the war 1812
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:37.580]  and the only reason their smaller force beat the British was they were using older tactics
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:41.519]  and he said, don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes.
[01:53:41.519 --> 01:53:45.660]  Let them burn the towns, let them rape the people, let them run around and act powerful.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:48.460]  We don't go out and shoot them out in the open, all the rest of it.
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:53.299]  We wait until they get right up to 20 feet away and are reloading and we shoot for the
[01:53:53.299 --> 01:53:55.580]  whites of their eyes.
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:57.460]  Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes.
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.340]  Make it up close and personal.
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:02.100]  I don't need guns, they bring in some tyranny.
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:06.460]  I need a ball-peen hammer, I can take anything I want.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:10.460]  But do you know how to drive an armored vehicle or a tank?
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.460]  You know how to shoot a rifle.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:16.420]  You know how to beat somebody's brains out because everybody can run their mouth all
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:21.019]  day long about killing people, but instead of starting to get in a mindset where we're
[01:54:21.019 --> 01:54:25.059]  thinking about killing people, why don't we get in a mindset of how we're going to kill
[01:54:25.059 --> 01:54:29.740]  their ideas and go speak at city councils and county commissions and state houses and
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:30.740]  C-SPAN.
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:31.740]  I know you're doing that.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:32.740]  I'm not criticizing you.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:36.180]  And when your country's being taken over by a multinational coup allied with communist
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:40.180]  China and promoting pedophilia and chopping children's genitals off, you're like, hey,
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:44.180]  our founders took them on over a damn t-tax and oppression.
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.260]  Why are we putting up with this?
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:56.740]  I get what you're saying, but we're in a new type of war and 95% of it's psychological.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.180]  I really think we should reach out to people in corporations and government everywhere else
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:04.180]  and tell them, keep leaking information, which they're doing.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:07.580]  I got to tell you, at the top, the feds are completely evil.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:12.340]  At the mid and low levels, most of them are on our side.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:15.860]  So how does that hurt the globalists to have a war with that captured thing?
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.860]  Here's an example.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:17.860]  I'm going to break.
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:18.860]  Come back with your calls.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:19.860]  I promise.
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:20.860]  I'm going to go faster.
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:21.860]  I had to give those callers a lot of time.
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:22.860]  I'm sorry.
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.860]  We're calling.
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:24.860]  We're gone.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:25.860]  We're going to get to everybody.
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:29.860]  I use this analogy a lot to explain that the government's hijacked.
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:30.860]  It's not our enemy.
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.860]  It's too big.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:32.860]  It's out of control.
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:35.900]  But the hijacker has a bomb, takes over the cockpit, kills the pilots, puts on their own
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.900]  outfit, and then comes in and waves guns at people while it's on autopilot and says, do
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:41.139]  what I say or I'm going to kill you.
[01:55:41.139 --> 01:55:46.260]  You don't then open the side door and flood the compartment with depressurization and
[01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:49.860]  kill everybody just to get the hijacker.
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:54.420]  And that's what I'm saying is we're on this hijacked airplane and the new world order
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:56:01.980]  Biden is in the pilot's outfit and they've shot the copilot and the pilots tied up.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:06.840]  And there's only one hijacker with a bomb around him, probably isn't even really a bomb.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.960]  We have to decide what are we going to do to beat that guy?
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:17.360]  You're like, well, that's a hard question.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:26.400]  But we don't open the escape hatch and flood the airplane just to take him out.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.960]  Because if we take him out, we take ourselves out.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.639]  What do we do?
[01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:40.240]  Maybe he walks by us waving his gun around and you're strong enough, maybe you were Golden
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.240]  Gloves champion or something, and you break his jaw with one powerful shot.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:48.920]  He doesn't pull the ripcord and detonate the bomb.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.840]  Or maybe it's better the whole plane go down than he'd be able to fly into a building.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:56.519]  And maybe you go ahead and just jump on the side of a bitch and let him pull the bomb
[01:56:56.519 --> 01:56:58.120]  and the whole airplane goes down.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:01.440]  It's better than laying down to that bastard, huh?
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:07.080]  But I'm just telling you, folks, you better get dialed in to where you stand.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.280]  Everybody else is going to make excuses.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.680]  Oh, the government's good.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:11.440]  It's not as bad as Alex says.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:13.480]  We all know that's a lie now.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:16.960]  So I'm talking to the people that have been in the middle of the road on this and who
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.360]  think we're in the status quo.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:21.120]  Folks, we're not in the status quo now.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.160]  The Democratic Party's outlawed their political opposition.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.200]  They're bringing in tyranny.
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.519]  They're bringing in pedophilia.
[01:57:27.519 --> 01:57:28.880]  They're bad.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.400]  The worst of the worst are in control.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.920]  And if you think they're bad now, soon even more radicals will be in control because that's
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.000]  how evil works.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  It rots.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.719]  All right, hour number three, I appreciate callers holding.
[01:57:40.719 --> 01:57:48.440]  I promise you, Donald, Jim, Curtis, John, Eben, Rich, Aaron, James, Hammer.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:54.880]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:58.080]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:02.400]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.400]  and self-defense.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.559]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:58:05.559 --> 01:58:08.080]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.120]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.019]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[01:58:14.019 --> 01:58:15.080]  filtration.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.719]  This is something you need now.
[01:58:16.719 --> 01:58:21.280]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:25.680]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:27.040]  still get quality.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:32.799]  InfoWarsTore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[01:58:32.799 --> 01:58:34.960]  water and air filtration.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:37.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:38.840]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:41.799]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:58:41.799 --> 01:58:49.600]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:55.519]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at InfoWarsTore.com
[01:58:55.519 --> 01:58:59.840]  that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.240]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:05.719]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with pearl calcium toothpaste.
[01:59:05.719 --> 01:59:09.680]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:13.120]  essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.880]  mouth, your throat, and more.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.480]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.400]  They're very, very strong.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.320]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.320]  Ours don't.
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.799]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[01:59:22.799 --> 01:59:28.799]  It is just chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[01:59:28.799 --> 01:59:30.519]  So it's now back in stock.
[01:59:30.519 --> 01:59:32.280]  It became a best-seller.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:35.600]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:37.000]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  We've got some of that left.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.719]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running
[01:59:41.719 --> 01:59:42.719]  out as well.
[01:59:42.719 --> 01:59:45.920]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:45.920 --> 02:00:05.280]  All right, I'm going to stop being so long-winded, but I'm wound up today.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.600]  That's part of the problem.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.240]  I come in and read all this news and go crazy before I go on air.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:11.840]  Let's talk to Donald in Maryland.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:12.840]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:13.840]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:15.880]  The two-party system is now the one party.
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:17.320]  I made that statement in the first hour.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.320]  What do you think of that?
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:25.880]  Well, it's definitely a one-party system because Republicans that you call Republicans are
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:26.880]  just puppets.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.880]  They're letting everything.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.440]  So the people won't panic.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:34.799]  They put Republicans out there that make it look like they're trying to hold the line.
[02:00:34.799 --> 02:00:37.219]  But really, it's just a one-party system.
[02:00:37.219 --> 02:00:38.219]  And you said it right.
[02:00:38.219 --> 02:00:40.120]  I'd like to see you rant, but you said it right.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:44.320]  You said it's time to get right with Jesus because he didn't let us until he was taken
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:45.320]  out of the way.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.600]  The one-world system is already here, and it's going to go in effect.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.000]  It's already in effect.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.719]  There ain't no stopping it because God is orchestrating the whole thing.
[02:00:54.719 --> 02:00:58.799]  The devil knows he's got a space to operate in, and he's going to do so.
[02:00:58.799 --> 02:01:01.240]  And nobody's going to be able to stop it but Jesus.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:03.559]  So if people are trying to say, what are we going to do?
[02:01:03.559 --> 02:01:06.040]  Get this party, get that party, it's only one season.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.040]  That's Jesus Christ.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:13.160]  And if you don't get right, like you said, with Jesus, all the parties you can try to
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:18.360]  get together, all of them is this one-world system, and the devil has a space to operate
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.160]  in, and he's going to do it.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.559]  Well, that's the smartest thing said on my show in 29 years.
[02:01:23.559 --> 02:01:24.559]  At the same time, please elaborate.
[02:01:24.559 --> 02:01:26.600]  Give us your take on it, Donald.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:29.799]  But God wants to see what we're going to do in this test, though.
[02:01:29.799 --> 02:01:31.960]  We have to understand the Antichrist will come.
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:35.840]  He'll wage war against the saints and overcome us, whether that's a year from now or 20 years
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:37.000]  or 100 years.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.680]  We're coming into this beast system.
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:40.200]  They're beta testing it.
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:41.600]  It's fulfilling it all.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:42.719]  And you're right.
[02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:46.320]  But at the same time, we've got to fight evil and try to protect the children while we're
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:47.320]  here.
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:53.160]  So how do we deal with that paradox, knowing Antichrist will get his three-quarters of
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:58.519]  attacking us, God wins in the fourth quarter, then how do you deal with that?
[02:01:58.519 --> 02:02:03.240]  Because you've got to understand, you say as a Christian that you've got to know that weapons
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:07.700]  of malware are not carnal, but might through God end up pulling down on strongholds.
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:12.519]  We tried for years with the political system, choosing people that you don't know what side
[02:02:12.519 --> 02:02:13.519]  they on.
[02:02:13.519 --> 02:02:14.519]  They just fit.
[02:02:14.519 --> 02:02:18.840]  You don't even know if they are Americans that's actually in government right now.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.120]  You don't know where they came from.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.840]  They look like us, but they might not be us.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.719]  So we can't depend on man.
[02:02:24.719 --> 02:02:25.719]  We got to go.
[02:02:25.719 --> 02:02:30.600]  You talk about giving together and going on offense and going, yes, go on offense, why?
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:31.600]  In prayer.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:32.960]  Go on defense in prayer.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.100]  You got to go on offense and defense because our weapons are not carnal.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:41.040]  We can't go with the carnal thing here because it's a spiritual thing that's going on.
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:48.200]  You say it a lot of times, but you try to answer all avenues of the question.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.639]  And you cannot save this world.
[02:02:50.639 --> 02:02:52.600]  You're going against God.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.240]  God already gave the devil space to operate because whoever want to be with him, be with
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:01.280]  him and whoever want to be with God, you're going to be with God.
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:04.080]  I agree that that's true and we're predestined as well.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.400]  What I'm saying is we're supposed to fight evil in the process.
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:10.960]  I get it's all predestined, but we're predestined to fight it.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:13.639]  So what are we supposed to do while we're here on the earth?
[02:03:13.639 --> 02:03:19.240]  You fight it by, like you say, you go to legislation, you let your voice be heard because right
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.880]  now they got you coming and going.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.280]  You can't go to the old fashioned way of going with marches because why?
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.280]  It's people in the thing that they setting you up with, like you went to January 6th,
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.280]  right?
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:31.280]  It's like, what?
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.280]  That didn't make sense.
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.280]  Why?
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:37.680]  Because you knew that them people was going out to, they had already, they planned shit.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:40.920]  They said they come, this is what we're going to do and they did it.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.000]  And they own all the media and all everything and everything, but the narrative don't go
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  that way.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.040]  And they outright in your face blatantly will let people get away with crimes and won't
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:52.040]  do it.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.040]  Why?
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:59.160]  Because they want you to vote against your own system and it's not working no more.
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:00.160]  I hear you.
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.160]  That's what people call it.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.519]  Wanting me to like lead some attack.
[02:04:02.519 --> 02:04:03.519]  You're right.
[02:04:03.519 --> 02:04:04.519]  It's God's plan.
[02:04:04.519 --> 02:04:05.519]  We have become evil.
[02:04:05.519 --> 02:04:06.519]  We've let the devil take over.
[02:04:06.519 --> 02:04:07.519]  We're being judged.
[02:04:07.519 --> 02:04:08.519]  Look at all the murderers.
[02:04:08.519 --> 02:04:09.519]  Look at all the murderers in Baltimore city.
[02:04:09.519 --> 02:04:10.519]  Look at all the abortions that come up to heaven.
[02:04:10.519 --> 02:04:11.519]  All those murders come up to heaven and God's judgment got to come.
[02:04:11.519 --> 02:04:12.519]  I said that a couple of weeks ago.
[02:04:12.519 --> 02:04:13.519]  I'm surprised God hadn't blown the planet up already.
[02:04:13.519 --> 02:04:14.519]  He can't because he already said how he was going to do it.
[02:04:14.519 --> 02:04:15.519]  He, he, he got God is true to his word.
[02:04:15.519 --> 02:04:16.519]  He will let he, that's why he going to let him do what he going to do.
[02:04:16.519 --> 02:04:17.519]  So he's taking it out of the way.
[02:04:17.519 --> 02:04:18.519]  You know what?
[02:04:18.519 --> 02:04:42.519]  If God didn't have his spirit poured out upon all flesh and when he pours it back, then
[02:04:43.519 --> 02:04:44.519]  you're going to see that seven years of tribulation.
[02:04:44.519 --> 02:04:45.519]  Hold on Donald.
[02:04:45.519 --> 02:04:46.519]  Hang on.
[02:04:46.519 --> 02:04:47.519]  Don't hang up.
[02:04:47.519 --> 02:04:48.519]  I want to hear more from Donald.
[02:04:48.519 --> 02:04:49.519]  Stay with us.
[02:04:49.519 --> 02:04:50.519]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[02:04:50.519 --> 02:04:51.519]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:04:51.519 --> 02:04:52.519]  You are crazy in my view.
[02:04:52.519 --> 02:04:53.519]  If you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get
[02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:54.519]  high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:04:54.519 --> 02:04:55.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water
[02:04:55.519 --> 02:04:56.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:04:56.519 --> 02:04:57.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high
[02:04:57.519 --> 02:04:58.519]  quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:04:58.519 --> 02:04:59.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water
[02:04:59.519 --> 02:05:00.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:00.519 --> 02:05:01.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get
[02:05:01.519 --> 02:05:02.519]  high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:05:02.519 --> 02:05:03.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water
[02:05:03.519 --> 02:05:04.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:04.519 --> 02:05:05.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get
[02:05:05.519 --> 02:05:06.519]  high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable

[02:05:07.519 --> 02:05:08.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:08.519 --> 02:05:09.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get
[02:05:09.519 --> 02:05:10.519]  high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:05:10.519 --> 02:05:11.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water
[02:05:11.519 --> 02:05:12.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:12.519 --> 02:05:13.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get

[02:05:15.519 --> 02:05:16.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:16.519 --> 02:05:17.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get
[02:05:37.519 --> 02:05:48.519]  high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:05:48.519 --> 02:05:49.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water
[02:05:49.519 --> 02:05:50.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:50.519 --> 02:05:51.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high
[02:05:51.519 --> 02:05:52.519]  quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:05:52.519 --> 02:05:53.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water
[02:05:53.519 --> 02:05:54.519]  filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if
[02:05:54.519 --> 02:05:55.519]  you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high
[02:05:55.519 --> 02:05:56.519]  quality, storable food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable
[02:05:56.519 --> 02:05:57.519]  food and water filtration, and if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration,
[02:05:57.410 --> 02:06:03.930]  you're going to be high on your food.
[02:06:03.930 --> 02:06:12.769]  And you're going to be high on your water.
[02:06:12.769 --> 02:06:13.769]  And you're going to be high on your food.
[02:06:13.769 --> 02:06:14.769]  And you're going to be high on your food.
[02:06:14.769 --> 02:06:15.769]  And you're going to be high on your food.
[02:06:15.769 --> 02:06:16.769]  So, it's a lot of different things.
[02:06:16.769 --> 02:06:17.769]  We're going to get to that.
[02:06:17.769 --> 02:06:18.769]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:18.769 --> 02:06:19.769]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.769 --> 02:06:20.769]  And I said I'd go quicker to your calls, but all the callers have been amazing today.
[02:06:20.769 --> 02:06:21.769]  I may just have to take over the whole fourth hour here, but we're going to get to everybody.
[02:06:21.769 --> 02:06:22.769]  I'm going to do this in a minute.
[02:06:22.769 --> 02:06:23.769]  I'm not going to talk for a minute.
[02:06:23.769 --> 02:06:24.769]  I'm going to do this in a minute.
[02:06:24.769 --> 02:06:25.769]  I've got a little bit of time.
[02:06:25.769 --> 02:06:26.769]  I'm going to do this in a minute.
[02:06:26.769 --> 02:06:31.769]  everybody. Donald is really talking about the fact that this is God's plan
[02:06:31.769 --> 02:06:37.210]  unfolding. I agree, but we're not just pawns or automatons. We have free will.
[02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:45.090]  How do we play into that? But the new video is breaking. Banking insider
[02:06:45.090 --> 02:06:50.370]  warns CBDCs will be implanted microchips in the population. That's now being
[02:06:50.370 --> 02:06:55.010]  admitted. That is incredible information. That's at man.video right now. So in
[02:06:55.010 --> 02:07:00.250]  closing, Donald, I appreciate you calling and getting through and holding. I agree
[02:07:00.250 --> 02:07:04.250]  with you. So how do we thread that needle of it's all prophesied, it's all coming
[02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:08.290]  true, but God also wants us to fight evil and God says if you don't stand up
[02:07:08.290 --> 02:07:12.849]  against evil, I'm not going to recognize you. So how do those two things go
[02:07:12.849 --> 02:07:17.889]  together? With prayer and getting people together in prayer and sending prayer to
[02:07:17.889 --> 02:07:21.769]  God and let the spirit lead us. We can't let the flesh lead us, but the flesh
[02:07:21.769 --> 02:07:26.130]  will lead us to January the 6th out of our feelings and emotion. We'll get jammed
[02:07:26.130 --> 02:07:30.210]  up because they're already playing chess with us. And by the way, my
[02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:34.170]  spirit told me not go to January 6th, show that Roger Stone had just become
[02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:39.970]  born again, but I ignored my instincts and my spirit and still went. Saul did it.
[02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:46.769]  He said when he said he was going to set a sacrifice up, he said he forced himself.
[02:07:46.769 --> 02:07:50.650]  When God is telling you something, you're forcing yourself because of
[02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:54.330]  your feelings and emotion, you cannot save this planet. If you're trying to
[02:07:54.330 --> 02:08:00.290]  save this planet, you're going against God's will. This is the devil's system
[02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:06.650]  and it got an expiration date. Well that's a beautiful, that's a beautiful
[02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:12.530]  quote. The devil's system has an expiration date. Keep, man, I'm, Donald,
[02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:17.170]  keep, keep, keep laying it on us. It has an expiration date and God's giving us time to
[02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:21.010]  operate. All who want to go with him, let him go with him. You got some people that
[02:08:21.010 --> 02:08:25.130]  will hurt you. They, they, they salivate in evil. They can't wait. You can see them.
[02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:29.410]  You show it. How they just salivating all the stuff they're doing, cutting up kids,
[02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:33.930]  doing whatever they're doing, murder. They salivate. When I get around leftist leaders, they
[02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:39.290]  literally show their teeth and salivate hating me. It's not because I'm that good,
[02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:44.090]  but they see God in me. They literally salivate. They salivate because you're
[02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:48.570]  just shaking them. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. You're trying to wake
[02:08:48.570 --> 02:08:52.570]  them up to Christ. There's only one way out of here. You got to get on the ark.
[02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:57.530]  What is that ark? In Christ. Why? He said, you're either lukewarm or cold. He said, I'll
[02:08:57.530 --> 02:09:00.490]  spew you out my mouth. What you mean? How's he going to spew me out my mouth? That's
[02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:04.530]  vomit you. Well, how will you vomit me? Because I seeded you together where? In
[02:09:04.530 --> 02:09:09.410]  heavenly places. Where? In Christ Jesus. So when Christ spew you out of his mouth,
[02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:18.650]  the curse takes you. That means he's done with you. You were seeded, but you didn't do what he
[02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:26.769]  wanted to do. So he vomited you out. Which tells us Christ is the groom. We're the bride. This is
[02:09:26.769 --> 02:09:31.450]  a merger with Christ. And God's saying, I'm not going to let you merge with me. I'm going to kick
[02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:39.570]  you out. Yes. Christ, Noah had an ark, and the dove with the spirit of God was on that. Christ
[02:09:39.570 --> 02:09:45.610]  seeded us together in him. He's the ark back to heaven. If he's going to take you out, he's done
[02:09:45.610 --> 02:09:50.170]  with you. And we're in that seventh church, the last hill church. He said, you're not either hot
[02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:56.370]  or cold. You're lukewarm. And everybody looking forward to be a bad time when God come. No. He
[02:09:56.370 --> 02:10:02.290]  said, you're rich. He said, I need nothing. They're waiting for a bad time. When it get bad,
[02:10:02.290 --> 02:10:06.970]  I'm going to go with God. No, he's going to come when it's good time. You're rich. He said, I need
[02:10:06.970 --> 02:10:13.530]  nothing. But you don't know that you're miserable, poor, blind, and naked. It's true. They serve the
[02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:19.450]  devil, even when the devil takes everything from them. Yeah, they love it. Because they want to
[02:10:19.450 --> 02:10:29.130]  keep this planet. They love this system. This is a failed system. You said it. Wow, that was an
[02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:36.410]  incredible caller. Never heard from that guy before. Wow. Man, that was amazing. I got a
[02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:39.809]  church. I'd be at it every day probably as a preacher. Let's go ahead and talk to James in
[02:10:39.809 --> 02:10:44.849]  Indiana. You're on the air, James. Welcome. Thanks for holding. Yeah, dissolve the corrupt DOJ. DOJ
[02:10:44.849 --> 02:10:48.650]  has been telling whistleblowers not to talk to Congress on DOJ corruption. There should be
[02:10:48.650 --> 02:10:52.130]  national protests at every federal building Friday, protesting the persecution of President
[02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:57.210]  Trump. President Kennedy said DOJ frames the disabled. There's older news of the government
[02:10:57.210 --> 02:11:01.210]  making up fake medical records to go after whistleblowers. My prediction next year, you will
[02:11:01.210 --> 02:11:06.250]  see calls for jury nullification at records high because no one trusts the corrupt DOJ. Lastly,
[02:11:06.250 --> 02:11:10.690]  one is whistleblower whiter slow down. I'm going to give you time just because I can listen fast
[02:11:10.690 --> 02:11:14.050]  and I can barely track you and I bet half the listeners can't hear what you're saying. I'm
[02:11:14.050 --> 02:11:19.210]  barely fought. I agree. In fact, I have a big article here out of the Hill. The elites are
[02:11:19.210 --> 02:11:23.330]  panicking, saying they're getting jury nullification except for the few jurisdictions
[02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:29.290]  they control. Everyone's turning against the system. And the Republican neocon answer is have
[02:11:29.290 --> 02:11:32.889]  the Republicans that are really Democrat operatives are about to leave the Republican
[02:11:32.889 --> 02:11:41.330]  Party because, quote, they're scared of the populist. Absolutely. When's whistleblower
[02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:45.010]  Whitehurst coming on that was showing how the federal government was framing innocent people?
[02:11:45.010 --> 02:11:50.130]  I've had Dr. Frederick Whitehurst on four or five times. It's even alive. I'm sure he's alive.
[02:11:50.130 --> 02:11:56.530]  When I interviewed that guy like 30 years ago, 25 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a key
[02:11:56.530 --> 02:12:02.389]  point to bring him on. And also for a promotional issue, I would love to see Infowars do like a
[02:12:02.389 --> 02:12:07.849]  sports trading card that has the Alex Jones show on the top of the war room in the middle and
[02:12:07.849 --> 02:12:12.330]  American Journal at the bottom and sign to the right for promotional. You can probably get
[02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:16.610]  between 60 and 120 bucks for each one. That'd be a great funding mechanism. Actually, Drew,
[02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:21.690]  who's watching right now, came up with the idea. We need to finish that, do that and then roll
[02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:25.769]  that out. That's a great idea. Anything else, James? No, thanks for your time. Keep up the
[02:12:25.769 --> 02:12:30.610]  fight, Alex. I love you, brother. Thank you so much. All right. Aaron in South Carolina. You're
[02:12:30.610 --> 02:12:41.410]  on the air. Alex, I got a plug for you at the end of this if you want it. Welcome. All right. Hey,
[02:12:41.410 --> 02:12:48.410]  no violence. If you want to be effective, Donald, call back in and have Donald start offering
[02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:55.170]  prayers. And, you know, you don't just stay in your lane, Alex. You are opening the hearts and
[02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:59.090]  minds of people doing what you're doing. Keep doing what you're doing, please. We don't need
[02:12:59.090 --> 02:13:04.130]  to get violent right now. We know we could take a bullet, whatever. I mean, that'd be great. No,
[02:13:04.130 --> 02:13:07.730]  but it's a normal discussion when you're overrunning a coup to talk about, hey, let's
[02:13:07.730 --> 02:13:12.650]  physically fight back. But we're in a new war. It's more sophisticated than that. And if I really
[02:13:12.650 --> 02:13:16.730]  thought physical violence was a way to go, I would say it. But I right now they're getting
[02:13:16.730 --> 02:13:23.610]  ready to false flag and blame us guaranteed. OK, well, hey, look, whatever they do, Alex,
[02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:29.970]  you stay in your lane. You're the prophet. The closer you are to the Lord, the more pure and the
[02:13:29.970 --> 02:13:34.290]  harder your words are going to hit. So just keep doing what you're doing. OK, I think we're all
[02:13:34.290 --> 02:13:40.769]  pathetic in this moment. But yes, go ahead. What else? All right. So I called in about arresting
[02:13:40.769 --> 02:13:48.170]  Trump. Yeah, let him be arrested. And I'm going to base what I'm saying off of your own words,
[02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:55.849]  Alex. And you can correct me if I'm wrong, but have I heard you say that if you found out Trump
[02:13:55.849 --> 02:14:03.290]  was involved with Epstein and underage girls, that you were done with them? Of course. OK. Well,
[02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:09.370]  that information is out there. I've tried really hard to get it to you to get you with Maria Farmer
[02:14:09.370 --> 02:14:18.250]  and let her tell you herself. Let me just stop you. Let me just stop you. I've seen daily mail
[02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:22.650]  articles that claim I grabbed a woman's butt and said I wanted to marry her. I never grabbed
[02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:26.410]  anybody's butt. And I didn't tell that woman I wanted to marry her. They paid her money. Ten
[02:14:26.410 --> 02:14:32.250]  thousand dollars. I'm told to say that. OK, then I see this woman. Tell Anderson Cooper she thinks
[02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:37.050]  rape is sexy and that Trump never touched her, but it was more emotional rape. I don't believe that.
[02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:44.010]  So just because somebody says Trump is not on the logs on Epstein's plane. So, I mean,
[02:14:44.809 --> 02:14:48.570]  so I'm not in bed with Trump. If I see Trump being bad, I'll come out against him.
[02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:53.930]  I mean, there's been all these Jane Doe's file lawsuits claiming Trump's doing all this.
[02:14:53.930 --> 02:15:00.250]  Trump's a control freak. You think Trump would get on an airplane with a third party
[02:15:00.250 --> 02:15:06.010]  and fly to an island and screw kids? Let me just say this, Alex. Let me just say this. At least,
[02:15:06.650 --> 02:15:12.250]  please be careful and definitely watch out for that snake, Alan Dershowitz.
[02:15:12.250 --> 02:15:16.410]  Be very careful. That's all I'm asking you to do right now. I'm sure you'll figure.
[02:15:16.410 --> 02:15:20.010]  No, no, I hear you. Alan Dershowitz had a book out that my publisher put out.
[02:15:20.889 --> 02:15:24.889]  It's an imprint of a big publisher. And he's very interesting. But I mean, look,
[02:15:24.889 --> 02:15:29.610]  lawyers are allowed to represent people. So he represented on a few things Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:34.809]  I mean, I mean, this is what I'm trying to understand is there was never any evidence
[02:15:34.809 --> 02:15:38.809]  he did anything. What I'm saying is I want to see evidence. People claim all day.
[02:15:38.809 --> 02:15:43.530]  I'm a KKK member. No evidence. It's ridiculous. I'm Papa Smurf before on that.
[02:15:45.130 --> 02:15:49.690]  I'm certainly not the president of hair club for men. But I mean, I'm trying to understand.
[02:15:49.690 --> 02:15:55.290]  I keep hearing Trump is screwing kids. I know people that were his wingman. Trump likes
[02:15:55.930 --> 02:16:02.889]  super intimidating six foot tall women, like full powered women like you. Pedophiles want control
[02:16:02.889 --> 02:16:06.730]  because they're not confident. They want a little eight year old kid is a powerful.
[02:16:06.730 --> 02:16:13.370]  You Donald Trump is not screwing kids, man. That's not his M.O. Maybe he's not anymore.
[02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:19.930]  I don't know. You said he's not anymore. What I'm telling you is I want to see.
[02:16:19.930 --> 02:16:24.490]  He's not on the flight logs. Bill Gates is 30 something times.
[02:16:25.930 --> 02:16:31.690]  Listen, you need to talk to Maria Farmer, Alex. OK, Maria, what proof? I don't know who that is.
[02:16:32.010 --> 02:16:38.170]  Well, it's because of her that you were vindicated. She is Jeffrey Epstein's secretary
[02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:43.450]  that reported him to the FBI. The only person persists. I forget all the names.
[02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:45.770]  OK, I remember that now. What does she say about Trump?
[02:16:49.530 --> 02:16:53.610]  There's two families that she had to hide from when she went into hiding, other than delay.
[02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:56.970]  One were the Clintons. The other were the Trumps.
[02:16:57.930 --> 02:17:05.050]  So so is she saying you're on air uncensored, sir? I'm asking you, what is she? Hold on.
[02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:08.330]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm saying, what did Trump do? What will he want? What will they say?
[02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:13.770]  I'm not going to say anything. All right, listen, I appreciate your call. All I know is.
[02:17:18.170 --> 02:17:22.490]  I've had the system go around with PIs and try to get people to lie about me.
[02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:29.690]  I want to see proof. That's all I'm saying. I'm not in bed to promote Trump. I'm not in league
[02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:34.090]  with Trump. I've got nothing but grief supporting Trump. And let me tell you something. Sound of
[02:17:34.090 --> 02:17:38.890]  freedom. They are legitimately censoring that coming after it, and it exposes them and they
[02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:44.010]  can't stand it. I mean, I know that intellectually and spiritually. I feel good promoting the film
[02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:48.410]  like my instinct that I used to go against my spirit. I used to always ignore it.
[02:17:48.570 --> 02:17:55.210]  Like the caller said, Donald, it's never wrong. It's just promoted. It's good. And my gut tells
[02:17:55.210 --> 02:18:00.570]  me Trump's pigheaded and thinks he knows everything and thinks he knows how to do it best.
[02:18:00.570 --> 02:18:05.210]  And then I know people that know him. Roger Stone was his wingman for 20 years.
[02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:11.050]  I'm going to leave it at that. I read in a newspaper article, Roger never told me that
[02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:17.369]  when Trump was cheating on his wife, Roger had to go out with him because Roger would be the guy
[02:18:17.369 --> 02:18:21.130]  that was the boyfriend of the girlfriend, even though it was really Trump's girlfriend.
[02:18:23.530 --> 02:18:27.530]  I read that in his article. Roger didn't tell me that. The point is, Trump likes.
[02:18:29.130 --> 02:18:33.210]  I'm not really into six foot women, but I mean, I've met Melania. She's very intimidating.
[02:18:33.210 --> 02:18:38.090]  The point is, he likes the biggest intimidating thousand horsepower woman you can get.
[02:18:38.090 --> 02:18:43.770]  That's not pedos. Pedos don't want thousand horsepower women. I like thousand horsepower
[02:18:43.770 --> 02:18:50.890]  women. But the point is, is that I don't want children. I have no attraction other than
[02:18:50.890 --> 02:18:55.050]  give him an ice cream and be nice to him and tell him, tell him, you know, little kid jokes.
[02:18:56.250 --> 02:19:00.970]  So like if there's a pedo universe, I'm on the opposite end of it.
[02:19:00.970 --> 02:19:04.810]  I'm like, take a little kid fishing, tell him jokes, have fun, you know,
[02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:07.930]  laugh at their funny jokes. They're so good that that's how Trump is.
[02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:11.210]  Trump's not screwing children and there's no evidence of it.
[02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:18.090]  Absolutely no evidence of it. And there's become this religion
[02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:21.530]  to say Trump's the worst thing on earth. And.
[02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:27.130]  I'm not going to sit here and then say Trump's the worst thing on earth.
[02:19:29.610 --> 02:19:32.730]  And then not attack the enemy. So if I've attacked
[02:19:33.690 --> 02:19:41.530]  O'Biden and the Rothschilds and the New World Order and Sadiq Khan and, you know, and Disney,
[02:19:41.530 --> 02:19:46.090]  if I've attacked them for 50 hours, then Trump gets one hour of attack.
[02:19:46.650 --> 02:19:50.410]  That's what I'm saying. It's like it's like this. Well, we're showing how good we are,
[02:19:50.410 --> 02:19:55.050]  that we spend all our time attacking Trump because, you know, we're not with him.
[02:19:55.050 --> 02:19:56.650]  We want brownie points for the system.
[02:19:58.650 --> 02:20:02.250]  There's a headline, Trump banned Jeffrey Epstein from our logo after sex criminal
[02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:08.810]  hit on minors daughter book claims. Yeah, I know all the inside baseball from Roger.
[02:20:10.410 --> 02:20:14.010]  And. I think it was like 15, 20 years ago.
[02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:18.570]  They're there in Florida next to his club. He gets invited to Epstein's house.
[02:20:22.330 --> 02:20:25.530]  I think Roger said he was there. So he gets there with Trump. They walk in
[02:20:26.250 --> 02:20:32.010]  and Trump goes, man, this guy's really nice to let all the little kids in the neighborhood
[02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:36.970]  swim in his pool. And Trump was there 30 seconds. He goes, where's the parents?
[02:20:38.490 --> 02:20:41.770]  And Trump said, let's get out of here. And they ran out of the place. I mean,
[02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:46.410]  Donald Trump wasn't in Moscow or St. Petersburg being peed on.
[02:20:47.530 --> 02:20:50.730]  Donald Trump doesn't screw children. Give me a break.
[02:20:53.369 --> 02:20:56.650]  You think Donald Trump feels big conquering a child?
[02:20:56.650 --> 02:20:58.570]  That's the pedophiles that get off on that.
[02:20:59.530 --> 02:21:07.289]  I mean, I know psychology folks, a globalist scumbag gets off on conquering a child and
[02:21:07.289 --> 02:21:12.810]  stealing their innocence. Donald Trump wants the biggest, most aggressive
[02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:18.410]  Marilyn Monroe flamethrowing woman to conquer. He wants the big kahuna. You know, I know,
[02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:25.050]  because that's what I want. I want the big flame breathing woman, man, the full deal.
[02:21:25.050 --> 02:21:29.369]  I don't want some little chicken woman, some little I don't want a teenager girl.
[02:21:29.369 --> 02:21:34.410]  I sure as hell don't want some kid. I want a woman, a woman, the big thing,
[02:21:34.410 --> 02:21:40.570]  the big one with the big hips, the big breasts, the big air, the big lips, the big eyes, the big,
[02:21:40.570 --> 02:21:46.970]  big, big. And I'm not here in some defense of Trump. I just know Trump and know what he likes.
[02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:54.170]  He's the opposite of a PETA. But I think the caller raises something really important.
[02:21:54.170 --> 02:21:58.970]  I bet the caller's right. I bet they do dredge up. They've already got all these freakazoid
[02:21:58.970 --> 02:22:04.010]  claiming Trump tried to rape him. I bet they do dredge up them saying he screwed some kid.
[02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:07.369]  In fact, I bet that's the next because they know we're aware of their pedophilia.
[02:22:07.369 --> 02:22:11.130]  We know they're aware of Big Mike. We know we're aware of the Clintons, the Podestas.
[02:22:11.130 --> 02:22:18.650]  I think that caller is super right. I bet they come out and say Donald Trump is screwing kids.
[02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:24.650]  I actually think that's true because that's the one thing they think will turn us against Trump.
[02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:27.450]  And if I ever see evidence, I don't mean some deep fake, folks,
[02:22:27.450 --> 02:22:31.610]  because they could show you a deep fake of me raping a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:35.450]  They could show a deep fake of me having sex with Santa Claus, folks.
[02:22:35.450 --> 02:22:40.890]  They could show a deep fake of me raping the Virgin Mary. It's not real, okay?
[02:22:43.450 --> 02:22:46.650]  I'm lusting after a ribeye steak right now, not kids.
[02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:54.730]  Like in my chain, it's like ribeye steak, my wife, he goes down, sunset.
[02:22:55.289 --> 02:23:00.330]  Children aren't even on the menu. But the point is, ribeye steaks and baked potatoes are like
[02:23:00.330 --> 02:23:06.410]  right at the top. I'm sorry, maybe a double vodka with a lemon. But the point is, is that
[02:23:06.410 --> 02:23:10.330]  we have to get to the point of just getting smart here.
[02:23:12.570 --> 02:23:17.450]  Rich and Evan and John, Jim and Hammer, I got to get to you. I'm out of control today.
[02:23:17.529 --> 02:23:22.250]  But the callers are amazing. We didn't cover a lot of the news, though. Boy, it was amazing.
[02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:25.610]  We'll try to hit some of it. Maybe I'll just take over the fourth hour. Probably will.
[02:23:25.610 --> 02:23:29.210]  In fact, let's just do that. Rich in New Jersey, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[02:23:30.330 --> 02:23:33.050]  Hey, Alex, nice to talk to you finally. I've listened to you for years.
[02:23:34.570 --> 02:23:38.410]  You mentioned that we're in a one party system or moving towards it.
[02:23:39.369 --> 02:23:44.490]  We've been there in New Jersey. I ran for a local office in New Jersey.
[02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:51.770]  I ran for a state office in the eighth largest county in New Jersey. And I can tell you the
[02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:58.170]  Republican Party doesn't exist. There's in my county, Camden County, there are thirty five
[02:23:58.170 --> 02:24:08.490]  towns and twelve of those about a third of them have no municipal chair. The county chair does
[02:24:08.490 --> 02:24:16.410]  everything in his or her power, depending upon it, to not help you win. And it's to the point
[02:24:16.410 --> 02:24:21.369]  now where I talked to other candidates that ran. I'm not running this year, but I ran in the past
[02:24:21.369 --> 02:24:27.130]  and I talked to other candidates. And it's almost like these municipal chairs or these county chairs
[02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:32.170]  work for the other side. Oh, absolutely. So talk about what you see in New Jersey,
[02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:38.170]  because New Jersey or Michigan or even New York is a perfect example of Republicans are
[02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:43.369]  vestigial. Look at California. The few Republicans that won House seats get indicted. So absolutely.
[02:24:43.369 --> 02:24:49.210]  The Democratic Party is outlawing the two party system. Yeah, I mean, so a couple of years ago,
[02:24:49.210 --> 02:24:54.890]  I ran for state assembly in my district. The people I ran against have been in for 20 years,
[02:24:54.890 --> 02:25:02.170]  20 plus years. And I sat down with the chair and also the finance director. And I said,
[02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:07.450]  well, I know you're not going to help me. I know you're not going to you're going to disappear
[02:25:07.450 --> 02:25:11.690]  after I commit and sign on a dotted line. But I listen to your show all the time and you always
[02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:16.890]  say it starts at the local level. So I want to I want to get involved. I did it at a municipal
[02:25:16.890 --> 02:25:24.490]  level. I did that state level. And it is so hard because you ask for help. I even said to them,
[02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:28.170]  I said, listen, can you give me five hundred bucks so I can get seated so I can get a website
[02:25:28.170 --> 02:25:34.010]  up? I put so much money out of my own pocket to get started. And I have a small business.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:37.369]  And remember, they're raising they're getting huge amounts from the RNC,
[02:25:37.369 --> 02:25:41.210]  but giving nothing to candidates. Well, that's just it. In other words,
[02:25:41.210 --> 02:25:48.330]  I looked at the Republican and Democratic Party as like franchises. And, you know, some something
[02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:54.890]  does have to filter down to the local levels. And, you know, I came to the party with and I got
[02:25:54.890 --> 02:26:00.410]  chastised by Republicans that which I won't name their names. But, you know, there's some good ones
[02:26:00.410 --> 02:26:05.610]  out there in New Jersey. But some of the major guys that have been in power in New Jersey for
[02:26:05.610 --> 02:26:13.369]  years, lawyers and high end businessmen, I said to them, here's two things that I that I would like
[02:26:13.369 --> 02:26:18.650]  to do when I get in that I want to do one. Everybody talks about term limits. OK, fine.
[02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:24.010]  You know, you do what you can in two term limits. And then halfway through your second term limit,
[02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:31.290]  you kind of feed you kind of bring along the next person and say, here, continue my my my journey.
[02:26:31.290 --> 02:26:35.690]  But the other thing I said and I asked is very facetiously, I said to them,
[02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:40.570]  why why are we spending millions of dollars? In my case, I raised fifty thousand dollars
[02:26:40.570 --> 02:26:44.330]  against the Democratic chief at three hundred three million dollars. I said,
[02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:50.490]  why are we spending millions of dollars to get a seat that pays us fifty thousand dollars a year?
[02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:53.850]  And they kind of like chuckled. Like, well, what do you mean? Like they were kind of like
[02:26:54.490 --> 02:26:57.850]  like dumbfounded. I asked that question. I said, I know the answer to that question.
[02:26:57.850 --> 02:27:02.170]  I'm not an idiot. I'm a businessman. I know the answer. But here's what I propose.
[02:27:02.810 --> 02:27:09.050]  Why don't we come down? We have an agreement between both parties. And we say, you know what?
[02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:16.810]  You cannot raise or spend more than one year's worth of salary for any position from from,
[02:27:16.810 --> 02:27:20.810]  you know, very local level all the way up to a presidential, whatever it is,
[02:27:20.810 --> 02:27:25.050]  because the millions of dollars are spent. We know why they're spending it, because it's it's
[02:27:25.050 --> 02:27:29.210]  certainly you understand the problem with that model. In the past, it was a problem
[02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:36.490]  because back then, if you do campaign caps, then the corporate media will promote your enemy and
[02:27:36.490 --> 02:27:39.850]  give them free advertisement and beat you. But now, because the corporate media is broken
[02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:44.010]  and we have freedom online, we could actually have donation caps.
[02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:48.730]  Thank you so much for the call. We're going to go to break and then we're going to go to Evan,
[02:27:48.730 --> 02:27:53.050]  John, Curtis, Jim and Hammer. And that's it for calls. I got a few other news stories,
[02:27:53.610 --> 02:27:57.369]  way more than a few. I was going to hit, but there's no way to do justice. But I'll
[02:27:57.369 --> 02:28:01.850]  try. I mean, it's amazing what we've got ready for you. And then in the fourth hour.
[02:28:02.090 --> 02:28:06.010]  We have in the fourth hour, I forgot who's taking over. Kate Daly's always amazing.
[02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:09.770]  I'll probably take a little bit of her time. And I and I didn't do this. I only plugged once.
[02:28:09.770 --> 02:28:14.330]  The first hour didn't plug in the second hour. We have a little silver, highest quality,

[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:56.920]  Out here in the fields. I fight for my meals. I get my back into my living.
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:01.920]  I don't have to fight. I don't need to fight.
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:03.920]  To prove I'm right.
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:07.920]  To prove I'm right.
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:12.920]  I don't need to be forgiven.
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:14.920]  Certainly not by Hollywood and the Left.
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:17.920]  Only God forgives me, not you.
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:20.920]  Alright, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:24.920]  Man, I really want to hit the pedo stack today.
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:27.920]  I mean, man, these people are sick.
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:31.920]  They all got that look to them.
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:34.920]  They'll be defeated.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:37.920]  Because they're never going to stop pushing until we stop them.
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:39.920]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:41.920]  Evan in California, thanks for holding your own here.
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:46.920]  Stopping the New World Order and the Trump indictment. What's your view?
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:49.920]  This is Evan the Evangelist. Nice to talk to you again.
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:51.920]  I want to make a quick comment.
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:54.920]  I met Donald Trump in 1994 on a movie set.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:58.920]  He's the guy you described. I love the guy like a brother.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:01.920]  He's a great guy and I know what the pedo vibe is.
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:04.920]  That ain't him. He's a fantastic guy.
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:07.920]  I want to make a comment in fighting the New World Order.
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:10.920]  There's roughly 70 million Catholics.
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:16.920]  And if a couple of them instead of working towards the New World Order were against it,
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:18.920]  it would be a huge swing.
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:23.920]  The Pope is running the New World Order, the spiritual wing.
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.920]  He was getting people to take the vaccines.
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:30.920]  The Catholic Charities is trafficking kids across their southern border.
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:33.920]  And people don't really want to talk about this, but I'm an evangelist.
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:36.920]  I like bragging about Christ, not about some building.
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:40.920]  So I think it's super important if your listeners knew something.
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:46.920]  And that is that people like Lady Gaga and Bono, they're in good standing with the Catholic Church.
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:47.920]  So is Joe Biden.
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:59.920]  So people need to realize that Catholics should be following Christ, not a church led by a Pope saying that there is no hell.
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:04.920]  Even though Jesus said more about hell than he did heaven, they're essentially calling him a liar.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:08.920]  They say he isn't quite kind enough, so he might want to follow the Virgin Mary instead.
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:17.920]  So a big thing that Catholics need to do is become part of the solution instead of the mover of the problem, essentially.
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:24.920]  And they're giving political cover for the New World Order's religion.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:32.920]  And, you know, Augustine, 300 years after Christ, made it the state religion.
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:35.920]  People talk a lot about the different paganist things.
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:46.920]  But one thing I want to point out, that it was Gregory I in 600 AD, 600 years after Christ, he came up with the doctrine of purgatory.
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:51.920]  So essentially, he put people in bondage that Christ had set free.
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:54.920]  So now, out of fear, they're in the Catholic Church.
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:57.920]  Out of fear, they give money to the Catholic Church.
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:00.920]  I say they'd be a lot better off giving money to Infowars.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.920]  And I just, you know, people don't want to say this stuff because it seems like you're attacking Catholics.
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:08.920]  I was raised a Catholic, and then I came to Christ.
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:16.920]  So people realize that they're running cover for the New World Order when they say they're Catholics.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.920]  And I pointed out before to you, Alex, that the LGBT was running cover from the pedo-movement.
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:29.920]  When you talk to a Catholic family member, you should say, hey, do you realize that your church is promoting the New World Order?
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:30.920]  Do you realize that?
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:35.920]  And they should come to Christ in a way that makes them not an enemy of Christ.
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:39.920]  I believe it's the doctrine of demons, the Catholic Church.
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  And like I say, I love Catholics.
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:43.920]  I've known a lot of Catholics and counseled them.
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:45.920]  And when they were on their deathbed, I—
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:48.920]  Sure, well, there's no doubt the current pub in the whole system.
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.920]  But you look at the play they use to take over the Catholic Church, but the same play to take over everything.
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:58.920]  The Boy Scouts, our colleges, our public schools, I mean, it's all an attack on our children.
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.920]  A pedophile cult.
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:02.920]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:03.920]  Great point, sir.
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:04.920]  All right.
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:05.920]  John in Nebraska.
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:06.920]  Thank you for calling.
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:07.920]  You're on the air.
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:08.920]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.920]  Topic for tomorrow, 54th anniversary of the fake moon landing.
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.920]  Maybe have Stanley Kubrick, his daughter, on.
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:22.920]  You know, I've talked to Vivian Kubrick.
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:25.920]  She doesn't know anything about 2001 Space Odyssey.
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:27.920]  She's in the movie, but she's three years old.
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:31.920]  Well, I'm not talking about the movie 2001.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:32.920]  No, no, no.
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:35.920]  I know, but they say, like, he shot that and he shot this.
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:37.920]  Guys, type in Vivian Kubrick 2001.
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:40.920]  Like, he makes a phone call from a space station to his daughter.
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.920]  It's a video phone call.
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:43.920]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:48.920]  Well, Bart Shibrel is probably the best one on the fake moon landing.
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:52.920]  Oh, and by the way, the last caller, yeah, right on on the Catholic thing.
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:56.920]  I've been on this warpath for 40-plus years.
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:57.920]  Well, isn't it funny?
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:00.920]  India tried to land something a few years ago and it blew up.
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:02.920]  Now they're sending another probe.
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:06.920]  Why can't anybody else get something on the moon?
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:07.920]  It all blows up.
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:11.920]  They're like, is somebody blowing it up or what's happening?
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:19.920]  You need to get Stu Peters or Owen Benjamin's opinion on the moon landing.
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:23.920]  I know you had them both on recently, and, of course, they wouldn't touch the topic
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:27.920]  because you immediately lose credibility.
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:36.920]  But this gentleman who was saying in truth that everything in the Bible is true,
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:44.920]  it's kind of interesting that the Bible in Genesis 1-16, talking about the moon here,
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:48.920]  it said that God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:52.920]  and the lesser light to rule the night.
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:54.920]  The moon gives its own light.
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:40:01.920]  And I'd just be curious if Stu Peters, who claims to be now on his own show,
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:06.920]  a globe skeptic, if you would look into this.
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:10.920]  I know how crazy it sounds, and I didn't mean to get off on it,
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:13.920]  but I just thought tomorrow the moon landing was going to be a big deal.
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:14.920]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:15.920]  But let me just say this.
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:16.920]  Let me just say this.
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:19.920]  Look at my head right now.
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:21.920]  This is actually flat.
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:25.920]  It's an optical illusion that it's round.
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:26.920]  I agree.
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:27.920]  It's all flat.
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:30.920]  I'm just saying those two guys.
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:33.920]  I don't follow all that enough, man.
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:36.920]  Listen, I've been up at 50,000 feet in a private plane,
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:38.920]  and I've seen the curvature of the earth.
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:40.920]  I'm not going to debate that.
[02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:43.920]  I can't get folks to admit that the COVID shot doesn't work.
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:46.920]  So just the whole globe thing is just too much.
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:47.920]  I appreciate your call.
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:52.920]  My head is not round.
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:53.920]  It's flat.
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:55.920]  How do you prove it?
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:58.920]  Well, I mean, at a certain level it all looks round,
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:40:59.920]  but it's just really flat.
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:01.920]  It's a realm.
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:03.920]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Curtis in Minnesota.
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:05.920]  Curtis, thanks for calling.
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  Go ahead.
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:10.920]  Hey, Jesse Ventura, when he wrote his last book,
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:11.920]  I went to the book signing.
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.920]  It was up in St. Cloud, Minnesota.
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:17.920]  And I got there just before he arrived.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:21.920]  So I went back to the front door and I saw this limo pulling up,
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:23.920]  and I knew it was him.
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:26.920]  So I stood there and I held the door open for him and his wife when they
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:27.920]  came in.
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:30.920]  And you know what?
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:36.920]  He came in and he told the story about the CIA interviewing him right
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:38.920]  away when he first became governor,
[02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:40.920]  and they wanted to know all about his campaign.
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:44.920]  I was in the bottom of the basement after I'd been elected.
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:46.920]  And in came the CIA.
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.920]  It was like 20 people who looked like old ladies and normal people.
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:53.920]  And they said, wonder how you won.
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:55.920]  Yeah.
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:57.920]  So anyways, when I held that door open.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:41:58.920]  I was a Navy SEAL.
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.920]  I was a warrior.
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:01.920]  I was a fighter.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:05.920]  Alex, that's a great imitation, but I'm trying to get to something here.
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  I held the door open and I spoke to his wife.
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:13.920]  And she had an eye on me the entire time he was giving his speech.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:15.920]  She took my pictures.
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:17.920]  She was taking pictures of the crowd.
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:20.920]  And Jesse puts his wife on a pedestal.
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:24.920]  And he and his wife have been under attack,
[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:27.920]  and I think that's why he's totally turned the way he's turned.
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:30.920]  And I could be wrong, but, you know,
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:33.920]  she's been having seizures and he's been treating that.
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:34.920]  No, no, no.
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:35.920]  He treats his wife well.
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:36.920]  She's a nice lady.
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:37.920]  I don't think she's his handler.
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:39.920]  She's a great lady.
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:40.920]  No, not a handler.
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:44.920]  But, you know, I think she kind of wears the pants in the family.
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:47.920]  And I think she's spooked by all this crap.
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:51.920]  I mean, they have assassinated his reputation.
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:52.920]  They've been through a lot.
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:54.920]  And bless you, too.
[02:42:54.920 --> 02:42:57.920]  I mean, you guys, at the tip of the spear, you know, Jesse ran that show.
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:42:59.920]  They attack leadership.
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:01.920]  And this country is hurting for leadership.
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:03.920]  And without leadership, people have nothing.
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:04.920]  Okay?
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:07.920]  Well, I think Jesse's a good guy, and I appreciate your call, brother.
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:11.920]  Yeah, no, I know Jesse's wife well.
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:12.920]  Hung out a lot with her.
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:13.920]  Nice lady.
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:16.920]  I saw him on Theo Vaughn's show this year.
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.920]  Like, I believe everyone should be made to take the shot.
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:24.920]  You shouldn't be able to leave your house if you don't take it.
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:30.920]  Meanwhile, I was on shows with Alex and experts predicting the lockdown
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:32.920]  and the fourth shot.
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:34.920]  Why did I do that?
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:36.920]  I don't know.
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:41.920]  But I'm a Navy SEAL, and I'm a fighter.
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:49.920]  And so I think Americans should let Big Pharma put in their body whatever they want.
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:53.920]  Because I'm a Navy SEAL, and I'm a fighter.
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:55.920]  And that's all I'm saying.
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.920]  All right?
[02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:03.920]  I think they should put in our bodies whatever they want.
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:13.920]  I think they should put in our bodies whatever they want.
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:15.920]  Ooh, baby.
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:17.920]  I'm going crazy today.
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:19.920]  I should look like Benjamin Franklin like him.
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:21.920]  I should grow like, oh, that's it.
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:23.920]  That's my new hairstyle.
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:26.920]  I'm going to grow a big mullet and like Benjamin Franklin hair.
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.920]  Oh, my God, it'll be obnoxious.
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:32.920]  I like Jesse.
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:35.920]  But I know the inside baseball.
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.920]  He did his first and second True TVs.
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:40.920]  They got huge ratings.
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:46.920]  And they came and said, next we're doing two macabras and things like that.
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:49.920]  And if you don't want to be involved in that, fine, you're not involved.
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.920]  And I said, fine.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:56.920]  And they said, they want you to do the series, but it's going to be on UFOs.
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:57.920]  And I said, no, thank you.
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:58.920]  I don't want some TV show.
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:00.920]  Big deal.
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:04.920]  I was like, Jesse, I've already hosted like five History Channel and two
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:06.920]  Discovery Channel shows.
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:10.920]  I know you only think your two TV show is the only one that's big.
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:12.920]  But I've already hosted like five, six shows.
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:15.920]  Did you know that?
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:16.920]  No, I did not know that.
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:20.920]  Only I have TV show.
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:23.920]  I ignore all of this stuff, man.
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:25.920]  None of it means anything to me.
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:31.920]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:32.920]  All right.
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:35.920]  Let's talk to Jim in South Carolina.
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:38.920]  Woo!
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:41.920]  You're on the air, Jim.
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:42.920]  All right.
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:45.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.920]  Long time listener.
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:47.920]  First time caller.
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  You have done well all day, though.
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:46:00.920]  I came across some information this afternoon with a fellow named Derek Johnson.
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:05.920]  He's a retired military disabled veteran.
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:07.920]  His name is Derek Johnson?
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:08.920]  Yeah, Derek Johnson.
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:10.920]  Do you want a D-E-R?
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:11.920]  No, I got it.
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:12.920]  I'm just writing it down.
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:13.920]  What did he say?
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:14.920]  Derek Johnson.
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:21.920]  Well, he came out with the information as far as President Trump and the inauguration
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:28.920]  ceremonies on January 20th.
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:37.920]  President Trump left the White House with Melania, red carpet treatment, flew out to
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:41.920]  Andrews Air Force Base, red carpet again.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:54.920]  Official gun battery salute, 21-gun salute, whereas Biden never received a 21-gun salute
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  on his inauguration.
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:58.920]  It was very strange, and no one was there, yes.
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:00.920]  Yeah, I know.
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:02.920]  Nobody.
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:10.920]  And he was sworn in before noon, whereas it's against the Constitution.
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:15.920]  One term begins, ends at noon, and the other begins.
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:18.920]  And he was actually sworn in before noon.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:23.920]  You know, two men having the babies, kind of protocol being in order.
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:24.920]  Yeah.
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:34.920]  I mean, I was thrilled with this realization that he's put forth as far as President Trump
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:45.920]  and the executive orders that he has put in place, and that whoever is impersonating
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:49.920]  Biden there, I mean, you can look at the before and afters.
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:53.920]  He's completely different, especially the earlobes.
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:55.920]  If you look at them, they say his eyes.
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:58.920]  And next you're going to tell me that Big Mike's got a big old pecker?
[02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:01.920]  You know he does, right?
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:03.920]  Well, basically drags the ground, yeah.
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:04.920]  It's like a trunk.
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:06.920]  It's an elephant.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.920]  Well, listen, Big Mike's not actually a man.
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:10.920]  It's actually an elephant.
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:14.920]  So that thing bouncing around in the pants is actually an elephant trunk.
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:15.920]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:16.920]  Yeah.
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.920]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:25.920]  Yeah, you know, they don't care about protocol in the law.
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:29.920]  So anybody that says, oh, Trump's secretly still in, and you know, this is...
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:34.920]  In the real world, the country's being butchered right now.
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:35.920]  And I get it.
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:36.920]  We're in the twilight zone.
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:42.920]  So all I know is what Donald said earlier.
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.920]  Not Donald Trump, the caller from Maryland.
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:49.920]  God's the only thing that's going to fix this.
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:53.920]  Hammer in Maine, you're on the air.
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:54.920]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.920]  I'm trying, brother.
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:48:57.920]  All right.
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:48:59.920]  Two reasons for calling.
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:08.920]  One, I'd like to remind listeners about our power and sovereignty that we hold under Jesus Christ to not forget.
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:14.920]  And remember what a president is, to preside as commander in chief.
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  He sets the tone.
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:17.920]  Right.
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:21.920]  So that being said, you know, like stands in meter.
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:27.920]  Our primary focus, I believe, should be to, like you're saying, don't fight this.
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:30.920]  And we're fighting powers and principalities.
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:37.920]  Destroy the rage against God's children, that rage to consume it, because they don't have Jesus Christ.
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:48.920]  That being said, to expose their occultism, remember all the names they use in articles, you know, they're fancy nonsense, to incite and generate discord.
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:55.920]  So I was actually a victim of satanic ritual abuse, a survivor for over 20-plus years.
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:57.920]  I won't get into it too deep.
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:49:58.920]  That's interesting.
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:49:59.920]  Tell us about it.
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:00.920]  All right.
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:08.920]  Well, my stepfather, he used to do a lot of stuff to me when I was sleeping and all of that.
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:12.920]  And the guy was just like flat-out dark personality.
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:15.920]  And he was a smith, if you know what I mean.
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:20.920]  Well, I don't know what a smith is.
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:21.920]  What does that mean?
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:25.920]  Well, you know, like a blacksmith to, you know, build and construct.
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:26.920]  Right?
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:40.920]  So it led me to rites and rituals of—he was involved in the consumption of what I refer to as the soma, what they try to get off of infants.
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:47.920]  And the cellular junk, you know, the stuff, the angel hair that comes off babies.
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:55.920]  So they would consume this stuff, like the adrenochrome stuff, too, and it would cause the hallucinations like ayahuasca and all of that.
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:59.920]  So the rites and rituals are really to consume power.
[02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:06.920]  But upon doing that and crossing that threshold, they actually deny Jesus Christ and God, which is 100% positive.
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:08.920]  So why would you deny Christ?
[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:10.920]  Okay.
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:21.920]  So the freedom—I'm jumping around a little, but the Freedom of Information Act was for positivity and to let people worship how they may.
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:24.920]  It was never to hurt kids or perform satanic rites.
[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:27.920]  And we got to keep that on the forefront of our thinking.
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:31.920]  Now, Roe v. Wade and their sacrifice stuff, right?
[02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:41.920]  So they—you can clearly see how upset they are with denying them of their material—
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:42.920]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:46.920]  I mean, the satanic church, all of them just came out last week and said, it is our sacrament.
[02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:49.920]  And then the leftist reverend was saying, we need to kill babies.
[02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:51.920]  I mean, they're demons.
[02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:54.920]  Yeah, they're pissed, man.
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:52:01.920]  I think from there, it's important to jump back into the Twilight speak or double speak that they use.
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:08.920]  Because Obama, during his 2015 State of the Union, I think it was, before Trump got in,
[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:13.920]  man, you could clearly hear that guy say that they were going to execute some kind of shock.
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:15.920]  Oh, we have a shock.
[02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:18.920]  And all of you got invested in it, blah, blah, blah.
[02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:20.920]  And then everybody gets up and cheers, man.
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:22.920]  They all clap for it.
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:25.920]  I'm going to coin a new term for all the leftist sexualization of children.
[02:52:25.920 --> 02:52:27.920]  It's pedo-speak.
[02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:29.920]  Pedo-speak.
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:34.920]  So now when Levine promotes cutting kids' balls off, it's pedo-speak.
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:36.920]  Let's go to this clip of pedo-speak.
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:38.920]  In fact, I'm going to cue up here when you're done.
[02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:41.920]  We're going to have a few clips here of pedo-speak here today.
[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:44.920]  We're coining the term now.
[02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:46.920]  They can't stand it.
[02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:47.920]  I've got a bunch of pedo-clips.
[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:50.920]  That's what I call it on my list when I have this clip.
[02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:53.920]  Let's see how many pedo-clips I got.
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:56.920]  Oh, God, we got some pedo-clips here.
[02:52:56.920 --> 02:53:00.920]  So we're going to have some pedo-speak for you.
[02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:04.920]  Oh, yeah, we got a lot of pedo-speak here today.
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:05.920]  So keep going.
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:06.920]  Sorry.
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:08.920]  Yeah, no worries.
[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:14.920]  So another point I wanted to make, I think it's super important for us to remember that we're all God's children.
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:18.920]  Even the scum in this, we're supposed to pray even for our enemies.
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:27.920]  All those young trans kids that are finding this, it's not death metal or punk rock or any of that stuff like when we were younger.
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:32.920]  It's now inside, and they're questioning biological truths.
[02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:40.920]  So they really got in, and we're not going to let it fly anymore, right?
[02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:41.920]  Absolutely.
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:46.920]  We're in their cult just because we're on the planet they control, and they're literally teaching us men are not real.
[02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:47.920]  Women are not real.
[02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:49.920]  We're going to teach children how to have sex.
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:50.920]  We're going to teach them all this.
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:51.920]  It's a sick cult.
[02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:52.920]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:54.920]  All right.
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:59.920]  Kate Daly is about to take over the fourth hour, but I did not get to the pedo stack today.
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:01.920]  I did not get to the environmental power grab stack today.
[02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:06.920]  I did not get to the Biden abolishes popular tax break.
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:11.920]  Biden abolishes popular tax break for many retirement savers.
[02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:14.920]  Now he's taking people's 401ks.
[02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:16.920]  How liberal.
[02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:22.920]  Oh, you're getting free tuition, but we're going to take the retirees money.
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:24.920]  You're not going to get a free education.
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:25.920]  You're not going to get.
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:31.920]  They're going to take everything and just stop being chumps.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.920]  And I know a regular audience are not chumps.
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:40.920]  I'm saying the people that buy this crap, come on, man, to quote Joe Biden.
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:45.920]  So I'm going to take a few minutes in the next hour to hit all this.
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:46.920]  But just look at this guy.
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:50.920]  This is the guy that came out against the sound of freedom.
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:54.920]  He writes all these articles defending pedophiles.
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:01.920]  And he now is upset that he's being attacked.
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:07.920]  But just if I need a babysitter.
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:11.920]  There's one guy I call.
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:13.920]  You know, if you need the Ghostbusters, call this guy.
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:19.920]  But let me tell you, this is a very nice person.
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:21.920]  Very nice person.
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:26.920]  And this is all they could get to attack sound of freedom is this guy.
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:28.920]  Who are we going to have attack sound of freedom?
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:32.920]  Well, there's that reporter that apologizes for pedophilia.
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:34.920]  He's the perfect guy.
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:35.920]  Let's get him right on that.
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:38.920]  When the public sees that, they'll think this movie's fake.
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:43.920]  So a guy's like, I defend and apologize for pedophiles.
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:45.920]  And your movie doesn't exist.
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:48.920]  There's no pedophiles.
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:52.920]  Say that again.
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:55.920]  I'm apologizing for pedos, but they don't exist.
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:58.920]  The devil's greatest trick is what?
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:01.920]  He does not exist.
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:05.920]  Bloomberg sound of freedom hit piece written by pro pedo contributor.
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:07.920]  Big article on that.
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:09.920]  What a nice person.
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:13.920]  YouTube is pulling sound of freedom interviews and reviews.
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:16.920]  And I mean, it's like mainline Fox News videos, you name it.
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:18.920]  Pulling them, pulling them, pulling them, pulling them.
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:19.920]  The movie's good.
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:20.920]  The movie's true.
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:22.920]  They're upset, folks.
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:23.920]  Sound of freedom racing.
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:24.920]  85 million.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:25.920]  It's 100 million now.
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:26.920]  Two weeks.
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:31.920]  Only movie outside Christmas season to ever see second weekend ticket sales increase 35%.
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:33.920]  It's a symbol of the death of Hollywood.
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:35.920]  But there's this man.
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:37.920]  He likes you.
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:41.920]  Former spokesperson for pedophile advocacy group writes Bloomberg hit piece targeting
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:43.920]  any child sex trafficking film.
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:45.920]  Sound of freedom.
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:49.920]  That's little shoes Bloomberg.
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:50.920]  That's Trump's nickname.
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:52.920]  Little shoes Bloomberg.
[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:54.920]  What's that mean?
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:57.920]  Oh, I know what little shoes means.
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:02.920]  I wasn't told by Bloomberg security detail what little shoes means.
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:06.920]  Little shoes Bloomberg.
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:08.920]  But look at this nice man.
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:10.920]  He's not creepy or anything.
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:13.920]  The Wonder Woman author normalizing pedophilia.
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:14.920]  Look at this article.
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:16.920]  That's three years ago.
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:17.920]  Two years ago.
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:21.920]  What a nice man.
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:22.920]  What a nice.
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:25.920]  And he's battling that sound of freedom.
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:28.920]  Thank goodness.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:34.920]  Thank goodness we've got good people like him.
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:35.920]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:36.920]  More news.
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:37.920]  I'm going to hit.
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:39.920]  And then Kate Nally takes over.
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:40.920]  Silver bullet.
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:41.920]  Three years sold out.
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:42.920]  Discounted.
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  Available.
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:44.920]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:49.920]  With all the craziness in the world.
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:50.920]  The collapsing borders.
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:52.920]  The war with Russia.
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:53.920]  The insanity.
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:55.920]  The currency devaluations.
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:57:56.920]  The economy going crazy.
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:02.920]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self defense.
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:04.920]  Now we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:07.920]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:09.920]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:13.920]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:15.920]  This is something you need now.
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:19.920]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:21.920]  The highest quality food.
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:25.920]  The best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:33.920]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:36.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:37.920]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:40.920]  At 10% off it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:46.920]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[02:58:46.920 --> 02:58:51.920]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:58:51.920 --> 02:58:54.920]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:58:54.920 --> 02:58:56.920]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:58:56.920 --> 02:58:58.920]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:58:58.920 --> 02:59:00.920]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:02.920]  What's better, down and out?
[02:59:02.920 --> 02:59:03.920]  What's better?
[02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:05.920]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:10.920]  The answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:13.920]  So one person might like this coffee.
[02:59:13.920 --> 02:59:14.920]  Another person likes that coffee.
[02:59:14.920 --> 02:59:16.920]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:59:16.920 --> 02:59:17.920]  They're all very diverse.
[02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:22.920]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love.
[02:59:22.920 --> 02:59:28.920]  And sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:31.920]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds.
[02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:33.920]  Gives you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[02:59:33.920 --> 02:59:38.920]  And it's in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.
[02:59:38.920 --> 02:59:42.920]  So get your Infowars MD Good Night Sleep today at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:48.920 --> 02:59:53.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:53.920 --> 02:59:55.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.800 --> 03:00:12.800]  Man, listen to Chuck Berry.
[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:25.800]  See down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:32.800]  but he can play guitar just like he's ringing the bells.
[03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:35.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go, go.
[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:38.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go, go.
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:41.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go, go.
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:44.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:47.800]  Johnny B. Goode.
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:51.800]  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:54.800]  or sit beneath a tree by the railroad track.
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:57.800]  Gold engine, everything glistening in the shade,
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:00.800]  strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.
[03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:03.800]  The people passing by, they would stop and say,
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:06.800]  oh my, was that a little country boy to play.
[03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:07.800]  Go, go.
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:10.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go, go.
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:13.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go, go.
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:16.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:19.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:21.800]  Johnny B. Goode.
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:24.800]  We're going to blow up the New World Order.
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:26.800]  Let's get ready for that.
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:28.800]  Because you know we're not turning back.
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:30.800]  You know it's not a bluff, you bastards.
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:32.800]  We're going to eat your guts.
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:37.800]  This dog will hunt.
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:53.800]  You will be the leader of a big old band.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:01:57.800]  Kate Daly's about to take over.
[03:01:57.800 --> 03:01:58.800]  Listen to this right now.
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:01.800]  His mother told him someday you will be a man.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:04.800]  And you will be the leader of a big old band.
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:07.800]  Many people coming from miles around
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:10.800]  to hear you play your music when the sun go down.
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:13.800]  Maybe someday your name will be in lights saying,
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:15.800]  Johnny B. Goode tonight.
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:16.800]  Go, go.
[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:18.800]  Go, Johnny, go.
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:20.800]  Go, go, go, Johnny, go.
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:23.800]  Go, Johnny, go, go, go.
[03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:24.800]  Go, go.
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:26.800]  Yeah, I'm going to stick with the humans.
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:28.800]  The God that made us.
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:30.800]  That's just the way I am.
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:32.800]  I'm a human supremacist.
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:35.800]  I'm kind of partial to my people.
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:36.800]  All right, great job to the crew.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:39.800]  We're going to end this little transmission here
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:41.800]  before Kate Daly takes over.
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:43.800]  I hit four stacks today.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:45.800]  I got about 15.
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:46.800]  And I'm going to be a good boy tomorrow.
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:48.800]  I have a feeling I'm going to come in here
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:51.800]  and hit the carbon tax, New World Order,
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:54.800]  SEG fraud stack first.
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:57.800]  And then we'll have all the other news tomorrow.
[03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:00.800]  Owen Schroer has always got the latest breaking news.
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:04.800]  He'll be on in about 55 minutes once we go to break.
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:07.800]  57 minutes right now.
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:11.800]  He'll be taking over and knocking it out of the park.
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:14.800]  And the best part of my job is I get to know this great crew.
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:16.800]  I get to know all of you, the listeners and viewers.
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:18.800]  And I get to take on the New World Order,
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:25.800]  which my cells and my soul and everything I am is meant to do.
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:28.800]  So I'm just very honored to be in attack formation.
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:30.800]  So stay in attack formation.
[03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:33.800]  All right, that's it for my segment.
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:35.800]  The great Kate Daly takes over the other side of the break.
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.800]  But first, a little promo that Darren McBreen put together.
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:41.800]  Attention, projectionists.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:47.800]  Adjust the lens so that your picture will be focused properly before the show starts.
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:51.800]  4, 3, 2, 1.
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:58.800]  Your film is now ready to be shown.
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:02.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:04.800]  Don't listen to corporate media.
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:05.800]  Don't listen to the establishment.
[03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:07.800]  Don't listen to Republican, Democrat leaders.
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:08.800]  Don't listen to think tanks.
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:10.800]  If you want to hear why they fear Infowars.com,
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:12.800]  if you want to hear why they fear Alex Jones,
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:16.800]  go to Infowars.com and actually hear my show.
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:17.800]  Watch what we say.
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:19.800]  Watch what we do.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:21.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:27.800]  Big, big, big broadcast lined up for you today.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:28.800]  So start your engines.
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:29.800]  Take the links.
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:31.800]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Bandai Video.
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:32.800]  Take clips.
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:33.800]  Share them.
[03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:34.800]  Share the articles.
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:35.800]  You're the Paul Revere.
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:36.800]  Without you, we lose.
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:38.800]  When you take action, we win.
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:40.800]  So come in for the big win now.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:43.800]  Connect to share the link now.
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:04:59.800]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:01.800]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:02.800]  They have a lot of power.
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:03.800]  But they can be defeated.
[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:06.800]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:09.800]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[03:05:09.800 --> 03:05:13.800]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink
[03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:15.800]  and that you cook with.
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:18.800]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:05:18.800 --> 03:05:20.800]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:23.800]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:05:23.800 --> 03:05:26.800]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:28.800]  to non-detectable levels.
[03:05:28.800 --> 03:05:30.800]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:32.800]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:35.800]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that exclusively
[03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:39.800]  at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System
[03:05:39.800 --> 03:05:43.800]  in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:45.800]  Get it today, and it funds the Infowar.
[03:05:45.800 --> 03:05:46.800]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:49.800]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[03:05:49.800 --> 03:05:51.800]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:53.800]  that they allow in the water supply.
[03:05:53.800 --> 03:05:56.800]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[03:06:05.800 --> 03:06:12.800]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:12.800 --> 03:06:16.800]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:19.800]  And I have so many things to talk about today.
[03:06:19.800 --> 03:06:21.800]  We've got to play a little catch-up here.
[03:06:21.800 --> 03:06:23.800]  I've got life insurance.
[03:06:23.800 --> 03:06:26.800]  Some things came out about life insurance that are very, very telling.
[03:06:26.800 --> 03:06:29.800]  Also, some things about Trump also.
[03:06:29.800 --> 03:06:33.800]  And I want to talk about what the CFR, Council on Foreign Relations,
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:35.800]  is telling you about what's going to happen.
[03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:37.800]  So, so many things today.
[03:06:37.800 --> 03:06:38.800]  Let's get started.
[03:06:38.800 --> 03:06:41.800]  If I was a member of the AP,
[03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:45.800]  I have to laugh when I say that because they're so buffoonish
[03:06:45.800 --> 03:06:48.800]  and ridiculous in their news coverage.
[03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:49.800]  The news yesterday,
[03:06:49.800 --> 03:06:54.800]  heat is testing the limits of human survival.
[03:06:54.800 --> 03:06:56.800]  It's called summer.
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:06:58.800]  It's summer.
[03:06:58.800 --> 03:06:59.800]  It's one of the four seasons.
[03:06:59.800 --> 03:07:01.800]  Let me introduce you.
[03:07:01.800 --> 03:07:05.800]  It's one of the four seasons that we always have and that we've always had.
[03:07:05.800 --> 03:07:07.800]  I know it sounds crazy.
[03:07:07.800 --> 03:07:09.800]  Like I made it up, but yeah.
[03:07:09.800 --> 03:07:11.800]  And by the way,
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:16.800]  this is not the most craziest heat you've ever been through in your whole entire life.
[03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:18.800]  It's not climate change.
[03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:22.800]  1913, it was 126 degrees.
[03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:27.800]  In 1930s, it was 119 degrees average.
[03:07:27.800 --> 03:07:28.800]  There you go.
[03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:30.800]  No climate change.
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:32.800]  It's called being cyclical.
[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:38.800]  So, I literally have 110 degree temperature outside from where I'm at right now.
[03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:40.800]  And I'm sitting in air conditioning.
[03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:42.800]  And then I get into my air conditioning car,
[03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:43.800]  and I'm still alive.
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:44.800]  Who knew?
[03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:45.800]  Oh my gosh.
[03:07:45.800 --> 03:07:47.800]  Run for the hills.
[03:07:47.800 --> 03:07:48.800]  Survival.
[03:07:48.800 --> 03:07:49.800]  Human survival.
[03:07:49.800 --> 03:07:51.800]  It's embarrassing.
[03:07:51.800 --> 03:07:52.800]  It's embarrassing.
[03:07:52.800 --> 03:07:55.800]  And all the way down to whatever local news you have,
[03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:57.800]  they're parodying this kind of crap.
[03:07:58.800 --> 03:07:59.800]  It's...
[03:07:59.800 --> 03:08:00.800]  Are you tired of it?
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:02.800]  You know, in the wheel of fear,
[03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:04.800]  malaria is back.
[03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:05.800]  The heat.
[03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:07.800]  I mean, they are running out of things,
[03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:08.800]  and they're a little arsenal.
[03:08:08.800 --> 03:08:10.800]  It's embarrassing.
[03:08:10.800 --> 03:08:12.800]  Anyway, so be very afraid of arsenal...
[03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:13.800]  Not arsenal.
[03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:15.800]  Be very afraid of malaria.
[03:08:15.800 --> 03:08:17.800]  Yes, that's making a comeback for sure.
[03:08:17.800 --> 03:08:21.800]  And now that the very glittery month of June is over,
[03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:23.800]  all I'm going to say about that
[03:08:23.800 --> 03:08:25.800]  is that we have seen the village,
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:27.800]  and we don't want it raising our kids.
[03:08:27.800 --> 03:08:28.800]  Thanks.
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:29.800]  Yeah.
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:30.800]  That was...
[03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:32.800]  I want my eyeballs to be washed.
[03:08:32.800 --> 03:08:33.800]  Oh my gosh.
[03:08:33.800 --> 03:08:36.800]  What a weird month that was, right?
[03:08:36.800 --> 03:08:38.800]  And this is also a really good time
[03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:40.800]  to pull your kids out of government schools.
[03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:42.800]  So I'm just making this plea,
[03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:44.800]  kind of like a PSA.
[03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:47.800]  Get your kids out of government schools.
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:48.800]  It's not public school.
[03:08:48.800 --> 03:08:50.800]  It's government school.
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:52.800]  Government indoctrination camp.
[03:08:52.800 --> 03:08:53.800]  And if you're worried,
[03:08:53.800 --> 03:08:55.800]  well, they might come out weird.
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:08:58.800]  Homeschooling kids might be weird.
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:02.800]  There are kids literally who identify as kitty cats
[03:09:02.800 --> 03:09:04.800]  in your kids' classroom,
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:07.800]  licking themselves and purring in the corner
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:09.800]  behind the desks.
[03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:11.800]  I assure you, your kids will be just fine.
[03:09:11.800 --> 03:09:12.800]  I promise you that.
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:15.800]  You can't get any weirder than government schools.
[03:09:15.800 --> 03:09:17.800]  So please, by all means,
[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:20.800]  rip your kids out of those institutions, please.
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:22.800]  They don't stand a chance.
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:25.800]  You guys, it's eight hours a day,
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:29.800]  six hours a day of constant crap coming at them.
[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:31.800]  I don't know how they survive that.
[03:09:31.800 --> 03:09:33.800]  This is why when they go to college,
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:34.800]  they come home very liberal.
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:37.800]  You could take the most conservative kid,
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:39.800]  conservative kid,
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:41.800]  put him in a four-year university
[03:09:41.800 --> 03:09:42.800]  and he'll come out a liberal.
[03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:45.800]  It's very difficult to not have that happen.
[03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:47.800]  So I plead with you,
[03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:50.800]  please rip your kids out of those schools right now.
[03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:51.800]  It's worth it.
[03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:52.800]  You might have to pay extra.
[03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:54.800]  Yeah, you're going to be paying double with taxes
[03:09:54.800 --> 03:09:55.800]  and everything else.
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:56.800]  But you know what?
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:09:57.800]  Your kid's worth it.
[03:09:57.800 --> 03:09:58.800]  And if you're a grandparent,
[03:09:58.800 --> 03:10:00.800]  help your kids out.
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:02.800]  Let them know that you'll be there to help out
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:04.800]  when they want to rip them out of school.
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:06.800]  Now, here's something very interesting.
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:08.800]  This was the total life insurance numbers
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:09.800]  that just came out.
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:12.800]  And I want to share just a couple of stats with you
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:14.800]  because this really tells the tale.
[03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:16.800]  In 2019, okay,
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:18.800]  before the crazy went down,
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:20.800]  it was just semi-crazy,
[03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:23.800]  a $762 billion payout.
[03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:28.800]  $762 billion plus billion dollar payout.
[03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:29.800]  Okay?
[03:10:29.800 --> 03:10:30.800]  That was 2019.
[03:10:30.800 --> 03:10:32.800]  $762.
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:34.800]  In 2020,
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:36.800]  it went up?
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:37.800]  No, no.
[03:10:37.800 --> 03:10:38.800]  It went down.
[03:10:38.800 --> 03:10:40.800]  And it went down by a lot.
[03:10:40.800 --> 03:10:43.800]  $744 billion in 2020.
[03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:48.800]  $744 billion in life insurance payouts
[03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:49.800]  and annuities, all of it.
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:50.800]  Okay?
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:53.800]  And then in 2021,
[03:10:53.800 --> 03:10:56.800]  it shot up to nearly $800 billion.
[03:10:56.800 --> 03:10:57.800]  Yeah.
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:58.800]  Yeah.
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:10:59.800]  And 2022,
[03:10:59.800 --> 03:11:03.800]  just about right at the $800 billion mark,
[03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:05.800]  just shy of it.
[03:11:05.800 --> 03:11:07.800]  That is a huge jump
[03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:09.800]  because in 2019,
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:12.800]  it was $762 billion.
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:14.800]  We did not have a pandemic.
[03:11:14.800 --> 03:11:16.800]  We have to stop saying that.
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:19.800]  Everybody still refers to it as the pandemic of 2020.
[03:11:19.800 --> 03:11:20.800]  Stop.
[03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:21.800]  Just stop.
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:24.800]  We had a government-induced backstemic.
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:27.800]  That's what we had of 2021.
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:31.800]  A government-induced backstemic.
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:34.800]  And that is very different from a pandemic.
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:37.800]  And with great sanitation in our country,
[03:11:37.800 --> 03:11:39.800]  this would be very, very difficult
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:41.800]  to actually have a real pandemic
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:43.800]  because of the situation.
[03:11:43.800 --> 03:11:46.800]  We don't have the same things we did during the Black Plague.
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:49.800]  And the reason the Black Plague was the Black Plague
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:52.800]  was from bacteria because it spread.
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:55.800]  They didn't have the sanitation back then.
[03:11:55.800 --> 03:11:58.800]  This is oftentimes why people got sick.
[03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:00.800]  It's why pioneers got sick.
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:04.800]  It's why people in general had most anomalies
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:06.800]  was bacteria and fungus.
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:08.800]  It was not virus.
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:11.800]  So please, we got to stop saying pandemic.
[03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:15.800]  It's just we keep encouraging the lie
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:19.800]  and then we talk about it and we say the truth about it.
[03:12:19.800 --> 03:12:21.800]  But that's not what we should be doing.
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:23.800]  We should always be correcting the lie.
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:25.800]  We were not in a pandemic.
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:27.800]  There were not extra bodies.
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:30.800]  There were not extra spaces in the cemeteries.
[03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:33.800]  Life insurance, the numbers finally came out.
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:36.800]  $744 billion in 2020.
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:38.800]  We did not have excessive death.
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:40.800]  In fact, it went down.
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:41.800]  Who was dying?
[03:12:41.800 --> 03:12:42.800]  Who was dying?
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:43.800]  I ask you.
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:45.800]  Who was dying in 2020?
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:48.800]  The only people dying were in the ICUs.
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:51.800]  That's the saddest part of this, right?
[03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:53.800]  With an experimental drug.
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:56.800]  By the way, I had Scott Shara on last week
[03:12:56.800 --> 03:12:59.800]  and his daughter Grace, I think,
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:03.800]  in my personal interpretation, was murdered by the hospital.
[03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:06.800]  The judge did appoint a trial date.
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:07.800]  So that was coming.
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:08.800]  Remember when I had him on,
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:10.800]  in two days he was going to be going in for this.
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:12.800]  And the hospital was going to argue
[03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:16.800]  that it should be carried under medical malpractice.
[03:13:16.800 --> 03:13:18.800]  That that's how it should be handled.
[03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:22.800]  Well, they tried.
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:25.800]  They tried to do that last Friday.
[03:13:25.800 --> 03:13:27.800]  And then what happened is the judge went,
[03:13:27.800 --> 03:13:28.800]  uh-uh, no.
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:33.800]  And the case was argued that she passed away.
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:36.800]  And so therefore, nope, it goes to trial.
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:40.800]  So it's going to trial in November 2024.
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:42.800]  So I just wanted all of you to know that.
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:45.800]  This is something that I think all eyeballs should be on,
[03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:46.800]  this case.
[03:13:46.800 --> 03:13:48.800]  Because this case tells the tale.
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:50.800]  When they want to get away
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:52.800]  with what they're doing in the hospitals
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:54.800]  and act like, oh, we didn't know.
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:57.800]  Oh, geez, you know, we're not to blame here.
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:13:59.800]  We were just doing what we were told to do.
[03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:03.800]  We all know, looking back at Nazi Germany,
[03:14:03.800 --> 03:14:06.800]  we all know that that does not, it's not okay.
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:09.800]  Now, the Nuremberg stuff doesn't apply here
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:11.800]  in the United States, sadly.
[03:14:11.800 --> 03:14:12.800]  Most people don't know that.
[03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:15.800]  But let me just tell you, this kind of case
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:18.800]  and the courage of Scott Shara and his family,
[03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:20.800]  that is a big, big deal.
[03:14:20.800 --> 03:14:22.800]  And we need to keep an eye on this
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:24.800]  and support in any way we can
[03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:27.800]  and support those that want to take the hospitals to court.
[03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:28.800]  They should.
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:30.800]  I almost lost my husband there.
[03:14:30.800 --> 03:14:32.800]  And I know what they're up against.
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:35.800]  But let me tell you, if the court cases don't come,
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:36.800]  we're totally done.
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:38.800]  So we have to fight on that level
[03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:40.800]  and use the court system to our advantage.
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:43.800]  Last time I checked, yep, we still had a constitution.
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:47.800]  Not very many people are obeying that constitution.
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:49.800]  And I get it.
[03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:51.800]  But we can still use the court system.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:54.800]  And there still might be some decent judges
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:56.800]  that still care about the process
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:58.800]  and still care about this country.
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:14:59.800]  Maybe a few.
[03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:00.800]  I'm hopeful.
[03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:01.800]  Who knows?
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:05.800]  I know that there are many on the take.
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:06.800]  But you know what?
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:07.800]  There's still something here
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:10.800]  that is so beautiful about this case
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:13.800]  and so sad that this happened to the Shara family.
[03:15:13.800 --> 03:15:16.800]  But you know, I'm looking at this whole situation
[03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:18.800]  and the way they've dealt with it.
[03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:20.800]  And the way they've dealt with it is beautiful.
[03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:21.800]  They didn't take the FEMA money.
[03:15:21.800 --> 03:15:25.800]  It allowed them to sue the hospital for wrongful death
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:26.800]  and go after this.
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:27.800]  And I'm so glad
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:29.800]  because what's going to happen during a trial?
[03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:30.800]  All the facts come out.
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:31.800]  That's what's so great about it.
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:33.800]  All the facts come out, right?
[03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:34.800]  Or at least they try.
[03:15:34.800 --> 03:15:36.800]  And at least you have a shot at it.
[03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:37.800]  And people can start understanding
[03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:40.800]  what in the world is going on with the hospitals.
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:43.800]  And what a predicament we're in ever since Obamacare
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:45.800]  and the centralization of medicine.
[03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:46.800]  I'm going to come right back.
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:48.800]  I've got some stuff on FedNow.
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:49.800]  I've got all kinds of stuff.
[03:15:49.800 --> 03:15:51.800]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:52.800]  I'll be right back.

[03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:04.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:17.119]  Hi there, welcome back, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Dally, your
[03:20:17.119 --> 03:20:21.439]  guest host from katedallyradio.com, so good to be with you, hope you're enjoying, I mean
[03:20:21.439 --> 03:20:25.400]  we're halfway through the summer, right, can you believe it, this year has just gone by
[03:20:25.400 --> 03:20:30.560]  so quickly, I swear I think time is going faster, I truly do, you can't do that one
[03:20:30.560 --> 03:20:34.920]  second thing anymore, the 1-1000, 2-1000, it doesn't work anymore, it actually goes
[03:20:34.920 --> 03:20:43.080]  a little faster it seems, doesn't it, anyway, FedNow will be launched as soon as tomorrow
[03:20:43.080 --> 03:20:49.039]  and FedNow probably not the biggest thing to be concerned with, but it is paving the
[03:20:49.039 --> 03:20:54.960]  way for FedCoin and that truly is the problem, FedCoin will be definitely the issue, but
[03:20:54.960 --> 03:21:02.519]  the Federal Reserve, that horrific entity will launch FedNow real-time payments, services
[03:21:02.519 --> 03:21:07.480]  as early as tomorrow, so you know, just so everyone's very, very aware, I'm sure you
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:14.880]  are, but you know it's interesting because they already had this really in the COVID,
[03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:21.320]  the COVID CARES money, the 2020 money that they handed out to everybody, there was a
[03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:26.039]  section in there and I actually took screenshots of it, there was a section in there that had
[03:21:26.039 --> 03:21:29.960]  already gone to this place and already figured this out and now they're making it look like
[03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:34.720]  it's very, very new, like they just did it, you know, wow, they just pulled this rabbit
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:39.759]  out of the hat, it's ridiculous, we know that, right, they've had this for a long time, they've
[03:21:39.759 --> 03:21:43.320]  been trying to implement it, but they took it out of, it was like one of the first things
[03:21:43.320 --> 03:21:49.480]  in the CARES Act and then they took it out right before they put that through and so who
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:54.160]  knows why, I guess it wasn't just ready yet, I don't know, they were baking it in the oven
[03:21:54.160 --> 03:22:00.599]  for some time and so it's pretty sick because what it does is it lays a track down and that's
[03:22:00.599 --> 03:22:05.560]  the most dangerous part of that, it lays a track down for FedCoin and the takeover of
[03:22:05.560 --> 03:22:10.960]  payment systems in general so that you think the federal government is going to do a whiz
[03:22:10.960 --> 03:22:16.119]  bang job, right, when have they ever done that, when have they ever, well, they only
[03:22:16.119 --> 03:22:21.000]  succeed in control, they only succeed in that, so it makes sense.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:28.840]  I also wanted to talk about this too, the federal judge hinted yesterday that the historic
[03:22:28.840 --> 03:22:35.119]  criminal trial for the alleged mishandling of classified documents, as Trump is the only
[03:22:35.119 --> 03:22:41.140]  person that will be in this situation for that, makes no sense, right, against Trump
[03:22:41.140 --> 03:22:47.759]  might not start until after the 2024 election, the judge didn't say whether she would agree
[03:22:47.759 --> 03:22:52.519]  to this request or not to postpone the trial, but she was going to take it into consideration.
[03:22:52.519 --> 03:22:59.240]  Now, let's just go down this road for just one second, okay, because you can't ignore
[03:22:59.240 --> 03:23:05.340]  just the very, very obvious, number one, what judge in the country can do that when it comes
[03:23:05.340 --> 03:23:11.039]  to a case, oh, you're running for president, okay, not a problem, let me take that into
[03:23:11.039 --> 03:23:16.320]  consideration, you're flying to the fake moon landing, oh my gosh, you're an astronaut,
[03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:20.679]  let's take that into consideration, that doesn't happen, it just doesn't happen, and
[03:23:20.679 --> 03:23:25.640]  the thing is, is I actually really like Trump, I really do, I know a lot of things that he's
[03:23:25.640 --> 03:23:31.080]  done that have been amazing behind the scenes, and I actually am a fan, I have voted for
[03:23:31.080 --> 03:23:38.080]  him, I'm a fan, I like him, this isn't about him though, this is about the game, so there's
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:42.400]  a couple of things that are happening here, and I guess we can all decide which, right,
[03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:46.759]  the judge is just doing something really bizarre that they never do, and we're supposed
[03:23:46.759 --> 03:23:51.160]  to concentrate that it's a win, but we're not supposed to think it's preposterous that
[03:23:51.160 --> 03:23:57.640]  it would happen, right, and that they're going to use this against him in the campaign, yes,
[03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:03.279]  and they can make it look like nobody voted for him, yes, they could do that, right, the
[03:24:03.279 --> 03:24:07.080]  problem is, is that we all know that elections are fixed, and nobody's done anything about
[03:24:07.080 --> 03:24:14.960]  the fraud, the immense fraud, so what does that mean, they could fix it anyway, they're
[03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:20.519]  looking maybe for a plausible reason why he doesn't win, but here's the other case scenario,
[03:24:20.519 --> 03:24:24.560]  Biden did that little slip where he said Trump was going to be president again, I thought
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:29.480]  that was kind of funny actually, so let's just say he is, right, and let's just say
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:36.560]  whoever his VP is, they use this against him, and they do this show trial after the election
[03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:41.800]  if he wins, and they put him in so that everybody stops talking about election fraud, and then
[03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:47.640]  of course his successor would be the vice president, right, that could work, or then
[03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:53.160]  there's this other scenario where maybe the entire thing is faked, and I mean the entire
[03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:59.920]  thing is fake, and they're all a part of it, and playing this game, there was a while ago
[03:24:59.920 --> 03:25:07.720]  I said he'll never ever actually do time, and he won't sit in jail, and there probably
[03:25:07.720 --> 03:25:15.119]  won't be this trial, and if I'm right, then I guess you gotta go with the third scenario,
[03:25:15.119 --> 03:25:21.920]  that it's all a game, that it's all fake-a-roo, and that either whether he was on board, or
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:26.439]  threatened, or whatever the case may be, because I really don't think Trump is a horrific guy,
[03:25:26.439 --> 03:25:32.240]  I can think of a lot more horrific people right now all throughout DC than Trump, okay,
[03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:37.000]  but it is kind of interesting that this lags on, and that this could actually get excused
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:42.320]  for a reason that isn't really plausible, and doesn't really work, because that's just
[03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:46.640]  not how it's done, if they really, if you're in a criminal trial, and you really think
[03:25:46.640 --> 03:25:50.240]  somebody's a criminal, you're not gonna go, oh well, we'll put it off, because of this
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:55.539]  one reason, that just doesn't work that way, so it leads me to believe that probably the
[03:25:55.539 --> 03:26:00.140]  whole entire thing is faked, and I know no one wants to hear that, everyone wants a Superman,
[03:26:00.140 --> 03:26:04.580]  everyone wants to think we can put our faith and trust in one person to clean up this horrid
[03:26:04.580 --> 03:26:09.699]  wretched mess that we all made, and I know you say, well, we didn't make it, well, through
[03:26:09.699 --> 03:26:15.420]  consent, and through just ignoring it, yeah, we never ever really challenged all the stuff
[03:26:15.420 --> 03:26:19.740]  going on, so we are to blame, we are to blame, but I'm throwing that out there, because I
[03:26:19.740 --> 03:26:26.660]  want us to see the theater as a total theater, too, one thing that the lefty loonies don't
[03:26:26.660 --> 03:26:31.980]  have is clarity, they don't have a way to understand what's actually happening, so they
[03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:37.259]  get mired down in these little weird details while they're pushing agenda, and they can't
[03:26:37.259 --> 03:26:43.660]  see that a bigger production is being played out, and the one advantage that you have listening
[03:26:43.660 --> 03:26:48.820]  to this, is that you can see, you do have that clarity, and that is a complete and total
[03:26:48.820 --> 03:26:56.820]  gift, and so, would it be a stretch to understand that the entire thing is played, that they're
[03:26:56.820 --> 03:27:02.779]  all a part of what's going on, because the trajectory of the nation has only gone one
[03:27:02.779 --> 03:27:11.500]  way in 120 years, and that way has not served us well, we are losing liberty all the time,
[03:27:11.500 --> 03:27:19.300]  so obviously, it's not working, right, and as we sit there and we pontificate as Republicans,
[03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:22.779]  or we sit there and look at the whole, oh my gosh, we gotta do something, something's
[03:27:22.779 --> 03:27:28.539]  never done, a lot of talk, a lot of talk, and even your favorite guy, whoever that is, you're
[03:27:28.539 --> 03:27:34.699]  thinking of your favorite politician right now, even them, you can't count on anything
[03:27:34.699 --> 03:27:39.380]  they do, because they're not actually doing anything, a lot of talk, so it leads me to
[03:27:39.380 --> 03:27:43.779]  believe that it might be that third option, right, I mean, you kind of have to go there,
[03:27:43.779 --> 03:27:48.820]  because of the way that all of this is playing out, it's not normal, this is not how things
[03:27:48.820 --> 03:27:55.259]  normally happen in court, it's not normal at all, it's just like the $5 million case
[03:27:55.259 --> 03:28:01.179]  against him, that wasn't a criminal trial for rape, or whatever it was, but it ended
[03:28:01.179 --> 03:28:06.539]  up that way, and a win in a civil court for $5 million, and he wasn't there, come on,
[03:28:06.539 --> 03:28:11.859]  that doesn't happen, this is ridiculous, it's ridiculous to think that, so my mind
[03:28:11.859 --> 03:28:14.099]  goes there, could it be the other options?
[03:28:14.099 --> 03:28:19.060]  I guess, I could be totally wrong, I understand, maybe the judge is just doing something bizarre,
[03:28:19.060 --> 03:28:23.539]  we should look at it as a win, they will use it against him, who knows, who knows, they'll
[03:28:23.539 --> 03:28:28.820]  use it to construct voter fraud, who knows, but it will be interesting to see who's in
[03:28:28.820 --> 03:28:34.619]  this race, they're all vetted, right, they're all properly vetted, so I guess we'll see
[03:28:34.619 --> 03:28:40.140]  who the winner or figurehead of America actually is, because that's what we're voting for,
[03:28:40.140 --> 03:28:45.340]  is figurehead of America, make no mistake, it's not the president like a president Washington
[03:28:45.340 --> 03:28:50.099]  was, no, this is the figurehead, doesn't actually run the country, it's just the face
[03:28:50.099 --> 03:28:55.740]  of the country, we got a horrid face right now, a sniffing face, be right back on the

[03:31:06.179 --> 03:31:09.980]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:31:09.980 --> 03:31:13.939]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[03:31:13.939 --> 03:31:18.820]  Amazon or m4store.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:31:18.820 --> 03:31:23.140]  after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right
[03:31:23.140 --> 03:31:24.140]  now.
[03:31:24.140 --> 03:31:29.420]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at m4store.com.
[03:31:29.420 --> 03:31:33.500]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air, so you
[03:31:33.500 --> 03:31:37.660]  won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help
[03:31:37.660 --> 03:31:38.859]  keep m4store.com on the air.
[03:31:38.859 --> 03:31:42.460]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:47.699]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to m4store.com and get
[03:31:47.699 --> 03:31:51.900]  a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or
[03:31:51.900 --> 03:31:53.539]  give them to the local school.
[03:31:53.539 --> 03:31:56.460]  This is an info war, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:31:56.460 --> 03:32:02.900]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:07.820]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't
[03:32:07.820 --> 03:32:11.779]  get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:32:11.779 --> 03:32:13.539]  Now we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:32:13.539 --> 03:32:16.539]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't, and I'm
[03:32:16.539 --> 03:32:20.500]  not preaching the choir on that, but a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't
[03:32:20.500 --> 03:32:23.060]  have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:32:23.060 --> 03:32:27.300]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high
[03:32:27.300 --> 03:32:29.259]  quality water filtration department.
[03:32:29.259 --> 03:32:33.099]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going
[03:32:33.099 --> 03:32:35.820]  to find and still get quality.
[03:32:35.820 --> 03:32:40.740]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[03:32:40.740 --> 03:32:42.939]  water and air filtration.
[03:32:42.939 --> 03:32:45.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:32:45.619 --> 03:32:47.820]  Our prices are already the lowest at 10% off.
[03:32:47.820 --> 03:32:49.779]  It's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:32:49.779 --> 03:32:53.740]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:32:55.400 --> 03:33:05.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.400 --> 03:33:17.400]  Oh yeah, back here with you on the Alex Jones show, I'm Kate Daly.
[03:33:17.400 --> 03:33:20.400]  Oh, I'm doing the white man overbite on that one.
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:22.400]  Oh yeah, anyway.
[03:33:22.400 --> 03:33:24.400]  Love it.
[03:33:24.400 --> 03:33:26.400]  I love music.
[03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:28.400]  Gets me through all of this crazy insanity.
[03:33:28.400 --> 03:33:35.400]  So, it's no secret that I'm in the state of Utah and that I have a total kiss-ass, bald,
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:40.400]  gabbin, gruesome junior as a governor who parades around in a very feminine way and claims
[03:33:40.400 --> 03:33:42.400]  to be a conservative.
[03:33:42.400 --> 03:33:46.400]  He just regrettably became the first chair of the National Governors Association.
[03:33:46.400 --> 03:33:51.400]  Now, let me tell you why that's scary and why you should be very afraid for your own
[03:33:51.400 --> 03:33:56.400]  state because something's about to roll out that he's going to bring to your states in
[03:33:56.400 --> 03:33:59.400]  the name of National Governors Association.
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:01.400]  He is just loving this new title.
[03:34:01.400 --> 03:34:05.400]  So, it's called Disagree Better.
[03:34:05.400 --> 03:34:08.400]  Disagree, but better.
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:13.400]  So, you can disagree, but you can do it better.
[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:18.400]  Really what they're saying is you can't disagree, you better just agree because if you don't,
[03:34:18.400 --> 03:34:20.400]  we'll go after you.
[03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:23.400]  So, here's a couple of things that they will be telling you in your state that you should
[03:34:23.400 --> 03:34:29.400]  be doing to disagree better and that is write an op-ed with someone who is of the other
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:33.400]  party because, you know, it's always fun to sit down and write an op-ed with somebody
[03:34:33.400 --> 03:34:37.400]  from another party that don't want to ever.
[03:34:37.400 --> 03:34:41.400]  Do a service project with someone who is of another party.
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:42.400]  That sounds fun.
[03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:43.400]  Let's mow lawns.
[03:34:43.400 --> 03:34:44.400]  Let's do it.
[03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:47.400]  Let's go weed somebody's yard together, okay?
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:49.400]  And then have a calm Valium-like debate.
[03:34:49.400 --> 03:34:53.400]  So, it's not really like a debate, it's just where you outnice each other and you can
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:56.400]  sit and talk about what you agree on.
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:34:59.400]  That sounds lovely, does it not?
[03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:05.400]  Well, first of all, let me just say this because this is what he's not getting called on, okay?
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:08.400]  It's not his job.
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:15.400]  Since when is it a governor's job to tell you how to deal with other people or go into
[03:35:15.400 --> 03:35:20.400]  the psychology of you or tell you that you can't be mad or that you can't call somebody
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:22.400]  a liar, right?
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:27.400]  He paraded around my state to the high school students and he decided that he would go after
[03:35:27.400 --> 03:35:28.400]  them.
[03:35:28.400 --> 03:35:33.400]  So, what he did was he presented his conservation and all of these things and said, you know,
[03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:36.400]  you should conserve but you should also be in the moderate middle.
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:37.400]  Don't be too left.
[03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:39.400]  Don't be too far right.
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:42.400]  Just be in the mushy middle because it's fun.
[03:35:42.400 --> 03:35:43.400]  Yeah.
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:46.400]  I know that this is happening in your states too.
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:47.400]  Why?
[03:35:47.400 --> 03:35:50.400]  Because he's rolling it out under the National Governors Association.
[03:35:50.400 --> 03:35:53.400]  You're also going to get disagree better.
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:58.400]  This is plainly and very clearly not the role of government.
[03:35:58.400 --> 03:36:01.400]  In a limited government, you are you.
[03:36:01.400 --> 03:36:02.400]  You can do whatever you want.
[03:36:02.400 --> 03:36:03.400]  You can say the things you want.
[03:36:03.400 --> 03:36:04.400]  You can get mad.
[03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:05.400]  You can disagree.
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:06.400]  You can yell.
[03:36:06.400 --> 03:36:10.400]  It does not matter but it's not their job to school you.
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:12.400]  So, they're paying taxpayer dollars on this.
[03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:13.400]  I'm not kidding.
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:18.400]  This is what it is and really the only thing they want is for you to agree with the liars
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:23.400]  and the narrative and unless you do, you know, you're not disagreeing better.
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:24.400]  Okay.
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:25.400]  Truth brings peace.
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:27.400]  What we actually need is truth.
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:28.400]  We don't need service projects.
[03:36:28.400 --> 03:36:32.400]  I don't need to write an op-ed with somebody from another party and I don't need to have
[03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:35.400]  a volume like debate where we outnice each other.
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:38.400]  What we need is truth all across this country.
[03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:41.400]  That's what we're suffering from.
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:42.400]  It's an illness.
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:47.400]  You know, there are times where do I miss my 18-year-old rear end?
[03:36:47.400 --> 03:36:48.400]  Yes.
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:49.400]  Do I miss being ignorant?
[03:36:49.400 --> 03:36:50.400]  Yes, I do.
[03:36:50.400 --> 03:36:51.400]  I miss being ignorant.
[03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:52.400]  It was fun.
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:53.400]  It was blissful.
[03:36:53.400 --> 03:36:56.400]  They do say ignorance is bliss for a reason.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:01.400]  The problem is that at some point, you have to adult and you have to get out of that and
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:06.400]  you have to realize that there is truth to be had and we're not getting it, right?
[03:37:06.400 --> 03:37:09.400]  You're not getting it from the AP who's telling you that heat.
[03:37:09.400 --> 03:37:11.400]  How are you surviving this summer?
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:13.400]  You're not getting it from that.
[03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:20.400]  You're getting it from this, from shows that dare to tell the truth about what's actually
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:22.400]  happening big picture, right?
[03:37:22.400 --> 03:37:24.400]  And even the Governor's Association.
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:27.400]  That should never exist in this country.
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:31.400]  The founding fathers would be rolling in their graves over this and it's very telling that
[03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:36.400]  it does and it's very sickening actually that it does because it shouldn't.
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:42.400]  They're rolling this out to your state soon so that you all can disagree better.
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:43.400]  Just take Valium, right?
[03:37:43.400 --> 03:37:44.400]  Seriously.
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:48.400]  That's really what they want and they want you to stop disagreeing with them and with
[03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:51.400]  the narrative and boy, wouldn't that be easy?
[03:37:51.400 --> 03:37:56.400]  And when your governor embarks on a psychological campaign like they've done around this country
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:02.400]  really for years, but when your governor takes it up as his new mission in life to make sure
[03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:08.400]  that he controls how you disagree with people and capitalizing on the fact that, oh, see,
[03:38:08.400 --> 03:38:12.400]  none of you get along out there and I know you're all worried about it.
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:19.400]  And with my concern as governor, I will help you to deal with life better, with my disagree
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:20.400]  better.
[03:38:20.400 --> 03:38:24.400]  The D is in blue, I think, and the B is in red.
[03:38:24.400 --> 03:38:25.400]  So cute.
[03:38:25.400 --> 03:38:26.400]  Anyway, gross.
[03:38:26.400 --> 03:38:28.400]  I just threw up in my mouth.
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:29.400]  That was disgusting.
[03:38:29.400 --> 03:38:30.400]  Anyway, you're going to get it.
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:35.400]  And I'm so sorry because this Nimrod became governor of my state.
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:38.400]  And not only did we give you Romney, but we gave you this guy.
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:39.400]  So I'm really sorry.
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:43.400]  Anyways, I didn't vote for either one of them, just so you know.
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:46.400]  And who knows how much fraud was involved too.
[03:38:46.400 --> 03:38:53.400]  I also had a conversation with a woman that was a liberal and I don't really have a lot
[03:38:53.400 --> 03:38:57.400]  of conversations like that because I just find it very difficult to tell you the truth.
[03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:03.400]  But she was a woman liberal who actually, total lefty, but she actually was speaking
[03:39:03.400 --> 03:39:09.400]  out about the end game of the transgender movement and what it looks like in the end.
[03:39:09.400 --> 03:39:18.400]  And that is the erasure of women in general and also sex in general, very much an end
[03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:25.400]  result of humans not being human and also going into transhumanism.
[03:39:25.400 --> 03:39:29.400]  And it was interesting to hear somebody on the left say these things.
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:34.400]  And the only thing I was questioning was, I asked her, well, what are you fighting for?
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:38.400]  You've been fighting for women's rights for 30 years and you pretty much have all the
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:39.400]  rights.
[03:39:39.400 --> 03:39:42.400]  So I'm just wondering what you do at your desk every day.
[03:39:42.400 --> 03:39:46.400]  And let me just tell you what they fight for.
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:50.400]  They fight for the right to live free from violence and discrimination.
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:56.400]  Okay, you can do that.
[03:39:56.400 --> 03:39:58.400]  That's, yeah.
[03:39:58.400 --> 03:40:02.400]  To enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:06.400]  Again, we already do that.
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:07.400]  You can do that.
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:09.400]  You don't need a women's group to do that for you.
[03:40:09.400 --> 03:40:11.400]  You don't need an additional right.
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:13.400]  To be educated.
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:17.400]  That's not really a right, just something that you can go do.
[03:40:18.400 --> 03:40:19.400]  To own property.
[03:40:19.400 --> 03:40:21.400]  Okay, we do.
[03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:22.400]  We own property.
[03:40:22.400 --> 03:40:26.400]  Even if you're a woman, actually starting a business is actually easier.
[03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:30.400]  They've actually given you more rights than the other person, which diminishes other people's
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:31.400]  rights.
[03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:32.400]  To vote.
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:34.400]  I think we nailed that one.
[03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:39.400]  In fact, the states were already going that direction before the women were taking to
[03:40:39.400 --> 03:40:40.400]  the streets.
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:41.400]  We know that, right?
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:43.400]  The states were already doing that.
[03:40:44.400 --> 03:40:48.400]  Because before, it had been property owners got the voting rights.
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:51.400]  There is no right to vote in the Constitution.
[03:40:51.400 --> 03:40:53.400]  It's not there.
[03:40:53.400 --> 03:40:55.400]  And to earn an equal wage.
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:41:01.400]  Well, does that mean that you can stay at home and then jump back into the workplace and
[03:41:01.400 --> 03:41:03.400]  make the exact same as everybody that's already been there?
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:05.400]  That doesn't seem really fair.
[03:41:05.400 --> 03:41:07.400]  But that's what Ginsburg did.
[03:41:07.400 --> 03:41:10.400]  Ginsburg said she was the women's right advocate of the century.
[03:41:10.400 --> 03:41:15.400]  What she did was she just demanded to make the same pay as her male counterparts without
[03:41:15.400 --> 03:41:18.400]  doing any of the time and experience.
[03:41:18.400 --> 03:41:20.400]  It's the truth.
[03:41:20.400 --> 03:41:22.400]  But look at her record.
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:27.400]  She wasn't some like amazing women's rights leader, Ginsburg.
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:28.400]  No.
[03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:29.400]  You know what she was?
[03:41:29.400 --> 03:41:32.400]  She just demanded.
[03:41:32.400 --> 03:41:33.400]  She was demanding.
[03:41:33.400 --> 03:41:35.400]  That's what she should be known for.
[03:41:35.400 --> 03:41:36.400]  Yeah.
[03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:40.400]  And they had to relent because she was that demanding.
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:42.400]  And so I don't know what they're fighting for.
[03:41:42.400 --> 03:41:46.400]  She did say she was fighting for transsexuals to not be in the same prison cell, which I
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:50.400]  agree with as women, and also that they should not be occupying women's sports.
[03:41:50.400 --> 03:41:52.400]  So I was glad that she said that.
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:57.400]  And that is that is a fight in the states that we have to make sure that we are all
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:41:58.400]  a part of.
[03:41:58.400 --> 03:42:00.400]  But women's rights in general, what are they?
[03:42:00.400 --> 03:42:02.400]  What do they do all day?
[03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:04.400]  We have these rights.
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:09.400]  And that's why when I say the National Governors Association shouldn't exist or these things
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:16.400]  are crazy, the governor is wanting to modify your the way you deal with people, your behavior.
[03:42:16.400 --> 03:42:19.400]  All of these things should not be a thing.
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:22.400]  And these women's rights groups, I just still have no idea what they're actually fighting
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:23.400]  for.
[03:42:23.400 --> 03:42:25.400]  I really it's amazing.
[03:42:25.400 --> 03:42:26.400]  What are they doing every day?
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:27.400]  I don't know.
[03:42:27.400 --> 03:42:29.400]  What do you do at your desk?
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:30.400]  Look around and try to pick a fight.
[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:31.400]  I don't know.
[03:42:31.400 --> 03:42:32.400]  Very strange.
[03:42:32.400 --> 03:42:38.400]  But anyway, I it was not it was an odd thing because there's nothing there's no foundation
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:39.400]  under that.
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:40.400]  There's no truth under that.
[03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:42.400]  We need truth more than ever.
[03:42:42.400 --> 03:42:46.400]  Truth would bring a lot of peace right now, a lot of peace.
[03:42:46.400 --> 03:42:49.400]  And you wouldn't see the fighting, but they're conjuring up the fights.
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:50.400]  And that's what's bringing the discord.
[03:42:50.400 --> 03:42:52.400]  Be right back on the Alex Jones show.

[03:44:56.400 --> 03:45:01.400]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[03:45:01.400 --> 03:45:06.400]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:45:06.400 --> 03:45:12.400]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:14.400]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:45:14.400 --> 03:45:16.400]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:45:16.400 --> 03:45:18.400]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:45:18.400 --> 03:45:23.400]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:45:23.400 --> 03:45:25.400]  This is something you need now.
[03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:29.400]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.

[03:45:57.400 --> 03:45:59.400]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:45:59.400 --> 03:46:01.400]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:46:01.400 --> 03:46:03.400]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:06.400]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:46:06.400 --> 03:46:10.400]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:46:10.400 --> 03:46:14.400]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:46:14.400 --> 03:46:18.400]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[03:46:18.400 --> 03:46:20.400]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:23.400]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:46:23.400 --> 03:46:27.400]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:46:27.400 --> 03:46:29.400]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:46:29.400 --> 03:46:31.400]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:46:31.400 --> 03:46:34.400]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[03:46:34.400 --> 03:46:39.400]  Exclusively at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system.

[03:46:46.400 --> 03:46:49.400]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[03:46:49.400 --> 03:46:53.400]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:46:53.400 --> 03:46:56.400]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:02.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.400 --> 03:47:04.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.500 --> 03:47:17.900]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[03:47:17.900 --> 03:47:22.380]  There was an experiment called Universe 25, maybe you've heard of it, right?
[03:47:22.380 --> 03:47:27.900]  It was a mice experiment and it was done by American scientist John Calhoun.
[03:47:27.900 --> 03:47:32.780]  And John Calhoun was basically, he was pretty much working CIA, I mean he was doing this
[03:47:32.780 --> 03:47:40.500]  at Johns Hopkins, which screams CIA, and also he was doing this at the Walter Reed Hospital
[03:47:40.500 --> 03:47:41.500]  too.
[03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:47.380]  And so he was getting his money from them and of course doing this experiment on mice.
[03:47:47.380 --> 03:47:49.280]  And so he built the Paradise of Mice.
[03:47:49.280 --> 03:47:55.580]  It was a specially designed space where rodents had abundance of food and water as well as
[03:47:55.580 --> 03:47:57.740]  like a large living space.
[03:47:57.740 --> 03:48:04.040]  And in the beginning, he had four pairs of mice and it grew and they reached about 600.
[03:48:04.040 --> 03:48:10.660]  And they gave him enough food and water, but that was about it.
[03:48:10.660 --> 03:48:13.260]  And they were very, very contained.
[03:48:13.260 --> 03:48:20.020]  And what happened was they actually started turning asexual.
[03:48:20.020 --> 03:48:26.500]  The females showed more and more aggressive behavior and isolation elements, lack of reproductive
[03:48:26.500 --> 03:48:27.500]  mood.
[03:48:28.260 --> 03:48:30.860]  The males started just, they called them the beautiful mice, they just started grooming
[03:48:30.860 --> 03:48:36.700]  themselves and not really caring about being with the gal mice.
[03:48:36.700 --> 03:48:41.700]  And of course, all they cared about was food and sleep and they had a lot of isolation
[03:48:41.700 --> 03:48:42.700]  happening.
[03:48:42.700 --> 03:48:44.860]  A lot of things were going on.
[03:48:44.860 --> 03:48:48.260]  And it started the demise of this mice colony.
[03:48:48.260 --> 03:48:51.260]  They had a lot more room for them, but this was what started the demise.
[03:48:51.260 --> 03:48:55.540]  And they said the death phase consisted of two stages, the first death and the second
[03:48:55.540 --> 03:48:56.540]  death.
[03:48:56.540 --> 03:48:59.140]  And that the first death was more like a spiritual death.
[03:48:59.140 --> 03:49:00.460]  It was really interesting.
[03:49:00.460 --> 03:49:07.580]  In fact, by 1973, they had killed the last mouse in Universe 25 because they had just
[03:49:07.580 --> 03:49:11.780]  become just crazy.
[03:49:11.780 --> 03:49:13.140]  They had no purpose.
[03:49:13.140 --> 03:49:17.740]  They had no way of having a job.
[03:49:17.740 --> 03:49:20.620]  The societal order just broke down.
[03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:24.980]  And like I said, the women got more abusive toward the babies and the babies were dying
[03:49:25.540 --> 03:49:30.980]  and not all of them, but they were displaying behavior that just wasn't normal at all.
[03:49:30.980 --> 03:49:35.620]  They were getting into homosexuality was observed, cannibalism increased.
[03:49:35.620 --> 03:49:39.940]  And despite the fact there was plenty of food, plenty of water, but they were contained against
[03:49:39.940 --> 03:49:42.660]  their instincts in this cage.
[03:49:42.660 --> 03:49:47.020]  And two years after the start of the experiment, pretty much it was over.
[03:49:47.020 --> 03:49:50.780]  And so what they were trying to, I think, go after and prove was the fact that overpopulation,
[03:49:50.780 --> 03:49:53.780]  oh, look at our world, we're overpopulated.
[03:49:53.780 --> 03:49:57.980]  All you have to do is drive across the United States and you'll know we're not overpopulated.
[03:49:57.980 --> 03:49:58.980]  It's ridiculous.
[03:49:58.980 --> 03:50:04.700]  But the eugenics, the eugenics and the eugenicists, as we have in government right now, were pro
[03:50:04.700 --> 03:50:08.780]  this idea, really wanted this to showcase this.
[03:50:08.780 --> 03:50:11.940]  Interesting that they're not really talking about this because really what it is, it's
[03:50:11.940 --> 03:50:13.220]  a model.
[03:50:13.220 --> 03:50:17.820]  It proved to kind of be a model for what 15 minute cities will look like.
[03:50:17.820 --> 03:50:18.820]  Fifteen minute cities.
[03:50:18.820 --> 03:50:19.820]  Yeah, you'll have food.
[03:50:19.820 --> 03:50:20.820]  Yeah, you'll have water.
[03:50:20.820 --> 03:50:21.820]  You'll be fed.
[03:50:21.820 --> 03:50:22.820]  Lucky you.
[03:50:22.860 --> 03:50:27.420]  You just won't be able to follow all those natural instincts, do what you want to do.
[03:50:27.420 --> 03:50:31.140]  You'll be camera'd, spied on, and you won't be able to travel.
[03:50:31.140 --> 03:50:34.220]  And there'll be a lot of things that you can't do.
[03:50:34.220 --> 03:50:38.300]  And does the societal order break down in 15 minute cities?
[03:50:38.300 --> 03:50:40.100]  I would imagine it gets a little Hunger Game-ish.
[03:50:40.100 --> 03:50:41.100]  Sure.
[03:50:41.100 --> 03:50:46.520]  But that was a really interesting, go back and read on that Universe 25.
[03:50:46.520 --> 03:50:52.260]  It was a really interesting, because it became so agitated and aggressive, fighting, no protection
[03:50:52.700 --> 03:50:53.700]  instincts.
[03:50:53.700 --> 03:50:58.420]  And one of the things they did was it feminized the men with little or no skills.
[03:50:58.420 --> 03:51:01.380]  They didn't have a purpose and no protection instincts.
[03:51:01.380 --> 03:51:04.380]  Oh my gosh, that sounds familiar.
[03:51:04.380 --> 03:51:05.380]  Hmm.
[03:51:05.380 --> 03:51:06.380]  Sounds familiar, right?
[03:51:06.380 --> 03:51:07.380]  Yeah.
[03:51:07.380 --> 03:51:08.380]  That's what I thought.
[03:51:08.380 --> 03:51:13.500]  Anyway, I just wanted to relay that to you because I think Universe 25 is a great way
[03:51:13.500 --> 03:51:16.460]  to kind of explain what happens in these 15 minute cities.
[03:51:16.460 --> 03:51:19.340]  They're not fun.
[03:51:19.420 --> 03:51:23.340]  I also wanted to talk to you for just a moment about mortgages.
[03:51:23.340 --> 03:51:27.660]  Mortgage insurance, 99% of all of you are under a 6% mortgage.
[03:51:27.660 --> 03:51:28.660]  So you're not going to budge.
[03:51:28.660 --> 03:51:29.660]  You're not going anywhere.
[03:51:29.660 --> 03:51:34.300]  The only thing that they can mess with to get you out of your property so you couldn't afford
[03:51:34.300 --> 03:51:36.300]  it would be mortgage insurance.
[03:51:36.300 --> 03:51:39.180]  And that went up last year 42%.
[03:51:39.180 --> 03:51:44.740]  And then we started hearing the rumblings of California and Florida, not insuring some
[03:51:44.740 --> 03:51:47.100]  homes based on certain factors.
[03:51:47.100 --> 03:51:48.740]  I think you're going to see a lot more of that.
[03:51:48.740 --> 03:51:54.940]  I think between property taxes and mortgage insurance, that's a great way to commandeer
[03:51:54.940 --> 03:52:01.140]  property in the United States is to inflate those beyond reason and to the point where
[03:52:01.140 --> 03:52:05.740]  you would not be able to live in your home at all and want to go live in a tiny home
[03:52:05.740 --> 03:52:06.740]  or an apartment.
[03:52:06.740 --> 03:52:11.940]  And they really are taking the tiny home movement and lowering expectations and making people
[03:52:11.940 --> 03:52:17.680]  think that this is the best way, most minimalist, tiniest way to live and that you'll be happy.
[03:52:17.680 --> 03:52:19.560]  This is what they're doing to our youth.
[03:52:19.560 --> 03:52:22.920]  They're telling them that this is kind of the new way and that you should be proud of
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:25.480]  that because of the environmental impact.
[03:52:25.480 --> 03:52:27.800]  Can I throw up now?
[03:52:27.800 --> 03:52:31.840]  Anyway, they're conditioning them to think that you don't want a big house.
[03:52:31.840 --> 03:52:34.720]  You don't want to work for anything or have anything in your line site that might be a
[03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:35.720]  dream.
[03:52:35.720 --> 03:52:39.160]  Oh no, live in this tiny home, 200 square feet of fun.
[03:52:39.160 --> 03:52:40.160]  Yeah.
[03:52:40.160 --> 03:52:41.160]  Super.
[03:52:41.160 --> 03:52:45.680]  Anyway, I also wanted to give you the three scenarios that the CFR outlined.
[03:52:45.680 --> 03:52:48.520]  And usually the CFR will kind of tell you what they're doing.
[03:52:48.520 --> 03:52:54.120]  I went back into CFR newsletters by the decades and every single, every single issue had
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:52:57.000]  something about nukes.
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:52:58.000]  I'm not joking.
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:04.320]  Like every single, it was, it was absurd actually that we have been dealing with the nuke threat
[03:53:04.320 --> 03:53:07.080]  pumped in our face for this long.
[03:53:07.080 --> 03:53:08.520]  It's insane.
[03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:14.800]  But these were the three scenarios they gave for Russia and for the Ukraine.
[03:53:14.920 --> 03:53:20.760]  They said basically that there'll be a nuclear weapon.
[03:53:20.760 --> 03:53:24.240]  Russia's going to use a nuclear weapon against Ukrainian military, right?
[03:53:24.240 --> 03:53:28.480]  To attempt to weaken the country's will and damage its military capacity.
[03:53:28.480 --> 03:53:32.000]  A tactical nuclear weapon will have a small payload.
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:33.000]  Okay.
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:37.520]  And then it said that we'll probably won't respond to that, but, but we'll send troops
[03:53:37.520 --> 03:53:41.580]  into by, by sending troops into Ukraine, but the United States would ramp up the number
[03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:43.980]  of conventional weapons they send to Ukraine.
[03:53:43.980 --> 03:53:44.980]  Interesting.
[03:53:44.980 --> 03:53:49.540]  So they said this back in, I think it was November or December of 2022, about seven
[03:53:49.540 --> 03:53:50.540]  months ago.
[03:53:50.540 --> 03:53:55.940]  So then they said that, that Russia's most, this, this option least likely, but it would
[03:53:55.940 --> 03:54:01.540]  be a strategic nuclear war against Ukrainian civil targets.
[03:54:01.540 --> 03:54:05.980]  And that that attack would get everybody in a, in a, in a tussle.
[03:54:05.980 --> 03:54:11.980]  And of course that they would use something way more powerful than a tactical weapon.
[03:54:11.980 --> 03:54:17.980]  And that it would, it would have a Western, more direct Western involvement and would
[03:54:17.980 --> 03:54:22.900]  dramatically change the intensity of the conflict, but that we would remain indirect through
[03:54:22.900 --> 03:54:25.900]  arms sales and non-military support.
[03:54:25.900 --> 03:54:29.620]  They also talked about hitting Los Angeles.
[03:54:29.620 --> 03:54:30.940]  I know they just picked that randomly.
[03:54:30.940 --> 03:54:34.640]  It's like, when you think of cities, you just go Los Angeles, right?
[03:54:34.640 --> 03:54:41.560]  So they would do Los Angeles and they would make it an attack or maybe a city in Canada
[03:54:41.560 --> 03:54:42.560]  or something.
[03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:43.560]  I don't know.
[03:54:43.560 --> 03:54:47.720]  Anyway, they would go after this city and they would do something to that.
[03:54:47.720 --> 03:54:50.480]  And that would draw us in for more arms sales.
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:56.960]  And that we would, that we would not cross into the border into Russia, but that we would
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:54:58.480]  use advanced cruise missiles.
[03:54:58.480 --> 03:54:59.480]  They got it all laid out.
[03:54:59.920 --> 03:55:07.000]  They had this entire plan laid out and I just sat there thinking, wow, you know, the think
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:11.760]  tanks and what they do and the CFR, one of the biggest think tanks that's been controlling
[03:55:11.760 --> 03:55:16.760]  the government for over a hundred years, but this is, it's totally amazing how they map
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:21.760]  out every single response to what they say is going to happen.
[03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:24.120]  And usually it's them doing the happenings.
[03:55:24.120 --> 03:55:29.160]  So I always, I always chuckle because you know, they're putting it out there.
[03:55:29.160 --> 03:55:32.680]  They want to see what, you know, how the, how the crowd takes it.
[03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:36.240]  You know, we used to say at my house, you know, go check the weather at the house, you
[03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:38.320]  know, see how everybody's doing really.
[03:55:38.320 --> 03:55:40.700]  It was checking the temperature at the house.
[03:55:40.700 --> 03:55:41.800]  And that's basically what they do.
[03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:46.320]  And they throw this out there so that, so that they would be the ones to go see how on it
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:47.320]  we are.
[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:53.040]  This is why you have us, even though they're the ones constructing everything, they're constructing
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:54.800]  the scenarios.
[03:55:54.800 --> 03:55:59.920]  It just baffles me to no end that we keep thinking that Russia would be the one to do
[03:55:59.920 --> 03:56:00.920]  this.
[03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:05.160]  The Russia is going to go nuke Los Angeles, knowing that we could squash Russia in two
[03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:06.160]  seconds.
[03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:12.080]  And by the way, why haven't we, because you've got to have a boogeyman, that's how it works.
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:17.080]  You've got to have a boogeyman, you know, you've got to have ISIS, whatever happened to ISIS.
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:20.160]  They just take their brand new little tennis shoes and Toyota trucks and just fade into
[03:56:20.160 --> 03:56:21.160]  the sunset.
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:23.080]  How nice of them.
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:27.720]  And then also, you know, I'm looking at this and it was always talking about how, you know,
[03:56:27.720 --> 03:56:31.440]  we wouldn't be the ones to go in and start World War III.
[03:56:31.440 --> 03:56:32.440]  It's going to be them.
[03:56:32.440 --> 03:56:33.440]  Wink, wink.
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:34.440]  I just, okay.
[03:56:34.440 --> 03:56:35.440]  Wink, wink.
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:37.920]  Um, yeah, the other wars weren't started by us either.
[03:56:37.920 --> 03:56:38.920]  Right.
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:39.920]  Because we didn't have a hand in that.
[03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:40.920]  Right.
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:47.520]  Um, so I say that with kind of a chuckle and kind of a very dismayed sort of, this is kind
[03:56:47.520 --> 03:56:52.200]  of the sick world that we live in with the CFR calling all these shots, but it's always
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:57.400]  good to read the CFR so that you can know what's coming because it's kind of like predict.
[03:56:57.400 --> 03:56:58.400]  It's like predictions.
[03:56:58.400 --> 03:56:59.400]  It is.
[03:56:59.400 --> 03:57:03.520]  It's like, uh, we get to, we get to see, uh, what they have in store because they've really
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:04.720]  thought through the process.
[03:57:04.720 --> 03:57:06.960]  I mean, really thought through the process.
[03:57:06.960 --> 03:57:08.360]  No surprises here.
[03:57:08.360 --> 03:57:13.240]  Um, and, uh, and then also, um, it's interesting that they keep saying it's going to drop like
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:15.440]  the, uh, the Hiroshima bomb.
[03:57:15.440 --> 03:57:18.200]  And you know, I did a show on that right here on Alex Jones.
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:22.840]  So interesting that they have to keep going there to tell you what it's going to look
[03:57:22.840 --> 03:57:28.520]  like and feel like, so that you're very, very, very afraid, very afraid.
[03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:32.720]  And by the way, those insurance companies that run those, um, the mortgage insurance
[03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:37.400]  and everything, they have a lot bigger hand in what's happening than we ever talked about.
[03:57:37.400 --> 03:57:40.920]  It needs to be explored a lot more, the insurance companies.
[03:57:40.920 --> 03:57:44.880]  Thanks you guys for Alex Jones and Kate Daly, your guest host from the Kate Daly show.
[03:57:44.880 --> 03:57:45.880]  Appreciate you guys.
[03:57:45.880 --> 03:57:46.880]  Hey everybody.
