[00:00.000 --> 00:28.800]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:28.880 --> 00:33.760]  Trump spoke to a crowd of around 50,000 people yesterday. The corporate media said 25,000. I've
[00:33.760 --> 00:40.640]  seen the numbers. It was at least 50,000. We had some crew there covering it. And he did a great
[00:40.640 --> 00:46.240]  job. He also on Friday after we criticized him for his death and destruction comment, tweeting
[00:46.240 --> 00:51.920]  a picture of a baseball bat. And we don't need that. He deleted it. So that's a good thing.
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.080]  We're winning this nonviolently. We don't need to step into the provocateur actions.
[00:56.720 --> 00:59.360]  And speaking of that, before we play a few of these clips,
[01:01.200 --> 01:06.240]  there is a new video that's been released of the Metro Police behaving just like Ray Epps,
[01:07.200 --> 01:09.840]  telling people break in, go over the barriers, go into the building.
[01:10.560 --> 01:15.120]  So we have the new videos coming out of that. I mean, this was a total and complete setup.
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.160]  We've got that tonight. But here's a few clips of Trump in Central Texas last night in Waco.
[01:21.200 --> 01:24.720]  He said either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state. Totally true.
[01:25.440 --> 01:27.360]  Says this is the final battle. Here's the clips.
[01:30.640 --> 01:38.160]  Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state. That's the way it's got
[01:38.160 --> 01:45.760]  to be. We're at a very pivotal point in our country. Either we descend into a lawless abyss
[01:45.760 --> 01:52.240]  of open borders, rampant killings, super hyperinflation, which is what we have right now
[01:52.240 --> 01:59.680]  and not coming down and festering corruption. Or we evict Joe Biden and the Democrats from
[01:59.680 --> 02:07.120]  the White House and we make America great again. In 2024 is the final battle. That's
[02:07.120 --> 02:13.520]  going to be the big one. If you put me back in the White House, their reign will be over
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.560]  and America will be a free nation once again.
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.440]  Well, he could have done a lot better job when he first got in, but I think he's awake to what's
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.200]  happening and going on now. I definitely like everything I'm hearing from Trump.
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.000]  Now, mainstream news is reporting that the Santa's donors are telling him drop out before
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.280]  he ever announces. Trump comes out and says, very unlikely to Santa's will be his running mate.
[02:42.560 --> 02:48.000]  This attempt to have him arrested has really blown up in their face and shows how disconnected
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.840]  the establishment is. But Trump does look like he's lost about 40 pounds. I like to look without
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.760]  the red tie, but I really like the things he's saying, the things he's doing. That subject said
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.880]  born too late to explore the earth, born too early to explore the galaxy, born just in time to make
[03:04.880 --> 03:11.920]  America great again. Wow. Trump describes 2024 election as the final battle from podium in Waco.
[03:12.880 --> 03:18.160]  The witch hunt against me is dead. Trump says Manhattan DA tricked by fraud star witness wasn't
[03:19.360 --> 03:26.720]  into horse face storming. And it just goes on from there. But I do have to say Trump looked
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.760]  really good yesterday. He looked younger than when he ran seven years ago. Weird stuff going on.
[03:33.760 --> 03:40.960]  Huge. Trump says he thinks Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg has dropped the case against him. Trump deletes
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.960]  posts that threatens DA Alvin Bragg. Yeah. Why, why do you do that with an image of yourself with
[03:46.960 --> 03:51.920]  a baseball bat? Like he's in that movie, the untouchables or something. We just don't need
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.800]  that folks. So I'm very glad Trump deleted that. I mean, we can not walk it right into their trap
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.880]  and call for violence. That would be really, and he's like, well, they do it all the time.
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.680]  I understand that. I mean, the Democrats do a lot of horrible things. I mean, we have to act like
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.640]  them. So that's some of what we've got here tonight. I went over the phones up coming up
[04:14.640 --> 04:20.000]  specifically on Trump and what you think of him, obviously being the massive front runner
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.280]  and the media spinning it. Well, he'll just lose again, like two years ago in two years. So,
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.600]  oh, cause you stole the election and we all know that. I mean, sure. You say it's not the case.
[04:30.320 --> 04:36.080]  The evidence is overwhelming, but can they beat a massive super tsunami because you see so many
[04:36.080 --> 04:41.680]  Republicans stay home because they believed the background noise that trust the plan. Trump's
[04:41.680 --> 04:48.240]  invincible. He will win. No problem. Just trust the plan. Stay home, suck your thumb. But people
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.120]  now realize that's not the case. We're covering this and so much more today. It's a big live
[04:53.120 --> 04:55.760]  Sunday, March 26th transmission. Stay with us.
[05:23.520 --> 05:29.280]  Alex Jones was right. Think about how frustrated we are. If you've been awake for a year or two,
[05:29.280 --> 05:32.960]  imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[05:32.960 --> 05:38.960]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax,
[05:38.960 --> 05:45.200]  not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the
[05:45.200 --> 05:50.880]  first amendment. The government fears Alex Jones. That's why the globalists hate me
[05:50.880 --> 05:53.920]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[06:11.360 --> 06:18.160]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:18.160 --> 06:24.240]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.480]  I want to be 100% clear with everybody on this live Sunday, March 26,
[06:33.280 --> 06:38.880]  2023 broadcast. Whether Trump is for real or not, the deep state hates his guts and
[06:38.880 --> 06:45.040]  is scared of him because they see him as a power rival. And whether he's 100% real or not,
[06:45.680 --> 06:50.640]  when he gets up and says we have a world corporate government destroying our borders,
[06:50.640 --> 06:55.280]  our families, our culture, that's criminal. And the corporate media is your enemy.
[06:55.280 --> 06:58.800]  And they're trying to devalue the dollar and destabilize our country.
[06:58.800 --> 07:03.920]  And it's us or them. And we either take them out or they take us out politically.
[07:05.760 --> 07:12.320]  That's all completely true. And saying that energizes the awakening to levels never before
[07:12.320 --> 07:17.280]  seen. Because like I told you in the last six months, used to it was not popular to talk about
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.760]  world government, the new world order, even though it was all true. Now everybody from Russell Brand
[07:21.760 --> 07:27.680]  to Elon Musk to Joe Rogan's on board to Tucker Carlson. Tucker's been doing it for a long time.
[07:28.400 --> 07:33.040]  He's certainly not a Johnny come lately, but everybody else is starting to be a Johnny come
[07:33.040 --> 07:40.640]  lately, which is fine. We're really winning right now on so many fronts when it comes to hearts and
[07:40.640 --> 07:47.280]  minds. So that's a big deal. Trump was on fire yesterday in Waco and so was Matt Gaetz. So was
[07:47.280 --> 07:51.840]  Marjorie Taylor Greene. I didn't go. We had some crew there covering it, but I got to tell you,
[07:51.840 --> 07:58.800]  it was amazing. More hardcore stuff said at that rally that had been said in the last six,
[07:58.800 --> 08:06.080]  seven years of Trump combined. So Trump is definitely born again hard as they call it.
[08:06.720 --> 08:12.400]  And I think they'll probably try to assassinate him or something. This is just insane. I'm mad
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.280]  at him about the poison shots and don't trust him. But even Jared and his daughter said they're not
[08:19.280 --> 08:22.960]  involved with Trump now to business themselves. That's good. It looks like he's got all the
[08:22.960 --> 08:28.800]  Hollywood wannabe scum away from him and it's doing a lot better. Now I certainly am not delusional,
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.040]  but again, I'm going to say it one more time. You don't say things like this.
[08:35.440 --> 08:40.080]  You don't speak truths like this and it not have a huge effect against the enemy.
[08:40.640 --> 08:44.240]  Somebody that is working for the new world order does not say stuff like this.
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.440]  I think all of his kind of reckless statements about death and destruction, we're going to
[08:49.440 --> 08:54.400]  overthrow you and all this. It's not a good thing. Could have been better thought out,
[08:54.400 --> 08:58.400]  but it's a good thing when it comes to showing that it's not a good thing in action.
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.920]  But it's in a way a good thing showing he is completely out of control, meaning they do not
[09:03.920 --> 09:08.640]  control him at all. I think it's very easy to gauge that and to see that and that's why they hate him.
[09:08.640 --> 09:14.160]  Not that he wasn't aligned with them on some issues, but in the main, in general,
[09:16.640 --> 09:22.080]  this is an amazing time to be alive right now. This is not just Trump. Populism, nationalism,
[09:22.080 --> 09:30.480]  anti-globalism, pro-free market, pro-God, pro-family information is paramount now all over
[09:30.480 --> 09:36.320]  the world. People really get there's a choice between nationalism and populism and freedom
[09:36.320 --> 09:40.480]  and the tyranny of the great reset of the new world order and the UN and all the rest of it.
[09:40.480 --> 09:46.240]  So simply incredible. I got a bunch of these clips. I already played these once when the first
[09:46.240 --> 09:49.920]  little segment, I'm going to air them again. I'm just going to air them again because they're
[09:49.920 --> 09:53.360]  powerful and I'll air the MTG clip and then the other Trump clip I didn't get to.
[09:54.320 --> 09:59.520]  But let's hear the MTG clip first. Then let's play Trump either the deep state destroys America,
[09:59.520 --> 10:04.320]  we destroy the deep state, which is true. Trump with the final battle and then Trump for the
[10:04.320 --> 10:08.160]  public schools and we'll come back from break and hit all the rest of the news and open the
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.720]  phones up and take your calls and so much more tonight. Stay with us. Biden and the Democrats
[10:12.720 --> 10:20.000]  have created one dumpster fire after another, but the most terrifying is the two tiered injustice
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.760]  system. Just yesterday, I led an oversight committee delegation into the DC jail.
[10:28.880 --> 10:35.600]  And again, I witnessed the devastating effects on the pre-trial January 6th detainees who were the
[10:35.600 --> 10:43.360]  true political prisoners and are at the mercy of the Biden regime. Meanwhile, Antifa and BLM
[10:43.360 --> 10:51.120]  domestic terrorists are still out free roaming the streets. Biden and Merrick Garland are even
[10:51.120 --> 10:58.400]  trying to throw a man in jail for making memes during the 2016 election. The case of Douglas
[10:58.400 --> 11:06.720]  Mackey should scare every single American. Without free speech, we can never win the information war.
[11:08.080 --> 11:13.600]  But the most terrifying thing of all is how the Democrats have weaponized the government
[11:13.600 --> 11:21.760]  against President Trump, all for the crime of beating Hillary Clinton and winning the 2016
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.160]  presidential election. We don't consider that a crime, do we?
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.600]  No, we elected him. We elected him in 2016 and we also elected him in 2020, didn't we?
[11:39.440 --> 11:42.560]  But now the radical New York district attorney Alvin
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.840]  Bragg has initiated yet another phony witch hunt against President Trump.
[11:49.520 --> 11:56.560]  That's right. Boo. This attack is an egregious weaponization of our justice system
[11:56.560 --> 12:04.480]  designed to influence the 2024 presidential race. Since before President Trump was sworn in,
[12:04.480 --> 12:08.480]  radical left Democrats, or should we say communist Democrats,
[12:10.160 --> 12:16.960]  have attacked him with Russia, Russia, Russia, the Mueller hoax, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine,
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.920]  impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two, the illegal and unconstitutional
[12:23.920 --> 12:32.000]  Mar-a-Lago raid, and now this from the Manhattan D.A.? This is nothing but a witch hunt against
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  President Trump and he is completely innocent.
[12:41.840 --> 12:48.000]  This is election interference and we refuse to look at it any other way.
[12:49.520 --> 12:56.000]  Radical left communist Democrats in the New York district attorney's office are politicizing our
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.800]  justice system to influence the 2024 presidential race, but they're really hijacking our freedoms
[13:04.800 --> 13:12.560]  and destroying what it means to be an American. This is unprecedented. Never before has a former
[13:12.560 --> 13:21.200]  president been charged a former innocent president. America's enemies are desperate to
[13:21.200 --> 13:29.680]  stop President Trump because he is the only one who can stop them. He is the only one who can
[13:29.680 --> 13:32.960]  defeat the radical communist Democrats.
[13:36.880 --> 13:40.800]  You know, I want you to know as hard as we work in the House of Representatives,
[13:40.800 --> 13:43.760]  where it's the only place we have Republican control,
[13:44.400 --> 13:50.240]  we cannot accomplish the America first agenda without President Trump in the White House.
[13:51.200 --> 13:54.160]  We have to take back the Department of Justice.
[13:56.400 --> 14:04.000]  You have to understand they're not just coming after President Trump. They're coming after you.
[14:05.440 --> 14:09.200]  And President Trump is just the only one standing in their way.
[14:12.080 --> 14:19.840]  Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state. That's the way it's got to be.
[14:21.600 --> 14:27.760]  You're at a very pivotal point in our country. Either we descend into a lawless abyss of open
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.720]  borders, rampant killings, super hyperinflation, which is what we have right now and not coming down
[14:35.440 --> 14:42.160]  and festering corruption, or we evict Joe Biden and the Democrats from the White House and we
[14:42.160 --> 14:47.280]  make America great again. Well, I've called for this for decades. The rest of the clips
[14:47.280 --> 14:53.040]  will come back after the break, but you cannot argue with the rhetoric. The rhetoric itself
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.360]  changes the playing field forever. It's the one thing the enemy can't stand is being identified,
[14:57.360 --> 15:04.480]  as I've told you 5,000 times. I'm getting chills right now. So when Trump came out against nuclear
[15:04.480 --> 15:07.760]  war, I still had issues with him, but I said he was better than the Santas. He just went
[15:08.560 --> 15:12.640]  way ahead of the Santas. And we'll open the phones up. I know a lot of you are pissed at Trump.
[15:12.640 --> 15:18.160]  I've been pissed as well, and I'm certainly not lackadaisical that he's going to save us,
[15:18.160 --> 15:25.680]  but you cannot lie that that type of rhetoric from the president, the former president,
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.920]  the Republican front runner in every poll, 25 to 30 points ahead of the Santas,
[15:30.480 --> 15:34.240]  30 points ahead of Biden right now, he would just destroy him completely.
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.960]  Yeah, they stole the election, but by a margin. Trump surged so much that they have no way of
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.040]  winning now. If they held the election next week, he won by 30 points. Everybody knows it.
[15:45.920 --> 15:51.280]  So, wow, this is quite the moment, ladies and gentlemen. The new world order is in deep crap.
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.760]  They can't survive talk like this from Trump. I mean, let me tell you, we'll be right back. Stay
[15:55.760 --> 16:07.040]  with us. If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[16:07.840 --> 16:14.320]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president
[16:14.320 --> 16:20.560]  2024 shirt. I am not seriously planning to run for president. This is an idea the crew had,
[16:20.560 --> 16:25.440]  have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex Jones was right. There's infowars.com in the back.
[16:25.440 --> 16:30.240]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front. It's a fundraiser shirt. It's made out of really nice
[16:30.240 --> 16:36.160]  fabric. It's high quality, and it is a exclusive shirt to infowarstore.com. And when the shirts
[16:36.160 --> 16:43.440]  are gone, they're gone. We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts, and we'll
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.920]  have a historic memento, be able to spread the word and meet a lot of like-minded people, and
[16:47.920 --> 16:53.360]  you'll be able to keep us on the air. No way. No way. That's a bridge too far. That's no,
[16:53.360 --> 16:59.760]  it can't be. And I said on national television that he was going to win. And infowarstore.com.
[16:59.760 --> 17:04.400]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[17:04.400 --> 17:07.920]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.480]  drug addicts and criminals. And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[17:12.480 --> 17:16.400]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[17:16.400 --> 17:21.280]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again,
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.160]  I have Infowars to thank for that. Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald
[17:26.160 --> 17:32.160]  Trump two questions. I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[17:32.160 --> 17:38.160]  and under the Infowars team. I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of
[17:38.160 --> 17:44.560]  clips because Alex's whole mentality was go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.520]  to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping
[17:49.520 --> 17:54.720]  the American people. And I really do credit Alex for really instilling that within me early on in
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.720]  my career.

[20:00.480 --> 20:06.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:13.760 --> 20:21.600]  Welcome back to the live Sunday Night Edition of the Alex Jones Show. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[20:21.600 --> 20:26.320]  We'll be here until 6 p.m. Central when Owen Schroeder takes over, 6 to 8 p.m. with Sunday
[20:26.320 --> 20:31.840]  Live. In the course weekdays, 8 a.m. Harrison Smith, myself, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Owen Schroeder,
[20:31.840 --> 20:37.280]  The War Room, 3 p.m. Central at Infowars.com, Ford Slash Show, and across wonderful stations,
[20:37.280 --> 20:43.040]  TV and radio across the country. So I want to give the number out. I have a ton of other important
[20:43.040 --> 20:50.160]  news and clubs will be interspersing between your phone calls, but seriously, I am a decisive person
[20:50.960 --> 20:57.840]  and I'm almost always cut and dry where I stand, and I couldn't support Obama or John McCain
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.560]  back in 2008. They were both globalists. I knew it was a rigged election,
[21:02.560 --> 21:06.640]  and Obama did win in a landslide because the whole media was behind him, but John McCain
[21:06.640 --> 21:11.520]  was just as bad in many ways worse, which is hard to be worse than Obama, but he's definitely right
[21:11.520 --> 21:17.120]  there with him. I mean, they're two peas in a pod, but with Trump, it's not a lesser of two evils.
[21:17.120 --> 21:22.320]  You know what you've got. He's got problems, but the deep state really hates him. He did a lot
[21:22.320 --> 21:27.280]  of good stuff. Do we just sit here and let them install somebody else or falsely put Trump in
[21:27.280 --> 21:34.160]  prison? So I've been drug kicking and screaming the last year back, very upset with Trump,
[21:34.880 --> 21:39.120]  for the fact that on so many issues, he's dead on, like not putting us under the UN
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.560]  treaty over our healthcare and controlling our borders and bringing jobs back to America and
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.200]  stopping the fentanyl and now going after the deep state. And I really do believe
[21:51.360 --> 21:56.800]  that if he wins, if he gets back in office, he will fire the FBI director. He will fire
[21:58.080 --> 22:04.560]  the head of the justice department day one. He will clean house and put his people in there.
[22:04.560 --> 22:10.880]  That's why I have to be really honest with you. I think Trump's for real. Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[22:10.880 --> 22:15.840]  Doesn't mean all his actions are what I would do, but I mean, he really means to be president.
[22:15.840 --> 22:21.200]  He's really fighting the deep state and they see him as a threat to their power. They see him as
[22:21.200 --> 22:25.840]  a rival. If it looks like he's about to win again, I think they're going to shoot him. I think they're
[22:25.840 --> 22:29.840]  going to blow his airplane up. And he even said that last week. He said, well, I'm going to go
[22:29.840 --> 22:33.840]  ahead and just walk right in front of everybody in Manhattan and handcuffs. If I get killed,
[22:33.840 --> 22:41.200]  so what? I'll be a martyr. So he is in that fully committed mode. I found Jared Kushner
[22:41.200 --> 22:46.240]  disgusting. I found people worshiping Trump disgusting. I found all the delusional stuff
[22:46.240 --> 22:53.120]  about how he's invincible and the Q stuff to do not be true. I've got a lot of problems, but
[22:55.600 --> 23:00.240]  comparing Trump to the Democrats is not a lesser of two evils. It's two different animals.
[23:00.240 --> 23:06.560]  It's two different things, but here's the deal. What do we do other than Trump? Because I don't
[23:06.560 --> 23:11.280]  think he'll save us. None of us can individually save ourselves. All of us working together and
[23:11.280 --> 23:15.920]  through God can, but I mean, really, obviously they're scared of and don't want him there. So
[23:16.800 --> 23:23.680]  do you want him back in or do you like DeSantis or am I wrong? Am I right? How do we put pressure
[23:23.680 --> 23:29.840]  on Trump to be more hardcore? Now it looks like he will be way more hardcore. That's basically
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.480]  the open discussion I'm having in my own brain that I'd like to share with you because I respect
[23:34.480 --> 23:38.320]  your views. I respect your ideas. I love the different angles and points you raise.
[23:38.320 --> 23:45.680]  So we're talking about one issue tonight, and that is President Trump as the Republican nominee
[23:45.680 --> 23:50.880]  because he's going to get it. They could indict him all day. That'll take a couple of years
[23:51.520 --> 23:56.640]  to get a conviction. They're having to back off right now because it made him explode the polls.
[23:56.640 --> 24:00.480]  I kind of told him that would have happened. I didn't know it would be 28, 30 points. I thought
[24:00.480 --> 24:06.320]  it'd be like 15, 20, as I said a few weeks ago, but what are they going to do? Because
[24:07.200 --> 24:10.560]  I want Bolsonaro back in. They stole the election from him. He isn't perfect either.
[24:11.360 --> 24:18.320]  I want to see more people like Orban in Europe. I'd like to see Nigel Farage run for parliament
[24:19.040 --> 24:24.560]  in the UK, not just run for parliament, ESPN parliament, run for prime minister.
[24:25.520 --> 24:30.480]  So none of these guys are going to save us individually, but remember the Japanese
[24:30.480 --> 24:33.040]  prime minister was really fighting the New World Order. He got assassinated,
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.200]  was getting ready to run again reportedly. So it's a very dangerous position. Trump said,
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.720]  make no mistake, the hatred the deep state has of him is very real. Just by being a supporter,
[24:44.720 --> 24:53.760]  I've experienced insane levels of attacks, but do not mix the two. Saying they hate his guts
[24:53.920 --> 24:59.360]  does not mean he's wonderful, does not mean he's infallible, does not mean he doesn't have issues
[24:59.360 --> 25:04.960]  like all of us do. He's got major blind spots. Man, we can talk all about those all day, but
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.720]  I'm asking you, what do you think? And then if you don't like Trump, what is your alternative?
[25:10.720 --> 25:16.240]  Or if you do like Trump, please just don't tell me everything's handled. It's wonderful. He's
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.080]  playing 10D chess. He knows all the answers. Just let me tell you something he doesn't.
[25:20.080 --> 25:26.960]  And it's a really a positive thing in a way that obviously he's a wild card. The system hates him,
[25:26.960 --> 25:32.240]  but it's also positive in that when I got up here and promoted to Santa's in the last six months,
[25:32.240 --> 25:36.640]  it was to make Trump get better on issues. I knew he'd be the nominee. I said that at the time,
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.480]  but I'm not some loyal opposition that just sits there and opposes things to look good.
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.520]  I do it to get people to be better because I'm not a person following different leaders. I'm
[25:47.520 --> 25:54.800]  trying to get issues and policies in. I'm a action person. I'm a policy person. I'm a
[25:55.360 --> 25:58.880]  judge of tree by its fruits person as Christ told us to be.
[26:00.720 --> 26:06.800]  But I have seen it many times, not all the time, like on the vaccine issue. I had two videos
[26:06.800 --> 26:11.440]  produced, got them to Trump, talked to the folks that watched it with Trump. Trump tried to call
[26:11.440 --> 26:15.200]  me. I missed the call. He said, I don't want to hear about this vaccine again. I think it's great.
[26:15.760 --> 26:20.880]  And if people don't like it, screw them. Okay, got it. But on the issue of
[26:23.360 --> 26:30.800]  death and destruction and baseball bats and all this garbage, kind of saber rattling,
[26:30.800 --> 26:36.240]  Trump came out and deleted his tweet or his social post Friday with all the death and destruction,
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.880]  baseball bat garbage, because we don't need that. That opens a major trap up for the globalist stage
[26:40.880 --> 26:43.840]  events or provocative term and blame us. I think everybody understands that. So
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.200]  that's where I'm at on this, but we do see that we're able to have an effect on Trump.
[26:49.200 --> 26:53.520]  It's a positive thing and he's way more hardcore than he used to be. And again,
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.440]  words aren't just words when it's somebody at his level, this will change the playing field forever.
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.080]  This will move the needle towards people exposing globalism as being the real enemy. And once their
[27:04.080 --> 27:10.880]  agenda is realized to be the bane of our existence, it's game over. So we're moving
[27:11.520 --> 27:19.120]  the ball down the field towards the touchdown in zone very fast. And I can tell you this is
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.480]  very positive from my perspective. Maybe you disagree. I'd like to hear from you.
[27:24.480 --> 27:35.600]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 or 877-789. Alex, if you agree, if you disagree,
[27:35.600 --> 27:38.800]  if you're a long time caller, a first time caller, I don't care whether you're black,
[27:38.800 --> 27:43.920]  white, gay, straight, tall, short. All I want is you to have a clean phone line
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.960]  and be ready to make your point because I'm going to hang up on you quick because I respect your
[27:48.960 --> 27:57.520]  time and I will get to the next person. 877-789-2539. Also remember, I'm not fun about the Republican
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.280]  party. I'm not fun about the Democratic party. I'm not fun about big money or George Soros or
[28:01.280 --> 28:06.880]  the Easter money. I am funded by your purchases of products at infoworkstore.com plus their
[28:06.880 --> 28:12.880]  amazing products. And I am very excited to see how popular Alex Jones for president t-shirt is
[28:12.880 --> 28:16.720]  that's meant to be a fun shirt to meet like-minded people, cause conversations
[28:16.720 --> 28:23.200]  and trigger leftist libtards, but it's a limited edition one month search shirt. That means it'll
[28:23.200 --> 28:27.360]  only be for sale another three and a half weeks. And when it's gone, it's gone. Every new shirt
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.920]  will be one month and that's it. And a lot of folks are getting it. I appreciate it because
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.120]  that helps on the operation. It's just a historic little memento. Get your Alex Jones for president
[28:37.120 --> 28:43.920]  on the front 2024 on the back info wars.com at info war store.com. It's a fundraiser shirt

[28:59.760 --> 29:04.400]  The fight against the new world order is now the top story in the world. The globalists are in deep
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.760]  trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down info wars and
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.960]  other truth tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless others. So please pray
[29:14.960 --> 29:19.280]  for us now more than ever. Spread the word about the broadcast and get great products to keep us

[30:00.800 --> 30:05.600]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[30:06.240 --> 30:11.280]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew
[30:11.280 --> 30:16.720]  at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[30:16.720 --> 30:21.680]  been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard
[30:21.680 --> 30:28.320]  work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.640]  myself and the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now
[30:32.640 --> 30:38.320]  to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word.
[30:38.320 --> 30:42.640]  I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never
[30:42.640 --> 30:47.600]  go to info war store.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while
[30:47.600 --> 30:52.080]  at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products
[30:52.080 --> 30:57.120]  at info wars store.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to info wars store.com,
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.640]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now. I've got some good news.
[31:01.520 --> 31:08.480]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[31:08.480 --> 31:14.160]  That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual
[31:14.160 --> 31:19.040]  viewers and listeners ever go to info war store.com and ever actually buy the products. So you're
[31:19.040 --> 31:24.480]  missing out on these products. Plus it funds the info war. Think of what we've done with just 1%
[31:24.480 --> 31:29.760]  of our massive audience actually buying products. Think what would happen if those of you on the
[31:29.760 --> 31:35.440]  fence actually went to info war store.com and got some of these amazing products. I would recommend
[31:35.440 --> 31:40.320]  turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects.
[31:40.320 --> 31:45.840]  So you reorder and see how great it is. Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum
[31:45.840 --> 31:50.640]  CBD oil. That's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as
[31:50.640 --> 31:56.000]  well, or real red pill plus just go try the product funding info war and help us defeat
[31:56.000 --> 32:03.040]  the roller together. Info war store.com. I'm a huge believer in information. I watch info wars
[32:03.040 --> 32:07.280]  every day and follow Alex Jones closely. You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve and he's
[32:07.280 --> 32:12.880]  been demonized as a conspiracy theorist. Think about how frustrated we are. If you've been awake
[32:12.880 --> 32:17.200]  for a year or two, imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like
[32:17.200 --> 32:24.400]  decades. Alex has been right on for over a decade. This is reality. It just
[32:26.400 --> 32:30.400]  is stranger than fiction. The revolution of peaceful information is coming,
[32:30.400 --> 32:34.320]  and when it comes time, you people are gonna be brought to punish. You're lying to the public.
[32:34.320 --> 32:40.000]  It's disgusting. The media continues to misrepresent what I've said. He may be America's
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.760]  best known conspiracy theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country,
[32:45.760 --> 32:49.840]  bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[32:49.840 --> 32:53.120]  We're gonna get fired up about the real things, the things that matter.
[32:57.680 --> 33:05.120]  Burning hell, New World Order. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[33:05.120 --> 33:14.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:21.120 --> 33:28.480]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[33:35.120 --> 33:44.640]  You know, supporting President Trump eight years ago has been really hard for me. I've been
[33:44.640 --> 33:49.440]  attacked, I've been demonized, I've been lied about, and that makes it even more frustrating
[33:49.440 --> 33:55.760]  when he does the wrong thing. And so again, I don't think he's our savior. Jesus Christ is our savior.
[33:55.760 --> 34:01.200]  But I'll say this, the things he's saying will irrevocably damage the New World Order and their
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.400]  agenda and will be picked up by world leaders everywhere against the New World Order agenda.
[34:06.400 --> 34:13.440]  So the victory of getting globalism in the deep state out in the open is unrivaled and is
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.200]  unprecedented. Don't make any mistake about that. He's not under their control. They're scared as
[34:19.200 --> 34:25.440]  hell of him. He's got major problems though. Because he wanted to be the savior when they
[34:25.440 --> 34:30.160]  said, sir, we got a lockdown forever. He said, no, I'll warp speed it. Even though they already
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.200]  had made the vaccine and they brought him that plan. But so he could be the savior,
[34:36.160 --> 34:40.560]  he went along with it and now won't admit he's wrong. I'll criticize him till the day I die for that.
[34:42.480 --> 34:45.360]  But everything else he's doing is completely pissing them off.
[34:46.720 --> 34:49.360]  So I ask the listeners, do we just sit back and support
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.040]  some other Republican that's going to lay down to the New World Order?
[34:53.040 --> 35:01.040]  Now look, I'm no rocket scientist, but I am a political analyst that's proven I know what I'm
[35:01.040 --> 35:09.840]  talking about. And the delusional left when they went after Trump again did not realize what would
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.080]  make him explode in popularity, which has now happened in all the polls. Even the New York
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.400]  Post, it's the mouth of the Republican party. You know, the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.640]  the Democratic Party and said, oh, look, the Santa's top donors say, sit it out.
[35:23.680 --> 35:30.320]  You're not the guy. Trump is pulled into the pole position. He's like a transgender swimmer,
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.120]  you know, winning a 200 yard race by 100 yards against women. By the way, that just happened
[35:37.120 --> 35:43.040]  again a few days ago. We have video of it. This gigantic dude like blasts all these women.
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.920]  I mean, he could compete against the best dudes, but he wants to like wipe these women out.
[35:47.920 --> 35:50.320]  He won by an entire hundred yards.
[35:54.560 --> 35:58.480]  And that's where Trump is. That's why last week I'm like, what the hell are you doing
[35:58.480 --> 36:04.560]  with baseball bats on TV and talking about death and destruction? You're going to win, man.
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.840]  The only hope they've got is getting us violent. And again, I spent an hour bitching at Trump
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.040]  about that. When he's wrong, he's wrong because here's the deal. I'm not going to sit here and
[36:15.040 --> 36:20.720]  kiss his ass. I don't want to go to Mar-a-Lago and sit around like, you know, at some debutante
[36:20.720 --> 36:25.360]  rally. I don't want to be part of the power structure. I want freedom. I want the globalist
[36:25.360 --> 36:31.600]  off our backs. And if Trump will do it, great. But gut level, I know that if he's able to get in,
[36:31.600 --> 36:34.160]  which I think they'll kill him, I actually think he won't be able to get in. I'll be honest with
[36:34.160 --> 36:41.920]  you right now. If he's able to get back in, it's curtains for the deep state. He's going to go
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.920]  after them so hard it'll make your head spin. The problem is they know that. So we should have a
[36:47.920 --> 36:54.560]  large discussion about that right now. We've got loaded phone lines, Jason, Carlos, Michael, Anthony,
[36:54.560 --> 37:04.640]  Roberto, Killer, Savage, Ignacio, Julio, Candace, and others. So here's the deal. We're six minutes
[37:04.640 --> 37:08.080]  to break. I'm going to take at least five calls. So have your point ready. I'll move to the next
[37:08.080 --> 37:14.560]  person. Thanks for calling Jason in Corpus Christi, Texas. Yeah, it's a long time no talks. I totally
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.120]  agree with you 100% on all this. You know, I used to love Trump. I hated him. Starting to love him
[37:21.120 --> 37:26.080]  again. All the right things he's saying. I don't care who it is. We just got to get behind someone
[37:26.080 --> 37:33.440]  and just keep marching forward because we can't let these assholes win. So why are you supporting
[37:33.440 --> 37:39.280]  Trump? Because I actually listened to him. And when I listened to his speech last night,
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.680]  like you said, he's not, he's no globalist. He's no nobody. He's fighting and I'm standing
[37:43.680 --> 37:50.480]  behind him 100%. And again, you get my point. That type of rhetoric hurts the new order so bad. I
[37:50.480 --> 37:54.640]  mean, you know, words at that level, exposing they're the enemy and the bad guys. You couldn't
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.120]  ask for something better. I mean, that is devastating. That's why they want you, Mr. Jones,
[37:59.120 --> 38:03.280]  the same thing. They want us all and they ain't going to get it. So time to saddle up,
[38:03.280 --> 38:10.080]  boys. Let's go to work. I hear you. I'm saying it right now. I support Trump fighting World War
[38:10.080 --> 38:13.920]  III and I support Trump. You know, DeSantis came out and said he was anti-war a week ago,
[38:13.920 --> 38:19.200]  two weeks ago. Now he came out and said he loves war. So I don't like that out of DeSantis.
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.720]  Jason in Arlington, Texas. You're on the air. You think Trump's a Judas Goat. Tell us about it.
[38:23.680 --> 38:25.840]  Hey Alex, you hear me okay? Yes, sir. Thanks for calling.
[38:26.800 --> 38:33.520]  Okay. So I think Trump is a new version of Operation Trust. I think that the corrupt system
[38:33.520 --> 38:37.760]  knew that their cover was blown. They know that they have about a single digit approval rating.
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.960]  You said that many times. So they needed a controlled opposition operative to pacify any
[38:42.960 --> 38:47.680]  real resistance. And that's exactly what Trump does because he never gets at the real issues,
[38:47.680 --> 38:53.040]  the federal reserve, the military industrial complex. Ron Paul, I think Trump is wearing
[38:53.040 --> 38:58.720]  the mask of Ron Paul. And the system stopped Ron Paul because they knew he was real. Same
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.320]  thing with Ross Perot. Those were real guys. Trump has always been a part of this system.
[39:04.320 --> 39:09.600]  There's even a really interesting video of Sammy DeBol Gravano on YouTube where he says
[39:09.600 --> 39:15.120]  back in the day he tried to shake down Trump, but couldn't because Trump was surrounded by FBI.
[39:15.120 --> 39:20.640]  So he's had FBI around him for basically his whole career. Now Alex, you are the real thought
[39:20.640 --> 39:27.440]  leader. Okay. Trump needed you. You don't need Trump. Trump came and bent the knee to you because
[39:27.440 --> 39:34.480]  he needed your audience. He needed to get the Patriots on his side, but he is not real. He is
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.040]  Operation Trust 2.0 because the system is way more sophisticated than we give them credit for.
[39:39.040 --> 39:44.240]  They know what they're doing. They needed to mislead the resistance. That's my main point.
[39:44.880 --> 39:51.600]  The only way you're right, and you could be, is that we take the horrible Democrat attacks
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.360]  on Trump as if they're the full deep state. They're not the full deep state. They legitimately
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.240]  don't like him. But I think you're right that at a certain level, part of the deep state
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.120]  is opposition to the leftist and that Trump's their guy. I just don't know if Trump actually
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.800]  knows that because I know Trump. I've talked to him a ton. I know folks that know him well.
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.320]  There is nobody, brother, telling him what to do. I mean, let me tell you.
[40:13.360 --> 40:16.800]  So you could say he serves a bad element or something at some point,
[40:16.800 --> 40:23.600]  but he makes all his own decisions. So, I mean, he may be getting played or something,
[40:23.600 --> 40:27.600]  but I don't think he consciously is trying to sell the country out. What do you think?
[40:29.520 --> 40:33.920]  The phrase that you coined, geniusly, back in the day, the left-right paradigm,
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.720]  um, it's fake. It doesn't exist. So they had to create an anti-system character
[40:41.600 --> 40:46.320]  to corral everyone. And that's totally what Jan Six was. I mean, look at the cue shot and look
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.440]  at that situation where he came in just like a complete idiot. To me, that was a crisis actor.
[40:51.440 --> 40:54.240]  To me, that was someone that the system put in there for a photo op.
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.440]  Yeah, but we now know he's in jail and got set up. But I hear your point. I appreciate your call.
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.920]  Carlos in Canada. What's your, what's your view on Trump?
[41:06.240 --> 41:11.760]  Hello? Yes, you're on the air, sir. Thank you, Alex. Happy Sunday. I was distracted,
[41:11.760 --> 41:19.520]  but I want to tell you, if you want to reflect a little bit in 2016, listen to President Trump's
[41:19.520 --> 41:25.520]  inaugural speech. It will give you an idea as to where it was coming from and what he wanted to
[41:25.520 --> 41:32.240]  achieve. Shortly afterwards, you realize and others that he did not have a team behind him.
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.800]  He trusted, he thought he could trust Jeff Sessions, but that was only a superficial
[41:38.800 --> 41:45.040]  relationship with a Senator that was loyal to the Senate, a Senate that internally was against the
[41:45.040 --> 41:53.680]  president. He was not supposed to be elected and he was. Thirdly, if you want to understand why
[41:53.680 --> 42:00.400]  President Trump will be elected again, it will be because he understands America probably better
[42:00.400 --> 42:06.000]  than a lot of people who are billionaires and who have been billionaires. He is an American
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.840]  self-made from apparently the Western type of thinking, but from New York who wanted, like all
[42:11.840 --> 42:18.720]  billionaires, to win at the win. So for him, winning is important. But he could not have won
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.320]  because he didn't have a team. He must have a team. And if he doesn't, at present time, and
[42:24.320 --> 42:31.440]  remember, we told him in May 2020, drop everything and work on the election. Make sure that the
[42:31.440 --> 42:38.800]  election is not turned against you. If this doesn't happen before 2024, we'll just have a repeat.
[42:38.800 --> 42:45.920]  He has to make sure that every vote counts. Simple. All right, stay there, Carlos. We'll give you about
[42:45.920 --> 42:51.280]  another minute to finish up on the other points you've got than Michael, Anthony, Roberto, Killer,
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.800]  Savage, Ignacio, Julio, Candace, and others. Ton of phone calls coming up. Stay with us at fullwars.com.
[43:00.400 --> 43:06.800]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[43:10.080 --> 43:14.080]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president
[43:14.080 --> 43:20.320]  2024 shirt. I am not seriously planning to run for president. This is an idea the crew had.
[43:20.320 --> 43:25.200]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex Jones is right. There's infowars.com in the back.
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.000]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front. It's a fundraiser shirt. It's made out of really nice
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.920]  fabric. It's high quality. And it is a exclusive shirt to infowarstore.com. And when the shirts
[43:35.920 --> 43:43.280]  are gone, they're gone. We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts. And we'll
[43:43.280 --> 43:47.360]  have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people,
[43:47.360 --> 43:52.480]  and you'll be able to keep us on the air. No way. No way. That's a bridge too far.
[43:52.480 --> 43:56.800]  That's no, it can't be. And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[43:56.800 --> 44:04.080]  At infowarstore.com. I'm a huge believer in information. I watch Infowars every day and
[44:04.080 --> 44:08.640]  follow Alex Jones closely. You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve. And he's been demonized
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.360]  as a conspiracy theorist. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.760]  year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones and those guys have been awake for like decades.
[44:19.760 --> 44:27.120]  Alex has been right on for over a decade. This is reality. It just pancakes. Proof is
[44:27.120 --> 44:31.760]  stranger than fiction. The revolution of peaceful information is coming. And when it comes time,
[44:31.760 --> 44:35.520]  you people are going to be brought to punishment. You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[44:35.520 --> 44:41.520]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said. He may be America's best known conspiracy
[44:41.520 --> 44:47.840]  theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks,
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.160]  the biggest megaphone in the country. We're going to get fired up about the real things,
[44:52.160 --> 45:02.000]  the things that matter. Burning hell, New World Order. We now have three new game changing

[46:00.080 --> 46:05.520]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government. A flying disc has been
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.720]  found and is now in the possession of the army. Here is a bulletin from CBS News. President
[46:10.720 --> 46:18.560]  Kennedy has been shot. This is a different kind of war. The USS Liberty had just been attacked by
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.840]  Israeli jets and torpedoes. The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[46:23.840 --> 46:27.840]  They took the babies out of 80 bears and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[46:27.840 --> 46:34.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion. We need to go into the capital.
[46:35.760 --> 46:40.880]  You always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions. You guys censored
[46:40.880 --> 46:46.640]  Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is push
[46:46.720 --> 46:53.120]  the reset button. As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists
[46:53.120 --> 47:08.080]  start going to prison. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.640 --> 47:26.320]  All right, Roger Stone has some big breaking news on the Trump front. He'll be popping in
[47:26.320 --> 47:33.920]  next hour. But Carlos, I wanted you to finish up the points you were making on Trump. Look,
[47:33.920 --> 47:38.560]  I know Trump is way farther than perfect, but I know the deep state actually hates him.
[47:38.560 --> 47:42.720]  What do you say to callers that say he's an operative forum? It's a pretty articulate
[47:42.720 --> 47:49.360]  caller. I almost agree with him, but then I don't, that say he's controlled opposition.
[47:49.360 --> 47:54.400]  What do you say about that, Carlos? I don't think so. You see, I've been calling
[47:54.400 --> 48:01.440]  your program since 2016, actually, immediately after the last debate with Hillary Clinton.
[48:02.960 --> 48:09.360]  I have to tell you this. President Trump, before running, he's a businessman. He had invested over
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.640]  $100 million in his affair. He wasn't going to leave anything that could come against him
[48:15.840 --> 48:21.280]  uncovered. Yes, people would criticize him, vent all sorts of things about him, but he knew very
[48:21.280 --> 48:27.920]  well that he had to be clean and to have to be straight. What was devastating about his campaign
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.560]  was that he said to the blacks of America, black people of America, he said to them,
[48:32.560 --> 48:38.560]  hey, what have the Democrats done for you lately? And that simply left a question mark dangling.
[48:38.560 --> 48:43.280]  When he looked at the open borders and he said to people, look, you don't just let anybody in. We
[48:43.280 --> 48:50.320]  have borders to keep criminals out. There are rules. People realize, hey, he's right. Now,
[48:50.320 --> 48:56.080]  all of those things he tried to say and do now have been used against to divide the people of America.
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.560]  And my advice to President Trump is this. Get yourself a team of people that are good people,
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.040]  proven in the field, real patriots like yourself, and don't just go for whoever tells you.
[49:09.040 --> 49:14.000]  Don't wait until somebody tells you, oh, you have to take in John Bolton and then ask permission
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.720]  as he did in May 2020. Can I get rid of this guy Bolton, please? Absolutely. I mean, that shows how
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.960]  he brought in the establishment because they lied to his face. And so there won't be some
[49:24.960 --> 49:28.960]  honeymoon if he wins this time with me. Of course, a year and a half from now is like a million years
[49:28.960 --> 49:34.080]  from now. We'll be putting his feet to the fire the entire time. I just ask folks that are against
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.240]  Trump, what is your other option? I appreciate your call, Carlos. Good points. Michael in FEMA
[49:40.240 --> 49:46.160]  region 10, that means the West Coast. You're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. So let me get this
[49:46.160 --> 49:55.680]  straight. A 74 year old billionaire is supposedly a controlled opposition, a guy that nobody can
[49:55.680 --> 50:01.680]  control. He's working for the left and is doing all this. It's malarkey. It's garbage. I know
[50:01.680 --> 50:07.520]  Trump personally. He is completely pigheaded. No one is telling him anything. I know his family's
[50:07.520 --> 50:12.080]  telling him not to run. So now you won't even talk to him other than Don. The word is he doesn't even
[50:12.080 --> 50:17.280]  talk to the rest of his family now. The thing about Trump is that you can tell he's genuinely
[50:17.280 --> 50:22.880]  a patriot. This guy loves his country. It's absolutely clear. The other thing is I've really
[50:22.880 --> 50:27.760]  enjoyed your, uh, the interviews of Michael Flynn, general Flynn and Flynn is a patriot.
[50:27.760 --> 50:32.720]  You know, now Flynn, he used to be a Democrat and now he's changed because he's seen the inside.
[50:32.720 --> 50:38.640]  He knows how devious it is. But you know, one thing about Trump is that he is appointing judges
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.560]  who've changed, uh, the federal courts for the better. And then that's getting reversed by Supreme
[50:44.560 --> 50:49.520]  court. That's right. The Bruin decision, which is restoring the second amendment, our right to bear
[50:49.520 --> 50:53.920]  arms is because of Trump. You think some controlled opposition and we've been winning
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.320]  every major federal case right now, all the Democrat gun legislation is being thrown out.
[50:59.280 --> 51:07.120]  Yes. Now let me tell you, there's, there are three military officers that about 2017,
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.160]  we sent in a suggestion to the department of defense because the department of war back in
[51:12.160 --> 51:17.520]  1938 had a citizenship guide, which taught citizenship to all the military. You know,
[51:17.520 --> 51:22.800]  the 1776 commission that Trump put out, you think some controlled opposition guy is going to do
[51:22.800 --> 51:28.160]  that. That's what a Patriot does. There is no better time to teach our troops, all of them and
[51:28.160 --> 51:33.680]  all branches of the services about our guts, constitution, our heritage. That's what our,
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.000]  our country. We took the country even partially back. Now it's prime to totally wake up.
[51:38.560 --> 51:44.480]  He would never put a 1776 commission in unless he loved the country. So all of these clowns out
[51:44.480 --> 51:48.800]  there who are trying to fight over thinking things. And all the guy was articulate who was
[51:48.800 --> 51:53.280]  saying that, you know, Trump's a controlled opposite. He's overthinking it. You need to look
[51:53.280 --> 51:59.840]  at what people do rather than what they say. And when you look at what Trump did, the man loves
[51:59.840 --> 52:05.040]  his country. All right. And, and, and here's my other question to them. What do we do if we don't
[52:05.040 --> 52:09.440]  have Trump? I mean, you got the Santa saying, I love the Santa's in a lot of ways, but George
[52:09.440 --> 52:15.440]  Herbert Walker Bush is his, his, his idol. He's pro he's pro Russia war. And I still like the
[52:15.440 --> 52:20.080]  Santa's don't get me wrong, but I mean, Trump is just way out ahead of him right now. The rhetoric
[52:20.080 --> 52:24.000]  of we're going to defeat the deep state, the new world order and fire all these agency heads
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.120]  and restore the Republic. I mean, they hate those ideas even being out there. Those ideas
[52:29.120 --> 52:33.920]  are coffin nails to them. That's right. That's because everybody who makes it to the top in
[52:33.920 --> 52:38.720]  politics has been vetted along the way. There's only one guy that hasn't been vetted and that's
[52:38.720 --> 52:45.120]  Trump because he is not a politician. They've been compromised over and over again. Absolutely.
[52:46.560 --> 52:51.520]  That's exactly right. Alex, you know that better than anybody, even Pence. We thought he's Mr.
[52:51.520 --> 52:57.040]  Christian conservative. He was part of the deep state as well. He's a swamp creature. There's no
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.360]  doubt about that. I appreciate your call and what the process the last seven years has been
[53:01.360 --> 53:06.320]  showing us is Roger stones coming up next hour. We'll take your calls as well. Let's go to Anthony
[53:06.320 --> 53:13.360]  in Utah. You're on the air, Anthony. Go ahead. Yes, Alex. I want to talk about something.
[53:13.360 --> 53:23.360]  Chuck Schumer, he's allowed to say roughly to a reporter that the CIA has seven ways to Sunday
[53:23.360 --> 53:28.960]  to, what do you call again? The deep state, the intelligence agencies have seven ways
[53:28.960 --> 53:35.840]  to Sunday to get out, to get back at somebody that if he doesn't vote towards the correct way
[53:35.840 --> 53:43.200]  with abortion, that he's going to feel the, the, the, the heat on him, the world with the heat on
[53:43.200 --> 53:51.200]  him. Okay. And then he also said, um, Maxine warm was says, if I see somebody, if anybody sees anybody
[53:51.200 --> 53:57.760]  in a gas station or in a restaurant or any other place, you get in their face, you get in their
[53:57.760 --> 54:04.000]  face and you tell them, you ain't welcome here. You can't come here. Okay. And then you had, um,
[54:05.120 --> 54:13.040]  some comedian who had a mock dummy head of Trump. Okay. That they cut off and it was dripping blood
[54:13.040 --> 54:18.160]  and she was walking around and his son happened to see that I'm going to call it a commercial for
[54:18.160 --> 54:24.000]  right now. Okay. And his son got very scared that he thought his father was dead. That was about
[54:24.080 --> 54:27.440]  three. That was about, uh, five years ago. Hello, Alex. Are you there?
[54:28.800 --> 54:35.920]  A hundred percent. I'm listening to you, brother. Hello. Yes. Anthony, I appreciate your call. Your
[54:35.920 --> 54:41.120]  phone has lost connection. Uh, let's go to Roberto in Florida. Then Roger stone, Roberto, go ahead.
[54:42.400 --> 54:47.680]  All right. God bless you. God bless your crew. Uh, two quick points I'd like to make. I'd like
[54:47.680 --> 54:52.160]  to see you get Scott Ritter on. If he could, he did the great speech about the war machine in
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.880]  Ukraine. People can look it up on YouTube. I haven't had Scott Ritter on in about 14 years.
[54:56.880 --> 55:03.840]  We should get him back on. Great, great person. Uh, my thing is I'm recently saved, recently
[55:03.840 --> 55:10.400]  baptized, baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. The guy who died for our sins played, paid for
[55:10.400 --> 55:16.960]  our souls with his blood. We are all bought and paid for by him. We are true God, sons of God,
[55:16.960 --> 55:21.760]  daughters of God. People need to read their Bibles. This has all been pre-written. There's
[55:21.760 --> 55:27.120]  nothing we can do to control any of this. I did agree with Trump in the beginning. I don't know.
[55:27.120 --> 55:32.720]  Fool me once. You're bad. Fool me twice. My bad. I don't know what to think anymore, but I do know
[55:33.440 --> 55:38.480]  it saved to read your Bible. And if you're ever down in Sarasota, I've just moved down here to
[55:38.480 --> 55:44.080]  Florida. I found a great church. The pastor speaks about everything that you talk that no one speaks
[55:44.080 --> 55:47.280]  about. This guy talks about it all. What's his name? What's the name of the church?
[55:48.320 --> 55:54.080]  Pastor Danny in Manatee County. And it's the house of fellowship. All right, brother,
[55:54.080 --> 55:59.040]  thank you for the call. All right, we're going to get to killer and Savage and Ignatio and Julio and
[55:59.040 --> 56:03.680]  Candace and everybody else. Keep those phones loaded. They are loaded, but I don't see names
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.320]  according to those people that are on hold. So we're taking a ton of your calls. So is Owen
[56:08.320 --> 56:14.960]  Troyer in about an hour and three minutes from now, he'll be hosting six to eight PM central,
[56:14.960 --> 56:20.480]  but Roger Stone has got a lot of big breaking news, a lot of big developments. Roger,
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.520]  great to have you here. We're going to break about a minute, but give us a prelude to what
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.720]  you're going to be covering. You know, Alex, you now have the New York times and the Hill
[56:28.720 --> 56:35.840]  to a left wing publications, uh, openly admitting that Donald Trump's attacks on Ron DeSantis have
[56:36.160 --> 56:44.000]  the desired effect as has his combative pugilistic approach, uh, to the various investigations. Uh,
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.520]  and he is literally soaring in the polls, uh, and I think, uh, going to soon be untouchable
[56:49.520 --> 56:55.600]  for the Republican nomination. And once again, our strongest possible nominee to the governor,
[56:55.600 --> 57:00.320]  DeSantis has misplayed his cards badly here. I want to talk to you all about it.
[57:00.320 --> 57:06.160]  And we got 20 seconds to break, but average poll Trump, 28 points ahead of DeSantis. I mean,
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.960]  he's 15 to 20 points ahead of Biden in a rematch. I mean, wow, they really screwed the pooch with
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.840]  Trump, didn't they? I think they'd made an enormous mistake. Uh, and, uh, you know, when
[57:15.840 --> 57:21.200]  the New York times admits that things are going your way, they must really be going your way.
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.280]  Wow. Well, I don't want us to all to start celebrating yet here. Let's come back next
[57:27.280 --> 57:32.800]  hour and talk about it with the great Roger Stone, former top Trump advisor and the guy
[57:32.800 --> 57:38.080]  that got Trump to run for the presidency. This is a big deal. Big show tonight. Our number two

[59:55.920 --> 01:00:08.960]  It's Alex Jones, waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:22.960]  of the info war. Well, corporate media says 25,000 people, local news reports that 40,000 fit inside
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.800]  the area they had, but just like January six, he had 40,000 inside the ellipse and another
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.880]  close to a million outside, uh, people lined up for hours and hours. Couldn't get in. If anything,
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:42.960]  Trump goes with too small a stadiums, but man, uh, the rhetoric bringing down the deep state,
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.120]  bringing down the new world order, 28 points ahead of the Sanderson major polls. We'll be
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.040]  breaking that down when some stations join us in five minutes, but Roger, let's jump into it right
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:58.800]  now. Is there any other political figure in America that could command that kind of crowd,
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.320]  uh, and that kind of media attention, particularly when the mainstream media is doing their very best
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.720]  to pretend he doesn't exist. Trump is washed up. He's finished. He has no appeal. He's done.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.800]  And then you see something like this, where he not only commands an enormous crowd, uh, and look,
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:24.400]  Waco isn't Dallas, as you know. I mean that this is really a historical, uh, political phenomena.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.600]  And I think he laid it out, uh, better than I've ever heard him. Our problem is not Russia. Our
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.920]  problem is not China. Our problem is our own corrupted leaders. What could be more plain than
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:44.320]  that? I totally agree with you. And you just hit the nail on the head. Trump's incredible success,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.920]  still having rounds of 50,000 people, Texas, 40,000 with almost no announcement, like four
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.760]  or five days pre-announcement in the middle of nowhere. I mean, folks, Waco's cow pastures in
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.760]  case you didn't know, uh, it's two hours north of Austin. This is the death of the corporate media's
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.960]  attempt to control debate and shows they don't have the power they claim. Uh, it's absolutely
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:10.640]  true, Alex. And I must tell you, uh, it was very foolhardy of me. I went on Twitter and I mildly
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.920]  criticized Matt Gaetz red blazer. I said, I appreciate your support for president Trump, but
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:22.560]  I keep that red blazer for Christmas. If I were you, I was so overwhelmingly outvoted, uh, that
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.840]  although I myself would reserve the red blazer for Christmas, Congressman Gates can wear anything.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.080]  I was about to say, he looks like when I was a kid and they had huge movie theaters in Dallas,
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.600]  they've gotten rid of it. Have these giant screens. I don't know why things get less good
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.040]  as time goes on. But when I was a kid, my mom would take me to this big theater in Dallas
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.920]  to see classic movies like Ben Hur and stuff that were reshowing. This is gigantic movie screen.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.440]  And they had men mainly and women in red, red blazers. And he looks like the person with the
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.440]  flashlight that takes you to your seat. Yeah. The usher it's the usher look. And we're not referring
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.840]  to the rapper singer in this case, but look, he gave a very fiery speech. And I love the fact
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.520]  that Trump basically announced all the congressmen that have endorsed him. And then he made reference
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.480]  to those who he endorsed, who he has clearly contacted and they're saying, Oh, I love you,
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.200]  Mr. President. I'm going to be for you. I'm just not ready to endorse you. Now. Trump basically
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:23.600]  said, if you're not with us today, we don't want you. I love that. That is vintage Trump. It is
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.520]  a time for choosing and people have to decide, are you with the rhino establishment? I mean,
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:37.600]  Karl Rove blurts out on Fox referring to DeSantis as our campaign. What a stunning reveal that was.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.520]  All right. I'm going to shut up and give me the floor when we come back. I want to walk through
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.040]  the tables, totally turning on DeSantis. He was neck and neck with Trump. Some polls ahead
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.720]  just two months ago. What happened since then? Was it his endorsement of the war?
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.400]  Was it him saying his role models, George HW Bush, skull and bones? What did it? And then let's not
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.840]  get too positive here. They're still trying to indict Trump. And I know a lot of his family
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.000]  doesn't like him being all happy about this, but he knows he's innocent. Will he get indicted next
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:17.120]  week? Or is Trump right that this Soros creature in New York is about to back off? Is it true?
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:22.720]  The witch hunt against me is dead. Trump says Manhattan DA tricked by fraud star witness,
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:30.800]  who again, he's not into Stormy Daniels, he says. He goes on to say Trump says he thinks Manhattan
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.520]  DA Alvin Bragg has dropped the case against him. We'll get all that from Roger Stone straight
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.280]  ahead. But I'll say this, and I'm not the Trump ass-kissing club here because Trump grabs me up
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.200]  the wall. He looks like he's lost 30, 40 pounds and looks great. In the photos and video I saw,
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.720]  looks like he's for his age. My God, I'm jealous. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Roger Stone,
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.440]  straight ahead.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:30.400]  cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. Articrats only understand one word. No, no, no.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:38.480]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.400]  We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.600]  you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:56.720]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no, and we say no to your war.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:10.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.200]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.520]  And Roger Stone's with us for about 30 minutes at the bottom of the hour, then we'll come right back
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:27.600]  to the loaded phone lines. Trump is now in major polls, 25 to 35 points ahead of DeSantis. Everybody
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.880]  else, their attempt to arrest him has blown up in their face. Here's a short clip of Matt
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.080]  Gates yesterday to a crowd of at least 40,000 people, standing room only, tens of thousands
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:45.280]  turned away in Waco, Texas. Only Donald Trump could have rescued us from Hillary Clinton.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.760]  Without Trump doing three rallies in the final week in the 2018 election in Florida,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:03.600]  my governor today would probably be Andrew Gillum. How weird is that? And without Trump
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.240]  dragging Ted Cruz across the finish line, your senator would probably be Beto Beto.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:23.200]  So Ron DeSantis, Ted Cruz, Patriots of the MAGA movement delivered for you in your time of need.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.480]  Today, Ron DeSantis and Ted Cruz should endorse Donald Trump for president
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.480]  and stand with us as we were so proud to stand with them.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:43.280]  All right, Roger Stone, I'm going to shut up. You got the floor. History happening right now.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.560]  Deep state horrified. Will they indict Trump? What's really happening?
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.280]  Well, sir, there's a certain irony in that clip you just showed, Alex, because other than Donald
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:59.040]  Trump, there's really no one in America more responsible for the election of Ron DeSantis in
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:06.640]  2018 than Congressman Matt Gaetz. People have to remember that DeSantis was running at about
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:13.040]  7% in the polls. Every single 67 Republican county chairman in the state, the entire
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.800]  Republican power structure had endorsed Ron DeSantis' opponent. It was Matt Gaetz who
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:25.280]  persuaded Congressman, pardon me, President Trump to endorse and take a chance on Congressman
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:31.680]  DeSantis. DeSantis zoomed ahead in the Republican primary, and then as Matt Gaetz correctly said,
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.880]  Trump had to change his schedule to come to Florida in the final two weeks of the 2018
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:44.080]  campaign to drag DeSantis across the finish line. What amazes me, Alex, is that Governor DeSantis
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:51.440]  has maintained his discipline under relentless taunts and attacks by Donald Trump, which is his
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.920]  combative, pugilistic style. If I had a dollar for every person who contacted me and said,
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.280]  I love Trump and I like DeSantis, please tell him to stop attacking DeSantis. First of all,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.040]  you're wasting your breath. Donald Trump makes his own decisions. But secondarily,
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.480]  that strategy has paid off two times. At one time, in the sense that Trump has taken on
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:19.200]  all of these investigations of him, whether they are by Soros, Stoog, Alvin Bragg in Manhattan,
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:26.240]  or whether they are by Soros, Stoog, Fannie Wills, the prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia,
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:32.800]  or whether they are by special counsel Jack Smith. He has called them out as partisan witch hunts.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.280]  You know that drives his lawyers crazy. You know his lawyers are saying, don't do that.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:45.440]  But he has galvanized the public. He's also taken on DeSantis. And then DeSantis loses his discipline
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.920]  and comes out in the worst possible way. He says, I'm not getting involved in this effort to take
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.600]  down Trump by Alvin Bragg. I'm not getting involved. But he then recycles the fake charges.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:05.200]  Oh, I don't know anything about hush money payments to a porn star, recycling the narrative
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:12.400]  of the left, infuriating Trump's supporters. Then he doubles down with Piers Morgan,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.320]  makes it even worse. He attacks Trump's moral character. Are you kidding me,
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.600]  Governor? You didn't care about his moral character when he raised you out of obscurity
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.600]  and catapulted you to the governorship. You had no problems with his moral character then.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:38.880]  It was a giant misreading and a tactical blunder. And this comes on the heels, Alex, of DeSantis
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.720]  trying to reinvent his position on the war in Ukraine to sound more like Trump. So he tries to
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.400]  say, well, Russia's not our biggest problem. And I'm against the blank check given to them by the
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.400]  Biden administration. And then when his globalist multimillionaire and billionaire donors go out of
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.400]  their minds, he flops back and says, well, you know, Putin's a war criminal, which is just
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:10.000]  rhetoric designed to assuage the anger of his globalist donors. So he screws up his position
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.560]  on the war and he gets the deep enmity of Trump country. Here's what the governor doesn't
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:24.160]  understand. His base is a microcosm of the Trump base, but the Trump base is broader, deeper,
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:30.960]  and far more intense. People like Ron DeSantis here in Florida, but they love Donald Trump.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.880]  And new polls showing Trump leading DeSantis by two points in Florida. That's not bad. That's
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.640]  good. What about the national polls of 28 points? And the New York Times is even reporting it. The
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:49.520]  Hill is reporting it. He has zoomed ahead of DeSantis. He is the nominee apparent at this
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.720]  point. If I were Governor DeSantis, I would completely rethink my plan and not run.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.520]  Well, let me raise that. Even the New York Post says today, and I'll show it in a moment,
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.480]  it's in this big stack, I'm going to dig it out, that his top donors are telling DeSantis hanging
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.560]  up and wait until another election. Yeah, I've seen that. And of course,
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:16.880]  Karl Rove makes a giant blunder talking about the DeSantis campaign on Fox and calls it our
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.840]  campaign. I think that tells us everything we want to know.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.680]  All right, so let me move on here because I don't want to, and I get it's important about
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.000]  DeSantis, but I don't want to obsess over him. What about Alvin Bragg? Are they still going to
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.520]  try to indict him? Is Trump right, saying Bragg is going to drop it?
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.600]  I don't think we know. You have to assume that George Soros' minions are on the phone
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.520]  putting the heat on Bragg even as we speak. Soros paid for Bragg's election. Bragg would like to
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:49.440]  have a political future. I learned the hard way in the DC courtroom facts, truth, the law,
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:55.200]  those things don't really matter. I think Bragg's case blew apart last week with the testimony of
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.880]  Robert Costello to the grand jury. We only know about this because Costello has the right to talk
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:08.560]  about his testimony. He introduced evidence and documents proving that Alvin Bragg's principal
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:16.080]  witness, Michael Cohn, is a noted liar. Cohn lied about me. Cohn said before Congress under oath
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.680]  that he overheard a conversation between me and candidate Trump in 2016 in which I told him the
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.840]  WikiLeaks disclosures were coming. There's no telephone record to prove this. The secretary
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.720]  who he said came into the room to say that I was on the phone has no memory of it whatsoever.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:37.440]  Roger, just stop right there. Let me back you up. You were a consultant, weren't officially
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.800]  hired here then. I was on your ass every two days saying I'd hire you and give you a job if you got
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.520]  WikiLeaks on. Did you know? You said no. I know Randy Credico. He knows him. He says it's going
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:55.680]  to be big. The WikiLeaks, Assange was on TV going on Hannity saying that. I know you didn't have it
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.360]  because you've always been honest with me. You're a very honest person despite what the media says.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.560]  You didn't have it. You never got it. I was very frustrated with you.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.240]  But Michael Cohn said this conversation happened before the Democratic convention in 2016. Then he
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.960]  changed his story and said it happened before the Republican convention. Alex, I can tell you exactly
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:20.400]  when it happened. Never. Michael Cohen is a liar. They didn't call him as a witness in my trial
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.600]  because they know he would have been destroyed on the stand if Alvin Bragg moves ahead, relying
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.360]  solely on the testimony of Michael Cohen, particularly given the statement yesterday
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:37.200]  by released by Trump from Stormy Damals, in which even she and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.960]  say he's unreliable as a witness. This didn't happen. Bragg's case has been destroyed.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.000]  Will he bring it anywhere? Anyway, it's Manhattan. Can you imagine what this jury will look like?
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.360]  Well, that's the next question. What about Georgia? What about the D.C. cases?
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.080]  Well, here's the point, I guess. If Trump were elected president, he would have the authority
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.200]  to pardon himself. He cannot pardon himself from a state conviction. So he needs to avoid being
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.640]  charged in New York or Georgia. And if they ultimately want to charge him federally,
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:14.240]  I don't see how they get that to trial before the 2024 election. Therefore, he could run for
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:21.440]  president while under indictment, wear it as a badge of honor in the sense that it's evidence
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.800]  that he's being persecuted for political reasons. And then upon his election, even before he goes
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:33.120]  to trial, he could pardon himself. How do you like that? Well, let's talk about this when we
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.400]  come back. You know the deep state. You've studied them. What are they going to pull now? Because
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.640]  they sure as hell don't give up. And wow, Trump right back in the driver's seat, more than a year
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.840]  and a half out from the next election. What a circus. This is going to be the most spectacular
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:54.000]  and most dangerous election ever. How do we keep it peaceful? Roger Stones, our guest, stay with us.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.360]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.040]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:16.480]  at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.440]  been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:28.080]  work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.400]  myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.080]  to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.160]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.120]  never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.360]  while at the same time keeping us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.880]  buy products at InfowarsStore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:01.600]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now. There is a war for the future happening
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:07.120]  right now. There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.720]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment. That's why
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.160]  I ask listeners respectively to go to InfowarsStore.com and buy great products that will enrich
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:25.920]  and empower your life, while keeping us on air at the very same time. InfowarsStore.com, to get a

[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.240]  best products. And a lot of you have never shopped at InfowarsStore. You've been watching for years,
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.480]  you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfowarsStore.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.120]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air. So again,

[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:06.480]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.680]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:19.920]  2024 shirt. I am not seriously planning to run for president. This is an idea the crew had,
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:23.200]  have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex Jones was right.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.600]  There's Infowars.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.200]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It's made out of really nice fabric. It's high quality,
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.560]  and it is a exclusive shirt to InfowarsStore.com. And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:44.080]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts, and we'll have a historic memento,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.160]  be able to spread the word and meet a lot of like-minded people, and you'll be able to keep
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.760]  us on the air. No way. No way. That's a bridge too far. That's no, it can't be.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.720]  And I said on national television that he was going to win. At InfowarsStore.com.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:11.360]  developed. Dr. Jones Naturals tumor toothpaste that just came into stock. And I got to tell you,

[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:31.760]  essential oils. It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.

[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.800]  All right, Alex Jones here back live on Sunday night. Your phone calls for all you holding.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:24.160]  Killer and Ignacio and Julio and Candace and Lewis and Kim and Bart and Mark and Gary and Gold.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.080]  Every one of you will get on air. We love you and appreciate you holding. But I had to get Roger on
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.160]  last minute because I just thought I should try to get Roger on. Can he do it? He was able to do it.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.720]  Roger, in the nine minutes we have left in this segment,
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:43.760]  I want to support Trump and he is better because he's anti-war and his pedigree is not. I love
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.360]  George Herbert Walker Bush because I couldn't prove he was his skull and bones, but he says
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.320]  his idol is George Herbert Walker Bush and Yale. So to me, that has some major problems. I want
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:58.000]  to believe in DeSantis and to me, it's not a beauty pageant here, but it really gets down to issues.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.600]  So much of the system likes DeSantis versus hating Trump. Why does the system hate Trump?
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.360]  And what are you knowing him for 45 years, being his very close confidant, believe he'll do when
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:13.920]  he gets back in? He says, I'll destroy the deep state. I'll bring down the new world order. Just
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.160]  that rhetoric alone really makes me concerned for his safety. And let's be honest, that's a lot of
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.440]  questions. But last question, what will the system do if they already went so crazy to stop him before
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.520]  and failed? What are they going to do now? That's my biggest concern is that they are going to go
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:37.520]  crazy. Well, I think they've already done it in the sense that they have weaponized our federal
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:43.360]  judicial system in an attempt to try to charge him in connection to either January 6 or his
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:49.120]  handling of classified documents prior to the election. The point, I guess, is that Donald
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:55.680]  Trump came to Washington in 2017 and did not come from the world of politics. And therefore,
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.320]  it may have been somewhat naive. He had all the right instincts, but he believed there were two
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.840]  groups, two teams, the Republicans and the Democrats. He never realized that, unlike with
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:12.480]  Ronald Reagan, Republicans would not really close ranks around him and that many Republicans were
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:20.240]  dedicated to his destruction. For example, acting Attorney General Ron Rosenstein was a Republican.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:26.160]  Rosenstein, on the recommendation of the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, appointed
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:30.160]  Robert Mueller as a special counsel. And then look at look at what Sessions did.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.680]  Sessions was every bit as bad by recusing himself. My point, of course, is that Trump is a man who's
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:45.040]  learned a hard lesson. I think a second Trump presidency will be rhino free. You already see
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:52.880]  it in his campaign. Jared Kushner is not around. His daughter is not around. But Donald Trump Jr.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:00.160]  and Eric, both hardcore patriots, hardcore American first, hardcore conservatives. They're
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:06.000]  front and center in his. And notice he didn't even want Abbott or Cruz in his rally yesterday.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.880]  That's positive. I'm having a little trouble with your audio here. Sorry, Roger. I was saying he
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:19.680]  didn't want Abbott or Cruz at the rally either yesterday. That's a good sign. Well, I mean,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.880]  of course, my real question is, where was your governor? Where was your U.S. senator?
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.520]  I don't know if Ted Cruz is holding back thinking that he's a potential candidate,
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.400]  but that's not going to happen. Donald Trump is not going to withdraw from this race under any
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:41.040]  circumstances. He will run whether he is charged in these completely politically motivated
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:48.560]  investigations or not. And I think that he will triumph. But, you know, in all honesty,
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:54.240]  Governor DeSantis has to expect that there's going to be a deconstruction of his record,
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.960]  because many of the things that you believe, because he has said them, are not necessarily
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:06.240]  true. On the question of the vaccinations, his position is identical to that of Donald Trump.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:13.040]  I met a man on Sunday, last Sunday, whose son died after taking the COVID-19 vaccination.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:19.680]  And he told me that he decided to let his son take the vaccination because he saw Governor
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.200]  DeSantis on TV saying it was safe, it was effective, and it would protect his son
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.000]  from infection, which, of course, it didn't. This idea, I would have followed, I would have
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.720]  fired Fauci, he tells Piers Morgan. Why don't you fire David Kerner, the Vax Nazi that you just
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:42.960]  appointed to your cabinet two weeks ago? I mean, why didn't you fire your own advisors? This idea
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:49.680]  that he signed a ban. No, he signed a law giving immunity to anybody who pushed the vaccination
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.920]  and said it was safe and effective. OK, Roger, listen, I don't mind going there if you want to
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.720]  open this up. But Trump's been just as bad as DeSantis, and I'm mad at Trump about it.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:06.000]  But in the larger picture, I get what you're saying. But regardless, we both are. I agree
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.080]  with you, Alex. I don't like his position on the vaccination either. But don't try to tell me
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.960]  Governor DeSantis' position is different. He's trying to make it sound different. But what about
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.680]  taking nine million dollars from Florida power and light and then getting the greatest single
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.840]  rate increase for electricity that this state has ever had? No, I understand that you want
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.760]  to destroy DeSantis to make way for Trump. You think he's better. I respect that. OK, what I'm
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.240]  saying is I believe DeSantis is already eclipsed. He was already in the rearview mirror. I'm now
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:37.760]  more worried about the deep state and how they come after Trump. Look, they're going to do that
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:46.160]  anyway, which is why I think the single greatest mistake he or we can do is any intimation of
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.760]  violence or lawlessness. No, we're not for an insurrection. No, we're not for an uprising.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:57.040]  No. So you agree with me flipping out this week with the baseball bat and the death and
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.680]  destruction thing. And I'm glad Trump removed that. Right. He does it. He doesn't need that. Right.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:08.720]  Entirely counterproductive. And I think this is absolutely key. Let us not step into the same
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.040]  trap that some patriots stepped into on January 6th. Why was the Secret Service calling my hotel
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.880]  room and telling me that they had been instructed to escort me to the Capitol? This was a trap that
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:27.600]  I thank God avoided. I know nothing about the illegal events of January 6th. You did go and
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.800]  I saw the video. You jumped up on a chair and said, no, pull back. Do not breach the Capitol.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:39.360]  I saw it. But it was a setup and we cannot fall for that setup again. So those who decide
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.560]  anywhere along in this process, if the president is indicted in New York or if he is indicted
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.960]  in Georgia or if he is indicted in federally and you want to go to a public protest,
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:58.000]  keep it peaceful, keep it civil, keep it orderly, keep it legal because it's a trap.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.400]  They want the only way they can stop this forward momentum of the America first movement is by
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:12.000]  incorrectly accusing us of trying to foment insurrection or violence. They are, in fact,
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.200]  the violent ones. We know this from history. They burned down half the country, but we have a two
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:24.160]  tier justice system. So BLM and Antifa are not held responsible. But if you make any intimation
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:30.320]  that can be read, even if it's unfair as advocating violence, it is counterproductive,
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:37.920]  absolutely counterproductive. The America first movement is on a roll, folks. Don't take the bait.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.840]  And remember, not everybody wearing an America first or a make America great red cap is really
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:50.720]  a friend. Do not be goaded into stupid, senseless acts of violence. That is what they want. That's
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:58.080]  the only thing that can derail Donald Trump at this point. All right. StoneZone.com, Roger Stone,
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.840]  please join us again coming up in the week. We got 30 seconds left. Any other tidbits?
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:08.240]  Look, I think this is this is a watershed moment and we're going to know early next week what
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.960]  Alvin Bragg does. I don't think it is. I don't think we know. I think it is a question that is
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:19.280]  up in the air. But Trump has been absolutely right to get out there on offense. It is combative,
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:25.600]  pugilistic style. Take on the prosecutors, whether federal or state, in terms of questioning their
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:31.440]  motives, asserting his influence and taking the wood to Governor DeSantis, who is now definitely
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.960]  on the descent based on all of the polling. Trump was right. I would call it and I would
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.640]  call it a nosedive. I would call it that, too. All right, Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.240]  Thanks, Alex. God bless you. All right, folks. Massive information, phone calls
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.520]  coming up on the other side. Stay with us. It's Sunday night in full wars dot com.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.360]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.360]  and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.840]  drug addicts and criminals. And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.840]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.720]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again,
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.880]  I know I have influence to thank for that. Looking back on the day, I was able to ask
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.680]  President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.320]  classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team. And I really do credit that
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:40.000]  as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips, because Alex's whole mentality was,
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.120]  you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:49.520]  I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:54.320]  people. And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.160]  career.
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:31.680]  to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there

[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:33.040]  government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.360]  studios. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.040]  All right. I'm going to rampage through your calls now. So be ready. Make your point. I'm
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.240]  going to hang up on you cause I respect you. I want to get to the next person.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.760]  Let's go ahead and go to owl killer in Virginia. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:01.600]  So Alex, um, we won the, we've already won. Um, I noticed that when Tucker had, um,
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.960]  when Tucker mentioned, uh, Julian Huxley and UNESCO the other day and that Robert F. Kennedy,
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.840]  uh, junior, uh, Jimmy door, um, interview where he's going through event two Oh one
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.920]  and George gal running that, um, the tabletop exercise and how they were even, they were even
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.960]  war gaming, how to do, um, misinformation, what to say. If somebody calls it a lab leak,
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:31.200]  they're done. Trump state discipline. This, I totally agree. I meant to get to those clips Friday,
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.840]  but I had general Flynn on for an hour and a half. I didn't what everything we're saying
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.080]  that Patriots were saying 40 years ago. That's all true. That nobody like 1%
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:46.640]  new now it's mainstream. That is devastating. You hear how many people looked up UNESCO after
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.040]  Tucker brought that up. People have no idea what it is. They're done. They don't know.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.880]  It's the private corporate world government model for deep population. Exactly. And now they're,
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.800]  now they're out in the open. It's clear. They needed that they needed COVID and they need
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.280]  world war three to write over their banking system. I'm going to have to write over the
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:08.480]  banking collapse. They're looking for an excuse. I want to echo Carlos real quick.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:15.040]  We need somebody with a plan. We need a idea with a new currency. Trump needs to get some ideas
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.200]  going forward. We need our currency backed by gold. That's right. Cause the old systems coming
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:25.200]  to an end. We've got to not just fight the old system. We've got to fight for the new system,
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:31.200]  not the new system. They push. Yes. And he needs to have people ready to go. He needs to be,
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.880]  he needs to be talking to general Flynn. He needs to be talking to people. He needs to
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.760]  be talking to Robert F. Kennedy jr. Could you imagine if that's his running mate? Well,
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.240]  he almost put him in the cabinet before he needs exactly. God bless you. Incredible points.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.080]  Let's talk to Ignacio and Colorado here on the air. Hey Alex, happy Sunday.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.200]  God bless you.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:55.440]  Shout out to your father. Great to space. Big fan, big fan. Thank you. I'm loving it so far.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:02.080]  Hey, so my perspective and you know, I understand that you've been angry towards Trump on the,
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.360]  on the vaccine side of things, right? But we also got to understand and see it from the lens
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.080]  of the 2020 elections in which he might've gained, you know, and I'm estimating,
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.160]  I don't truly know the right numbers, but he might've gained the good, you know, five to
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.680]  seven million votes just by being in charge of that program, which I hate, by the way,
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:30.560]  I'm unvaccinated. My dad is, my mom is not. So my world kind of split. But the point is that he gained
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:37.760]  a certain amount of votes by owning that. And they were going to use it against them regardless,
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.160]  whether he went with it or he went without it, they were going to attack him, attack him, attack
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:48.320]  him and use that against them. So I would say, you know, we got to put that in the rear view mirror
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:56.800]  and focus on the Santas because his deep state is another George Bush. And if we put the Santas out
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.960]  of the fight, it's all over for them. And that's when things are going to get very scary. I think
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:10.000]  Trump, I hate to say it, but he needs to amp up security or whatever it takes, but like we need
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:17.760]  to keep the man safe. He totally is devastated in the deep state with all the talk he's doing
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:23.840]  lately and all the points he's making. So Trump is a guy, the Santas is fake. Otherwise he would
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.040]  have sent more than 50 migrants. He will be sending bus loads every day. All he did was a
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:36.640]  photo shoot just to collect MAGA points, but the guy's not really MAGA. All right. Interesting
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.720]  points, Ignacio. Thank you, sir. Another caller from Colorado, Julio, you're on the air.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.760]  Boy, Alejandro, I must say, I picked a good decision moving from the Midwest to the Rocky
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.120]  Mountain West. A lot of freedom fighters out here, including Ignacio. Nice to hear. If I'm putting my
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.400]  Tim Russert hat on, so I'm coming from the journalism side, don't love Trump, could care
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:05.200]  less about the politics. But as all your callers have mentioned, he goes nowhere without a strong
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.640]  cabinet, a strong base of people where they don't stab him in the back. He's not taking
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:18.480]  advice from a rights previous or Sean Hannity or all these types of bozos, right? It's quite clear
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:26.560]  listening from the callers that Trump is going to need a strong VP candidate, a strong everything.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:33.200]  And moving forward, he's got to be on the offense talking about the deep state, shining a light on
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.480]  these types of people. Stop messing around during your campaign speeches if you really want to
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:43.520]  galvanize the rest of the public. Because I tell you what, I see it in my small town in northern
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.680]  Colorado. I see it in Denver. I see it back in the Midwest. People are waking up, and it's only going
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:57.360]  to get crazier before November 24 comes around. And I'm talking about bank collapse. I'm talking
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:01.680]  about weather wars. I'm talking about trade derailments, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.600]  Alex. I agree with you. And I like the super hardcore rhetoric we're getting from Trump right
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:14.640]  now. No, absolutely. Look, who's talked about this in the last, say, three decades of American
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.880]  politics other than Ron Paul, other than people who were considered super fringe now that it's
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:25.760]  on Saturday Night Live when Woody Harrelson's talking about the real drug pushers of this
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:30.720]  country to even Bill Maher. People are hungry for more, as you said-
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.600]  Exactly. We the people have moved the needle towards reality, and Trump's just riding in
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.080]  on a surfboard. But if he does it, great, because nobody else wants to surf that populous wave.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.240]  Great points, Julia. I'm going to hear from you. Candice, thanks for holding from Tennessee. You're
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:51.600]  on the air. Hey, Alex. Hey, when we climb through the window, we're not getting sacrificed in Trump's
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:59.760]  Ashley Babbitt pageant. Trump has to win because he has sacrificed Ashley Babbitt. Now he has to
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:07.680]  make a memorial for her at the Capitol. And he has been involved in genocide. He has been involved
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.200]  in crimes against humanity, which are sociological and biological experiments. We need to hold his
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.280]  attention and hold him hostage to reprogram him because he took the Pfizer shot. He took the
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.880]  Pfizer money. We did it. We need to use him as a game piece because Trump's had pageants.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:30.480]  He's been at the WWF wrestling. He's had game boards, casinos, reality shows on NBC, golf
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:36.480]  courses. So he's the perfect pinata. No, I agree with you. We've got to dominate Trump
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.360]  and make him be what we want instead of other special interests. And what you said is so
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.720]  important. Whatever politician this is, the people are the dog. They're the tail. We don't want the
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:54.720]  tail wagging the dog, Candace. They're there to protect our rights. And that is it. And Ashley
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.680]  Babbitt was sacrificed on January 6th. That was 666. And that was in front of all of her big
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.240]  brother people that she loved. All the police just watching her get hoisted up through the window and
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:12.000]  shot them watching her die. All right. I hear your call. I appreciate your call. Kim in Long
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.480]  Island, New York here on the air. Alex, pleasure. I'm like almost flabbergasted. I'm speaking with
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:24.480]  you. I am so, so, so blessed to have you in my life during this time. I can't believe people
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:30.000]  are not supporting you enough. Everybody should be buying every day, every day, even a product,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.080]  even every week or once a month. But needless to say, I digress. I really, really don't see anybody
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:42.400]  talking about Trump's foreign policy. He was a master. He is a master. We know that it's going
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.120]  to be a Reaganist moment when he gets inaugurated. It's just like that. It would be just like that
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:53.360]  when Reagan got inaugurated, what happened? Iran released everybody. This is how it would be. We
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:00.000]  would be imposing threats. We'd be posturing. So my ultimate question is what happens if they
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.160]  steal this? What happens if they steal this? What are we going to do? Because for all of
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:13.440]  the medicinal purposes, this man should be the one that saves us because DeSantis has no foreign
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:19.040]  policy, has nothing. I don't want someone to prove to me what he can do. I want a proven master.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.040]  Well, it looks like we're going to have Trump as the nominee. We're a year and a half out, but
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.120]  imagine what the deep state's going to do though, Kim. They're going to go crazy.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:34.960]  Yeah. I mean, you know what's so wild, Alex, is that when he walked out the door,
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:41.440]  I think he started seeing everything that he didn't. His ego, I'm sorry, the it is powerful.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:46.880]  And I think his ego couldn't let him know that it was so fantastical. I think he saw all this-
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:50.960]  No, you're right. He's definitely gotten an education. Thank you, Kim. All right,
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.480]  Bart and many others, your calls are straight ahead on the other side of this quick break.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.320]  And then Owen Schroyer takes over for Sunday Night Live, 6 to 8 PM Central.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.600]  The fight against the new world order is now the top story in the world. The globalists are in deep
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:08.960]  trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down Infowars and
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.320]  other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others. So please pray for
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.640]  us now more than ever. Spread the word about the broadcast and get great products to keep us on
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.960]  air and fund our operation while at the same time enriching your life. Now we've got three new
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.080]  products available at InfowarsStore.com and a bestseller back in stock. We have the amazing
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:33.200]  Dr. Jones Naturals turmeric toothpaste. That's so much more. Find out more at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.480]  These are all the highest quality products. The prebiotic is now finally back in stock.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.040]  They're all there at InfowarsStore.com. So please take action now, enrich your life,
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:56.400]  empower your body and keep us on air. Please take action now. InfowarsStore.com.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.720]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.560]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:15.840]  Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:20.880]  been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:27.440]  work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible. So for
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.840]  myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.520]  to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.600]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.560]  never go to InfowarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.960]  while at the same time keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.320]  products at InfowarsStore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.720]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:07.600]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life. And Infowars for decades has been at the very forefront
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:12.320]  of the fight for a pro-human future. We can't stay on air without your help. And I want to
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.840]  thank you all for your past support. And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.440]  products at InfowarsStore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:27.200]  Ultimate Bone Broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock. Real Red Pill Plus,
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:32.880]  simply amazing. Nitric Boost, what it does for your heart. Cardiovascular, critical. All these
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.440]  products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.720]  and in stock, ready to ship to you right now at InfowarsStore.com. And the final 1200 signed
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.080]  copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not going to sign any more
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.320]  after that, are exclusively available at InfowarsStore.com as well. In the last month,
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.920]  I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books. We didn't have them for sale. But now I signed
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:46:03.040]  the last books. You can get them right now. It's hard to believe that we're already going
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:09.120]  into March 2023, and the world is an insane place. World War III has already started.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.440]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders. There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe's been
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:17.040]  removed from Project Veritas. The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.080]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening. But those
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.400]  of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.240]  counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.080]  and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.760]  Whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the Great Reset and the War for
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.600]  the World, or Ultimate Bone Broth finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.480]  at InfowarsStore.com. These are truly amazing products. So get your Infowars products at
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.200]  InfowarsStore.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air. It is your
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.360]  decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfowarsStore.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:06.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.880]  All right, last segment. I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central, the regular Alex Jones show.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.720]  Please spread the word. That's how we reach new people, and I thank you. We got loaded phone
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.920]  lines. I'm going to get to every person I can, so I'm going to give each caller about a minute.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.320]  Bart in Georgia. You're on the air, Bart. Go ahead.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.640]  Yes, sir. This possible indictment of Trump, I think, is really a disguise for an assassination
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.440]  attempt because Trump's Secret Service is substantially less than any sitting president,
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.840]  and they're going to try to kill him. He shouldn't go. He should just barricade himself
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:51.440]  inside of Mar-a-Lago and then call for his protesters to block the feds from coming in.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:57.440]  Well, he said he's ready to be assassinated, but definitely I think what he's doing,
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:00.560]  the power structure's going to come after him. It doesn't mean he's perfect,
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:06.720]  but they see him as a threat to their power. Yeah, and I think his threats of protest
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:12.720]  was what made them back down because what they're afraid of is another January 6th.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.000]  That's why they're trying to set everybody up because they're so afraid.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.680]  No, I agree. They're afraid of a real January 6th. People weren't trying to take over then.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.160]  And if we wanted to, we could. Absolutely. Appreciate your call,
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.800]  Bart. Thanks for holding to say that. Mark in Brooklyn, go ahead.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.920]  Yeah, Alex. How you doing, my brother? Good, brother.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:37.280]  Love you, man. Love you. You're the best. Listen, I think Trump is, he's using his psych social on
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.360]  these people. You know what I'm saying? When he's threatening them, trying to put them out there,
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.240]  trying to make them do things to show the American people what they're really like,
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:51.760]  to put them out there. You know what I mean? And I wanted to ask the question,
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:49:00.720]  who can we, how can we establish and put together a rally or a march to get these people arrested,
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.080]  to start arresting these people already? How can we start doing this?
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.360]  Well, I mean, he's having rallies everywhere calling for their arrest. I think it's happening,
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:11.040]  brother. I don't think one rally is going to do it. But I mean, that's why this rhetoric is so
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.800]  powerful. He's saying these are criminals. They've hijacked your country. They want to destroy you.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.880]  And we've got to arrest him. I think he's doing it. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. Other than that,
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.480]  I mean, I'm going to start trying to do it here in Brooklyn. I'm trying already,
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:31.200]  trying to get people to come together and to go down to the legislation office in downtown Brooklyn
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:36.000]  and start doing the same thing. Well, that's your first amendment, right? And just don't
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.440]  get provocateur. And I'm sure you won't. God bless you, Mark. Thanks for holding,
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:42.480]  getting to everybody. Hate to cut people off. These are great calls, but thanks everybody.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.960]  Gary in New York. Another call from New York. You're on the air.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.400]  Hey, thank you, Alex. A long time listener, first time caller, and thank you very much
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.120]  for your story. I was on the fence for a very long time, but I've gotten a couple of your products
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:00.320]  and no complaints. Thank you. Anybody else that is on the fence, if you're afraid to buy something
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:04.960]  online, look up virtual credit cards. They protect your account. They've stopped a lot.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.080]  On to Trump real quick. I'm worried that they're going to use some kind of event
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:19.040]  to start up something similar to January 6th. And anybody that's at an event that
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.720]  may have somebody trying to do something wrong, we've got to stop it. We got to put a stop to it.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:31.120]  We can't do another January 6th where you have a few people breaking windows and opening doors
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:38.960]  and then allowing people in. As far as Trump, I'm worried now, I think you reported, correct me if
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:45.760]  I'm wrong, the CIA being concerned about a civil war in the country. Yes. What if they use Trump,
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:53.680]  not him being involved, but what if they trigger something to spark that? They could do anything.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.200]  We're in a war with them. They can do stuff. We can do stuff, but I absolutely hear what you're
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.120]  saying. And that's why we've got to have good people everywhere documenting what's happening.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.560]  I didn't get to it tonight. I will tomorrow. New police footage of the Metro Police, not the
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:11.760]  Capitol Police helping storm the Capitol. Such a giant development. We'll be covering it tomorrow
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.160]  at 11 a.m. Central. Thank you, Gary. Gold in Arizona. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:24.000]  Yeah. My point about Trump is he talks about fighting the deep state and he's going to end
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.040]  them. But really, he needs to end the Federal Reserve because the only meaningful and substantive
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:37.600]  regime on earth is the bankers. And the only regime change that matters is changing the bankers
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:42.640]  and putting, repealing the amendment that gave them the right to coin our money and putting it
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:48.080]  back into the hands of the people. You're talking about what happened in 1913 and you're dead on and
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.240]  Trump is starting to criticize the private Federal Reserve. You're absolutely right. Let's go to the
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:57.360]  top of the pyramid. Who's really running it? All right. God bless. Thank you for calling. Thanks
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:01.680]  for holding. Incredible point. These are all incredible callers. Lewis in Wyoming. Go ahead.
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:08.480]  Hey, Alex. How goes it? Good. Love, brother. Yes, I just want to say I'm worried about this becoming
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:14.720]  a cult of personality. Donald Trump is talking about promoting freedom cities. If you actually
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:19.920]  look at what he's promoting, it's the exact same thing that WF is promoting as the 15 minute cities.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:26.160]  I'm a little bit worried about this. I mean, this is the same guy that was under the lockdown. He's
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:32.080]  the same guy still touting his vaccine as he saves millions of lives. I don't believe him as
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:37.360]  far as I can throw him. Well, most of what you say is legitimate. The first part, his new freedom
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:42.560]  cities are brand new cities. The left doesn't want any new cities. They want control our old
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:45.840]  cities. But so I think you're wrong on the first point. I think you're right about the other points.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.120]  I just want to say, let's be careful here. Let's not become a cult of personality. Let's not just
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:57.600]  say Trump is our savior because he's not. Jesus Christ is our savior. 1776 is our savior.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:02.400]  God bless you, brother. I hear your point. Michael in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:10.080]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call. Welcome. All right. My point is I think it's a big rope
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:16.400]  of dope. I think they pretty much calculate that he's a shoe in for the nomination.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:23.520]  And I honestly think they just called Bill Clinton and Clinton said, well, all you got to do is just
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:30.880]  get a third party candidate like Ross Perot and split the vote and Biden's back in. And that's
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:38.320]  pretty much it. So, I mean, I agree with you that they're going to try a populist third party
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.800]  candidate to split the vote. Who would that candidate be? I don't even think it has to be
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:49.680]  populist. I just think the establishment Republicans, Jeb Bush, they dig him up from
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:54:00.560]  the bayou or whatever. So how do we counter that, Michael? Well, Trump's not a team player.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:09.440]  He's an enforcer. But somehow he's got to get somebody that's semi-establishment Republican
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:15.600]  to be on his ticket. Whether that's a Ted Cruz or somebody, but he's got to have somebody that's
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:22.960]  going to be a, I hate to say this, but a legitimate Republican. That's my only thought.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:26.720]  No, you're right. The Republican party will run a third party candidate against him.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.240]  And I'll be talking about that all week. You're totally right. That's their ace in the hole.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:33.280]  That's why I love taking calls. Didn't even think of that. Boom, it's Hide and Play with you.
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:36.720]  Thank you, Michael. All right. Will in Southern California, you're on the air.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:44.400]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I think it's such a huge issue. And there's so many
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.440]  potential voters that are on the left that aren't happy with what's going on right now.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.960]  And if he would just announce his genomic experiment, I just lost my sister late last year.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:03.600]  And I always say he's not my savior. He was my coach. And also want to know what you think about
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:12.000]  the Uniparty. Is RFK Jr. a viable alternative? I like RFK, but he's still too liberal on guns
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.400]  and things. But I think he's a good man. You know, maybe Trump should run with RFK. Wow,
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.800]  that would get a bunch of Democrat votes, wouldn't it? That would be the best of both worlds.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.880]  I was thinking of that earlier. What if Trump shows RFK as running mate?
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:31.040]  I mean, they assassinated his father when he was winning the primaries. It's just like,
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.080]  they stole an election from Trump. They killed RFK Jr.'s father. Thanks for the call. I could
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:39.440]  talk to all these callers an hour. They're all amazing, but we're getting to them all here.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.440]  Al in Michigan. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.880]  Hey, good to talk to you. What about a Jones Trump ticket?
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.720]  We're selling an Alex Jones for president t-shirt for fun to fund the operation. But no,
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:57.120]  I'm not going to be running for president with Trump.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.120]  Hey, but I would vote for you over Trump. I mean, you would be the best candidate to
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:11.680]  sharpen him in the Republican, the whole primary. You're going to bring up the issues that need to
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:17.280]  be talked about. And you know, Washington didn't want to be president, but when the time came,
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.400]  he stood up and did what the country needed. Well, that's definitely not my plan. I appreciate
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.480]  your call. Look, I'm sorry to Rosie. Says why Trump keeps talking about the Santas
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.400]  and Mark in Florida, Trump and the Bible. Guys, don't let me forget tomorrow.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:36.480]  Owen is going to take the calls. Do not hang up Rosie. Do not hang up Mark. And Al,
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:46.320]  don't hang up. You got more to say. Owen wants to talk to you. 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.640]  Owen Schroeder for two hours taking your phone calls. We'll let it break for two minutes.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.800]  He'll be in the seat live tonight, taking your calls. Please. The problem is we order such a
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.760]  small number of the Alex Jones for president shirts that I can't really plug those because
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:04.720]  they haven't ordered more. They'll be sold out in like a day. Seriously. But the tumor toothpaste
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:10.000]  is great. The CBD oil is amazing. The ultimate bone broth is back in stock. It's all there.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:16.720]  Thank you all for getting the products. Thank you for funding. Let's make a straight donation.

[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:28.880]  you. And we're winning. All right. Great job with the crew. Your phone calls, Al, Rosie, Mark,
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:36.080]  and others are coming up with a great Owen Schroyer with Sunday Live. There's only six
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.320]  minutes and ads an hour. We only do local ads for local stations. Very soon I'm going to do my
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.880]  regular show. We're about to cut a lot of ads out of the show. So get ready for that. All right.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:47.120]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroyer.
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:19.280]  And a bestseller back in stock. We have the amazing Dr. Jones Naturals

[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:46.480]  Please take action now. Infowars4.com.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:54.720]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.560]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:03.360]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:10.400]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:15.760]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:21.040]  incredible. So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:26.880]  encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:31.040]  spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:36.000]  listeners never go to Infowars4.com. And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.560]  life while at the same time keeping us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:46.240]  go buy products at Infowars4.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowars4.com,
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.520]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:57.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
