[00:34.440 --> 00:42.600]  pretty much every day now the amount of off-the-chart incredible news that we have to cover is
[00:42.600 --> 00:51.720]  simply mind-blowing thank you so much for joining us on this 13th day the Wednesday edition
[00:51.720 --> 00:59.080]  of the worldwide broadcast again it is November 13th 2013 we're going to be here for the next
[00:59.080 --> 01:05.040]  three hours I wasn't going to have any guests today but there's been so much breaking news
[01:05.040 --> 01:09.480]  since yesterday when I made the decision to not have any guests that we're going to have
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.240]  several guests on today Eric Muller known as ManCal Muller syndicated radio host he
[01:15.240 --> 01:22.200]  has a hit TV show God guns and automobiles with his brother he was offered nine plus
[01:22.200 --> 01:30.560]  million dollars to join the Obama team basically and to go be hired by another broadcasting
[01:30.560 --> 01:37.600]  outfit and sell out and a lot of other people I know this is happening to and the Pentagon
[01:37.600 --> 01:45.240]  announced it was going to start these operations through other corporate conduits back in July
[01:45.240 --> 01:48.840]  government promises to stop line because of drugs report spotlight was the article but
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.120]  in it they actually meant they're going to engage the alternative real media that isn't
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.760]  selling out it's also in the news that WebMD and other sites are paid millions of dollars
[01:58.760 --> 02:06.440]  a month to promote the Obamacare lie that it's affordable and wonderful even corporate mainstream
[02:06.440 --> 02:11.760]  media has to admit it's easier to get into Harvard than it is to sign up for Obamacare
[02:11.760 --> 02:18.520]  mathematically easier to get accepted to Harvard than it is to sign up for Obamacare because
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.720]  folks it's not meant to be signed up to we told you that beforehand the bill says you
[02:23.720 --> 02:27.880]  don't get the health care you get your prices doubled and you get your quality cut it was
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.240]  written by offshore mega banks to absolutely eviscerate everyone what do you think we just
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.080]  got up here and said it was going to screw you and made it up we showed you the subsections
[02:37.080 --> 02:44.320]  the greatest screw job in history the greatest screw job because the betrayal is so over
[02:44.320 --> 02:50.920]  the top I mean when Nazi stukas were bombing Poland you knew it was a black airplane dive
[02:50.920 --> 02:57.000]  bombing out of the sky dropping a 500 pound bomb on you but I'm telling you if you painted
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.600]  a smiley face on the bomb today the average trendy would go out and lay on the ground
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.840]  and beg the stuka to bomb them if you said the stuka bomber is coming and it's going
[03:06.840 --> 03:13.840]  to give you something free the average trendy even if they saw cities burning and buildings
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.560]  burning would go out and lay on the grass waving torches at night saying please give
[03:18.560 --> 03:23.480]  me the free deal and if they saw bomb dropped 100 yards away killing people they would run
[03:23.480 --> 03:29.560]  towards the bomb if it was trendy and if the bomb was black that's another thing it's
[03:29.560 --> 03:36.080]  important to see that's that's your racist if you don't run out and the Nazi black bomber
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.920]  flies up and it drops a bomb and you I mean that's my analogy you just run up and grab
[03:39.920 --> 03:45.000]  it because it's the trendy thing to do I'm being a little bit sarcastic now but I mean
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  what do you do at this level of insanity here's what's coming up we've got the latest death

[04:13.680 --> 04:20.320]  Cuba is really good and the People's Republic of China will basically join and then have
[04:20.320 --> 04:28.480]  enough votes to run the UN Human Rights Council why don't they resurrect Genghis Khan or Stalin
[04:28.480 --> 04:35.040]  or something and give them honorary doctor ships or something doctorates doctor ships

[12:43.960 --> 12:47.080]  and everything i just said i'm gonna go in here and eat so i tried to get a place in the corner

[12:53.160 --> 12:56.840]  then lady came over and said i didn't used to believe you but now i know you're right and then
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.000]  you know the waitress came over your your dinner's been paid for and into the place a huge democrat
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.800]  hangout and i'm telling you i saw that they understand they've been betrayed but they only
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.000]  know because they're listeners of my show and i'm not saying i'm something special no one else is
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.200]  telling them no one else is explaining it to them straight up they just have no idea you know the
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.640]  average democrat out there is still believing that they're going to get the the pot of gold
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.400]  at the end of the rape row and you know i use that term because that's what this is we're being
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.920]  pilfered we're being stripped mind we're being extracted use the words of dylan radigan when
[13:34.920 --> 13:41.240]  they basically didn't renew his contract and got rid of him at msnbc because he dared say
[13:41.240 --> 13:47.800]  mathematically we're screwed mathematically we're slaves this is being done by megabanks emergency
[13:47.800 --> 13:53.400]  red level alert oh my gosh that's extreme you're supposed to play patty cake and or maybe tiddly
[13:53.400 --> 14:01.160]  winks or hopscotch uh up on the deck of the titanic as it turns around and gets ready to break into
[14:01.160 --> 14:10.920]  and go to the bottom this is a guarantee ladies and gentlemen and now the truth is really starting
[14:10.920 --> 14:16.360]  to come out wait till i get to the latest nsa news it's unbelievable and we've got man cow joining
[14:16.360 --> 14:22.280]  us in 15 minutes if he doesn't check it out and i'm not i'm not saying that like nanny nanny boo boo
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.440]  you know you're not willing to do it he didn't even have cold feet to come on he said he'd do it
[14:27.480 --> 14:34.200]  i just um then it was some trepidation when i was talking to him a little bit off air during a break
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.200]  but i mean you you want to tell people this type of stuff that the government is going around in
[14:40.200 --> 14:44.360]  fact when you print me the washington post article you had up earlier about them admitting the cias
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.560]  involved in domestic propaganda and buying off the media this is going on ladies and gentlemen
[14:49.560 --> 14:55.000]  i mean it's too late for me now because i've gone so far and and people wouldn't wouldn't go along
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.440]  with it even if i did try to sell out but but i mean literally ladies and gentlemen i could be on
[15:00.440 --> 15:06.920]  500 radio stations on 160 something all the biggest ones on fox news bigger than glenn beck
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.280]  see glenn beck figured out you can't sell out to the devil and it's been unselling out or maybe
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.200]  never even really sold out but he's just getting the fact that this whole thing's going down
[15:16.200 --> 15:22.040]  and that's why limbaugh's got more hardcore and everybody's got more hardcore i mean we're on a
[15:22.040 --> 15:30.760]  collision course with destruction we've got a destiny of of of hellish inferno if we don't
[15:30.760 --> 15:40.920]  change our destiny destination void destination hellhole destination scam destination fraud but
[15:40.920 --> 15:44.600]  but let me just do this let me just read you the headlines let's see if i can do it
[15:44.600 --> 15:50.760]  Washington Times bainter says house won't negotiate with senate on immigration bill and
[15:50.760 --> 15:55.800]  that it's dead knowing banner that could be some type of double cross operation here's
[15:55.800 --> 16:00.680]  that article i mentioned us repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.320]  and there are hundreds of billions in pentagon slush funds now being used to buy off even the
[16:05.320 --> 16:11.800]  smallest blogs that's why i told you what all hell is going to break loose folks you're going to see
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.600]  bloggers come out and say i've murdered people you're going to see talk show hosts come out and
[16:16.600 --> 16:24.280]  attack us you're about to see it's all about to break loose okay and and and whoever you see being
[16:24.280 --> 16:29.400]  attacked from by the power structure and the so-called alternative media you can bet that's
[16:29.400 --> 16:35.160]  where the paychecks are coming from you can bet that's who's getting paychecks okay to attack
[16:35.160 --> 16:39.960]  that's why even though i have differences with mainline libertarians and conservatives the
[16:39.960 --> 16:45.400]  globalist plan on getting rid of them too now so we're all in the same boat emergency situation
[16:45.400 --> 16:50.280]  all hands on deck this is it this is the beginning because you notice they're on cloak now everybody
[16:50.280 --> 16:54.120]  knows their criminal takeover it's all over the news that we're all being surveilled illegally
[16:54.120 --> 17:00.280]  that there are FEMA camps that they're training for total collapse now they're uncloaking because
[17:00.280 --> 17:05.720]  they're getting ready to go operational they don't have any choice there's moves to impeach holder
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.200]  there's moves in peach obama which should happen but if we don't aggressively get on the offense
[17:12.200 --> 17:14.840]  we're going to lose everything now let me go over some of these headlines here
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.200]  saudi arabia cuba people's republic of china three of the greatest tyrannies on earth
[17:22.200 --> 17:27.560]  will join un human rights council and decide what's a human right and what isn't and will help cover
[17:27.560 --> 17:33.320]  up tyranny and now that the us is is the absolute center of evil uh now all these other tyrants
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.960]  get to oppose as human rights advocates i have to tell you what to do in saudi arabia and china
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.960]  with mobile execution vans in cuba and saudi arabia you don't hear any of the gay rights activists
[17:43.960 --> 17:48.760]  talking about how they execute you over there if you're gay or if you're caught in north korea with
[17:48.760 --> 17:53.960]  a bible they're executing thousands a week now in public executions oh no that's all trendy
[17:54.520 --> 18:00.440]  that's all trendy uh so again mass public executions carried out in seven north korean cities
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.800]  in that now well that's total government that's where we're headed morocco obama's popularity
[18:05.800 --> 18:09.720]  falls to i all time low but the first time the majority of america's think the president is
[18:09.720 --> 18:15.400]  dishonest and untrustworthy and that's in their whitewash uh mainline gallup polls and
[18:15.400 --> 18:20.600]  cobec university polls i mean that's selected people they're calling even their own dumbbells
[18:20.600 --> 18:24.760]  they can't even call their regular dumbbells and get them to buy the suckering anymore
[18:24.760 --> 18:31.880]  but don't worry motley cruz six has had enough of our celebrity president and of course he was on

[33:45.560 --> 33:53.400]  the morning fox show for more than a decade and he also has a hit show on the history channel
[33:53.400 --> 34:02.360]  right now god guns and automobiles with his brother of course Mark Muller of max motors
[34:02.360 --> 34:08.280]  and the reason I got him on today and asked him to come on was because I was on his radio
[34:08.280 --> 34:13.640]  show today and I'm back on it tomorrow popping in with news updates and and mancals one of the
[34:13.640 --> 34:18.600]  few people I can talk to who's been on talk radio for decades who knows how the news works
[34:18.600 --> 34:24.760]  who understands things like he said on his show today I see Obamacare press releases
[34:24.760 --> 34:30.920]  on his website then I see it word for word on CNN and MSNBC that night they are literally loading
[34:30.920 --> 34:37.800]  the teleprompters word for word with whatever the White House says and and how he sees an Obamacare
[34:37.800 --> 34:44.280]  supporter sticker on a car and literally has to control himself not to ram their vehicle I mean
[34:44.280 --> 34:50.680]  I have these exact same type of thoughts because I'm so sick of the gullibility of people that do
[34:50.680 --> 34:55.720]  not know how media works do not know how this stuff operates so I say a lot of things on
[34:55.720 --> 35:02.360]  mancals show that will get him to then blurt out things that he's confirmed separately
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.240]  going through it so I was mentioning how they're coming out with all these internet censorship
[35:07.240 --> 35:11.960]  bills and I've got a UN secret treaty that our government's already signed on to that
[35:11.960 --> 35:17.480]  WikiLeaks just leaked today Curt Nemo has that article at infowars.com secret globalist treaty
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.920]  threatens internet freedom we broke that the white boxes or NSA run going in nationwide stealing
[35:22.920 --> 35:28.520]  all your phone data illegally the Seattle police within 24 hours said they've turned them off
[35:28.520 --> 35:34.040]  and admitted they're illegal that's not national news that's now not in mainstream news that's
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.960]  how controlled the media is we break it secret documents the police put out a press release
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.600]  and say we're turning it off the city council in Seattle is freaking out turns out it's going
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.960]  in nationwide this should be one of the top stories in the world secret boxes stealing all
[35:49.960 --> 35:56.440]  your cell phone data tracking you in real time face scanning you you name it it's not even news
[35:56.440 --> 36:03.240]  folks okay this is how dark it's gotten this is how many minutes close to midnight we've gotten I
[36:03.240 --> 36:09.880]  mean I'm freaked out every second now I always slept like the dead I can't even sleep now I'm so
[36:09.880 --> 36:14.840]  freaked out historically knowing historically where we're at from studying history I mean this
[36:14.840 --> 36:19.880]  is insane wired magazine says our government has weaponized the internet here's how they did it
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.760]  and admits the whole thing surveilling you tracking you and using data against you economically
[36:24.760 --> 36:30.360]  you go all do I have to hide their predators look at Obamacare designed to rip you off
[36:30.360 --> 36:35.720]  designed to not work and it was man cow months ago that said you watch when it comes out it won't
[36:35.720 --> 36:42.040]  work it's designed to be a total fraud and he was absolutely right so he joins us now so I'm
[36:42.040 --> 36:49.640]  just setting this up here because I'm on his show and he's talking about what's next in media
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.200]  control and I said well all the mainstream media is dying because people know they're lying alternative
[36:54.200 --> 36:59.160]  media is exploding but they're doing everything they can to cut off money to it so we can't operate
[36:59.160 --> 37:04.120]  we have giant audiences our routinely number one in major cities on some of the same stations as
[37:04.120 --> 37:08.840]  man cow I'm on like Orlando and others and they come in and buy the station and take us off number
[37:08.840 --> 37:13.800]  one in cities up against the competition on stations that are even small and they take us off
[37:13.800 --> 37:18.360]  so you don't get a brass ring you don't get a trophy for being number one you get taken off the
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.160]  air okay I'm gonna explain how this works and now they want to shut down the internet and the
[37:23.160 --> 37:27.560]  alternative because we're beating them there and we're taking over they don't want drudge report
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.520]  dot com they don't want info wars dot com they don't want man cow dot com they don't want world net
[37:32.520 --> 37:37.640]  daily dot com they don't want the blaze dot com bright bar dot com you can see well those you know
[37:37.640 --> 37:42.840]  none of those groups are perfect I'm not perfect the point is the establishment sees us as the enemy
[37:42.840 --> 37:49.160]  because we're free agents period we're not serving them we have red blood we don't like being run over
[37:49.960 --> 37:55.240]  now I say the next phase as the Pentagon has announced document can please is gonna they're
[37:55.240 --> 38:05.240]  gonna spend billions buying off the media billions buying off the media and then once they've done
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.600]  that they are going to then just start shutting off the smaller blogs and they're also going to try
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.960]  to buy people off through different different conduits so that's the bottom line there here's
[38:15.960 --> 38:21.320]  the washington post from earlier this year us repeals propaganda ban spreads government made
[38:21.320 --> 38:29.240]  news to americans and remember the pentagon came out and said on record that they are going to go
[38:29.240 --> 38:35.400]  out and quote work with alternative media and try to create partnerships that means covert
[38:35.400 --> 38:41.880]  partnerships black ops now how this works we're gonna go to man cow right now is I was offered
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.600]  three and a half million dollars like 13 14 years ago to sell out to one of the major networks
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.120]  and they told me you will not talk about the new world order the federal reserve the government
[38:50.120 --> 38:55.560]  dealing drugs any of that stuff you will be a mainline conservative and I said no so years later
[38:55.560 --> 38:59.960]  a deal came along for over nine million dollars close to ten and people said well why don't you
[38:59.960 --> 39:04.680]  say who did it well you sign agreements in these meetings or you go in and it's all in confidence
[39:05.400 --> 39:09.560]  I can say what I've been offered before and some of it's come out in the news before but I won't
[39:09.560 --> 39:14.360]  say who did it or you know how it all happened because if you ever do that then you never even
[39:14.360 --> 39:20.440]  get the intel of the offers so I'm on man cow show telling the story and then he goes yes that
[39:20.440 --> 39:27.880]  just happened to me last week and the point is this is intensifying right now they are buying
[39:27.880 --> 39:35.880]  up the opposition right now and man cow did not go along with that and so he can tell you now
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.760]  from an insider perspective this is a major guy with a hit show on history channel other shows
[39:40.760 --> 39:46.200]  in the works fox news contributor syndicated radio show he's already made you know tens of millions
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.360]  of dollars in radio he's a real major player this is real this is credible this is what's going on
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.880]  in america folks this is how they're taking down the media because most people like armstrong
[39:57.880 --> 40:03.400]  williams sold out for a quarter mil to promote no child left behind a small talk show host a small
[40:03.400 --> 40:09.160]  columnist okay you know he gets a quarter mil to sell out man cow gets offered nine plus mil
[40:09.160 --> 40:14.680]  man cow there is the intro sir tell us exactly and then you've got some big hollywood insider news
[40:14.680 --> 40:20.600]  what they told you about knowing obama living with obama go ahead now alex look i knew obama
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.600]  before he was anybody i knew about the church before anything because here was a christian church
[40:26.600 --> 40:33.000]  and celebrated islam um harry lenox was just and i told you about this i think that's a blockbuster
[40:33.000 --> 40:39.560]  story the star with james spader this hit show the blacklist and he told me that he was the actor
[40:39.560 --> 40:49.080]  hired to teach obama to be harry lenox watch the blacklist and you can see obama that this is an
[40:49.080 --> 40:55.160]  actor that we've hired in our president all right look i went to number one on wabc in new york
[40:55.160 --> 41:03.960]  and they said uh well what happens now i said i get fired i had uh number one show in chicago
[41:03.960 --> 41:09.560]  on q101 emiss corporation emiss means truth and i personally found them to be a bunch of liars
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.760]  but they came to me they said look we don't show the fox news channel and there was there
[41:14.760 --> 41:21.320]  was a many issues but we want you to support hillary uh we you know we don't like seeing you on tv
[41:21.320 --> 41:28.120]  uh we don't want you to syndicate we don't uh and and that's it and i said fine now now i'm
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.600]  going to tell you something that you're going to disagree with but let me continue here it was
[41:32.600 --> 41:39.000]  actually two weeks ago one of these major corporations i got offered nine and a half million
[41:39.000 --> 41:47.400]  dollars for a three-year deal no comedy no musical elements and they wanted me to uh
[41:47.400 --> 41:56.120]  lean towards and promote obama and i said no now i i have to say i feel a little bit like no i'm
[41:56.120 --> 42:04.600]  i'm sure you do as well as the flood is here and you and i have dear friends alex who who have sold
[42:04.600 --> 42:09.880]  out and i ask your listeners when you have somebody you love a radio person out of your tv host
[42:10.520 --> 42:14.920]  that you love and all of a sudden wait a minute now they're promoting something that they hated
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.440]  it uh well wait a minute i'm a republican or i'm a democrat i'm this and they're doing company
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.720]  line they're doing party line even though it's against everything that they didn't they didn't
[42:25.720 --> 42:32.680]  agree with a week ago why is that well because it's a script and of course i often wonder why
[42:32.680 --> 42:39.480]  am i sitting here working so hard when i could sell out and it would be so much easier to just go along
[42:39.480 --> 42:45.480]  so look this company the points i want to make that you're not going to like
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.960]  and people aren't going to like
[42:53.320 --> 42:59.240]  i have a right not to hire somebody that i don't want to hire i have a right to tell my employees
[42:59.240 --> 43:05.400]  i don't like your stupid haircut i don't want you coming in here with a death metal shirt cover up
[43:05.400 --> 43:09.960]  your tattoos no i you know i want to see your i want to see your face i don't want you wearing
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.920]  a band cow i've got to say this i've got to say this i've got to say this look well look you said
[43:14.920 --> 43:19.880]  hold on hold on yeah but here's the deal they've taken our money our tax money man cow you love free
[43:19.880 --> 43:25.800]  speech and the band the black crows had a woman's private area on the front of their cd and they
[43:25.800 --> 43:31.960]  wanted me to go against walmart well look walmart has a right to say no a major corporation and
[43:31.960 --> 43:37.880]  yes they've got friends of the obama administration has a right to say man cow we're gonna pay you
[43:37.880 --> 43:43.000]  nine and a half million dollars but you have to support obama care they have a right to
[43:43.000 --> 43:50.520]  say that alex and i have a right to say no man cow i absolutely totally disagree with you
[43:50.520 --> 43:55.960]  because this isn't let me stop you this isn't like you're going to work at twin peaks burger bar
[43:55.960 --> 44:03.000]  with girls being scantily clad and the uniform and the uniform is daisy dukes and then and then
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.600]  and then you disagree with it sure you you go to work there they have a right to say that's their
[44:06.600 --> 44:12.520]  dress code this is where you've got a combine of offshore banks the military industrial complex
[44:12.520 --> 44:17.960]  who's got control of banker bailout money and taxpayer money using that money through media
[44:17.960 --> 44:24.760]  combines they own to go out and then basically shut down the rest of the media through regulation
[44:24.760 --> 44:31.000]  and then basically buy everyone off to put out their message that's what's going on and i understand
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.560]  you're coming out talking about a major deal you refused and you don't want to totally burn bridges
[44:35.560 --> 44:39.400]  and i understand when the devil puts their arm around your uh you know their arm around your neck
[44:39.400 --> 44:44.120]  and and offers you something really great you know you push the devil away but you still say man
[44:44.120 --> 44:51.080]  you're sexy i get all that but come on this shows look at armstrong williams being paid off a taxpayer
[44:51.080 --> 44:57.800]  money to go out and promote no child left behind my point is this is going on everywhere this is
[44:57.800 --> 45:03.960]  happening everywhere alex you're not you're not going to hire somebody that hates alex don't show
[45:04.680 --> 45:10.360]  you're not going to hire look yes i understand what you're saying but they certainly whatever
[45:10.360 --> 45:15.240]  whatever you want to label that they stole all the money they stole the economy they're exempt from
[45:15.240 --> 45:20.040]  all the taxes they were right to say now they buy everything up to support obama and i have a right
[45:20.040 --> 45:27.480]  to say i don't want to do that now is it sad is it do i wish that they would support free speech yes
[45:27.480 --> 45:32.360]  is it discouraging yes no i'll tell you what's not fair you know you know more hollywood folks than i
[45:32.360 --> 45:39.160]  does the tribune is firing everybody the sun times was the size of the la phone book when it came to
[45:39.160 --> 45:45.560]  chicago now it's three pages of race baiting i watched scott pelion brian williams and they recall
[45:45.560 --> 45:50.600]  an abc cbs and you know all the rest of propagandas and they're reading with press releases
[45:51.640 --> 45:56.680]  that you and i get but refuse to read and i think people know that the mainstream newspapers which
[45:56.680 --> 46:02.840]  are over they know that abc cbs nbc and the rest that it's it's white house propaganda
[46:02.840 --> 46:09.320]  and don't believe the illusion they're failing so we will win alex we are winning and by the way
[46:09.320 --> 46:14.520]  i've read the i read the end of the book and so have you good wins and god wins and i don't want
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.480]  people to get discouraged no no i hear you but listen i appreciate your courage on your own show
[46:19.480 --> 46:25.560]  talking about being given this offer and then refusing it my only issue is this they're they're
[46:25.560 --> 46:30.760]  trying to bring back the fairness doctrine so that we can't have our free speech the fcc is
[46:30.760 --> 46:36.920]  announcing that they are persecuting the tea party with the irs and the pro life grips yeah they are
[46:36.920 --> 46:44.680]  funding all these new akron groups as obama navigators to rip everybody off so so so my point
[46:44.680 --> 46:51.640]  is my point is you being given this offer to leave obama alone is clearly part of the larger
[46:51.640 --> 47:00.440]  takeover is what i'm getting at what what's the question though is it disgusting is it sickening
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.160]  does it sadden me would i like to be able to have more money for my children of course my
[47:05.160 --> 47:10.680]  soul is not for sale and i hope that more good people stand up look the fact is obama has more
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.720]  whistleblowers and his administration and all other administrations combined
[47:17.720 --> 47:21.720]  people are standing up of course their lives are being destroyed nobody's allowed to really
[47:21.720 --> 47:27.080]  talk truthfully about Benghazi you know that 200 of the top military people in america
[47:27.080 --> 47:32.600]  have been fired i mean this is a coup d'etat obama is you know if you question obama you get
[47:32.600 --> 47:39.480]  destroyed i get audited year after year as you do illegally do i like it no the fight goes on
[47:39.480 --> 47:44.840]  and i hope that people listening will join us um it believe me be much easier to go along and i
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.720]  think most people just go along and take their paycheck and uh and and enjoy the you know the
[47:49.720 --> 47:56.600]  end of the world to being televised i can't live that way well listen man cal i agree with you but
[47:57.800 --> 48:02.440]  here's an example of the censorship everyone i know in hollywood you know more people than i
[48:02.440 --> 48:07.800]  do you know everybody everybody i know in hollywood almost everybody unless it's i'm having dinner with
[48:07.800 --> 48:13.080]  sean pin he's like basically a low grade moron everyone in hollywood that i talked to almost
[48:13.080 --> 48:17.240]  all of them are not really liberals they're not socialists they're not even conservatives they're
[48:17.240 --> 48:22.280]  libertarians what you'd call conspiracy theorists that just means they don't believe known liars they
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.440]  don't believe the system but they all say i'll be kicked off tv i'll be kicked out of movies if i
[48:28.440 --> 48:33.240]  don't go along with this there's a few mob bosses up at the top and i've been in meetings with these
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.120]  studio heads and people they are like mob bosses who literally have everybody living under fear
[48:38.120 --> 48:41.960]  uh james woods has come out and said he's been told he'll never work again because he dared
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.000]  criticize obama this is a tyranny we all need to stand together like james woods and others
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.920]  and say enough is enough this makes mccarthy and and his blacklist look like nothing man cal is
[48:52.920 --> 48:58.920]  what i'm saying well it was mccarthy right his hollywood loaded with socialists and commies
[48:58.920 --> 49:05.240]  and by the way uh you know everybody look ten crews made a mistake my take was let it go let
[49:05.240 --> 49:11.080]  it fail uh the man felt like he had to fight but by the way as everybody was bashing you know the
[49:11.080 --> 49:16.680]  rhinos republican name only that the the lame stream uh republicans which are you know they're
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.720]  looking it's it's it's it's hulk hogan versus iron cheek it's all fake republican versus democrat
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.520]  is faked at this point but everybody was going after ted cruise everything ted cruise said
[49:26.520 --> 49:31.960]  was the truth everything that you and i are saying is the truth look i i saw as i told you yesterday
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.440]  i just want to steer my car i mean i'm kidding but you know a guy at this point that has an
[49:36.440 --> 49:43.640]  eye heart obamacare bumper sticker i mean look it's intellectually dishonest obama is doing
[49:43.640 --> 49:49.560]  everything that bush did times ten but you know look i have in i have in the top black
[49:49.560 --> 49:53.960]  comedians and they say well we won't say anything because he's african-american we're african-american
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.320]  the the democrats and the liberals won't say anything but but boy they wouldn't stop elliak
[49:59.320 --> 50:05.160]  under bush the ignorance that's going on the intellectual lies the party first i mean this
[50:05.160 --> 50:12.120]  is like nazi germany i mean it's really i mean a party first the party the party uh and and the
[50:12.120 --> 50:17.240]  government and i and i i mean alex i can go on and on about this i mean if it's one of our kids

[54:51.400 --> 54:58.280]  mother his grandfather his grandmother all cia all foundation run from the beginning
[54:59.080 --> 55:05.640]  and that's my point this is a scientific take over plan i could tell man cow though was very
[55:05.640 --> 55:10.360]  irritated because he said all come on your show and talk about that and i could tell once he got on
[55:10.360 --> 55:16.440]  air and was talking about turning down that nine million dollars he he was really upset by the
[55:16.440 --> 55:21.560]  time he went to break and had to go so uh but i mean people need to know about that stuff they
[55:21.560 --> 55:29.240]  need to understand that these type of things are are indeed happening and so when you see
[55:29.880 --> 55:36.600]  people out there that are promoting establishment anti-gun anti-family they're being paid folks
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.320]  are being paid by the government and in many cases via government through contracts stimulus
[55:41.320 --> 55:49.080]  money through mms nbc through the some of the big radio syndicators they are being paid to do this
[55:49.800 --> 55:59.080]  that's what's going on and now they're coming in with the next salvo in all this and that's why
[55:59.080 --> 56:07.080]  folks need to absolutely support this broadcast and radio stations that carry this the globalists
[56:07.080 --> 56:14.200]  are destroying the economy so that only they have money and only they have the qe unlimited cash the
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.240]  fiat counterfeit money they create the digital money so they can buy everything up see they have
[56:19.240 --> 56:25.400]  to crash things so that they can literally scoop it all up not just so they own it but so they
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.600]  totally can social engineer and control it and that's why you're listening to us on an mfm affiliate
[56:31.400 --> 56:37.720]  you've got to support the local sponsors you've got to support uh the local station and spread
[56:37.720 --> 56:41.720]  the word about it you've got to support this show you've got to spread the word about this

[56:59.800 --> 57:05.080]  the word out and then it became funding mechanisms where we can fund ourselves most talk show hosts
[57:05.080 --> 57:10.600]  get a paycheck they have a boss and it's very hard to find a boss that'll let you tell the truth i
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.560]  am my own boss i am my own media system it's one of the only things like this in the world
[57:15.560 --> 57:21.720]  probably well it is an original like drudge report is an original there's not many things that are
[57:21.720 --> 57:30.760]  truly standalone man cow is an original he's the real deal but uh it's bad and and you've
[57:30.760 --> 57:36.040]  got to come to realization that we are watching them the the meltdown of society you can't sell

[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:37.880]  it yet it's red link its secret globalist treaty threatens internet freedom and notice that the
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.360]  seattle police department came out and said we're going to turn off this system that steals all your
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.000]  data because it clearly is illegal just like the google cars grabbing data were illegal
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:53.320]  was stealing your personal communications and they're doing it from outside the telecom grid
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.120]  because that's turned into lawsuit city so now they're doing this under homeland security
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.280]  grants this should be one of the top stories in the world that indeed the documents got leaked
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:10.280]  indeed it was all true they turned it off hours after we broke the story yesterday
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.640]  and there is no media except one local tv station reporting on them turning it off
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:24.920]  we break it drudge report magnifies it out to everybody drudge report dot com but it doesn't
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.120]  matter if the mainstream media doesn't cover it that's why they're dying people know that a lot
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:35.640]  of the times they're not getting what's really going on and folks i'm not here differentiating
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:42.840]  myself from other media just so i get the audience i would believe me believe me i'm a humble man
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.240]  i would much rather fix things turn things around do a show once a week there's always
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.800]  tyranny to fight but you know if we turn the corner i would be hiking i would be camping
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.800]  i'd be traveling the world i'd be uh doing artwork and i would be working you know one day
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:07.080]  a week on radio or something or or you know having a painting website or something that's what i like
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:14.760]  to do i would love to be able to walk away from all this why frankly that's why i'm trying to find
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:21.080]  reporters and researchers and people that get it so i can build a media organization if we slow
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.720]  the new world order down enough for i don't have to be here six seven days a week because you're
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.960]  either totally into this and totally obsessed with it or you're not i can't turn it off when i leave
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:38.680]  work i can't stop thinking about it i can't stop being informed and that's where the frustration
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:49.080]  and the anger comes from is that this this stuff is totally real and history is happening and i'm
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:56.520]  just some ragtag person and putting on my fight against it i'm having a big effect what would
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:02.200]  happen if all of these doctors and lawyers and establishment people who i know are smart
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.880]  who i know were informed what would happen if they decided to be leaders and not just
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:13.720]  sell out to the nearest new world order person they found i mean these people will sell out
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:20.520]  their grandmother for a piece of silver they'll sell out their whole family their whole culture
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:29.480]  just to feel trendy and they'll go secure themselves in some country club area while the
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.920]  rest of the world melts down around them as if they're going to escape to melt down the world
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.800]  as if their kids aren't going to be sucked in by the world as if their wives and their husbands
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.160]  won't be sucked in by it i mean you will not get out of something like this that's being built

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.600]  is they they've been bought and paid for by offshore interest and right now through deals
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.320]  with the eu through deals with the pacific partnership they are putting through stuff
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:17.640]  that makes sopa and acta uh look pale in significance and that's why we have this next

[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.880]  now i've used this term for at least six seven years that we have a weaponized internet taken
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.720]  over by the military industrial complex globally that is designed to track trace and shut down free
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:43.320]  speech and then end net neutrality and charge you or even block you for being able to share any type
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.040]  of info they don't like aka facebook twitter you know blocking and banning people that talk about

[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:41.960]  on so many fronts this is the biggin on so many fronts this is the issue
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:51.800]  not just the nsa spy grid not just the domestic rollout but that the police in seattle under dhs
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:58.840]  grants and this is happening all over the country by the way put in illegal white box cream box spy
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:04.840]  grids that hack into your phone track everything you're doing uh they told the media last week
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:12.680]  it's a police communication system our own private internet wi-fi but of course it was then pointed
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.920]  out that it was tracking and logging everyone's location their thousand last locations with the
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.880]  uh gps and then triangulating for cameras to follow people we knew because the same system
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.320]  was put in in london five years ago and they had to remove it and then it came out we got a hundred
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.560]  plus page document leaked to us confirmed and that they were basically storing all your data
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.360]  tracking you breaking into your phone and that they weren't even supposed to have turned it on yet
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.480]  until the city council gave an authorization turned out the city council didn't even know
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:49.000]  about it they're saying and it was turned on and the police said the police sergeant the spokesman
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.920]  is in our article you can go read the quote there he said that it was an accident when they tested
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.880]  it when it went in last february that it wasn't supposed to be turned on yet it was an accident
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:08.600]  they just forgot to turn it off i mean the way they lied it was but that's what you do to your
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:15.080]  enemy i mean that's what you do militarily i mean in mars attacks the aliens land in las vegas and
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.720]  they say don't run we are your friends and the earthlings stop and then the aliens shoot them
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.960]  and then laugh and say what idiots and of course that's a play on the military tactic they found
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:31.800]  a world war one you would say stop we're not assaulting where your friends as the tanks
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.840]  rolled in and then they people would just drop their weapons and be bayoneted
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.400]  at point if you just said i'm not assaulting they would teach the germans how to say in
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.240]  in in english i am your friend the germans were the first to do it i'm here to help you friend and
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:53.400]  then and then the americans and the french and the brits were so you know old-fashioned and friendly
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.800]  they would say oh you're my friend ah that's what they do the government's your friend ah
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.320]  we're not watching you just like a wake-up the tanks are smashing into it setting the place on
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:09.800]  fire the bradley fighting vehicles they got special forces behind it you know shooting and classic
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:16.440]  infantry maneuver it's all on flare video and they would say where your friends come out come out
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.400]  come out they had bar bar wrapped around the front so they couldn't get out they'd run them
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.440]  out the back and you could see them on the flare footage shooting the men women and children
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.520]  and then they'd run over them with tanks to get rid of the evidence and push them into the fire
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:32.440]  with bulldozers that's just a classic special forces operation i mean they sent delta force in
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.200]  delta force said on loudspeakers come out where your friends and then shot everybody with m16s when
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.120]  they came out that's what you do we're here where your friend come out
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.280]  obama loves you the system loves you it's an accident that the healthcare site doesn't work
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.600]  it's an accident that many people have 500 600 rate increases on average 250 in grace it's an all
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.960]  an accident that foreign mega banks that literally kill whole third world populations when they have
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:11.800]  them captive would want to hurt you they just set up fox con factories with suicide nets and forced
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:17.960]  abortion and mobile execution vans and the communist chinese are now running the un human
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.320]  rights board why not have kim jong-un of north korea do it why not resurrect hitler skull you know
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.880]  the russians say they have a piece of it and it can be the judge they'll just have a skull up there
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.960]  and hitler will judge everyone at the peace peace tribunal i mean this is just the other
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.720]  worldliness because what's happened is the elite are now not accountable basically they can do whatever
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:44.280]  they want they have unlimited funding they have robotics that can build however many cheap widgets
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.160]  they want to survey us and they're rolling out the tanks the armored vehicles that police trained
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:55.720]  to attack us the the surveillance grids the the poison in the water they're now announcing you
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:59.000]  know what they let us put poison in the water in the food we're going to genetically engineer all
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.320]  the crops to basically sterilize them let's just do that it's all happening and again i'm not trying
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:12.520]  to scare you folks because this is already going on don't you want to know
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.240]  you know there are many cases with what i call stock home mass stock home syndrome
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:24.440]  where people will be told hey there's somebody in the bedroom robbing all your jewelry and
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.640]  everything and in more and more cases men and women will sit there and not even call 911 or
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.400]  not even get their gun and defend themselves they will just sit there keep watching tv going i don't
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:44.680]  believe it i don't believe it and that's what this is this is total denial on pcp this is total
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.560]  maximum denial total criminal group taken over stealing everything not nailed down
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:56.200]  on massing technology and weapon systems against us parading up and down arrogantly
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:05.400]  in an imperious fashion to get us ready for it and not one dinosaur media not one kleptocrat
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:12.680]  media not one prostitute media not one decepticon media except for one local tv station and the
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.440]  newspaper reported the police announced yesterday after drudgereport.com carried our info wars.com
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.360]  story on this not one national or international outfit covered this
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:33.320]  not one and that's why they're dying that's why they're a joke that's why they're a fraud
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:41.400]  that's why they fail because this proves that they are state run media
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:50.200]  because across the board they will not report on a giant nsa illegal system
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.640]  deliberately hacking and stealing all your data and and grabbing your personal data
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.000]  because you know they've been sued and lost court cases without warrants grabbing it from
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.560]  the phone companies that they're jacked into so they're making some in-run around where they just
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.320]  put up systems that just grab your data and signals intelligence and then admits can break
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.800]  into your phone you name it and tracks you and now it's coming out all over the country these
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.160]  systems it couldn't put in and now hacking sites the real media i've got stacks of it here are
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:24.440]  reporting all over the country they're finding the ip addresses associated with the seattle
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.880]  dhs the fusion center with the same prefixes but in different parts of the country that
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:36.120]  everywhere there are wireless systems in the hub grabbing everything of course they are
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.640]  they're i mean i i found nsa grids all over the place and went and looked up who it is and
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.280]  we're going to report on it and cops pull up in minutes and say you know what are you doing
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.920]  that's a that's a classified thing because the cop doesn't know that just means it's classified
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.720]  now go drink your fluoride and die give the kids some shots and put a diaper on him when he's 10
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.080]  shut up cop and go get right some tickets we're replacing you soon with a with the robot cameras

[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.520]  they're gonna have the drones the robots the kill grids the highway blockers up and then
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.240]  the cops can all just flop around dying from bio attacks and their stupid threat fusion centers
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:48.920]  built this is a technocratic kill grid you're in a science fiction movie grow up and realize it
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.840]  and realize the mainstream media is state-run whores who love tyranny and hate their families

[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.760]  know i want to be because i'm telling the truth they don't want to draw attention to that you
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.920]  just tuned in for the first time my name is alexander imrick jones and i'm coming to you from deep in
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:34.600]  the heart of texas in globalists occupied fema region six and uh every major globalist from the
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:39.400]  white house science art through david rockefeller to ted turner to prince phillip to prince charles
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:45.080]  to queen betricks all say on record they want to establish a planetary government to carry out your
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:52.280]  orderly extermination through a technocratic uh technotronic age and they've been planning this
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:59.800]  since 1931 officially under the technocratic technotronic society that is the modern version
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.800]  of the eugenics movement started in 1854 by gallton and adopted by the royal family in
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:15.320]  1862 and then adopted as official u.s government policy in 1907 adopted by germany by 1925
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:22.520]  adopted by mexico in 1927 adopted by italy at the same time just look it up and it's all
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.560]  battle plan it's all battle plan but you've got to understand folks you're living in a science
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.360]  fiction movie and we've held some of it back we've you know hitler was one of their acolytes but he
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:36.280]  kind of went after only a few groups and they didn't agree with that so they kind of let him wreck
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.880]  europe as a pretext to bring down the old european order uh the rand corporations all public about
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:48.760]  this i had jolscow's and his historian on breaking down their plan to allow us to have a nuclear war
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.800]  so that a new government can reemerge after the nuclear war and you go well that's madness where
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:26:00.120]  have i heard of that before you heard about it from the bland corporation in the 1964 film
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:06.440]  doctor strange love which is based on real rand corporation plans but it's not rand corporation
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:13.560]  it's bland corporation and it's all put in satire ladies and gentlemen but the point is
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:21.320]  these people aren't going to stop and they use the cog the continuity of government system
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:28.440]  that they've put in place to guard the people well it's the guillotine it's the takeover
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:36.040]  they have a takeover of society to guard society do you understand that and the average i mean
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:42.440]  every tv show you see is at five-year-old propaganda level that show that man cowl was
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:49.320]  talking about uh the blacklist every scene on that show is just in the in the regular office
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:55.720]  there's troops standing around with with uh with m fours and everyone's being searched and and and
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:01.560]  it's fetishized as the sexy girl gets groped on and you know and then they have rappers coming out
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:07.640]  promoting how great it is to be groped by the tsa so the sheep sit there literally like idiocracy
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.840]  thinking it's a good idea every cop movie i see every drama i see because i do watch them on the
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:23.480]  treadmill when i have time literally literally literally quite literally has just random checkpoints
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.160]  they'll just be driving along in the woods and they're wanting to be an emergency they'll be oh
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:34.280]  it's a checkpoint up ahead just routine or you'll be watching a movie uh like uh gravity and they'll
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.600]  just add randomly yeah my daughter died playing tag i'm glad they've banned it and i guarantee
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.080]  i could go make calls do the research find out who the writers were pull out all the stops and
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.520]  find out that that was government propaganda placement it's all on record as well paid for
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:58.920]  i mean you know most movies make as much money as they do on downloads and dvds and blu rays
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.480]  let's say they make a hundred million dollars on that if it's some four hundred million dollar
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:09.800]  movie to make in some cases a hundred mil will be product and propaganda placement
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:16.040]  now i remember some article i saw where the apprentice tv show i want to say got like
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.080]  16 million c of my uh memories correct from like four years ago just search apprentice
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:26.840]  got 16 million from virgin atlantic or atlantic virgin or whatever it's called the airline

[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:09.960]  even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.840]  known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:20.680]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and

[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:32.120]  ladies and gentlemen you either roll over to the globalist
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:39.640]  drop the white flag get in a ditch or you stand up against them there really is no choice
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.000]  for me at least we're going to stand we're going to fight humanity's going to make it through this
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.040]  great tyrannical challenge every generation goes through some form of tyrannical challenge but
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:56.120]  we're facing the biggest that human society's ever seen but we have the tools of technology
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:02.040]  that are neutral to use back against the globalist and if they lose the moral high ground and if we
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:08.280]  point out that globalists have hijacked this nation and if people understand that obama's
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.840]  just a puppet and that it's offshore banks that are doing this and that this is a takeover and
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:21.000]  an occupation we can turn things around especially if we explain to people that agenda 21 is the
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.760]  overarching program under unesco treaty to bankrupt every industrialized nation to block
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:33.640]  development in the third world to bring in a new political and economic dark age for social
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:41.560]  engineering towards massive forced population reduction this whole fake culture of hollywood
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:49.880]  and all the pomp and all the rest of it is literally just a surface projection to get the
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:59.240]  public to basically buy in to the false reality this this this artificial construct they're
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:05.000]  artificially trying to insert us into play does cave instead of living out in the real open air
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.120]  and so it's not for us to tell people what to think is to simply get them to realize that
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.800]  they have been put into an artificial environment that's what things like time square are is just
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:23.080]  a total surveillance grid total bombardment with their messages overtaking reality inserting you
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:30.360]  really into a giant high-tech reeducation camp with all of these different icons all these
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:38.360]  different artificially created avatars artificially created art types programming your basic human
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:46.760]  makeup so that you will then accept the matrix they're trying to build we're not in the matrix
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:52.360]  yet but this is the the beginning of the matrix as people become zombies and as their iq's lower
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:57.080]  as their brain waves lower and as they don't communicate with friends and family but obsess
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:03.560]  on their personal facebook all day instead of even worrying about i know a lot of media folks
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.720]  that focus on their private little facebook instead of a big facebook they have access to i
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.680]  tend to do the same thing as well we get we get focused in on the minute and and and the
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:18.040]  distraction instead of seeing the larger world and that's what the establishment wants and so
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:25.320]  think about the the just over the top nature of a giant nsa grid of boxes being put in nationwide
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:31.080]  not just seattle if they're illegal on record grabbing all your data without warrants we expose
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.600]  it the police say we're going to stop for now until the city council tells us what to do but
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.800]  homeland security paid to put it in the city council was kept out of the loop on it it's a total
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.080]  criminal conspiracy and no media so-called establishment media will cover it and it's not
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:52.200]  like i care it's not like we need to be in the mainstream media i've been in
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:00.680]  newspapers tens of thousands of times sometimes thousands of times in one story and it does nothing
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.520]  because no one even reads it or pays attention to it i've done countless national tv shows
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.400]  almost nothing happens unless it was pierce morgan that was shown on every major tv network in
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:17.480]  the world i'm told chinese japanese russian television every late night show that's the
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:23.080]  only time the mainstream media has any power is because then they can lens everything and
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:30.360]  basically repeat the same talking point now just like all this massive nsa rollout domestically
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.000]  is not being reported by the state-run media and that's what it is officially
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.280]  literally or that systems like this are being put in public schools and libraries everywhere
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:47.000]  at the same time that all of that is going on if you go up to info wars dot com there is a
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:54.520]  headline secret globalist treaty threatens internet freedom and this is being reported
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:59.400]  by the electronic frontier foundation by tech dirt by drudge by others but info wars dot com
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.880]  has it curtain emos written about it secret globalist treaty threatens internet freedom and
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.880]  we've been hammering this for months david night's been focused on it predominantly here at info wars
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:16.120]  and on the nightly news leon macadoo has been focused on as well no one could get the treaty
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:22.440]  you've got all these asian pacific countries the eu the us north american union tying these three
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.720]  trilateral commission super unions together their meeting and no one can find out what's
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:37.320]  happening in the meetings no transparency and now via wiki leaks the documents have been leaked to
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.600]  wiki leaks and i think it's important you leak to wiki leaks but that could be compromised as well
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.680]  leaked to a lot of different outfits when you leak folks but i'm glad they leaked to wiki leaks
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.000]  just like we were leaked these documents on what was happening with the white boxes in
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  scattle and what they really did and now we know at least in in in a portion of exactly what is
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:06.200]  going on and again the story with the documents 30 000 word documents spelling out details
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:13.800]  of an internet freedom killing economic system that that picks winners and losers unbelievable
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:21.800]  a us eu transatlantic trade deal merging with these different asian union systems and joining us
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:27.160]  is leon macadoo and david night here to break it down but first i want to play a report from
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.840]  monday two days ago before we got the documents where leon breaks down exactly what's going on
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:38.840]  and the bounty that was put out to get somebody to send the documents for money from the inside
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.480]  on what was happening at these huge meetings that thousands of people have been attending for years
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.960]  that no one is able to find out what's happening with corporations and our governments
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:53.800]  meeting to decide our future outside of congress here it is the trans specific partnership is a
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:59.640]  proposed free trade agreement that will literally sign the globe over to corporate control and as
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:05.400]  it stands we the people who will be most affected by this contract won't be able to see how our
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:11.720]  sovereignty in our planet is being raped and ransacked in the name of potential profit margin
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:17.800]  until it is too late tpp negotiations have taken place under a freakish cloak of secrecy
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:23.080]  denying all but a very few any input into the terms of the agreement the only people who have
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:29.960]  had access to the negotiations are 600 advisors none of whom work for congress and 500 of which
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:35.800]  are corporate lobbyists even though the press the public and most members of congress haven't seen
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:42.200]  details of the negotiations the obama administration hopes to fast track the tpp by the end of this
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:48.760]  year and the obama administration has categorized the deal as classified information congressman
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:54.200]  alan grason was permitted to review the document after filing a freedom of information act however
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:00.520]  he was not allowed to comment on it here is what he did have to say about the tpp the result will
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:06.680]  be soon evident to everybody when the agreement does get released you'll see massive giveaways
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:13.080]  of our sovereignty massive efforts to undermine the middle class in this country massive efforts to
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:19.640]  keep us from making decisions that we need to do to make ourselves safe to keep ourselves healthy
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.560]  and to actually have the kind of life we want to have why because we've given the entire process
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:32.040]  over to special interests it's no longer even properly called a trade agreement it's an anti
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:38.120]  sovereignty agreement it is very little of anything to do with trade at this point and the fact
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.560]  that something like this can be negotiated in secret for over three years it is an indication
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:49.720]  of how far our standards have fallen i can't remember any time earlier in our history when we
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.960]  would have done this i can't remember any time earlier in our history when we'd even make an
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:59.240]  effort to say that we couldn't have amendments on the floor of the house or the senate about something
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:04.200]  that's so crucial to the way that we conduct our lives in the future so what's so bad about the
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.560]  trans-pacific partnership that it's being labeled as nafta on steroids well the chapters that have
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:15.000]  been leaked reveal plans that would threaten public health the environment are you an internet user
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.640]  of course you are well forget about syspa sopa and pipa the tpp rolls all of those regulations
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:28.520]  up into one global agreement that totally circumvents domestic laws file downloads could be criminalized
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.800]  and your internet service provider would become a copyright enforcer meaning your isp address could
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:39.720]  monitor and police your every move using a three strike system after those three strikes your access
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:44.760]  to the internet could be cut off including your own personal website which could be deleted
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:51.000]  and the tpp's rules on copyright infringement directly affect anyone who shares information
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.600]  via the web fair use exceptions could be severely restricted effectively crippling any sharing of
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:02.840]  news and videos via youtube and other platforms pharmaceutical companies can institute longer
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:09.240]  patents that would preserve their monopolies and reduce access to affordable medications the tpp
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:15.480]  includes foreign investor protections which could help corporations offshore jobs negotiations
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.280]  include financial deregulation and loss of oversight that could lead to even worse financial
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.800]  meltdowns than what we've experienced and perhaps the most crippling to sovereign countries foreign
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.480]  corporations could pummel nations financially if that nation considers a domestic law that will
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:37.960]  curb expected future profits for instance if a country refuses to grow gmo crops rather than
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.520]  respecting that nation's sovereignty biotech giants can sue the country for cutting into their profits
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:50.120]  and then international tribunals could impose economic sanctions on that country until their ban
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:56.120]  on gmo's is lifted this is a huge concern for citizens all over the world so why aren't these
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:02.200]  contracts being made available for public review while a group hopes to do a little crowdsourcing
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:09.800]  and expose this contract just foreign policy has launched a free tpp campaign to reward wiki leaks
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:15.240]  if it is able to make the negotiating text of the trans specific partnership public so far the
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.920]  group has raised more than $50,000 from concerned citizens who refuse to acquiesce while corporate
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:26.840]  cronies decide our fate we have got to call our representatives and demand that they find out what
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:32.280]  is inside the trans specific partnership we have to know what's in store for us so we can do something
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:38.840]  about it before it is too late reporting for the info wars nightly news i'm leon macadoo all right
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:43.640]  there's the report from monday uh now uh wiki leaks has gotten the document looks like the
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:51.720]  bounty worked and here we are now with the text of it and it takes over vitamins minerals jobs
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.000]  internet uh foreign corporations run these meetings we've gotten them before from the
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.400]  banff canada spp meeting in 2007 that's in my film in game where it literally just turns everything
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:10.200]  over to foreign interest into select corporations who can then come in shut down their competition
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.760]  you name it this stuff is all written to pick winners and losers and uh david night go over a
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:21.160]  laundry list for folks of exactly what's in this text that's now on info wars dot com well alex this
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.720]  is to clarify things this is not the entire agreement it's only a boil down this is well this
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:32.040]  is the entirety of one chapter that deals with medicines and copyrights uh they're going to be
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.880]  28 other chapters that we haven't seen okay so they're going to cover things like energy food safety
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.680]  whether or not we have gmo labeling that's going to be determined not by the people not by the
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.400]  government so that's going to be determined by these multinational corporations and their lobbyists
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:54.920]  operating in secret so you mentioned agenda 21 but unlike agenda 21 this i think is even as they're
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:00.200]  trying to be very very secretive they're actually exposing what they're all about by the fact that
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:05.480]  they're doing this all in secrecy it's the corporate global governance exactly and this is a top down
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.680]  centralized imposition on people whereas agenda 21 is a lot more subtle they they kind of come
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.080]  at you from the grassroots they they have this long list of things that that would be good for you
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.440]  to adopt a good agenda and then they put in with this reincorporation technique they put that in
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.880]  at the local level whereas this is something that people can really see the global corporatist agenda
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:30.360]  in operation because they see the secrecy they see the centralization they see that it's top down
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:36.520]  this is something that as one guy from public citizen said the obama administration shameful
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:42.520]  bullying on behalf of giant drug companies would lead to preventable suffering and death in asia
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.440]  and pacific countries he said it's much worse than anything that the bush administration had done
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:51.800]  and remember that this tpp started in 2010 of course they've been doing this they've had the
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:56.200]  blueprint for global takeover through trade agreements for decades going back to the very
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:01.880]  first bill de berg meeting that was about creating the eu and the euro so this has been secretly set
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:07.080]  up by bill de berg group and other organizations like that meeting in secrecy but now they're
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.480]  actually putting it in practice so now they're coming up with the actual nuts and bolts that's
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:18.680]  right and again then they have the un grassroots renamob astroturf to roll out locally to clamor
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:24.280]  and support the top down vertical integration to make it look like it has grassroots support
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:29.800]  so those two locked together in a combine yes multiple fronts you're coming from both directions
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:34.360]  from the bottom you know this fake grassroots as you mentioned this astroturf as well as imposing
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:40.440]  this from the top the amazing thing is is that that elected leaders from states can't see this
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:46.040]  ron wyden you you just saw the clip in leon's report of alan grason but ron wyden also tried
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.040]  to get information about it after a lot of pushing from him they would let him come and
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.920]  look at it he couldn't talk about any of the details he couldn't let his staff congressmen
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.720]  can't tell the american people what agreements are being made this this is global governance
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.640]  leon since you filed your report we've learned more you've read over the document you've got a lot
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:08.440]  of stuff highlighted there yeah well that's the thing it's not up for debate they don't want
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:13.480]  anyone it's not transparent because if people knew what was going on they would stop it if if our
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.280]  elected representatives were allowed to see the text they would have to do something about it and
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:23.240]  right now it's you know maybe they just are too elitist they're not going to face retribution
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:27.720]  this is global government i mean this is outrageous absolutely that's what this thing does it
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:33.560]  circumvents domestic laws and and puts everything over to international tribunals which will it'll
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:39.400]  be international laws that will decide so if a country decides they're not going to grow gmo's
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:45.080]  or like what we're seeing in quebec they they don't want fracking there well now these corporations
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:51.720]  can go in and sue countries for cutting into their expected future profits and they could say oh well
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:57.240]  you don't want to grow gmo's or let us frack in your country then we're going to sue you because
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:03.080]  you're dipping into our profits and it's not going to be held in a public court so even though they
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.960]  are going to be paid uh if the country you know will have to pay with taxpayer dollars it's not a
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:13.480]  public court that it's being tried in it's it's a private secretive court no it's their court they
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:19.560]  do this all the time and then they come in and and literally say you're not allowed to have your own
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.360]  city run water thing that was already paid for that competes with us unfairly you've got to sell
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:30.200]  it to us right they call them investor state tribunals so what they've done is they've elevated
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.040]  these multinational corporations and understand that we talk about corporations
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.400]  local corporations domestic corporations don't have the kind of standing that the multinational
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:44.200]  corporations have so they come in as investors they have a tribunal they have equal status or you
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.480]  could argue superior status to the state sure will you read over this stuff it's it's the corporations
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:53.480]  and they're writing it then the politicians that are bought and paid for ratify it stay there i want

[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.160]  just a few days ago FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to buy my entire stockpile
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:14.680]  of high quality survival food it sounds crazy but I'll show you the exact letter they sent in a
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:20.440]  minute revealing FEMA's plot could land me in hot water and I think you deserve to know exactly
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:26.440]  what they're doing go to FEMA hates this dot com to see undeniable video proof that the government

[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:39.000]  disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't go to FEMA hates this dot
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.360]  com to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard right now and why supplies are so low

[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:21.880]  dot com
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:35.080]  you can see it's uh linked in red up there a secret globalist treaty threatens internet freedom
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:43.800]  and we've got 30 000 words out of just one chapter of the plan and we know some of the leaks of the
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:49.880]  of the open internet censorship where a company just says that you you you you you might have
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:55.000]  infringed and you're banned from the internet forever after three strikes it's it's the youtube model
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:59.800]  and you know you go up there and you make a parody of the nsa and show their symbol
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:05.800]  and then they say oh that's that's infringing on us your band you can already see their model on
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:10.520]  facebook twitter and youtube and you say well just don't go on those sites no no no this is for the
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:16.840]  whole internet now censoring you at the point as your info goes over the routers this is what
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.480]  wired magazines reporting it's what we're reporting this is what it does they're not this is the
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:26.840]  establishment's answer to the technocracy they've allowed to be built which we could use to have
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:33.240]  freedom they want to use to dominate us leon other points in your analysis well this particular
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:40.520]  chapter we obviously it's a lot of pages we haven't gotten to all 95 of them but uh the
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.120]  intellectual property it's going to affect anyone that uses the internet anyone that uploads any
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:52.920]  videos to youtube and they have to go through the fair use or copyright laws a specifically medicine
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:58.520]  i know a few months ago there was a big thing that they wanted to patent human genes and because
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:04.200]  in breast cancer research they said we discovered that well what that does is it makes it more
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:10.680]  expensive for women to receive treatment for breast cancer because a specific company will
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.800]  hold the patent on that and it won't let any of anyone else do any research and so therefore it
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:22.280]  keeps the prices high and that's exactly what is going to happen as these 500 corporate lobbyists
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:29.720]  are there at the table negotiating this quote that's right and obama has said that these treaties
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.480]  which they pass a treaty to allow this organization to be there but now that group breaks off as a
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.760]  rogue government they've said that that trumps the supreme court who properly ruled that you can't
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:46.200]  patent my gene and then say no one else is ever allowed to do anything with that gene that's
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.520]  outrageous they're saying this is going to trump that exactly and they're going to do that with
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.080]  medicines and they're it's obviously going to keep the prices high it's not going to lower
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:01.000]  the prices it's not going to make it stop competition exactly exactly it creates monopolies and
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.760]  david was saying something about evergreening so yeah with with uh with drugs this is something
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:11.960]  that got put into the united states here with uh warren hatch and and waxman the hatch waxman act
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.720]  called drug price competition and patent term restoration act now as we all know the title is
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:22.920]  exactly the opposite of what it is so instead of having drug price competition they're eliminating
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.320]  competition on price so it's like affordable care act is five times the cost right what it is
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:32.200]  it's something they call evergreening and it allows a big pharma when they've got a patented drug and
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:36.520]  they get a long time on these patented drugs but they want longer on them so they want to stretch
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:42.680]  this out to infinity and beyond if possible so what they do is they have a process of notification
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:47.240]  where you the the generic drug manufacturer has to give notification to the company notification
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:52.760]  all these different people did you just quote buzz light year it's they stretch this out a couple
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.560]  of years just a notification process so what they want to do is they want to export this technique
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:02.040]  to the entire world for the benefit of big pharma and it's not just big pharma that's what we're
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.000]  seeing in this particular chapter but remember this is just one of 28 and by the way we deal with
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.160]  this just putting out things like high-quality nascent iodine that's just on record so good
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:19.400]  where where they don't let nasty say that water hydrates you because drug companies don't want
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:23.560]  anybody to be able to say vitamin c cure scurvy is good for your skin that's right of course it's
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:29.320]  an absolute fact but they've written all the rules and laws and turn loose bureaucrats to
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.320]  shut us down meanwhile they can put drugs on the market that kill you on record and have mercury
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:37.320]  brain damaging kids we're going to come back to five more minutes with you then phone calls for

[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:54.120]  draconian tyranny well you know what this really shows alex is that they talk about themselves as
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:59.160]  being stakeholders actually they see themselves as being slaveholders and we're their slaves and
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:04.600]  if anything comes out of this nothing could be more clear than that obama is not about transparency
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:10.280]  obama is merely a puppet of large multinational corporations this agreement makes it perfectly
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.760]  clear they're gonna say the sun came up this morning that's right they've had at least 19
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.120]  meetings on this they said they were going to get this done by the end of the year this all
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:23.720]  started under the obama administration in 2010 this particular trade negotiation agreement
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:28.120]  and this covers everything the chapters that we got today are really a wish list for the for
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:32.760]  nsa for hollywood and for big pharma but there's stuff in there for all the big corporations
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.640]  the bankers have their part in there to stop any legislation that's going to reign in derivatives
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:43.320]  we've got jobs being moved offshore we've got food safety being taken away by monsanto's interest
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:48.760]  and we've got energy being uh having a fork stuck in it and the same groups want the borders open
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:52.840]  exactly so this is what people need to understand and a lot of people are starting to wake up
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:57.240]  especially people on the left are very concerned about this predominantly because of this chapter
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:03.720]  that was released today that is essentially bringing in syspa you know they tried acta pipa syspa
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:08.680]  twice now they're going to get this in through the tpp the same things that they were trying to do
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:13.800]  as far as the isp can't get it in congress we'll just do it internationally do it internationally
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:18.520]  go over everybody's head leon you've got some of those sections right well speaking about the isp
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.880]  so so file downloads could be criminalized right so now your internet service provider
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:29.000]  is going to be basically like the copyright police so it's going to monitor everything you're doing
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  online and if do anything that it doesn't like it you it's a it uses so it's spying on you and
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.280]  they're already doing it this just puts it into some type of law and it gives you a three it has
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:46.680]  a three strikes type system and so if you break it you know you break their rules three times
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:52.040]  you're out you're off the internet your band your website individually banned you are banned
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:56.840]  whatever computer your and that's why microsoft's coming out with the internet id google is unifying
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:02.360]  at all it's all an nsa takeover grid well remember that the internet was started by darpa it was
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.760]  virtually a darpa project so maybe they've been it's kind of been a pump and dump strategy the
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:13.560]  entire time you're right continue and also too speaking about the offshoring of jobs this basically
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:20.760]  it eliminates the by american so it allows foreign corporations to bid on contracts here and they say
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:26.920]  oh well that's good for the us because we can go and bid on procurements contracts over overseas
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:33.480]  no it's opening up our borders our countries so that foreign countries can bid on contracts here
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:38.680]  well these things are always selectively enforced there's federal law that most of federal money
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:43.560]  has to go to small businesses none of it does i mean it's all written to be selectively enforced
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:48.840]  i mean if you're tyson chicken you can ship any chicken you out you want if you're a small chicken
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:54.040]  operation you do one thing wrong you're all going to jail but it's bringing everything together
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:58.360]  they've had regional trade agreements as we talked about before you know bill deberg one of the first
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:04.120]  things they did was talk about the euro and the eu and now that they've got nafta and they've got the
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:07.800]  european union they're bringing these things together that's what these these agreements
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:12.360]  are getting larger and with the us kind of at the central focus we've now got the trans-pacific
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:18.040]  partnership as well as the north atlantic free trade and they merge all three as the trilateral
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:22.760]  commission said yes all three of the super unions together destroy the old sovereignty
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:27.560]  and create 10 mega regions within the three yes because i read that in a book it was written a
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:32.040]  while back that's right that's right two thousand years ago the actual process happening now that
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:37.400]  you've been talking about for decades that's been going on for many decades but we're really getting
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:42.120]  up to it real open corporate world government yeah and he's trying to fast track it to make this happen
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:48.760]  by the end of the year so it's like what another month and the tpp it represents 40 percent of
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:55.960]  the global the world's uh gdp but what obama has initiated even beyond that is the transatlantic
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.520]  trade stay there we gotta talk about this then we're gonna call this important

[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.240]  that of course we first yesterday interviewed the head of the veritas project james oakief here
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:45.800]  that's investigative journalism going to democratic after democratic office of course
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.880]  they're supposed to be 501c3 tax exempt uh nonpartisan groups administering and getting
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:57.080]  money to be the navigators but you show up and it's literal we salute mouse we will get the guns

[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:44.520]  and others so that's all uh coming up i promise i'm going to your phone calls but but but if i
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:52.040]  start ranting it's because i'm marveling at just david night leon macken who's still in studio
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:58.360]  where this really been covering uh these different uh partnerships the the eu the north american union
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:04.680]  spp and the two asian unions all set up by the rockefeller's on record all merging and leon
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:08.280]  you were you were getting into that before the break cut you off getting into these different
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:13.640]  partnerships that just circumvent america congress that is involved isn't allowed to tell the public
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.080]  i mean this is just outrageous it's just like the ns a spying is illegal they just as a government
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:24.120]  and corporate culture they're committing mass crime against us just setting the precedent by
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:29.480]  overwhelming us and i think that's what they're doing uh what do you think they're well finish
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:34.360]  your point leon and i want to ask both of you what do you think the in-game stratagem is here
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:40.600]  i mean do you think it's going well for team tyranny against team humanity well they're
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:49.560]  definitely lambasting us with tyranny and you know just one after the other so it is kind of
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:55.400]  distracting you're like which which debacle do i deal with now so but i the point i wanted to make
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:01.880]  was that the tpp represents all the countries that are involved in the tpp represent more than 40
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:08.120]  percent of the world's gross domestic product but obama has initiated another it's the ttip
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:15.000]  which will cover more than 60 percent of the world's gdp so this is huge so why is it not
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:20.840]  transparent why can't people do no one's talking about this on the news not the mainstream media
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:26.920]  lou dobbs on fox business maybe and that's the thing they literally are talking about the new
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.320]  tallest building in in the us and we think this would be news because this is something that's
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.800]  going to really affect domestic businesses small businesses they're not a part of this
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:41.400]  they're not stakeholders it's simply the multinational corporations you look at obama care
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.720]  and you see how this is people are realizing to some extent that they've been betrayed they've
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:50.760]  been lied to about what's going on with obama care and just like we saw the massive transfer of
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:56.120]  wealth that this guy is apologizing for from the federal reserve banker this obama cares an even
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:01.080]  bigger transfer of wealth than the tarp bailouts were it's a much worse deal for everybody and
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:05.720]  they're starting to realize it because of the website because it's a mandate on them personally
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.280]  it's much more difficult to get people to see these bigger issues it's one of the reasons why
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:15.560]  i think wiki leaks leaked this particular chapter because it deals with medicine and it deals with
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.520]  privacy and the internet people can understand that they're trying to get people to understand that
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:26.280]  other things like offshoring of jobs letting the bankers run free with these derivatives
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.240]  shutting down energy the food labeling issues those are harder to get people involved in but
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.960]  nobody is covering it except for the alternative media what i like to call the authentic media yeah
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:42.680]  what is the term i mean the rebirth of the real media uh non-state run i mean well what do you
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:48.520]  call us i think it's authentic as what i call it because we talk about what we see how about the
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:54.040]  get it right how about the pro-human media yeah about the pro-justice reality media i call us the
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:15:00.360]  reality-based community well you know in terms of authentic when we see something we report it to
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:04.120]  the best of our ability that's what you do you know you don't you don't make us you don't filter
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:09.720]  this we're able to go through and analyze something and talk about it there's not an agenda that we
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:14.440]  have to follow that we can't talk about this and the last thing the media exactly exactly the last
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:19.560]  thing the media the establishment media wants is for us to connect the dots too that's right that's
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:23.160]  right they don't want us to point out this is part of two other agreements all merging them
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:28.920]  together they don't want us to point out that all the money that was given to the congress to sign
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:34.520]  on to this but but congress can't just say we now give our right to make law to this group forever
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:39.240]  but that's what they call it fast track exactly with fast track they got a trade representative
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:43.720]  who goes out there they're going to go a czar exactly they're going to go negotiate this in
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:48.600]  secret they're going to get hit with this 3000 page million word document if the other if the other
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:52.520]  chapters are the same size they're going to have no time to consider it and it's not going to be
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.920]  done like a real treaty it's just going to be a simple majority and it's just going to be a simple
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:01.080]  majority of whoever's there when they if they've got enough to have a quorum we've seen that type
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.920]  of thing happen over and over again that's why they got the federal reserve act passed they did it
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:10.840]  you know the holidays we saw obama sign in the ndaa with indefinite detention on new year's eve
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:15.480]  they do this kind of stuff when people aren't around a fast track it is very subversive but
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:20.280]  the more they try to become secretive about this the more obvious it is to people what they're
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:25.240]  doing even if we don't see the details we know exactly exactly when i'm and again i'm not tooting
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:28.200]  our horn i want to get your take on this again we're going to break and come back with calls
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:34.680]  but we're just a pro-liberty media organization i'm an aggressive you know leader of the
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:39.000]  organization we've got all these great reporters and researchers and folks that send us tips but
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.320]  we're i mean we're not that special other than the fact that we're willing to tell the truth
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:49.880]  and point out that the the elephant in the room and that's what's so crazy about this ish we put
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:54.440]  out a report from a leak document about the police illegally grabbing everybody's dad it's
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:59.640]  clearly illegal just like the google cars were and the police within six seven hours suspended
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:03.480]  because the city council goes you're not supposed to be doing that and the police know that they've
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.720]  committed a crime under homeland security just because the feds told you it was okay and you watch
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:13.560]  shows like 24 where they do illegal stuff this is the real world you know al qaeda works for your
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:19.640]  bosses so the police need to get to their head that they're part of a of a criminal takeover
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:24.760]  but but look at how no state-run media has even covered this it really shows how controlled they
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:30.120]  are you think they'd want to cover this right this is bigger than the snowden stuff this is
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:36.040]  nsa installed paid for snooping arms tracking and grabbing everything you're doing hacking your phone
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.680]  listening to you whenever you're in public it isn't just if you're on the internet it's like
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:44.600]  your microphones cameras they got microphones they got facial recognition they're got voice
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.000]  recognition license plate readers absolutely so this is black boxes in your car and they go now
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.320]  we're gonna start taxing you with it we paid we paid in the price of the car for a mandated box
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:59.160]  that they're gonna tax us with and then we were against it they went don't be a conspiracy theorist
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:04.440]  we won't tax you now they're like we got a man we're gonna tax you i mean these are crooks yeah
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.520]  leon what do you think of all this what do you think how long have you been here because i know
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:12.680]  you already knew about a lot of this stuff you got a journalism degree from ut and so you're
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.400]  already a smart person but being here eight months or so is it eight months seven i mean what has it
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:22.760]  been like for you well at times when you do turn on the mainstream media or something or even just
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:28.200]  things that are going on it can be very discouraging because they really are ramping up the tyranny
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:35.400]  train like everywhere you look it's like geez where does it end where do the tentacles stop but it's
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:42.120]  also because they are just turning it on like really getting it turned up people are waking up
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:47.000]  and it's like the harder they push and from every area that they're getting in and taking our our
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.440]  liberties away it is it's making people wake up all that much faster what does your gut tell you
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:56.040]  is going to happen because we've all had private discussions around here about just leaving the
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:02.040]  country but there's nowhere to run that's right yeah there's nowhere to go because just like the TPP
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.680]  this is this is pushing out the same types of things that they've gotten done that are really bad
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:10.920]  like what they've done with the pharmaceutical companies evergreening for example we're gonna skip
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:15.640]  this break by the way we're gonna skip this break go ahead i was just but you know we we're one of
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:19.880]  only two countries that has any patents on surgical procedures and so now they're going to push this out
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:23.720]  to everywhere so where you're going to run you can't run somewhere else you got to try to fight it
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:29.320]  but it's coming on very quickly there's not much time they've been talking about this for 60 years
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:34.920]  they are implementing it now through the TPP and through tafta and these other mechanisms and they're
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:40.120]  doing it i have fronts a 1937 new york times original somewhere around here i got it from
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:45.160]  um bernadine smith out in california that runs a second amendment group i gotta find that it's
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:49.160]  somewhere around and it's the new york times she actually bought a bunch of them and it's actual
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:54.680]  new york times showing the 10 regions and how it would be part of the 10 global you have 10 global
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:59.240]  mega regions in the world government it says world government and then 10 regions here no more states
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:04.600]  and it's like wow they're still trying to do the same plan but now they've they're doing it yeah
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:09.960]  yeah multi-generational they've had this plan and they're following it through multiple generations
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:14.120]  and we're we're at the very end of the game right now because you know they don't necessarily need
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:18.840]  to do another step as i mentioned they've got both tafta and tpp we're at the center and and for
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:24.520]  folks to know the rural affairs commission with the department of defense of it it's there to shut
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:30.680]  down small farms yes i mean this is a military takeover yes yes i mean i say that over and over
[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:38.200]  again it's it is and i'm it's a systematic scientific shutdown of human society with giant mega
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:44.680]  walmart command bases sucking everything dry putting us on welfare so we can be socially engineered
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:50.120]  i'm hoping that both the left and the right wake up to this the left like occupy a lot of them
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:54.280]  they're looking at this and saying well this is corporations well it's not really just corporations
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:58.120]  i make a distinction between people that are small businesses that operate in a free market
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:03.960]  environment and between large multinational corporations that are the tail wagging the
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:08.840]  dogs of the governments that basically dictate to them the terms that they want they will shut down
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:14.440]  right now they will shut down entire industries and write regulations to do it so they can consolidate
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:21.160]  markets that's criminal absolutely it's it's monopolies exactly leon i just i don't want to
[02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:26.680]  make any predictions about what's going to happen because i i'm i feel like it's just being too
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:32.840]  optimistic and i really become a realist as i've gotten older and it's sad and it's scary because
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:39.080]  they really are clamping down they really are evil yeah and and this this tpp is like the
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:45.880]  globalist wet dream you know what i mean like this is this is huge for them if people if there was
[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:51.480]  ever a time for americans to wake up and people around the world to wake up it's it's right now
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:56.600]  it's right now but it's like the alamo no matter how big the odds you keep your head down and you
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:03.160]  go into it right but that is the issue is is they've already set up the system to start shutting down
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:08.920]  even the old media and so now they're consolidating the old dinosaur media and getting them to where
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:13.720]  they will not report anything they're told i mean i talked to media where they'll see cops
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:17.400]  shoot somebody in the back and the newspaper says you're not going to report that i mean that's
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:21.320]  what's really scary is that we're getting to the point where they're really just going to start
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:27.640]  trying to take people away and then the civil war starts i mean it's just to know that we're
[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:35.240]  literally living in the in in in like 1937 germany i mean we're really going into it well
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:40.440]  that's why Lieberman and and Rockefeller wanted to give obama the internet kill switch because
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:45.080]  they know how by the way that's in place they just want to they want to say it's it's legal go ahead
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:50.520]  well that's what they know how much of an influence we have you know just being on the internet and
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.560]  not being able to go on cnn or whatever like they don't even have an audience they don't
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:23:00.280]  matter we have a huge audience and drudge and bright barton these other organ you know the
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:06.520]  authentic media our voices are being heard people are listening and that scares them and i'll tell
[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:10.280]  you what's going to happen too when the republican puppets get back in the ones they're trying to
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:15.000]  shut down the real libertarian elements the tea party it's not going to work this time glen back
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.880]  is already said i'm not a republican anymore i'm a libertarian because he realizes that's
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:22.520]  where it's all gone and it's the same thing across the board we are winning the intellectual battle
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:27.160]  yes notice our talking points that are based on real research are now becoming the talking
[02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:32.120]  points not because we were even that special but because we were willing to fight until the truth
[02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:38.120]  and i built a platform my audience built a platform you got people like since and brenner who was
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:43.960]  introduced the patriot act he wrote other many other instruments of tyranny he actually suggested
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:49.400]  that journalists be prosecuted under the espionage act in 1917 a year ago but now this last week he
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:55.240]  went to the european union and he's talking trash about the nsa police state so even he sees the
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:24:00.280]  handwriting on the wall but you can't necessarily believe that he's been reformed sure that's why
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:06.040]  kerry kerry saying he doesn't believe oswald acted alone that's right i mean we've won the fight
[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:11.320]  intellectually but the bully doesn't care no he'll lock us up and and i don't think we're
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:14.680]  going to be able to form it at the top i think what it's going to boil down to is going to be
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:19.000]  people refusing to go along with it it's going to be the police standing down just like the
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.160]  east german police refuse to shoot people that were crossing over the wall it's going to be that
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:26.680]  type of thing like stewart roes has talked about like you've talked about it's also going to be
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:31.240]  people standing up in juries and refusing to convict people and send people to jail for these crimes
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:36.360]  let me say this if i wanted to be a big sensation hero as a stunt i would get on an airplane i'd
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:40.200]  fly to seattle with a film crew i'd get up with a step ladder and i'd bash one of those things
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:45.640]  with a baseball bat they would arrest me that's the new rosa parks now i'm not telling the listeners
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:52.120]  to go do that i'm just saying we have the moral authority whoever starts going after these these
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:58.440]  these probe droids these these these that we paid for that are meant to rob our freedom and track us
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:03.720]  i mean imagine i guarantee you there are thousands of folks in seattle listening to us right now
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.880]  what have they just started showing up smashing them with with baseball bats and i'm not calling
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:11.720]  for that i don't agree with the founding fathers that hung up posters against the king they should
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:15.480]  have submitted to the king and i don't agree with rosa parks she should have sat at the back of the
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.440]  bus and shut up i don't think you should stand up against any of this and go out there uh right
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:24.680]  now i mean i mean it's not like i've ever gone or anybody else runners ever gone to billboards
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.800]  around town and climbed up in the night and spray painted them or anything people always think i
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:33.800]  always want to see some action folks i was out taking action this morning because let me tell you
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:40.760]  it feels so good to take physical action and um anyways i'm sorry go ahead well that's that's what
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.440]  it's gonna take it's gonna take people at the grassroots level standing up and doing something
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.680]  because washington is obviously too corrupt and we've got these phony people you can even see
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:53.240]  feinstein coming out and saying that she's she's upset about this come on she's part of this she's
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:57.640]  been on top of this she knows all about it and we've seen headaches from her with the nda before
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:02.920]  there there there's some phony stuff going on up there i don't know any of them that we can trust
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:07.320]  and certainly you've got this massive bureaucracy that just keeps going oh no no no exactly look at
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:12.280]  obama with ndaa he says i'm not going to sign it don't create opposition against it turns out he wrote
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:17.720]  it right then he says oh i won't sign it now that it's passed signs it it's all about betrayal yes
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.880]  and then he gets politically destroyed doesn't matter that was his job they said you're going to
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:26.360]  take the blame you ready then they'll resuscitate him and he'll get the next time there's a flood
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:30.360]  and Haiti he'll get a hundred million dollars and keep it like bill clinton exactly and so both on
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:35.880]  obama care in this tpp hopefully people can see that now with anything else leon last word well
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:42.600]  ran paul had a was saying at a some forum this week that obama actually wrote the part in obama
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.560]  care that takes the people's insurance away from them no no he did see i used to think he was a
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.680]  total puppet now i've done more research because it's leaked he stays up late screwing his own
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:58.280]  people oh yeah like like and and i i'm so different from this that i've never really understood it
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:03.720]  but now i get the mindset cheating people is like the thrill great job guys i'm here to get more
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.960]  articles out with curtain ammo more than out he is with jacari jackson hosting great job leon
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:12.120]  macadoo and david and i keep it up now we're gonna go to break i promise come back and do nothing
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.920]  but take your phone calls ladies and gentlemen uh but listen we are so blessed to be here this is so
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:23.080]  rare so historical the position we're in i have an incredible responsibility and i know as a top
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:29.400]  general in this fight that that i shouldn't be you know out doing the things i'm doing and
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:33.080]  admitting some of the things i do but at this point i'm just gonna be honest people it feels so
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:38.520]  good to take physical action ladies and gentlemen and and that's the only way i can sleep at night
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:45.960]  is if i if if i physically make scenes in stores about vaccines is about physically you know
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:52.280]  defaced propaganda that i paid for i'm sick of the abuse i'm taking my freedom back and and and
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:57.560]  and that's where it's at okay because because people think man that's work you know to climb up on
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:03.400]  something at five a.m i can't help it okay that's the point is that's why i'm still alive it's why
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:09.480]  i have energy is i'm not laying down and dying folks and it's not work to fight tyranny it's like
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:13.720]  saying it's work to breathe it ain't work it's living here that's what i'm telling you we're

[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:14.200]  boy scouts as a kid i'm a cold war fast attack submarine veteran um i'm a official member of
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:21.240]  the nr8 gun owner i'm also a member of the american cold war veterans association so basically
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:27.800]  basically you're a racist uh bad person just in a terrorist yes um i'm also on the president's
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:32.920]  enemy list which you can get through that through breaking obama they got a facebook page
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:41.000]  and a uh website as well i want to i got three things i got a statement a theory and a and a
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:48.680]  suggestion for you there alex and um my statement is this morning breaking obama where you can get
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:55.080]  your official card carrying president's enemy list card from they posted a picture of this very
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:00.600]  attractive woman with a double barrel shotgun walking through a meadow which is turned brown
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:10.040]  because it's false it looks like she's bird hunting but but it says last month 34 times more americans
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:18.120]  registered for a gun license than obama care well that's right and i've seen the statistics
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:24.680]  that it is easier to get accepted at harvard than to be able to get on the obama care exchange
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:29.160]  and that's because they only do it with token people to trot out in front of the folks to think
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:34.120]  that they won the lottery ticket see now getting obama care is like a lottery ticket so even though
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:39.320]  you just get your tiny paycheck cut and you get your your your tax refund taken and your bank
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:45.240]  account garnished it doesn't matter because somebody got it i heard somebody one day saw leprechaun
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:52.280]  and a pot of gold right on yeah i heard that statement you made earlier today i watch and
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:59.960]  listen to you every day i don't miss an episode period um okay my uh that that was my statement

[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:23.960]  just i want to appreciate if you think about this there's two guys on the hill and there and there's
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:29.080]  and with five thousand people and they're sitting on a hill and they're eating fish and bread and
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:33.720]  one comes up to him said let's go on down the hill and we can kill them the 700 soldiers that
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:40.200]  taken jerusalem we can get rid of them romans and jesus said back up jesus you ain't learned yet right
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:45.160]  so so and that's when jesus jesus turned in jesus he was mad he didn't believe in paying taxes
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:51.720]  anybody you know sees a put it you know so so jesus jesus was pissed but even then jesus had remorse
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:57.720]  man it came back and threw the 30 silver pieces down and said uh you know this is blood money out
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:01.960]  of well then the fantasies are blood on your hands man and they bought the potter's field and he went
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:10.040]  out and hung himself but he had remorse man these guys are strong evil luciferian elite
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:15.800]  bags man and they have no remorse or anything about anything that they do and that's what's
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:20.760]  really disgusting and scary as shit about the whole thing i hear you and you're a really good
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:25.640]  caller but i wish you wouldn't use old english that's when the when the french norman took over
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:32.520]  britney um well britney is just a part of french then they took over uh england and and other areas
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:39.240]  proper they outlawed the common tongue so that's why it's seen as dirty and nasty and so how dare
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:44.360]  you use the common tongue but you're absolutely right and look most police i talked to are now awake
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:51.720]  and military again is the most awake group uh and then the police are awake as well because
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:56.120]  they're seeing all this crazy stuff going on the problem is is we've gotten to the point
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:02.440]  where we can't be compliant i myself have gotten so comfortable with tyranny that that i've even
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:08.040]  gotten compliant uh and just expect it now and it's not like i shouldn't have the attitude of
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:11.960]  someday they're going to come just arrest me or kill me in a parking lot and i should just accept it
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:17.480]  and no i mean i've decided i'm not going to just accept that uh and you just man up and let them
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:23.000]  drag me off like some martyr uh you know i'll i'll defend myself and and you know that's people
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.640]  like well that's not anything big that's common sense exactly we need to recognize we didn't ask
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:34.680]  for this fight we didn't look for it we don't want it to happen but many times you know walking home
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:38.440]  from school or whatever there'd be two or three bullies walking down and i could easily turn
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:42.520]  down the street and get home but you know what i would just make the decision by the time i was
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:47.000]  about 11 or 12 you know what i think i'm going to turn and walk on over to the bullies and let's
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:53.320]  just see what happens and those are the best times of my life uh and i found when i was fighting three
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.480]  people i was a lot stronger than i was fighting one person and i found the same thing as i grew up
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:03.080]  in business and life and everything we have the moral high ground we have everything we need to
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.320]  act like it and i mean somebody smarts off at you at a restaurant about something get in their face
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.960]  take over the whole place start talking about the new world order do it in grocery store lines
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:18.200]  uh you know let me tell you something i mean it's time to stop playing games with all these cameras
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:24.200]  and all this other junk i'm done and that's just the way it is the system's criminal and we are
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:30.040]  aiding and abetting it now when we don't non-violently resist it so the civil disobedience folks it's
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:33.800]  time and i'm not going to tell people what they should do or what they should be involved in
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:39.400]  but obviously obviously people can are smart enough to figure out what's going on in their area
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:43.480]  i appreciate your call sir let's talk to jeff in canada jeff you're on the air welcome

[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:03.880]  things that you're uncovering i i kind of scratch my head at times i wrestle with can can this all
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:11.400]  be real um so what you've done there was an article uh some time ago that referenced canada
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.400]  in regards to um in regards to what's happening in our own government here so i'll just quickly
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:23.000]  share it with you and what it led to um it certainly ties into that to the spying that you've been
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:29.720]  covering today on an unprecedented scale in the canadian economic action plan 2013
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:37.240]  info wars ran a story that canada's first uh first remedy to deal with any banking difficulties
[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:43.960]  in canada would be a bail in type system the same thing that happened in cyprus and i thought that
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:48.360]  that can't be true that can't happen in canada in fact give me the headline i remember that like a
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:54.280]  month ago when we'll pull it up what was the headline so um the thing that caught my attention
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:58.920]  hold on i want to get the headline up on screen for folks because you went and checked it out in
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:03.560]  the rabbit hole you found it was much worse than we said but but and i want you to say that in a
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:07.560]  minute i know it's always worse than we can say there's no way to describe something that's bad
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:13.480]  but but hold on one second uh the headline was something like uh canada respond to banking crisis
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:20.440]  with bail in or just type in canada bail in or canada cyprus info wars dot com search it
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:26.200]  i want to show folks the article on screen sorry sorry go ahead so i just thought well that can't
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:32.200]  be true so i looked it up and i got a copy of the canadian economic action plan 2013
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:38.360]  and i started reading at page 140 you actually listed the page numbers in that story and that
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:44.840]  is exactly what it says in the canadian economic action plan 2013 that the the important banks in
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:51.480]  canada if there was any difficulty they would enact as is happening globally um a bail in
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:56.600]  yeah for those that don't know it's kind of the affordable care act costs three or four times what
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:02.840]  it what it did before or the patriot acts unpatriotic or uh national defense authorization
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:08.200]  destroys our defense destroys our liberty we just put the document on on screen for tv viewers
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:13.960]  radio listeners will give them the headline in a moment yes the plan is a direct global tax to
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:19.720]  private mega banks every country yearly whatever they want will be taken out of your bank account
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:24.280]  and then it won't matter if you only try to operate on cash everything will be taken under
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:28.680]  homeland security that they have in every country now that globalist control they will take it directly
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:33.240]  from your employer uh and then they will take the exact amount needed to bankrupt you and your
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:38.360]  family uh because the plan is to totally savage everyone i'm not kidding the plan is make you
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:44.200]  go bankrupt but in fact put the back on screen i'll give the headline to folks cyprus style bail ins
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:50.520]  are proposed in new 2013 canadian government budget and it's actually worse than that they
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:56.200]  say in this that that this is what they're going to do but go ahead as you as you read on so i
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:01.400]  thought well i better read a little bit more here what's going on as you read on in that document
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:09.240]  and get into page uh i believe it's uh 147 48 49 as you read on it mentions and talks about the
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:14.760]  canadian pension plan board the canadian pension plan is one of the largest pension plans in the
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:21.640]  world and they're going to check that out in 2012 it was listed 172 billion dollars so that's a year
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:28.040]  ago well you had to be a canadian to sit on the canadian pension plan board and make a you know
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:33.640]  have the influence of where the investments went nationally and internationally well it appears
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:38.200]  that they're setting the stage to change the rules that foreigners can sit on the canadian
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:43.880]  pension plan board so that we can globally be more informed of what's happening so i think
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:49.080]  canadian canadians even know that they're setting it up that foreigners would make um
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:53.880]  investment decisions for the canadian pension plan well here it is in detroit uh they're
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:58.440]  going to take the pensions and give it to banks says detroit's decision to fend off bankruptcy
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:03.960]  pay pensions or banks and it's all just a fraud yeah no no sir they're going to take everything
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:08.760]  and then when this is all happening if you don't like it they're going to call you a terrorist
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:11.960]  and then they're going to send a paramilitary group of guys that like to kill people to your house
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:17.480]  to burn it down people say really no no that's what they train to do and see the cops will do it
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:22.200]  because somebody's going to blow their police station up you see the the the globalists will
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:28.520]  kill cops and kill military and say you know the liberty group did it and then when the cops go out
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:32.520]  and attack the liberty group they will the feds won't have to blow up police stations anymore
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:37.480]  because there'll be a war we'll start and then it'll be a real fight you see how that works
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:42.120]  i i do alex is that sweet though is that loving and then isn't that friendly

[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:13.080]  and roll over and die why don't you be trending um i'd like to say i take the million dollars
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:17.320]  that you offered to take the shots that i could use that money but i'm scared to do that well
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:23.000]  here's morgan didn't take the million dollars to take a thousand shots either so here's this here's

[02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:39.720]  treaty threatens internet freedom and that's a great headline but it's not one tenth as bad as it
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:45.720]  should be but i'm not criticizing nemo coming up with that headline i can't think of one that
[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:52.280]  describes how truly horrible it is and we've actually read the documents that no one's allowed
[02:54:52.280 --> 02:55:00.920]  to see that wiki leaks just put out and it just in it's just it's the sky's the limit why not i mean
