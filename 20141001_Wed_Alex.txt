[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:34.620]  Texas Alex Jones it's Wednesday October 1st 2014 this is the Alex Jones show live
[00:34.620 --> 00:39.900]  I'm your fill-in host Paul Joseph Watson but Alex will be joining us at 10 past the
[00:39.900 --> 00:44.060]  hour because of course we've got huge breaking news regarding Ebola the
[00:44.060 --> 00:48.860]  unprecedented first outbreak in the United States we've also got Joe Big's
[00:48.860 --> 00:54.060]  reporting live from the scene ground zero at the Texas hospital with a
[00:54.060 --> 00:58.340]  special report there with Josh Owens that he's filmed today also Gerald Salente
[00:58.340 --> 01:02.620]  coming up in the third hour to talk about latest financial situation and
[01:02.620 --> 01:08.100]  Bitcoin we've got callers coming up on Ebola in the second hour as well of
[01:08.100 --> 01:12.340]  course the latest news is that now they're saying there is likely a second
[01:12.340 --> 01:16.860]  patient infected with Ebola we've had officials give interviews on Texas
[01:16.860 --> 01:20.740]  television this morning saying that one of the family members of the Ebola
[01:20.740 --> 01:26.580]  victim who was confirmed as having the virus yesterday in Dallas has also
[01:26.580 --> 01:30.140]  likely been exposed that's not being confirmed yet but they're now saying
[01:30.140 --> 01:35.060]  that it is indeed possible that a second family member has been exposed to the
[01:35.060 --> 01:39.460]  Ebola virus basically the timeline which we need to go through is that the
[01:39.460 --> 01:43.420]  patient arrived in Dallas and a flight from Liberia on September the 20th
[01:43.420 --> 01:47.740]  showing no symptoms of the disease obviously we know that it could take up
[01:47.740 --> 01:51.900]  to three weeks for the symptoms to actually develop to actually show in the
[01:51.900 --> 01:58.420]  case of an Ebola sufferer he started feeling sick September 24th visited his
[01:58.420 --> 02:03.980]  doctor or a hospital we're not sure which yet on September 26 and this is the
[02:03.980 --> 02:08.140]  key here this is what's amazing about this story he was given antibiotics on
[02:08.140 --> 02:15.220]  September 26 after showing symptoms for two days and immediately sent home even
[02:15.220 --> 02:19.540]  though he had traveled from Liberia and this is what's causing a lot of
[02:19.540 --> 02:24.500]  condemnation directed towards health officials in Texas this morning which
[02:24.500 --> 02:29.220]  is the fact that this individual had the symptoms had Ebola for two days he was
[02:29.220 --> 02:34.220]  sent home basically he was walking amongst the population for four days
[02:34.220 --> 02:39.380]  with this virus and now you see the article up on info wars.com Texas
[02:39.380 --> 02:43.860]  Ebola patient was sent home for two days with antibiotics so he already had the
[02:43.860 --> 02:48.340]  virus two days before that he's been walking around Dallas Texas for four
[02:48.340 --> 02:54.100]  days obviously Ebola they say at the moment is not airborne other scientific
[02:54.100 --> 02:59.220]  research suggests that it may well be but for at least four days he was active
[02:59.220 --> 03:04.820]  in the Dallas area amongst the community amongst his family members and again
[03:04.820 --> 03:08.620]  CDC concerned about airborne transmission of Ebola virus of course we had the
[03:08.620 --> 03:14.420]  Canadian study back in 2012 which proved that Ebola could be transmitted via the
[03:14.420 --> 03:19.460]  air from pigs to monkeys we've had several top officials go public over the
[03:19.460 --> 03:22.820]  last few weeks including a major editorial in the New York Times saying
[03:22.820 --> 03:27.140]  that health officials are concerned that it could have mutated that it could have
[03:27.140 --> 03:32.980]  gone airborne no confirmation of that so far but it's obviously of concern we're
[03:32.980 --> 03:36.780]  gonna play some clips coming up we've got Zachari Thompson the director of
[03:36.780 --> 03:41.260]  Dallas County Health and Human Services who gave an interview with WFAA this
[03:41.260 --> 03:46.220]  morning confirming or basically suggesting indicating that there was a
[03:46.220 --> 03:50.700]  second Ebola case one of the family members of the victim that's there in
[03:50.700 --> 03:56.340]  the Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas also Sanjay Gupta doctor Sanjay
[03:56.340 --> 04:00.020]  Gupta gave an interview on CNN which we're gonna play a little later if we
[04:00.020 --> 04:06.020]  have time which in which he said the four-day period where this Ebola patient
[04:06.020 --> 04:11.620]  was walking around Dallas was quote a significant period of time and he made
[04:11.620 --> 04:15.580]  the point that although this is transmitted via bodily fluids it could
[04:15.580 --> 04:20.580]  be transmitted merely by shaking the hand of an Ebola victim so you got to
[04:20.580 --> 04:24.700]  think you know this this guy's been walking around Texas Dallas for four
[04:24.700 --> 04:30.300]  days without being isolated as I said September 24th was when he first showed
[04:30.300 --> 04:34.460]  symptoms he was walking around Dallas and so that's why there are
[04:34.460 --> 04:38.420]  concerns that this could spread of course the CDC is trying to dampen down
[04:38.420 --> 04:42.700]  the hysteria we'll be back with Alex Jones after the break this is the Alex

[08:27.580 --> 08:30.860]  this Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones show of course we've got the huge
[08:30.860 --> 08:35.980]  breaking Ebola news it emerged last night that a first Ebola patient confirmed
[08:35.980 --> 08:40.700]  to have the virus in the United States in Dallas we're gonna go to a clip now
[08:40.700 --> 08:46.100]  which is the likelihood that a second patient has been infected one of the
[08:46.100 --> 08:50.500]  family members of this individual in Dallas and this is Zachari Thompson
[08:50.500 --> 08:54.220]  director of Dallas County Health and Human Services he gave an interview with
[08:54.220 --> 09:00.260]  WFAA and he said that there's likely to be a second case here's that clip and
[09:00.260 --> 09:03.860]  this is the Dallas address he was at as a parent a lot of parents want to know
[09:03.860 --> 09:08.060]  these children are they going to school are you going to be talking with the
[09:08.060 --> 09:12.220]  schools about how to handle this that's priority number one in our meeting this
[09:12.220 --> 09:17.540]  morning is to ensure we've already dialogue with the ISD and so the
[09:17.540 --> 09:22.020]  precaution is to keep the children home and we will evaluate and they will be
[09:22.020 --> 09:25.700]  monitored let me be real frank to the Dallas County residents the fact that
[09:25.700 --> 09:30.140]  we have one confirmed case there may be another case that is a close
[09:30.140 --> 09:35.100]  associate with this fact with this particular patient so I want to be frank
[09:35.100 --> 09:39.340]  this is this is real there should be a concern but it's contained to the
[09:39.340 --> 09:42.900]  specific family members and close friends at this moment all right we
[09:42.900 --> 09:47.740]  certainly appreciate your time okay that is Zachari Thompson Health and Human
[09:47.740 --> 09:51.380]  Services official who basically acknowledged the fact that it's very
[09:51.380 --> 09:55.540]  likely there's a second Ebola case one of the family members of the victims but
[09:55.540 --> 10:00.340]  live on the line now with more breaking Ebola news is Alex Jones Alex
[10:00.340 --> 10:05.300]  welcome to the show absolutely Paul now I've been explaining to people from the
[10:05.300 --> 10:10.940]  beginning that I've seen major signs of scripting to all of this when I say
[10:10.940 --> 10:15.220]  scripting I don't mean the Dallas County or Dallas City officials I don't
[10:15.220 --> 10:21.660]  mean 99.9% people our own government but major scripting at the CDC at the
[10:21.660 --> 10:25.980]  Obama administration level and at the United Nations level we've been saying
[10:25.980 --> 10:32.460]  this for several months it is unprecedented to bring dozens and
[10:32.460 --> 10:41.660]  dozens of hot infected patient number one ground zero Ebola victims into the
[10:41.660 --> 10:45.860]  United States it used to show up in three days it shows up in 22 days now
[10:45.860 --> 10:52.900]  meaning someone can spread and spread and spread the default was it was a
[10:52.900 --> 10:57.420]  level four containment illegal and then those laws are still in the books to
[10:57.420 --> 11:03.860]  bring someone with smallpox or Ebola or anything of that nature into the United
[11:03.860 --> 11:09.340]  States US citizens were to be held in quarantine on Navy ships special medical
[11:09.340 --> 11:13.740]  ships that they have and other facilities they have in places in
[11:13.740 --> 11:17.980]  Sierra Leone other areas this is unprecedented we have top urologists in
[11:17.980 --> 11:23.180]  build in Germany saying five million we'll get it by December the UN says
[11:23.180 --> 11:29.220]  1.4 million most top urologists say it's beginning to go slightly airborne that
[11:29.220 --> 11:34.460]  means it isn't hardy airborne but it is clearly leaning towards being somewhat
[11:34.460 --> 11:38.940]  airborne if that is the case and that's why we're seeing this huge outbreak in
[11:38.940 --> 11:44.100]  Africa you've got seven nations now with it over in Africa you have got tens of
[11:44.100 --> 11:48.220]  thousands of people a week flying in and out of West Africa into every major
[11:48.220 --> 11:54.340]  city in the world and there should have already been a quarantine on Sierra Leone
[11:54.340 --> 11:59.620]  and a quarantine on Ghana and a quarantine on these other countries that
[11:59.620 --> 12:05.100]  was standard procedure it is a guarantee that you will get Ebola all over the
[12:05.100 --> 12:11.260]  world guaranteed with a 22-day carrier incubation period we talked top medical
[12:11.260 --> 12:14.700]  doctors on this so this is not my opinion that's why we kept saying this
[12:14.700 --> 12:19.320]  this is this is insane there should have been an immediate embargo those
[12:19.320 --> 12:24.660]  countries Sierra Leone and others are literally collapsing right now but
[12:24.660 --> 12:29.500]  they're letting the airport still run as middle-class and wealthy Africans and
[12:29.500 --> 12:37.260]  Westerners flee the nation then Obama injects 3,300 untrained US troops into
[12:37.260 --> 12:42.380]  the middle of hell hot zones we kept telling people months ago got attacked
[12:42.380 --> 12:44.700]  by the mainstream media because they didn't want people to be warmed up front
[12:44.700 --> 12:49.940]  this had all the telltale signs of bare minimum allowing a crisis to get out of
[12:49.940 --> 12:54.940]  hand aiding and abetting it not letting a good crisis go to waste but we know
[12:54.940 --> 12:58.620]  there's laboratories in the US England Africa other areas that have souped up
[12:58.620 --> 13:04.460]  Ebola we've played frontline pieces nova pieces admitting airborne Ebola escaped
[13:04.460 --> 13:10.540]  and killed monkeys in another lab in 1989 see we're informed and the system
[13:10.540 --> 13:15.340]  preys on the American people's ignorance to say oh don't listen to info wars
[13:15.340 --> 13:19.180]  don't listen to drudge don't listen to world net daily don't listen to those
[13:19.180 --> 13:22.380]  crazy people that actually have top scientists and medical doctors and
[13:22.380 --> 13:27.460]  virologists on oh look info wars is reporting on CDC medical journals two
[13:27.460 --> 13:31.820]  years ago saying Ebola had gone airborne we got attacked a month later
[13:31.820 --> 13:34.620]  New York Times admitted they believe it's going airborne with the top
[13:34.620 --> 13:40.740]  virologist the issue here is that I'm in Austin Texas literally two three hours
[13:40.740 --> 13:45.020]  from Dallas Joe Biggs is up there outside the hospital area where Rick
[13:45.020 --> 13:49.500]  Perry set to give a press conference at T-minus 45 minutes or so about 47
[13:49.500 --> 13:55.100]  minutes from now this is very serious because you have a huge Nigerian
[13:55.100 --> 14:02.620]  population huge West African population in Dallas and again it is it's so
[14:02.620 --> 14:07.660]  politically correct that you've got the emergency managers in Dallas County
[14:07.660 --> 14:11.860]  openly saying well we're still gonna tell the kids to stay home with this guy
[14:11.860 --> 14:17.660]  but everything's okay that entire family ladies and gentlemen should be locked
[14:17.660 --> 14:22.820]  up in a quarantine facility watching television and having a nice day so an
[14:22.820 --> 14:26.860]  epidemic doesn't get out of hand you get one person giving it to five they give
[14:26.860 --> 14:31.140]  it to 10 they give it to 20 they give it to 40 they give it to 80 they give it to
[14:31.140 --> 14:35.620]  100 and you see the numbers going up once you get about 10 or 15 people that
[14:35.620 --> 14:40.020]  have this it's going to be unstoppable and you're going to have tens of
[14:40.020 --> 14:44.460]  thousands hundreds of thousands maybe millions maybe billions of people with
[14:44.460 --> 14:49.860]  Ebola and on record I wanted on record that we pointed this out it's not hard
[14:49.860 --> 14:54.740]  to point this out this is default this is default that the minute there was a
[14:54.740 --> 14:59.140]  major outbreak you you shut down the aircraft coming in or you make people
[14:59.140 --> 15:02.380]  sign a form that they will go on aircraft that everybody has been
[15:02.380 --> 15:06.820]  quarantined for at least a month once they get off of it instead we knew the
[15:06.820 --> 15:10.580]  fix was in so they would have plausible deniability a month ago when they
[15:10.580 --> 15:14.260]  started flying all these medical workers in with Ebola and putting them in
[15:14.260 --> 15:19.180]  regular hospitals that aren't even level 2 level 3 containment ladies and
[15:19.180 --> 15:23.940]  gentlemen that violates federal law this is a disaster they want to use this to
[15:23.940 --> 15:27.420]  roll out more homeland security I think this is the end of the world no I
[15:27.420 --> 15:31.260]  predicted they're going to have phases listeners you've heard this hundreds of
[15:31.260 --> 15:36.940]  times phases of bio releases souped up bio weapon releases to train us to go
[15:36.940 --> 15:42.100]  under medical tyranny to train us to go under force inoculation so when they
[15:42.100 --> 15:45.940]  really released the deadly airborne Ebola or mouse pox down the road to wipe
[15:45.940 --> 15:50.580]  out 90% of the population all our 12 monkeys the people will do what they're
[15:50.580 --> 15:54.700]  told believing that they were protected by the government in the first few
[15:54.700 --> 16:00.180]  big outbreaks this is directly directly out of the globalist script
[16:00.180 --> 16:04.420]  ladies and gentlemen directly out of the prevent data this is how you conquer
[16:04.420 --> 16:08.420]  America and conquer the world this is how you get the guns this is how you
[16:08.420 --> 16:12.660]  bring in the tyranny if you bring in terrorists you notice how Texas under
[16:12.660 --> 16:15.620]  attack everyone's fleeing the rest of the country to come to Texas they have
[16:15.620 --> 16:19.180]  lower taxes and are libertarian conservative the border is wide open and
[16:19.180 --> 16:23.740]  they've targeted bringing in the buses Texas they've targeted Texas with all
[16:23.740 --> 16:27.700]  their different programs now Texas is where the Ebola is popping up you can
[16:27.700 --> 16:32.340]  just see all of this going on the ladies and gentlemen and now Paul Watson
[16:32.340 --> 16:36.540]  comes to visit the US the first time he's visited me here in nine years or
[16:36.540 --> 16:43.860]  eight years and now you're here in Texas Paul Watson 200 miles from Ebola which
[16:43.860 --> 16:48.420]  they're very calmly saying oh yes more the family probably has it it's no big
[16:48.420 --> 16:52.140]  deal it's like getting a cold or something no ladies and gentlemen this
[16:52.140 --> 16:57.540]  is very slowly the so-called US government the same ones that funded
[16:57.540 --> 17:02.940]  al-Qaeda and ISIS have now allowed dozens and dozens of people in with Ebola
[17:02.940 --> 17:08.380]  and did no screening at the airports for people coming in out of West Africa with
[17:08.380 --> 17:15.060]  with scientists saying 1.4 million with computer models are set to get it on
[17:15.060 --> 17:20.660]  the low end five million now on the high end that's by December we're talking
[17:20.660 --> 17:24.740]  about when they usually panic when 20 people have Ebola the previous top
[17:24.740 --> 17:28.580]  outbreaks for a couple hundred we're talking about countries collapsing right
[17:28.580 --> 17:32.740]  now as people are hanging basically off the aircraft to fly here and our
[17:32.740 --> 17:37.060]  government's going to come on in so the bottom line is the government whatever's
[17:37.060 --> 17:41.460]  behind this cannot and will not protect you you've got to protect yourselves and
[17:41.460 --> 17:46.300]  it is so disgusting like a slow-motion automobile accident to be seeing this
[17:46.300 --> 17:50.860]  unfold right now folks better be hitting their knees and praying to God because
[17:50.860 --> 17:55.900]  if this Ebola gets out and if it spreads with our compromised immune systems
[17:55.900 --> 17:59.260]  here in the United States all the vaccines of people been taken and if it
[17:59.260 --> 18:01.900]  starts mutating with other things that are going on right now all the other
[18:01.900 --> 18:06.220]  mystery illnesses sweeping the country of kids that have been vaccinated you can
[18:06.220 --> 18:11.340]  see with dr. Pionka a top eugenicist saying eight years ago that soon the
[18:11.340 --> 18:17.100]  airborne Ebola is coming and will kill 90% and 95% standing ovation at the Texas
[18:17.100 --> 18:22.820]  Academy of Sciences with people crying with joy as he projected a huge screen
[18:22.820 --> 18:27.140]  of red skulls on the wall this is making news folks look it up the FBI when
[18:27.140 --> 18:31.180]  talked about it and they began crying in their death cult of victory this is a
[18:31.180 --> 18:35.980]  death cult they're listening in Austin right now at University of Texas they
[18:35.980 --> 18:39.980]  are the most sick people you could ever imagine and I've been warning you my
[18:39.980 --> 18:45.100]  film in game warns you that they are all over Ebola the globalists have been
[18:45.100 --> 18:49.820]  messing with it screwing around with it constantly this is one of their main
[18:49.820 --> 18:55.580]  arsenal weapons so is mousepox kills 90 plus percent of people and again I don't
[18:55.580 --> 19:01.620]  think this is the big one I don't think this is the big one but it could be I
[19:01.620 --> 19:05.420]  believe it's just a primer Paul Watson what do you think well what I've noticed
[19:05.420 --> 19:09.860]  is Alex is this kind of simpering and patronizing tone from the media this

[19:13.060 --> 19:17.300]  to panic telling people that this hysteria this this outbreak is going to
[19:17.300 --> 19:21.540]  be limited when they're the ones who attacked us for warning about it you
[19:21.540 --> 19:26.940]  know one two months ago CBS News put out a big hit piece against us they dropped
[19:26.940 --> 19:30.500]  the ball I mean this patient was walking around in Dallas for four days they

[24:18.140 --> 24:22.620]  we're back on the Alex Jones show this Wednesday October 1st edition with me
[24:22.620 --> 24:27.900]  Paul Joseph Watson talking to Alex Jones Reuters just reported experts
[24:27.900 --> 24:33.340]  question two-day delay in admitting Texas Ebola patient so as I said before
[24:33.340 --> 24:37.580]  the break this guy was basically walking around Dallas for four days he
[24:37.580 --> 24:42.060]  got antibiotics two days before they isolated him so he went in to get
[24:42.060 --> 24:47.300]  treatment they asked no questions whatsoever of his travel history which
[24:47.300 --> 24:51.580]  numerous health professionals are questioning this morning and we also
[24:51.580 --> 24:56.620]  have an article out of info wars dot com actually UN says Ebola outbreak worse
[24:56.620 --> 25:02.020]  than HIV SARS this is David Nabar over heads up the United Nations Ebola
[25:02.020 --> 25:06.260]  response told the Sydney Morning Herald that Ebola is the scariest disease he
[25:06.260 --> 25:10.780]  has ever encountered during his career I can remember in Africa early on in HIV
[25:10.780 --> 25:14.660]  thinking this is unspeakably awful situation but it will not decimate the
[25:14.660 --> 25:20.820]  population so he's now saying that this could be worse than HIV for Africa which
[25:20.820 --> 25:24.500]  has obviously killed millions and millions of people we had the top
[25:24.500 --> 25:28.460]  German virologist a couple of weeks ago saying that Ebola basically could burn
[25:28.460 --> 25:33.540]  itself out in West Africa Liberia Sierra Leone and not stop until it's
[25:33.540 --> 25:39.340]  claimed basically all of the population Alex Jones more comments on this
[25:39.340 --> 25:43.220]  breaking Ebola news I mean the question that I've got Alex is that British
[25:43.220 --> 25:48.100]  Airways stopped all the flights from West Africa going into Britain and yet the
[25:48.100 --> 25:54.060]  United States basically did nothing look it's because the globalists are
[25:54.060 --> 25:57.340]  clearly behind this or it's like a wildfires coming and they were the
[25:57.340 --> 26:00.260]  firefighters to stand down because they want to destroy a neighborhood build
[26:00.260 --> 26:05.860]  condos on it either way the government is behind this either way the defaults in
[26:05.860 --> 26:10.300]  any emergency manager listening any hazmat person listening any CDC person
[26:10.300 --> 26:14.140]  listening any health department person listening any medical doctor listening
[26:14.140 --> 26:18.100]  any nurse listening anyone who's informed and I want to get some articles out
[26:18.100 --> 26:22.540]  about this you're showing the previous defaults you do what France did you do
[26:22.540 --> 26:25.500]  what England did you do what others do you did you do what Saudi Arabia did a
[26:25.500 --> 26:29.380]  month and a half ago when they had an Ebola patient show up you shut the
[26:29.380 --> 26:34.420]  flights down or you warn people there's gonna be a major fee associated with
[26:34.420 --> 26:37.700]  this you're gonna have to pay for it we're gonna put you in quarantine for a
[26:37.700 --> 26:42.980]  month this is the default and then meanwhile while there's Ebola outbreaks
[26:42.980 --> 26:46.340]  going on the border is wide open and herald over there it comes out and
[26:46.340 --> 26:51.060]  attacks Matt Drudge and says how dare you say Ebola could come into the US
[26:51.060 --> 26:54.860]  well guess what herald oh and again herald says he's a listener I've been
[26:54.860 --> 26:58.060]  on there so many times he's been on ours I don't want to attack him but he's a
[26:58.060 --> 27:03.140]  full of bull we were not being racist against his panics because we pointed
[27:03.140 --> 27:06.460]  out it's insane to have wide open borders we were pointing it out because it
[27:06.460 --> 27:10.380]  shows how the government he just is literally out of control and this is
[27:10.380 --> 27:15.300]  why this is happening until about 20 years ago if government screwed up
[27:15.300 --> 27:20.060]  people got fired and that's been the way it's always been okay if a Roman
[27:20.060 --> 27:24.060]  general lost a battle he got fired or executed okay if a captain did something
[27:24.060 --> 27:27.180]  wrong they got in trouble if a centurion got in trouble this is thousands years
[27:27.180 --> 27:30.820]  old when they grew up in Katrina and order a stand down feeling it's double
[27:30.820 --> 27:35.380]  the funding it's take the guns on 9-11 when Nora stands down and the NSA
[27:35.380 --> 27:40.460]  spawn on everybody they get five times the findings or even more since then for
[27:40.460 --> 27:44.940]  different federal departments and the police state bureaucracy so no one gets
[27:44.940 --> 27:48.620]  in trouble so they'll get a bunch of power and control and the military
[27:48.620 --> 27:53.100]  industrial complex medical center and obama care will come in with the federal
[27:53.100 --> 27:57.220]  emergency and declare their big victory and use this crisis under clowered
[27:57.220 --> 28:00.580]  and pivoted to further bankrupt the nation they've been shutting down our
[28:00.580 --> 28:05.180]  power plant shutting down our industry putting the highest tax rates in to
[28:05.180 --> 28:10.540]  drive people overseas this is another attempt like Godzilla attacking Tokyo to
[28:10.540 --> 28:17.260]  destroy America while sucking us dry it is a premeditated plan to bring down
[28:17.260 --> 28:22.780]  the country the globalists are following agenda 21 clowered and pivoted as
[28:22.780 --> 28:27.580]  only one small sociological example of their plan I mentioned it because people
[28:27.580 --> 28:31.620]  know what clowered and pivoted is bottom line there is zero debate no one can
[28:31.620 --> 28:35.300]  debate me I challenge people to debate me I challenge folks to call in the next
[28:35.300 --> 28:38.820]  hour when David Knight is giving analysis and co-hosting with you at
[28:38.820 --> 28:44.900]  editorial salent a challenge somebody to try to call in here and tell us how they
[28:44.900 --> 28:48.100]  didn't either cook it up and let it come in here or how they didn't order a
[28:48.100 --> 28:52.740]  stand down to let it come in here they did it and I want Rick Perry to be asked
[28:52.740 --> 28:57.580]  by the press conference are you are you gonna challenge Obama to shut down the
[28:57.580 --> 29:00.820]  flight side of West Africa that's what Rick Perry needs to be asked by the media
[29:00.820 --> 29:05.100]  I guarantee you nobody is gonna bring that up that's a governor's job he hit
[29:05.100 --> 29:09.900]  with Ebola he's just saying to the president Mr. President order flights out
[29:09.900 --> 29:13.580]  of West Africa shut down now and people that have bounced in from other
[29:13.580 --> 29:20.900]  countries with a West African original epicenter where they came from if
[29:20.900 --> 29:24.540]  they're originating out of West Africa they need to be put on quarantine and
[29:24.540 --> 29:26.980]  if you're coming to America you're gonna be quarantined because here's the
[29:26.980 --> 29:30.620]  problem once they let it get out of hand they're gonna start quarantining
[29:30.620 --> 29:34.260]  everybody with Obama's executive order claiming if you have any respiratory
[29:34.260 --> 29:38.060]  illness you can be locked up forever which they've never done before that was
[29:38.060 --> 29:42.420]  two months ago we said folks get ready now a respiratory thing has popped up

[33:11.700 --> 33:29.260]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind
[33:29.260 --> 33:34.780]  we're live on the Alex Jones show this Wednesday October the first 2014 talking
[33:34.780 --> 33:39.260]  about the breaking Ebola news Alex Jones is still on the line we're still
[33:39.260 --> 33:44.100]  waiting to connect with Joe Biggs who is live on the scene in Dallas we've got
[33:44.100 --> 33:47.580]  Governor Rick Perry coming up with the press conference and we're basically
[33:47.580 --> 33:52.740]  urging both Perry and our listeners to call the White House and urge them to
[33:52.740 --> 33:58.980]  cease all flights from West Africa into the United States British Airways this
[33:58.980 --> 34:03.620]  is an article from back in August August 27th out of the Daily Mail British
[34:03.620 --> 34:07.340]  Airways halts flights to Ebola hit Sierra Leone and Liberia for the rest of the
[34:07.340 --> 34:12.980]  year and it's not only Britain that did that over a month ago Air France did the
[34:12.980 --> 34:17.460]  same Emirates the huge airline company out of the United Arab Emirates also
[34:17.460 --> 34:23.700]  halted flights into the country from these Ebola hit countries yet now for
[34:23.700 --> 34:28.060]  more than a month the United States failed to do so we have the first Ebola
[34:28.060 --> 34:32.780]  patient now almost confirmation I think it actually has been confirmed or at
[34:32.780 --> 34:37.300]  least the likelihood of a second Ebola victim one of the family members of the
[34:37.300 --> 34:41.020]  individual that's there in the Texas Presbyterian Hospital at which we've
[34:41.020 --> 34:46.060]  got our reporters live on the scene but Alex we're putting out the call both for
[34:46.060 --> 34:50.740]  the for our listeners and for the media to urge the White House to order this
[34:50.740 --> 34:55.300]  cancellation of flights from West Africa because we've seen in an article from
[34:55.300 --> 34:59.580]  defense one this morning which is upon the drudge report there's really no way
[34:59.580 --> 35:03.740]  to screen for Ebola at airports of course we know it's got a three week
[35:03.740 --> 35:08.420]  period where somebody could show no symptoms whatsoever and the temperature
[35:08.420 --> 35:12.260]  scans that people could go through at the airports are basically completely
[35:12.260 --> 35:17.380]  useless it's admitted in this article they didn't work back in 2009 for the
[35:17.380 --> 35:21.300]  swine flu outbreak they're not going to work with Ebola so the only solution it
[35:21.300 --> 35:25.700]  seems is to stop those flights coming in Alex well that's right Paul you're
[35:25.700 --> 35:32.140]  absolutely correct and again our media is so lapdog so controlled so insane so
[35:32.140 --> 35:35.980]  pathetic that when we pointed out a month ago we should cease flights they
[35:35.980 --> 35:40.180]  attacked us in publications everywhere this is what they do because they want
[35:40.180 --> 35:44.660]  to get it in the country get the crisis going use it as a power grab use it as a
[35:44.660 --> 35:48.500]  destabilization program and then the feds and the globalist can again play the
[35:48.500 --> 35:53.860]  part of the saviors this is a classic divide and conquer order out of chaos a
[35:53.860 --> 35:59.340]  galleon dialectic program and there's no debating it and so we need to get the
[35:59.340 --> 36:02.580]  phone number to the White House out just so they know we know we need to get the
[36:02.580 --> 36:05.780]  number out to Rick Perry's office we've got our reporters there on the ground
[36:05.780 --> 36:08.980]  with their mic up on the stand they're gonna get a question into Perry and
[36:08.980 --> 36:11.980]  Dallas coming up at the start of the next hour I don't care what break it is
[36:11.980 --> 36:15.820]  we skip it once Perry starts speaking and going to those questions because this
[36:15.820 --> 36:20.380]  is so important and it's not just because this is in Texas but I was saying
[36:20.380 --> 36:25.340]  you know shut down the flights long before hit my state and my hometown this
[36:25.340 --> 36:30.460]  is a serious situation to say the least because if we don't get this contained
[36:30.460 --> 36:34.700]  they will use it to take so much control and it could really start spreading and
[36:34.700 --> 36:38.940]  of course undoubtedly if he was here for four days sick with Ebola walking around
[36:38.940 --> 36:43.300]  around his family and so many others I bet money that he's already given it to
[36:43.300 --> 36:46.780]  other people you know you said that last time the special report that you
[36:46.780 --> 36:49.820]  doubt a little probably spread it now they're gonna spread it to other people
[36:49.820 --> 36:54.540]  and now thanks a lot federal government thanks a lot for doing what you do so
[36:54.540 --> 36:59.820]  great you know you're not like he for several and 24 you're a bunch of folks
[36:59.820 --> 37:04.140]  that burn down the business and collect the insurance money and I'll guarantee
[37:04.140 --> 37:06.940]  you a lot of people who've gone along with this system are gonna have their
[37:06.940 --> 37:11.420]  families affected by this one way or another economically or physically by
[37:11.420 --> 37:16.380]  the crisis this is going to create there's still a chance of maybe to turn
[37:16.380 --> 37:20.260]  this around if they shut down more flights as it spreads exponentially
[37:20.260 --> 37:23.820]  around Africa I mean you've got you know hundreds of thousands of people now
[37:23.820 --> 37:27.460]  with it they say it's gonna be millions and I guess we're just gonna let the
[37:27.460 --> 37:30.420]  millions of people that are able to flee come here I mean hell they say
[37:30.420 --> 37:33.740]  anywhere you are in the world come here we'll pay for everything why not an
[37:33.740 --> 37:37.860]  ounce for you it's politically correct if you have Ebola come here we'll put
[37:37.860 --> 37:42.060]  you you know in a school next to some American kids I mean that's how over the
[37:42.060 --> 37:45.980]  top two plus two equals five is and you didn't build your business and
[37:45.980 --> 37:51.220]  Obamacare is free and all this other bull is and no other nation would act
[37:51.220 --> 37:54.780]  like to survive like this we knew the fix was in when they started shipping up
[37:54.780 --> 37:58.860]  all the patients into the US we knew the fix was in when they didn't shut down
[37:58.860 --> 38:03.380]  the flights or didn't even try to screen people we knew the fix was in and now the
[38:03.380 --> 38:08.780]  hospitals won't even ask somebody who's sick coming in from West Africa from
[38:08.780 --> 38:14.020]  Nigeria hey were you around people with Ebola this is ridiculous this is what
[38:14.020 --> 38:18.860]  America is trained to lay down trained to have no instincts and by the way it's
[38:18.860 --> 38:22.580]  not fear-mongering to warn people if you see smoke coming out of your neighbor's
[38:22.580 --> 38:26.940]  roof if you see smoke coming out of your neighbor's roof and you don't see them
[38:26.940 --> 38:30.540]  awake you go when you bang on the door Bob you know you'll Carol or whatever
[38:30.540 --> 38:34.100]  their names are get out here your house on fire you call the fire department
[38:34.100 --> 38:38.540]  that's taking action well our government saw 50-foot flames shooting out and they
[38:38.540 --> 38:42.380]  were gasoline thrown on it and then now they're gonna show up once it's burned
[38:42.380 --> 38:46.460]  down and do a press conference on the ashes with a bullhorn talking about how
[38:46.460 --> 38:51.020]  America came together at Homeland Security and Obamacare you know help
[38:51.020 --> 38:54.060]  with the hundreds of thousands of Americans that got Ebola these are the
[38:54.060 --> 38:59.060]  type of scenarios we're facing because the globalists are launching global
[38:59.060 --> 39:03.380]  destabilization plans and you believe me they're not gonna stop here if they're
[39:03.380 --> 39:07.260]  if they're crazy enough they can get away with bringing in Ebola patients that
[39:07.260 --> 39:11.500]  letting people fly in from Africa or poor countries are collapsing while
[39:11.500 --> 39:15.020]  everybody else is controlling this if they're gonna do that here they're gonna
[39:15.020 --> 39:22.180]  do everything else Katie are the door Katie bar the door they are just he's
[39:22.180 --> 39:25.420]  gonna sign executive orders to take the guns he's gonna sign executive orders to
[39:25.420 --> 39:28.340]  end the borders completely they're gonna sign executive order shut down all the
[39:28.340 --> 39:31.140]  power plants they're gonna they're gonna do and if you don't like an armored
[39:31.140 --> 39:34.420]  vehicles coming to your house well okay fine those cops are gonna have their
[39:34.420 --> 39:38.700]  kids die from Ebola too so everybody go ahead it's a suicide pack do whatever
[39:38.700 --> 39:42.900]  the new order says run by a bunch of banks and rob this blind and hate our
[39:42.900 --> 39:46.900]  guts let's just submit to them and do whatever they say and let them set up
[39:46.900 --> 39:50.340]  random checkpoints on the highway and have the government listen to our phones
[39:50.340 --> 39:55.340]  of the tea party and harass pro-wifers but we can't check people coming in from
[39:55.340 --> 39:59.700]  from from Ebola countries this is how ridiculous it all is
[39:59.700 --> 40:03.140]  Paul I'm turning it over to you and Joe Biggs from Dallas and Josh Owens and
[40:03.140 --> 40:06.420]  Dallas they're courageous to go out there and be near the hospital we got
[40:06.420 --> 40:10.060]  Rick Perry's press conference coming up with our questions and more and if
[40:10.060 --> 40:13.180]  you're listening to this transmission folks you're not a bystander you're in
[40:13.180 --> 40:17.100]  the arena get on the phone call the White House call Congress call the media
[40:17.100 --> 40:21.940]  call Fox News CNN and say listen here you little chicken neck establishment
[40:21.940 --> 40:26.700]  state-run media whores you prostitutes we expect you to ask Rick Perry and ask
[40:26.700 --> 40:30.500]  Obama and ask the White House press secretary why haven't you shut the
[40:30.500 --> 40:34.260]  flights down why are you bringing a bowl of patients here but no you don't
[40:34.260 --> 40:38.340]  question that's being conspiracy theorist you sit there and you stick your
[40:38.340 --> 40:42.460]  head in the sand and you do whatever the government says you people deserve
[40:42.460 --> 40:46.460]  everything you get in the government media and in the system if you don't
[40:46.460 --> 40:51.540]  speak out now okay where are your survival instincts dumbasses and I
[40:51.540 --> 40:55.060]  don't mean to use those type of words lightly but that's what it is get up off
[40:55.060 --> 41:00.580]  of your butts stop being morons and get involved and realize we aren't alarmist
[41:00.580 --> 41:04.380]  we're realist here we know what we're talking about we immerse ourselves in
[41:04.380 --> 41:07.900]  this we're committed to freedom we're committed to America we're committed to
[41:07.900 --> 41:13.300]  the Republic we're real folks and the reason we see so so alien the reason we
[41:13.300 --> 41:17.740]  see some so weird to a bunch of domesticated serfs is because we've
[41:17.740 --> 41:22.260]  turned into jellyfish slaves and so when people act like real Americans or
[41:22.260 --> 41:26.260]  people act like real Westerners or people that have basic survival instincts
[41:26.260 --> 41:31.540]  we're called a bunch of scum no we're not we tried to stop this and now it may
[41:31.540 --> 41:35.540]  get out of hand and I'm sure we'll get the blame for it in the end Paul Watson
[41:35.540 --> 41:39.700]  God bless you it's up to you listeners it's up to you to get the poor media up
[41:39.700 --> 41:44.740]  off their butts and to ask real questions to put heat on these politicians
[41:44.740 --> 41:49.940]  so they can basically have a joint suicide pack with everybody to bring a
[41:49.940 --> 41:52.980]  bola into this country and even if this doesn't get out of hand and I hope it
[41:52.980 --> 41:57.420]  doesn't what does it say about these people's mindsets what does it say
[41:57.420 --> 42:01.940]  about how they operate that they would try to do this obviously try to get a
[42:01.940 --> 42:07.300]  bola going in the country so Obama could act like a savior he is Barack Obama
[42:07.300 --> 42:13.500]  from now on President Obama is Barack Obama God bless you all there goes
[42:13.500 --> 42:17.940]  Alex Jones I remember it was President Obama who said that Ebola it would be
[42:17.940 --> 42:22.580]  quote unlikely for Ebola to arrive in the United States and of course we were
[42:22.580 --> 42:26.820]  called conspiracy theorists and fear mongers for weeks on end in fact CBS
[42:26.820 --> 42:31.660]  News wrote an article attacking info wars attacking me directly after I appeared
[42:31.660 --> 42:35.460]  on the Michael Savage show simply to go through some of the evidence that Ebola
[42:35.460 --> 42:39.060]  could have mutated it could have gone airborne and we were attacked we were
[42:39.060 --> 42:44.580]  demonized now the media is basically trying to downplay this the CDC is
[42:44.580 --> 42:47.980]  trying to downplay it for obvious reasons to prevent hysteria but I think
[42:47.980 --> 42:52.020]  there's also another reason why they're trying to downplay it and that's because
[42:52.020 --> 42:55.740]  they dropped the ball completely they've been caught with their pants down the
[42:55.740 --> 43:00.860]  health authorities there in Dallas this individual came into the hospital with
[43:00.860 --> 43:05.300]  Ebola symptoms they gave him antibiotics and sent him on his way without
[43:05.300 --> 43:10.260]  asking any questions whatsoever about his travel history he had come from
[43:10.260 --> 43:15.940]  Liberia which of course has been ravaged by Ebola in fact Anthony Fauci the
[43:15.940 --> 43:19.820]  head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases he told
[43:19.820 --> 43:24.340]  CNN this morning I was watching this in the hotel room that it was quote an
[43:24.340 --> 43:29.860]  enormous red flag that they didn't ask this individual about his travel history
[43:29.860 --> 43:33.900]  given that he's obviously you know he's a black gentleman he's come from Liberia
[43:33.900 --> 43:37.700]  he's obviously got a foreign accent he's got Ebola symptoms they gave him
[43:37.700 --> 43:42.340]  antibiotics and sent him home and for a total of four days he was wandering
[43:42.340 --> 43:47.580]  around Dallas and God knows where else infecting other people potentially they
[43:47.580 --> 43:51.940]  now talking about a second Ebola case the Health and Human Services official has
[43:51.940 --> 43:57.580]  indicated that second case is probable and here we have the article from
[43:57.580 --> 44:04.780]  prisonplanet.com Texas Ebola patient was sent home for two days with
[44:04.780 --> 44:09.980]  antibiotics so he went to the hospital they gave him the antibiotics they sent
[44:09.980 --> 44:14.580]  him home no questions asked they said he had press reports of the man who
[44:14.580 --> 44:18.020]  traveled from Liberia to Dallas on September 20th was dismissed from the
[44:18.020 --> 44:23.260]  Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on the 26th after seeking care he was
[44:23.260 --> 44:26.900]  evaluated and given a prescription for antibiotics with hospital workers
[44:26.900 --> 44:31.740]  believing he had some other ailment so again they completely dropped the ball
[44:31.740 --> 44:36.260]  on it yet we've been called fear mongers and conspiracy theorists for the best
[44:36.260 --> 44:40.860]  part of two months for simply warning about this situation arriving in the
[44:40.860 --> 44:46.060]  US which it now indeed has and of course Obama said it was unlikely and even
[44:46.060 --> 44:51.860]  Chris Matthews last night on MSNBC got in an argument with Ezekiel Immanuel
[44:51.860 --> 44:57.580]  about the fact that Obama basically broke yet another promise almost that Ebola
[44:57.580 --> 45:01.740]  would not arrive in the US obviously the precautions were not taken there's
[45:01.740 --> 45:05.580]  another article I believe out the Washington Times with the CDC admitting
[45:05.580 --> 45:09.380]  now that they were not prepared for this despite the fact for telling us for
[45:09.380 --> 45:14.020]  two months that they were prepared that this was very unlikely that's let's go
[45:14.020 --> 45:18.980]  to that Chris Matthews clip now from MSNBC where even Matthews who of course
[45:18.980 --> 45:23.060]  said he got a thrill up his leg for the Obama speech back a couple of years ago
[45:23.060 --> 45:28.860]  is now on the offensive against Obama over this Ebola situation let's go to
[45:28.860 --> 45:33.660]  that clip president statement doctor and that is that the president said it
[45:33.660 --> 45:37.340]  would be unlikely if he had a case in this country unlikely not even one case
[45:37.340 --> 45:43.500]  but if I see the tape again he said it wouldn't be a Ebola outbreak and I
[45:43.500 --> 45:47.140]  think now and in the second part of his sense he said that in the unlikely case
[45:47.140 --> 45:50.380]  someone brings it here yeah in the unlikely case somebody brings it well
[45:50.380 --> 45:53.500]  they've done it we're living in the world of the unlikely already that's all I'm
[45:53.500 --> 45:58.580]  saying I'm not I agree in the facts and I wonder everybody else is you're right
[45:58.580 --> 46:03.340]  it isn't unlikely case but it's not again we need to put it in perspective
[46:03.340 --> 46:08.860]  this isn't easily transmitted it's not like the flu it's not like measles or
[46:08.860 --> 46:14.580]  chicken pox you need bodily you need contact with bodily fluids and we have
[46:14.580 --> 46:19.340]  a health system that's much better I remember we also had today Sanjay Gupta
[46:19.340 --> 46:23.020]  on CNN we're trying to find this clip I saw it on an article earlier they
[46:23.020 --> 46:27.700]  since changed the article and we've got that clip now this is Sanjay Gupta
[46:27.700 --> 46:32.140]  saying explaining the fact that although this is not airborne as far as we
[46:32.140 --> 46:36.460]  know it's quite easy to pass on to other individuals merely by shaking their
[46:36.460 --> 46:40.980]  hand we think of you know exchange of bodily fluids is something more than
[46:40.980 --> 46:44.660]  that but sweat glands can achieve that especially if you've got a you know a
[46:44.660 --> 46:49.940]  broken area of your skin in your hand and here's Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN this
[46:49.940 --> 46:54.940]  morning explaining how that works to your point wolf from the 24th to the 28th
[46:54.940 --> 46:59.380]  it sounds like this is somebody who was sick but was not in isolation what is
[46:59.380 --> 47:02.460]  going to be absolutely critical obviously besides taking care of this
[47:02.460 --> 47:07.620]  individual is now to go back over those four days and figure out anybody that
[47:07.620 --> 47:11.660]  person may have had contact with that's that's absolutely critical it is
[47:11.660 --> 47:15.940]  absolutely crucial to do that to try and prevent other people from possibly
[47:15.940 --> 47:20.620]  spreading this virus it's it is called contact tracing and as Dr. Frieden
[47:20.620 --> 47:24.580]  pointed out it is a mainstay of controlling these sorts of things but
[47:24.580 --> 47:27.620]  obviously four days is a significant period of time and there could be many
[47:27.620 --> 47:32.660]  contacts the person may have had what if they do once they find those contacts
[47:32.660 --> 47:37.460]  they got to monitor those people for three weeks 21 days and make sure they
[47:37.460 --> 47:40.980]  don't develop any signs of fever because that could be one of the earliest
[47:40.980 --> 47:45.620]  signs of an Ebola infection so a couple of priorities wolf as Dr. Frieden
[47:45.620 --> 47:49.340]  laid out I think as you said transparently first and foremost that
[47:49.340 --> 47:52.940]  you have the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States they care
[47:52.940 --> 47:56.980]  for that person obviously a paramount importance but then going back finding
[47:56.980 --> 48:02.060]  all those contacts and and really monitoring them closely putting them in
[48:02.060 --> 48:06.980]  a situation where they can't possibly spread Ebola and monitor to see if they
[48:06.980 --> 48:11.540]  develop any fevers so that's that's what's happening right now wolf here in
[48:11.540 --> 48:15.500]  the United States this has not happened before it's happening a lot in West
[48:15.500 --> 48:20.060]  Africa as Dr. Frieden pointed out but from a medical standpoint this is
[48:20.060 --> 48:24.140]  historic what Dr. Frieden has just outlined okay it's very worrisome that's
[48:24.140 --> 48:29.020]  Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN I believe either last night or this morning talking
[48:29.020 --> 48:32.900]  about how easy this this could spread obviously we know it's not airborne but
[48:32.900 --> 48:37.740]  the key fact I think is the threat which is the threat of hysteria it's not
[48:37.740 --> 48:41.900]  necessarily the threat of a pandemic or an epidemic of Ebola it's the threat of
[48:41.900 --> 48:46.980]  hysteria which could grease the skids for this medical martial law situation
[48:46.980 --> 48:51.300]  that many people have been concerned about since for example 2001 with the
[48:51.300 --> 48:56.180]  Model States Emergency Health Powers Act we've got Joe Biggs I think we'll go to
[48:56.180 --> 48:59.460]  him after the break now because we're coming up on a break in a couple of
[48:59.460 --> 49:03.700]  minutes but we got Joe Biggs live on the scene on in Dallas we're gonna go to him
[49:03.700 --> 49:07.220]  now just before the break Joe Biggs you're there in Dallas what's going on
[49:07.220 --> 49:17.220]  what's the situation I don't hear anything Joe can you hear me oh I can hear
[49:17.220 --> 49:21.260]  you now hey Joe you're on the scene in Dallas tell us what's unfolding what's
[49:21.260 --> 49:26.460]  the situation there oh Roger I'm here at a ground zero at a bowl USA where
[49:26.460 --> 49:30.900]  patient zero is you know there's a lot of things unfolding right now you know
[49:30.900 --> 49:34.940]  we have that confirmed patient with Ebola right now they have another
[49:34.940 --> 49:40.020]  individual that's hospitalized or monitoring that have the symptoms of a
[49:40.020 --> 49:43.980]  bolus so they're gonna keep an eye on that person one of the things that was
[49:43.980 --> 49:47.860]  crazy though I heard you mentioned earlier on the show you know Thursday the
[49:47.860 --> 49:51.460]  patient tried to check himself in and they turned him away with flu like
[49:51.460 --> 49:56.060]  symptoms and gave him antibiotics so that's quite a long time a long period of
[49:56.060 --> 50:00.380]  time where he's been able to have contact with many individuals you know
[50:00.380 --> 50:05.100]  there was a an expert Ebola expert on last night at one of the local stations
[50:05.100 --> 50:08.180]  I stayed up till two in the morning watching local news to see what they
[50:08.180 --> 50:12.860]  had to say and the Ebola expert said that he fears that there will be you know
[50:12.860 --> 50:17.500]  quite a few more one of the last people in Africa that got Ebola was one man he
[50:17.500 --> 50:22.180]  infected 19 people so it's a very very scary thing and it's a very big
[50:22.180 --> 50:28.340]  possibility that this person has infected many other people and Rick Perry's
[50:28.340 --> 50:32.820]  coming up there in about 15 minutes I think with the news conference Alex was
[50:32.820 --> 50:36.580]  on the show earlier we're calling on Perry to ask the White House to shut
[50:36.580 --> 50:41.580]  down flights from West Africa into the United States Biggs if you could ask
[50:41.580 --> 50:45.060]  Perry a question that would be great we'll be back with more Ebola news Joe

[54:40.820 --> 54:46.700]  1-800-259-9231 but for the moment we've got Joe Biggs live on the scene at the
[54:46.700 --> 54:52.300]  Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas Texas covering the latest Ebola
[54:52.300 --> 54:57.220]  situation one confirmed case likelihood that a second patient has been infected
[54:57.220 --> 55:01.420]  a family member of the victim and we put the call out earlier for people to
[55:01.420 --> 55:06.140]  contact the White House to urge them to cease flights into the United States of
[55:06.140 --> 55:10.820]  America from these West African countries Britain friends have already
[55:10.820 --> 55:15.380]  done that the United States failed to do so now we have the first case arriving
[55:15.380 --> 55:19.580]  from Liberia we got Rick Perry coming up with a press conference here in about
[55:19.580 --> 55:23.100]  10 minutes we're gonna try and catch some of that and hopefully Biggs can get a
[55:23.100 --> 55:27.500]  question in there Joe Biggs other points on this case he said you've been you were
[55:27.500 --> 55:31.340]  up until 2 a.m. watching the breaking news coverage on this other facets of
[55:31.340 --> 55:37.020]  this Ebola situation yeah you know I flipped back and forth back and forth
[55:37.020 --> 55:40.260]  between you know your hardcore mainstream you know your Fox News your
[55:40.260 --> 55:45.180]  CNN your MSNBC in between that and then what the local media stand the people
[55:45.180 --> 55:50.340]  in Dallas are they've been put on a high alert you know to be very very careful
[55:50.340 --> 55:55.900]  while they're out if anyone with any symptoms people are on high edge here
[55:55.900 --> 56:00.780]  very tense very scared a local media when you when you can listen to them you
[56:00.780 --> 56:04.940]  can see it you know this is a big problem that they are worried about and they
[56:04.940 --> 56:08.700]  know that this man was able to roam freely for quite some time after he tried
[56:08.700 --> 56:12.460]  to admit himself so there's no telling who he came in contact with who that
[56:12.460 --> 56:16.820]  person there came in contact with that person so forth and so on you know
[56:16.820 --> 56:20.620]  there's a lot of people that could be affected by this one man and like you
[56:20.620 --> 56:23.620]  said that's a great point why haven't we shut down those flights coming from
[56:23.620 --> 56:27.060]  West Africa into our country that's that's something that needs to be stopped
[56:27.060 --> 56:33.400]  immediately also I mean this morning we mentioned earlier the clip of Zachari
[56:33.400 --> 56:37.900]  Thompson the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services he mentioned
[56:37.900 --> 56:41.940]  as far as I can recall the possibility that they're keeping children home from
[56:41.940 --> 56:46.100]  school in the Dallas area or in the immediate area surrounding that hospital
[56:46.100 --> 56:50.180]  I'd like to get some confirmation on that if the writers could help me out
[56:50.180 --> 56:55.460]  because I remember he mentioned that so as you said Joe it seems that the media
[56:55.460 --> 56:59.940]  and the authorities in the local area of Dallas are quite concerned about this
[56:59.940 --> 57:04.900]  whereas generally in terms of nationwide media we get this message about you know
[57:04.900 --> 57:08.660]  this is nothing we've got this isolated it's nothing to worry about obviously
[57:08.660 --> 57:12.500]  that's what you would expect them to do to prevent hysteria but as I said earlier
[57:12.500 --> 57:16.900]  they got caught with their pants down because as you mentioned Joe this guy
[57:16.900 --> 57:21.740]  was walking around for four days he came in two days before the case was
[57:21.740 --> 57:26.500]  confirmed they gave him antibiotics and sent him home so Joe I mean we've been
[57:26.500 --> 57:29.900]  called conspiracy theorists for the best part of two months for warning about
[57:29.900 --> 57:34.660]  this now it happens and it seems like it's it's an attempt on behalf of the
[57:34.660 --> 57:39.540]  CDC and the medical authorities to cover their behinds because they could
[57:39.540 --> 57:43.340]  they could and should have asked this guy about his travel history and caught
[57:43.340 --> 57:47.900]  this at least a couple of days earlier yeah I mean that's standard operating
[57:47.900 --> 57:53.140]  procedure for any kind of hospital especially when you know talks of a
[57:53.140 --> 57:56.500]  bowl have been going on for you know a couple months now you know that's
[57:56.500 --> 58:00.900]  something when someone shows up that's you know sign A if someone has flu like
[58:00.900 --> 58:04.380]  symptoms hey where have you been have you traveled anywhere you know that's
[58:04.380 --> 58:08.220]  kind of a very important question for someone like that in a hospital like
[58:08.220 --> 58:13.780]  this I mean this is a very big like hospital I mean very nice lots of money
[58:13.780 --> 58:17.660]  put into it you think that they would have people here trained to deal with
[58:17.660 --> 58:20.620]  something like that but then they're telling you right now the CDC is coming
[58:20.620 --> 58:24.420]  out and saying well no no you know all these hospitals in the area are well
[58:24.420 --> 58:28.260]  equipped to deal with a bullet patient well I don't see how that's possible
[58:28.260 --> 58:31.540]  when you guys aren't even well equipped to ask the proper questions to find out
[58:31.540 --> 58:35.420]  whether or not a patient that comes in might possibly have a bullet okay Joe
[58:35.420 --> 58:40.700]  Biggs live on the scene David Knight coming up stay tuned thank you for
[58:40.700 --> 58:47.580]  listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today

[58:53.100 --> 58:57.100]  Monday about a potential for hood situation the police are shoving people
[58:57.100 --> 59:01.320]  shoving Alex shoving the crowd whether it's the

[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.460]  we're back on the Alex Jones show I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:39.740]  today obviously we've got huge breaking news on the first case of Ebola confirmed
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:43.140]  in the United States we've got our reporter Joe Biggs live on the scene
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.700]  with Josh Owens there in Dallas we're waiting for Rick Perry to give a press
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.700]  conference which is coming up in the next five to ten minutes so we're gonna
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.780]  try to get some audio feed from that gonna take your calls at the bottom of
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:02.540]  the hour on 1-800-259-9231 that's 1-800-259-9231 obviously on Ebola then
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:06.740]  we got Gerald Salente coming up in the third hour we'll ask him about the
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.540]  Ebola situation and much more including Syria, ISIS, Bitcoin and the latest
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:17.940]  financial situation but now I'm joined in studio by David Knight David your
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:22.940]  comments on this unfolding Ebola situation well I guess Paul the first
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.020]  thing I was thinking was with you being here from the UK I started thinking
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:33.380]  about how they quarantine dogs in the UK you know since from 1897 until 2012 they
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:38.380]  would quarantine any dog that was coming into the country for six months as you
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:43.420]  probably know now they changed that policy in 2012 what they did was they
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:50.020]  changed it to 21 days if they were a non-EU country they would change it to
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.780]  sorry if it was the EU or the US would be 21 days it would be three months if
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:59.900]  it was outside of the EU or the US but still they're quarantining dogs why
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:04.620]  can't we get them to treat us at least with as much respect as they have for
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.300]  dogs I mean we can't even get the kind of treatment that you would expect for
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.980]  dogs as Alex was saying when he was talking to you why not tell these
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.100]  people if you're going to come in from a country where there's a pandemic going
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.180]  we're going to isolate you you'll have to pay for this isolation you're going to
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.420]  be set aside for 21 days while you might while we monitor you they are
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.900]  checking people for fever when they put them on the planes but of course this
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:30.100]  flight is anywhere from 22 to 33 hours anywhere from 2 to 3 stopovers to go
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:36.340]  from Liberia to the United States so you know something can happen within that
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.540]  period of time and of course they're not following those patients once they come
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.500]  in and check them for fever and they make it onto the plane there's no more
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.100]  tracking of those patients and there's no testing of them once they arrive at
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.900]  any of these stopover destinations whether it's in Europe or Asia or wherever
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.500]  you know when they're coming to the United States depending on on which
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:58.300]  direction they go and that's interesting David because I remember back in 2009
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.780]  during the swine flu outbreak when we arrived I was flying into China into
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.460]  Shanghai from Britain and they did the testing when we arrived so we couldn't
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.240]  even get off the the flight before we could enter the airport they came on in
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.940]  full hazmat suits and we're giving the temperature test for every individual
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:21.860]  passenger it seems the situation in now with this Ebola case is very lax as I
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:27.340]  said earlier Air France British Airways and Emirates which are three huge
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:33.900]  airlines banned all flights from West Africa as of the end of August America
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.060]  basically stood back and did nothing despite Obama at one point saying this
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.420]  was a global security threat even though he said it was unlikely that Ebola would
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.540]  arrive in the United States they don't seem to have prepared any measures now
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.100]  we've got articles out of the Washington Times where the CDC said they were
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.260]  underfunded they weren't prepared for this yet all along they told us not to
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.180]  worry that they would deal with it if it happened yeah and clearly as that story
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.540]  broke the other day I think you were the one that broke it about the CDC putting
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.740]  the information out there that how to handle dead bodies that hit people who
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.260]  had died from Ebola they put that information out there after they knew
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.060]  about this patient because this is something that depending on whose
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:18.580]  chronology you look at they first learned about it on either the 24th or on
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:23.780]  the 26th the press conference was yesterday the 30th so and in the
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.140]  interim they put together this thing about dead bodies and sent this out
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.180]  everywhere I'm not as optimistic as the CDC is when I look at this I see
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.820]  staggering incompetence at the very least I mean anybody who doesn't think
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.100]  that this was a deliberate propagation of a pandemic has to look at this at the
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:44.900]  incompetence and just be absolutely amazed we'll be back shortly with more

[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.660]  outbreak news we've got Rick Perry Governor Rick Perry coming up with a
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.620]  press conference very shortly we're asking him and we're asking our listeners
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.900]  to contact the White House and urge them to block all incoming flights from West
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.340]  Africa at least for a period of time because that's what several other top
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.300]  airlines have done over the past few weeks and yet the United States failed
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:58.740]  to do so now we have Ebola arriving from Liberia CNBC reports Dow dives 200
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:03.660]  points as global worries hit stocks one of those worries is identified as this
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:08.420]  Ebola outbreak so you know we've got CDC saying this is nothing whatsoever to
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:14.060]  worry about it's an isolated case yet it's already wiped 200 points off stocks
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.660]  off the Dow Jones as of this morning also on info wars calm we've got a big
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:23.460]  story former FDA top scientist says more will be infected now that Ebola is in
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:30.180]  Texas and this is Dr. Jesse L. Goodman formally actually currently formally
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.820]  with the Food and Drug Administration he said the public should not panic although
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.220]  he said the government should prepare for the worse it's quite appropriate to
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.980]  be concerned on many fronts Goodman said according to the Washington
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:45.780]  Examiner I think we're ready to go to this press conference with Rick Perry is
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:53.300]  that correct let's go ahead and superintendent miles in our local our
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:59.220]  state and our federal partners in keeping this contained this is a disease
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:05.940]  that is not airborne and is substantially more difficult to contract
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:12.140]  than the common code we have experts here with us today who will be talking to
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:18.500]  you in a minute about cautions that you may want to take the medical community
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:24.060]  of Nartex is along with officials from the state and federal government have
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:30.460]  been working together to take every step available and necessary to care for this
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:37.660]  patient's health and to ensure the safety and welfare of our citizens there
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:44.180]  are few places in the world better equipped to meet the challenge that is
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:52.140]  posed in this case Texas is one of only 13 states certified by the CDC to
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:58.300]  conduct diagnostic Ebola testing and we have the health care professionals and
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:05.020]  the institutions that are second to none public should have every confidence
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:10.500]  that the highly trained professionals involved here will succeed in this very
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:17.140]  important mission public health investigators from Dallas County and
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:21.300]  from the Texas Department of State Health Services are working to identify
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:26.540]  to locate and monitor the health of all of those who have come into close
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:33.220]  contact with the patient the highly qualified men and women of Texas health
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:39.300]  Presbyterian are doing everything in their power to deliver the very best care
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.980]  for this patient they have been and they will continue to be in close contact with
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:51.140]  federal state and local officials to ensure the public safety this case is
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:57.940]  serious rest assured that our system as working as it should professionals on
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:04.140]  every level of the chain of command know what to do to minimize this potential
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:10.260]  risk to the Texas of this country for that matter I'd like to ask Dr. David
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.740]  Lakey he is the head of our state health services to come and share with you the
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:21.660]  efforts that are ongoing as we address this issue David
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:29.740]  Good morning everyone my name is David Lakey I'm the commissioner of the Texas
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.940]  Department of State Health Services and I really appreciate you being here today
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:40.460]  I want to echo several of the comments that were made by the governor first you
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:44.060]  know our thoughts and prayers are really with the family they were notified
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:49.620]  about their loved one having Ebola yesterday obviously as a scary diagnosis
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.420]  and so our thoughts and prayers are with them right now and also with the
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.380]  treatment they the treatment team those individuals in the health care that are
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:03.300]  caring for the individual right now since the the outbreak of Ebola in West
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.980]  Africa Texas has been taking steps to make sure that we are prepared for an
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:13.940]  event like this a lot of education has taken place a lot of protocols have been
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:18.420]  put in place we've developed the ability to test for this virus since October
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.220]  excuse me since August and be able to do that in our in our laboratory and our
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:29.100]  preparedness is not just taking place at the level here at the local level in
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.140]  this hospital they take it really seriously they've been eating their
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.820]  staff they've been putting their own protocols in place so that they were
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:44.540]  ready to care for an incident that this individual so we've been on the
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:50.420]  lookout for this I had the opportunity today to spend time with the the team
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:56.300]  and talk to the management team and hear how they have been preparing for a
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.540]  long time for this event and then I had the opportunity to talk to the
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:05.380]  infection control practitioners and actually go on to the ward and see
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:09.420]  firsthand the work that they're doing and I want to let you know they're doing
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:15.220]  a great job they're they're providing compassionate care they're they have a
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:21.420]  committed staff that are providing top-notch care and are doing that in a
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:25.940]  safe environment they have a whole ward that's dedicated to the care of this
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:31.420]  individual they have a whole team of again professionals that are very
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.540]  competent caring for this individual and are doing it as I noted in a very safe
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:42.860]  compassionate environment providing excellent care now obviously this
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:48.020]  disease is scary to a large number of individuals but I think some of the
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:53.100]  points that Dr. Frieden emphasized yesterday I think we're gonna get an
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:58.020]  explanation so one of the statements that he said and I want to reiterate is
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:03.780]  that people cannot transmit this disease until they have some okay and so
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.100]  individuals that do not have symptoms are not yeah let's jump in there let's
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.260]  try and go back to that conference if they take questions obviously we want to
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:17.740]  try and get one or two in David the the spokesman there that came on after
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.700]  Perry was basically saying that they put protocols in place they were
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:24.980]  preparing for this for a long time and yet they completely botched the response
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:29.700]  they sent this Ebola victim home that's the thing they want to tell us they
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:33.900]  want to argue that we shouldn't worry because they are hyper competent and
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:38.860]  yet they won't even address why they just diagnosed him with some antibiotics
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.660]  and a and a cold or whatever the diagnosis was and sending back home for
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.660]  another two days to expose family members and other people in the community
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:51.260]  and then the ambulance workers as well they now have I believe it's the latest
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:56.460]  news that I saw it was 12 to 18 people are being monitored they've tested the
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:00.060]  ambulance crew they say that they have tested negative for Ebola but they're
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.660]  still keeping them isolated but it doesn't inspire confidence when they
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:07.540]  won't address their failings and we've seen this from Business Insider they
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.340]  put out an article with three points saying why we shouldn't panic and they
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.700]  say well they know exactly how to control the virus they know what
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.980]  precautions to be taken to treat the virus and yet why do we have over 200
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:25.260]  doctors and nurses that have died in Africa treating this if they completely
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.020]  know the protocols to keep this contained that makes me concerned that
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:35.100]  they don't understand fully the methods of the means of transmission they also
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.700]  want to say that it's not very contagious that doesn't spread through the air
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:41.500]  Harry started out by saying this is harder to catch than a common cold well
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.700]  you know you can catch a cold from inhaling what somebody sneezes out and
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.980]  certainly if this is transmitted by bodily fluids of somebody sneezes with
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:54.500]  Ebola you know where you touch anything where their bodily fluids were where
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.820]  they're they're bleeding you're going to get it so it is very contagious and it
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:01.540]  can be spread through the air as you've pointed out many times I've had animal
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.060]  studies that show that it that certain strains would transmit through the air so
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:08.140]  we're not really certain about that when I look at the number of doctors and
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.780]  nurses that have died I wonder if maybe that might be part of the reason that
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:16.100]  they don't fully credit the means of transmission and these are these are
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.980]  health professionals that take precautions to the end to degree and
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:22.580]  hundreds of them have died in West Africa we're told that it could only be
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.220]  transmitted via bodily fluids but we've also got the the CDC advising airlines
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:31.140]  to take precautions so as not to allow the airborne spread of the virus so we
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.620]  know that they are concerned about this despite the fact that Perry almost
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:38.100]  immediately in that press conference said that this is not airborne another
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.460]  concern David of course is the fact that this ambulance in which this Ebola
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:46.780]  victim was transported to the hospital was in use for two days afterwards
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:51.540]  before they identified him before they confirmed in and isolated him as an
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:55.980]  Ebola sufferer let's go back briefly to this press conference to see if we're
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:01.980]  going to get any actual answers they're they're marching orders and and and
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:07.100]  understand the importance of of that good collaboration that good partnering
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:13.900]  from the state right through our federal partners with the CDC so to those of you
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:18.060]  in the media for any questions and individuals on the podium here can
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:27.500]  respond I beg your pardon sorry
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:36.180]  can't hear the question mark cute we're we're categorizing his condition as
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:40.220]  serious but stable
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:47.580]  hmm yeah we're not sure we can't hear the with this press conference we can't
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.380]  we're here with the questions that people are asking the audience and we're
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:56.620]  not much in terms was in place for Ebola hospital for several weeks and Dr.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:01.820]  Ed Goodman to my right had had led the implementation of that that checklist
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:08.660]  was utilized by the nurse who did ask that question that nurse was part of a
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:13.580]  care team and it was a complex care team taking care of him in the emergency
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:17.420]  I think somebody asked if they regretfully that information was not
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:23.660]  fully communicated throughout the full team and as a result the full import of
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:28.900]  that information wasn't factored in to the clinical decision-making the
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:36.740]  overall clinical presentation was not typical at that time yet for Ebola so as
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:41.620]  the team assessed him they felt clinically it was a low-grade common
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:45.700]  viral disease that was the presentation he's talking about why they felt a
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:49.820]  diagnosis at the first time the guy came in did they ask him where he was
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:55.700]  coming from he volunteered that he had traveled from Africa in response to the
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:01.260]  nurse operating the checklist and asking that question
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:07.420]  that differs from what we were told before because they said he was he was
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.980]  sent I can't answer that given antibiotics one piece of information that
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:17.700]  would be factored into the entire clinical picture the clinicians did not
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:28.300]  factor it in so it was not part of their decision making I think that was a
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:35.420]  question from Joe but it's big get it yeah big bigs was asking if the fly it's
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.500]  gonna be shut down from West Africa I don't think that's a question that's
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:49.940]  really not in my domain he's a CDC so bigs just asked if we are here to shoot
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:53.780]  down and he basically avoided the question that's the gated so we are
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:58.220]  investigating it I can't give you specific information but we will look
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:09.700]  very carefully at that so now one of the media represents that it was a
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:13.900]  mistake confronting him on the mistake that led to this guy being able to walk
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:18.820]  back around Dallas that was present so that all the information wasn't present
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:28.140]  as they made their clinical decision the information was a present that's your
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:33.340]  point when you diagnose that information was not obtained when the patient was in
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:39.620]  the emergency it was not obtained because they failed to obtain I'm Dr. Mark
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:44.780]  Lester and I'm an executive vice president with Texas Health Resources
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:49.740]  I'm the zone clinical leader for the southeast zone in Texas health reasons
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:53.100]  it seems the media are asking real questions which is good this guy's
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:22:03.140]  getting quite a grilling just hard for us to remember it's unprotected exposure
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:08.700]  to the bodily fluids that constitutes an exposure and so very carefully and
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:14.860]  together with the CDC we're investigating how many people that might be and how
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:24.900]  they might be monitored that's so as I said we are investigating that right
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:34.060]  now people in Liberian community is saying they want to know who he's had
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.380]  contact with so these people can go and get tested to see if they have it so
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.300]  they can isolate it keep it from spreading they won't tell anybody
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:45.460]  anything about this guy whether he's a citizen anything about him they won't
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:50.460]  put this information out there so people can take precautions themselves and so
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:54.540]  far no comments on the possible second case which we talked about earlier one
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.580]  of the health and human services department officials said that there
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:05.260]  was a second Ebola case the press conference outside Dallas Presbyterian
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:10.340]  hospital Rick Perry just spoke a CDC official just spoken Joe Biggs managed
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:14.380]  to get a question in there asking if the flights would be shut down into the
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:18.020]  United States from West Africa Air France British Airways you know to
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:23.740]  Arab Emirates Emirates Airlines have done that the CDC official David kind of
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.620]  sidestep the question he said it wasn't his domain which is why you know we're
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:32.820]  encouraging people to call the White House and have this get behind this
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.060]  campaign to shut down the flights because several other countries have done it
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:41.460]  it seems like a reasonable precaution to take it's not as if there is a huge
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:46.580]  volume of air traffic from Liberia for example I noticed in the in the Daily
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:50.180]  Mail article there were just a few flights a week going into Britain so I
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:53.820]  can't imagine it's too many more going into the United States so it's not as
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:58.820]  if this would be a huge economic impact on the economy if this if these flights
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:02.980]  were canceled it seems like a sensible precaution to take David well as I
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.300]  mentioned when I first came in at the top of the hour some of the stations were
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.420]  on a news break at that time this is something that they've been doing for
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:14.660]  dogs coming into the United Kingdom for a very very long time for over a century
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:19.660]  they just stopped it in 2012 they would quarantine any animals that were being
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.940]  brought in the UK for six months to test them to see if they're positive for
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:27.620]  rabies or a variety of other diseases they changed that in 2012 but they still
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:31.580]  hold animals that are coming in from preferred areas like the EU and the
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:36.140]  United States they still hold them for 21 days they hold animals coming in from
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:40.860]  elsewhere they hold them still for three months why do we why are we more
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:45.980]  concerned about the health of dogs than we are about the health of Americans or
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:51.740]  people here clearly they're in my opinion they don't want to get this thing
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:55.860]  under control until are not making any efforts to try to do that until it gets
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.940]  out of hand and then they will get very heavy-handed then they will bring in
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.580]  martial law then they'll bring in mandatory quarantines that's what they've
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.900]  been preparing for they haven't been preparing to contain a disease they've
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:11.580]  been preparing for martial law and this is one more way that they could bring
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:16.380]  this in so it looks to me that it is something more than just vast and
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:20.180]  competence and clearly the kind of dodging that we've seen we've seen them
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:23.580]  say that we should not worry about this because they fully understand it and
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.700]  yet they don't have a cure for it they don't know how it's transmitted because
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:31.780]  we've had over 200 doctors and nurses die in Africa from this treatment and then
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:35.420]  they want to tell us how professional they are and yet they can't or won't
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:39.820]  explain why they didn't diagnose this guy when he first presented himself to
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:43.340]  the hospital but rather sent him home and then picked him up a couple of days
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:48.340]  later with an ambulance and I mean I go back to this comparison again and again
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:53.260]  with the swine flu outbreak back in 2009 the hysteria that preceded that which
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:57.820]  was being generated whipped up by the media and by officials was intense
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.580]  they were talking about troops on the streets in numerous countries across the
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:06.300]  world of course it never happened what did happen was that the mass generation
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:11.100]  of profits from the sale of a swine flu vaccine which was basically unnecessary
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.700]  for huge numbers of populations of countries around the world basically
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:20.060]  you were only at risk of getting swine flu of dying from swine flu if you
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.540]  are either elderly young or sick so that left out the vast majority of the
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:29.500]  population but they did get these swine flu vaccines which which created
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:33.420]  millions millions of profits for these pharmaceutical companies who had the
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.060]  vaccine lined up before the hysteria before the panic of course in the case
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:44.380]  of Ebola we've got discussion of the the Z-Map drug in in development we've got
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:49.700]  discussion of patents for Ebola viruses for vaccines but nothing really
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:54.380]  firmly established so in the absence of that financial motive it seems that the
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:59.420]  the CDC at the moment is trying to downplay the concerns of course our
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:03.580]  concerns which we've voiced on numerous occasions are the fact that they have
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:08.300]  measures in place the CDC to quarantine quote well persons who do not show
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:13.580]  symptoms of any respiratory disease and of course Obama signed an executive order
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:18.700]  back at the end of July where he said that basically any American could be
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:23.580]  detained could be quarantined if they show any sign of respiratory illness so
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:28.420]  we've got the architecture of medical martial law targeting people not even
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:32.940]  showing symptoms of Ebola seems to be directed more against the American
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:36.860]  people amongst establishing coalescing power within the medical
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.020]  establishment and yet they're caught with their pants down with this one Ebola
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:46.340]  victim who walks into a hospital in Dallas after having arrived in Dallas
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:51.300]  from Liberia is asked zero questions about his travel history given
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:56.260]  antibiotics and sent home David final comments on that before the break yeah
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.740]  that's the amazing thing to me that's what I would expect them if they were
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:02.900]  going to be candid and honest and forthcoming I would expect them to
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:07.660]  address that incompetence up front instead all they did was they gave us
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:10.220]  happy news about how they've been training for this they're prepared for
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:13.500]  this and we have the best medical facilities anywhere on the planet here
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:18.740]  in Texas and never address that and then dodge the question essentially saying
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.180]  well that information wasn't obtained that's why he was sent home it's like
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:26.020]  that's your job to obtain the information so if they don't understand
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:30.660]  that's their job if they don't do their job why should we be reassured about
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:36.460]  their competence but you mentioned the Z-Map virus vaccine that's something
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:40.340]  that everybody heard about when those first two came back that with Samaritan's
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:46.940]  purse Dr. Brantley and the other lady to Emory University they recovered however
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:51.220]  after that they gave other people the Z-Map virus they gave two people the Z-Map
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:56.420]  virus who then subsequently died so they're essentially two and two there
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:01.300]  have been three other people who were treated with the Z-Map vaccine they are
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.860]  still being treated so we don't know the outcome of that but if you look at
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:07.980]  those numbers that's not substantially better in terms of effectiveness than
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.340]  the people than the general population numbers in Liberia where it's so high
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:16.300]  they're having 53% casualties so far but they say of the people that are not yet
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:21.660]  dead they believe that those casual rates are going to go to 70% effectively
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.780]  because that's why it's staying down at 50% because the people who have
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.900]  contracted it and are being treated have not yet died but they expect them to so
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.420]  it doesn't look at this point like it's essentially much better than not being
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.780]  treated at all and of course they exhausted their supply after seven
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:39.900]  treatments and we've got your calls coming up after the break on Ebola

[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:13.420]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:17.260]  gcn radio network
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:25.460]  it's paul joseph orson filling in for alex jones today on this wednesday
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:29.460]  october first 2014 edition obviously we're talking about ebola we're going to
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:33.460]  go to your calls shortly but an interesting article pops up some
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:38.140]  information that's not being heard so far not confirmed but interesting
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:43.820]  nonetheless from a potential cdc source talking about the travel history of this
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:48.780]  ebola victim david night you have the story yes this is from red state dot
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:52.700]  comma eric erickson is the person who runs that site he's got a radio show in
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:56.260]  atlanta where of course the cdc is headquartered and he said during the
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.100]  break of his radio station individual call the program said he worked for the
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.780]  cdc he says that he vetted the individual established his credibility
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:06.940]  and everything the guy said that gave him some information that was later
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:11.980]  confirmed the press conference he's also said that the patient traveled from
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:17.700]  brussels to dallas virginia and then on to dallas texas so he stopped over in
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.940]  brussels and dallas virginia before getting dallas from library he also says
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:26.260]  that the patient had come from a funeral in Liberia and all this information
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.700]  was provided before the details came out and press conferences now one of the
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:34.620]  interesting things that he says is that this person from the cdc told him that
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:40.100]  he went to the hospital with symptoms on the 24th and they're saying in the press
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:43.740]  conferences that the first time he went to the hospital was the 26th that he was
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.580]  starting to have symptoms at home but waited for two days before we went to
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.900]  the hospital they sent him home and he came back in other two days so that
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.860]  stretches out the symptoms a little bit earlier moves it a little bit more
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:58.500]  forward if that's true and he says he assumed that the guy was confused
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:02.580]  because the press conference of the 26th so he texted the source and the source
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:06.940]  came back and confirmed that yes he came in on the 20th and that he went to
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.300]  the emergency room with symptoms on the 24th that would be very important
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:14.500]  because I would imagine anybody that had gone to the emergency room at that
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:19.820]  hospital on the on the day in question would want to present themselves to have
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:24.940]  testing so perhaps even somebody on the 24th might want to take that precaution
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.260]  he said they discharged him with antibiotics and he returned again days
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.260]  later with watery diarrhea and other symptoms they tested him at that time
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:37.820]  for malaria and then Ebola and then put him in isolation on the 28th so that's
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.500]  the information we have from from that source so obviously this the suggestion
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.380]  there is that he didn't fly directly to Dallas I think we should probably check
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:50.300]  the flights from Dallas from Liberia to Dallas if that is a direct flight you're
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:54.180]  saying that there are no direct flights from Liberia Dallas there is a if I
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:58.980]  looked at several of them and of course you get a wide range of ways that you
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:02.660]  can get here depending on the airline that you go minimum you're going to go
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:07.780]  for 22 hours and two stops and you can go as much as 33 hours and three stops
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:11.300]  and it depends I mean it can take you through Brussels Paris Atlanta
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.900]  Philadelphia Houston there's a lot of different cities that these different
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:19.220]  flights stop by and of course merely the fact that somebody doesn't present any
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:22.820]  symptoms of fever when they're getting on the plane doesn't mean that these
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:27.380]  symptoms won't begin during a 33 hour journey so that that's quite a
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.740]  quite a long period of time one other thing that I thought was kind of
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:34.340]  interesting is one doctor one American doctor who's currently being treated for
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:39.420]  Ebola is it says that he believes that he got it because he operated on a
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.580]  patient with a caesarean section giving her a caesarean section and did not know
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:47.100]  that she had Ebola and so the question is if this is the way that they're going
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:51.860]  to diagnose it early on and start to question people is by fever they didn't
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.980]  take her temperature I mean you know when we go to the hospital they're
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:58.900]  constantly taking your temperature so they didn't notice in the hospital
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.380]  according to the doctor who believes that he got it because he operated on
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:06.140]  somebody that you know they didn't know that she had any symptoms so that's
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.860]  that's just just amazing it's another reason that they need to halt the
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:13.300]  flights it's another reason they need to tell people we're gonna keep you an
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:16.700]  isolation for 21 days if you're going to come into America that's the way you
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:22.220]  stop this you do it one of one or both of those things whatever you do but it
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.420]  could be contained if they wanted to contain it okay we're gonna go to your
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.660]  calls now Juliano in Texas go ahead you're on the air
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:37.020]  hey how y'all doing guys good what's your comment today the thing that I don't
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:44.580]  understand is why are they not warning the people the citizens of Dallas it is
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:51.900]  a multi-cultural so many people that are in and out of this little hub it's
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:56.900]  easily going to spread and they're just telling us oh don't worry you're not
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:03.500]  going to catch it now what are we supposed to do well it's interesting you
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.780]  mentioned that because top story on drudge report right now red linked kids
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:11.940]  who had contact with Ebola patient monitored this is out the associated
[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:16.300]  press believe out the comments we just saw earlier from Texas Governor Rick
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:20.980]  Perry who said a handful of school-aged children who had contact with a man
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:25.540]  diagnosed with Ebola are being monitored so I mentioned briefly earlier that the
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:29.260]  fact that some school children were being looked at Perry says health
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.740]  officials learn Wednesday that the children have been identified as having
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:37.500]  contact with the man and are being monitored at home the unidentified man
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:41.860]  has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday the
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:46.980]  man is the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US so this is just the
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:53.860]  first example of other potential Ebola victims who may have been infected with
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:58.100]  the virus obviously this this guy was traveling around for at least two days
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:03.260]  maybe even four days in contact with the community and family members David Knight
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.940]  your take on that well that's just it I mean the Liberian community themselves
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:11.180]  are very concerned about this because they're in contact with friends and
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:16.060]  family living in Liberia where this has been the worst pandemic it's been worse
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:20.180]  even there than in Sierra Leone and they're saying we don't understand why
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:25.220]  they won't tell us who this guy is so that we can anyone who's had contact
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:29.460]  with someone what with that particular person can go get tested they want to
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:34.340]  know what the person's name is who they've been in contact with and they're
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:38.140]  telling people telling people in the Liberian community to stay away from
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:41.900]  social gatherings they're very concerned about that because they've seen how it's
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.980]  ravaged and completely shut down their country
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:49.380]  is a headline up on m4wars.com how bad could it get US government order of
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:54.540]  160,000 hazmat suits gives a clue that's out of zero hedge of course we had that
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:59.500]  story recently out of the the order that this company that creates the hazmat
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.060]  suits got from the Department of the State Department actually it was that
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:08.300]  they'd ordered this huge amount of hazmat suits and again they they've been
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:12.740]  preparing for this in some ways but obviously not in the most important ways
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:18.060]  as we saw at the Dallas Hospital there Phil in Florida you're on the air go
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:25.060]  ahead Phil hey good afternoon who's to say first of all that he didn't he was the
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:28.060]  person that brought it on the plane he could he could have caught it from
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:33.900]  someone for 33 hours from someone on the plane and they got the recirculating
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:41.060]  air air going through the aircraft at you know for 33 hours you can infect you
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:47.220]  know 290 300 people who are all on that plane well sure they're telling us that
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:50.780]  it is not airborne but of course if someone has it and they're sneezing or
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:55.100]  coughing then that makes it airborne the information that we reported earlier
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:59.060]  from the person who who called into a radio show in Atlanta Eric Erickson's
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:03.180]  radio show had said that the patient had come from a funeral in Liberia so that
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:10.260]  might indicate that he was the carrier the key thing is that you isolate people
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:15.260]  before you put them in an closed area like an airplane before you bring them
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:21.180]  to the country it's a 21-day period if we do it for dogs in the UK we can do it
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:26.180]  for people who are coming from an area that's infected with this pandemic it's
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:30.980]  not that difficult and of course we had the story back on August 4th on info
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:36.780]  wars.com CDC concerned about airborne transmission of Ebola virus basically
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:40.540]  from their own documents interim guidance about Ebola virus infection for
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:46.860]  airline flight crews they advised airline staff to provide surgical masks to
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:50.740]  prevent a potential Ebola victims in order to quote reduce the number of
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:56.060]  droplets expelled into the air by talking sneezing or coughing the CDC also
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:01.180]  directs airline cleaning personnel to quote not use compressed air which might
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:07.380]  spread infections infectious material through the air so this was two months
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.580]  ago almost that they were directing airline flight crews to take precautions
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:16.900]  with with flights potential that Ebola could spread at least to a limited
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:22.020]  extent through sneezing and coughing David no you know Paul I think back when
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:27.180]  HIV first appeared and people really didn't know it could this be transmitted
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:31.980]  by mosquito biting somebody and then biting someone else when you have a
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:35.900]  situation like this and you don't really truly understand all the modes of
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.780]  transmission and I would suggest that they truly don't understand all the
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:43.180]  modes of transmission or you wouldn't have 200 nurses and doctors who have
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:47.060]  died in country I mean are they just being are they just overworked and tired
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:51.020]  making careless mistakes are they being cavalier about the protocols or are
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:53.940]  there methods of and modes of transmission that they don't fully
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:58.220]  understand you have to air on the side of caution that's why we say they ought
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.020]  to stop flights and they ought to allow you know if they're going to have
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:05.700]  somebody come into the country they need to be quarantined for 21 days Kelly and
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:08.740]  Texas you're on the air go ahead Kelly
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:14.980]  Good afternoon. God bless you both. Hey, typically this patient that went to the
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.340]  hospital and then he was turned away is it not common I think it's typically
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:25.420]  they send you to a pharmacy to get your meds and not getting to you there at the
[01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:29.020]  hospital since they send him away and also the second person if it was a
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:33.620]  family member did they not know go to a store or somewhere to get this person
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:40.260]  food or stuff for comfort and liquids and wasn't there a story out that they
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.980]  proven that Ebola was airborne between piglets and monkeys they ended up
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:49.340]  having to slaughter all of them because of that that's right I was a 2012
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:54.900]  Canadian study they basically took pigs put them in a pen with monkeys separated
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.980]  only by a wire fence pigs infected with the Ebola virus and the monkeys caught
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:04.180]  the virus via airborne transmission via the respiratory system and they died
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:08.660]  basically so they proved that at least to a limited extent Ebola had gone
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:15.380]  airborne back in 2012 the Associated Press is reporting that 16 to 18 people
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:20.460]  are now being monitored as having potentially been exposed to this Ebola
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:25.300]  virus there in Texas so as he said this individual could have gone to the to
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:28.580]  the pharmacy to get his antibiotics it could have gone to the store and then
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:32.660]  the 16 to 18 other people could have interacted you know with their family
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:36.220]  members with their friends with their relatives so this is obviously of
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:40.740]  concern but thanks for the call we're going to Joshua in Texas Joshua you're
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:45.660]  on the air go ahead yes actually I first I like to say thanks for taking my
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:50.620]  call I got in pretty quick I did what you guys suggested not did call this be a
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:57.580]  the White House I got a I got a hold of the I believe it was a comment board or
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:00.500]  something like that it was a switchboard and I asked the lady who was on there
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:04.820]  asked her why is the president not allowing flights to be stopped from
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:09.420]  West Africa when countries such as the United Arab Emirates France and
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:13.460]  Britain are doing so and she told me that she refused to comment on it and
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:18.460]  that she she would pass my comments long to the president I didn't ask her is
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:22.460]  does the president doing this intentionally this is if he's so
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:27.100]  incompetent that he's gonna allow this to continue and she refused to take my
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:30.620]  comments so I just wanted to go ahead and put that out there I just want to
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.820]  let you guys know that well that's precisely the issue I mean it is either
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:37.780]  the most astounding incompetence we've ever seen or it's a deliberate policy
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:42.780]  neither one of them a good outcome with this but we see this over and over again
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:48.540]  nobody in the government wants to say anything give us any information they
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:53.580]  have absolutely nothing but contempt for a right to know information and they
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:58.220]  just want to protect their job I think a good idea would be to maybe start a
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:02.300]  petition on the petitions.yhouse.gov website maybe we can get the writers
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:06.620]  on that it's probably already there to be honest I would assume that some some
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.900]  people have demanded that they hold flights out of West Africa in the past
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:13.940]  but we could start a new petition on that website write an article about it
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:17.260]  and get people behind that obviously only people in the United States can sign
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:21.380]  those petitions it's on record who they are so that might be a good way to
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:25.820]  corral people around this this urgent activist issue of trying to encourage
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:30.820]  the White House to stop those flights coming in out of West Africa. Dave in
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:35.460]  Texas you're on the air go ahead. Hey guys I just want to talk to you about
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:40.260]  something that I heard in that press conference that's ridiculous apparently
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:45.140]  this guy was sent home with antibiotics for a virus and by the way I'm an ER
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:49.380]  nurse I interviewed at Presbyterian Dallas last Friday it was in another
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:55.300]  department but getting back to this prescription you don't prescribe antibiotics
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:59.700]  for a virus yes not ever yes it's completely
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:04.460]  infected so them claiming that they were no there were no symptoms that's an
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.580]  absolute lie there had to have been symptoms to prescribe antibiotics
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:14.660]  period now those symptoms may not have been a virus but they were symptoms so
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:18.780]  you know that whole thing is a bunch of BS and as for you know not cancelling
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:23.660]  flights out of West Africa I don't think it takes a genius to realize you know
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:28.380]  specifically what's going on here because that's 101. We've actually got the
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:34.020]  name if I could just stop you there Dave of the Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:39.260]  is the name now being confirmed who left Liberia on September 19th arrived in
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:43.660]  Dallas the following day as we mentioned earlier he had to go through at least two
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:47.940]  other airports to get there maybe Brussels maybe Washington Doors maybe
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:53.780]  Paris but Thomas Eric Duncan has been named as the Ebola victim there in
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:58.260]  Dallas I saw another tweet I believe on the same article if you scroll down a
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:03.180]  little bit I'm saying that he's now in serious condition so he's not a he said
[01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:06.100]  us and they pointedly avoided that they said they said they asked him for his
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.660]  social security number when they were getting a prescription and he said he
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:13.420]  didn't have one they also have the name of his sister that he was visiting can
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:20.860]  you read that Paul it was my Duncan yeah my worry is the name of his sister not
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:24.900]  sure about the pronunciation study you are a H said he notes five officials that
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:28.420]  he was visiting from Liberia when they asked for his social security number and
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:33.140]  he told them he didn't have one so this is not a US citizen by the looks of it
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:38.500]  but now his name has been confirmed as Thomas Eric Duncan and now they're
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.580]  saying that he's in quote serious condition I believe in the press
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:46.020]  conference we went to earlier they said he was stable so it seems his condition
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:51.860]  has now worsened David night that's a shame I'm sorry to hear that you know
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.660]  to be clear they're not going to be able to stop flights coming from West
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:59.980]  Africa the United States because of course they're going to have to go to
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:03.740]  intermediate destinations before they get here there aren't any direct flights
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:08.780]  from Liberia but what they need to do is they need to vet individuals and not
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:14.100]  clear them for flight to the United States if they are not quarantined and
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.980]  so that that needs to be it needs to be focused on that then in terms of the
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:20.860]  detail of policy of course aren't any direct flights I know people are going
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:24.300]  to complain about that yes we are aware that you can't get a direct flight from
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:28.100]  Liberia to the United States nevertheless the principle involved that
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:32.700]  you're going to vet people that you're going to watch them the same way they do
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:37.700]  dogs coming into the United Kingdom it's just a quarantine method and it's a way
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:41.460]  to keep it contained before it gets to the point where they're going to start
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:45.980]  enacting martial law and letting FEMA run riot over the United States which is
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:48.740]  really what they want that's what they've been preparing for they haven't
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:52.060]  been preparing for containment of a disease they've been preparing for
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:55.980]  containment of the population and this is what they want they want something to
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:50:00.820]  to happen I believe that it's not staggering and confidence I believe that
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:04.860]  it's a deliberate plan that they're deliberately opening the borders and not
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:11.260]  screening people for these diseases and a lot of these Africans coming in
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:14.780]  flying into Europe for example are obviously immigrants France has a lot
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:19.020]  of African immigrants air France from the article I was reading earlier they
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:23.980]  did ban direct flights from Liberia so obviously those those first ports of
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:29.020]  call in many countries Arab Emirates United Arab Emirates was the other one
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:33.660]  they have banned certain flights coming in from West Africa so they've taken that

[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.020]  Gerald Solente is coming up in the next segment we're going to switch gears talk
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:34.860]  about Syria geopolitics the Middle East and the latest financial news but now
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:38.580]  we're going to go to the final two callers Alex in Wisconsin you're on the
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:45.220]  air go ahead yes go ahead yeah I work in mold and a
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:49.020]  specific remediation and I just can't help ever I'm following the Ebola
[01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:53.220]  situation and I can't help that even the most basic things we use for
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:58.220]  contaminate contamination in our suit such as duct taping over the sleeve work
[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.300]  and at the ankles they're just not doing anything and it's really kind of
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:08.060]  surprising me well I was wondering if you guys think it's possibly some sort of
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:12.940]  false flag operations I've heard things that they maybe somebody poisoning the
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:18.260]  wells down there which is causing similar symptoms to Ebola yeah I mean
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.860]  there've been a lot of theories from the local population in those African
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:27.340]  countries about that potential you know false flag deliberate infection testing
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:31.180]  by the United States none of that's been confirmed but those rumors have been
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:35.100]  flying and yet I mean hundreds of health workers have died you would expect
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:39.460]  them to take the proper precautions given that it's not airborne as far as
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:43.260]  we're being told but hundreds have died we're gonna fit in the final call here
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.300]  Robert in Canada go ahead Robert hey thanks for having me on listen it's quite
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:52.900]  obvious people need to wake up on this issue it you know right now there's a
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:58.980]  purposely enforced globalist governmental negligence in force right now
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:04.580]  we need to continue to link this issue with other past issues like AIDS
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:08.460]  genetically altering our food to make us sick there's been a huge population
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:15.460]  control program that's been in effect from the US since the 1950s linking back
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:20.340]  to Tuskegee and we need to continue to link this with what's going on now and
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:23.540]  they want this to get out they wanted to get out even if this is a testing ground
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.620]  they wanted to get out we don't know if it's the big one but it's a testing
[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:30.540]  ground if it's not the big one and people need to wake up like out here in
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:36.140]  Canada they're asleep out here they're absolutely asleep you know they're not
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:39.660]  concerned look at the look at the public how they're not concerned about this in
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:44.180]  the US they're not because that good old USA is gonna take care of us well that's
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:50.740]  a myth and they're asleep because this is how deep this is really how deep that
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:57.140]  the brainwashing is in the US and around the world it's very it runs very deep
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:01.620]  and this is why these people the public the mass public is hard to reach you
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:05.620]  know let me jump in here and say this is about population control is about
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:09.100]  population control via martial laws about population control reducing the
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:14.460]  number of people they see people as a disease that's the whole Gaia theory so
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.820]  they're not concerned about controlling this disease they want to control
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:22.060]  population in every sense of the word absolutely you're you're exactly right
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:26.620]  and now we're saying New York Times reporting health officials in Dallas say
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.780]  Wednesday they believe the man who is first confirmed case of Bolivars in the
[01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:34.660]  country had come into contact with 12 to 18 people including some school
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:40.380]  children when he was experiencing symptoms so now 12 to 18 people
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:45.660]  potentially exposed to the Ebola virus we're going to continue to track this
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:50.060]  Gerald Salente coming up after the break David Knight final comments on this
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:54.500]  Ebola situation as we prepare to switch gears here we just had the first caller
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:57.900]  that we had in this segment talking about how he worked in the mold and asbestos
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:02.420]  industries where they they sealed things off even with duct tape when they
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:05.580]  brought these fellows over the first people they brought over they weren't
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:10.580]  putting them in level four biohazard facilities and we interviewed people who
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:14.260]  worked on development were trying to develop Ebola vaccines and they were
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:19.460]  absolutely appalled at the lack of proper procedures that were being taken
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.700]  with the people that were being born in this country as well as into the UK
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:27.300]  third hour coming up with Gerald Salente gonna switch gears talk about

[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:20.420]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.980]  Alex Jones
[02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:31.380]  third hour of the Alex Jones show is Wednesday October 1st 2014 edition
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:36.220]  Gerald Tolente coming up rounding up the Ebola news now of course we just went
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.140]  to the press conference earlier with Joe Biggs live on the scene Governor Rick
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:45.380]  Perry and other health officials CDC officials trying to obviously downplay
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:50.060]  the situation prevent hysteria as I said earlier that the bigger threat than
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:55.620]  Ebola maybe the hysteria that could be engendered as a result of maybe the
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.380]  mishandling of this situation which appears to be the case with this Ebola
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:05.340]  victim who was not diagnosed on his first hospital visit he was given
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:11.700]  antibiotics and sent home will CDC activate emergency measures after Ebola
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:15.340]  confirmed in US that was our story yesterday which was linked up on the
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:21.300]  drudge report obviously we've got these provisions in place by the CDC to
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:26.700]  quarantine healthy persons who do not show symptoms of the disease under the
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:31.460]  medical martial law infrastructure that has been established in the United
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:36.460]  States for well over a decade but on the flip side David Knight they're now
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:41.420]  saying obviously trying to downplay the situation and I noticed quite a
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:46.300]  simpering a lecture tone from both the mainstream media and the health
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:51.580]  authorities saying don't panic don't get worked up about this and yet they're
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:55.140]  the ones who have dropped the ball so we should really be asking even harder
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.500]  question trust us we're the professionals there's nothing to worry
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.620]  about we've trained on this we've got this we've been working on this for a
[02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:05.180]  long time and yet they do not address why they sent the guy home failed to
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:08.780]  diagnose and then when the press conference started and they are actually
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.340]  able to ask questions of course that was one of the first questions that people
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:16.140]  came up with is how could you possibly miss this and well we just didn't have
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:20.700]  the information why because they didn't ask for it we have that question the
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:24.260]  methods of transmission whether they fully understand it as I mentioned
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:28.060]  before one of the doctors that's currently being treated for Ebola and
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:31.740]  it's interesting that the way he's being treated is with blood transfusions
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:36.460]  from Dr. Brantley who survived and that's something that's developed as a
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:41.580]  large black market in the blood of survivors in Africa but he believes
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:46.260]  that he got it from performing a cesarean on someone that was not diagnosed
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:50.060]  and the question is well if it's as simple as just checking their temperature
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.660]  if you're working in a country where there is a Ebola pandemic and you're not
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:57.940]  checking people's temperature in the hospital I mean what's I just don't
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:02.900]  understand that but I would be curious to know how Dr. Brantley and others
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:07.140]  believe that they contracted this disease we've had over 200 doctors and
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:13.820]  nurses have died in West Africa many of them many of them westerners and so it
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:18.460]  isn't a question of them having a different protocol than the CDC or
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:21.620]  Western Medical Authorities are saying these are people who are coming over
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:26.420]  exercising the CDC protocols and still contracting the disease so does that tell
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:30.140]  us that they're being careless about this or are they just not understand
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:34.780]  fully the mode of transmission and we've got an interesting quote actually as you
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:39.540]  mentioned there David Dr. Kent Brantley a survivor of the disease obviously he
[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:44.020]  reacted to this latest case this first case of Ebola in the United States with
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:48.100]  the following comment which is really interesting it sounds quite volatile but
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.540]  he said many have used the analogy of a fire burning out of control to describe
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:58.020]  this unprecedented Ebola outbreak indeed it is a fire it's a fire straight
[02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:02.660]  from the pit of hell we cannot fool ourselves into thinking the vast moat
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:07.780]  of the Atlantic Ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire instead we
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:13.580]  must mobilize the resources to keep entire nations from being reduced to
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:18.700]  ashes and there you see the article up from Dr. Kent Brantley who was a
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:24.980]  survivor of Ebola quite inflammatory and be clear in places like Liberia where
[02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:29.420]  this guy who's currently being treated in Dallas with Ebola where he came from
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:33.500]  in that country in its early on they are not showing any signs of getting this
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:37.580]  under containment it is still spreading they have had some success in Nigeria but
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:41.980]  not in those countries it is still expanding we'll be back after the break

[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:20.460]  research journal obviously you've been so accurate in many of your predictions
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:24.020]  not just over the last few years but literally going back decades we're going
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:28.300]  to list some of those later but one of your most recent topics was of course
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:32.900]  Syria following fools blindly into war again and again you know last year we
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:37.580]  had huge opposition to a potential intervention in Syria back after the
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:43.540]  chemical weapons attack in 2013 now with ISIS on the table the the opinion
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:47.420]  polls seem to suggest that Americans have shifted now most of them support
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:52.820]  the attack on Syria in the name of defeating ISIS what do you think is
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:57.700]  the explanation behind that shift in public opinion well propaganda is a
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:02.940]  good business to get into you could do it cheaply and get great results let's go
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:07.820]  back and tracking trends as an understanding of where we are how we
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:12.500]  got here and where we're going so how did we get here well most recently we
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:19.020]  got here you mentioned that the Obama administration wanted to send bombs away
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:26.860]  into Syria over a year ago but because of Putin and pushing for Syria to get
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:31.700]  rid of their chemical weapons and the United Kingdom's Parliament not going
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:37.220]  along with it Congress also not going along with the administration back down
[02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:44.540]  so now how did it happen all of a sudden Obama shows up we got to save them
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:49.500]  Christians on the mountain you remember that one those you and those Yazidis
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:53.580]  everybody knows what he is it is you got one living around the block from you
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:58.820]  and everybody boy this isn't that we're not going back into Iraq I want to make
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:04.740]  this perfectly clear this is a humanitarian mission girls and boys so
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:10.620]  you got the setup right now all of a sudden they'd be head two guys oh my
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:16.940]  own a you be headed two guys what evil sick people who would be head two guys
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:23.980]  now how about was it over a million people that the United States and its
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:30.820]  coalition of the willing have killed in Iran in Iran excuse me in Iraq and
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:36.140]  Afghanistan since the war on terror began and we had to get rid of Saddam
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:40.300]  Hussein's weapons mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda that didn't exist you
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:45.500]  could bomb them that's cool man but no beheadings what happened over there in
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:51.180]  in Gaza 2100 people what's going on over in Ukraine they're only Eastern
[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:57.540]  European Russians you could bomb them kill them but don't behead anybody and
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:04.540]  everybody bought the beheading baloney oh yeah you're really evil when you behead
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:11.100]  people hey another drone strike over there in Yemen hey how many in South
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:17.740]  Waziristan and North Waziristan from the Nobel Peace Prize winner who is quoted
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:21.980]  as saying hey I'm really good at killing people so you could drone you could
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:29.100]  bomb you could napalm you could agent orange you could deplete uranium white
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:35.740]  phosphorus but no beheadings and everybody bought the beheading baloney go
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:41.140]  back to your country go back to the end of August that little chicken or Cameron
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:46.580]  shooting off his mouth oh now we got a terror alert terror alert how about the
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:52.460]  clown over there in Australia Abbott the other part of Costello oh yeah terror
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:59.620]  alert 800 cops to arrest 15 people and they only can got one up on charges of
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:05.580]  nothing but it works you spread fear and hysteria and that's what they're
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:13.060]  playing man the fear and hysteria card and 73% of the American people are
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:19.300]  buying it along with a lot of the Brits and the Australians and other so-called
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:24.940]  Westerners and talking about beheadings Gerald I mean Saudi Arabia they've
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:30.260]  beheaded more people in the last month alone than ISIS ever had simply because
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:34.660]  of that their brutal justice system which is it being in place for for
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:38.460]  generations and of course Saudi Arabia were one of the countries that funded
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:44.260]  the so-called moderate Syrian rebels who sold weapons to ISIS who defected to
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:49.380]  ISIS in huge numbers back around six months to a year ago now we're talking
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:53.700]  about the Obama administration again arming the so-called moderate Syrian
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:58.180]  rebels even though many of the units there have pledged allegiance not only
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:03.220]  to Al Qaeda groups like Jabhat al-Muzra but also to ISIS units themselves and
[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:08.300]  given them weapons and actually handed over some of the individuals that were
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:13.100]  allegedly beheaded the American journalist James Foley so Gerald how do
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:17.620]  you feel about the hypocrisy of you know Saudi Arabia Jordan Qatar being involved
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:21.540]  in this so-called war on ISIS when they were responsible for the for the
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:25.780]  upspring of ISIS in the region in the first place well exactly that's why I
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:29.940]  follow your work by the way you put it together very well and you laid out all
[02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:34.300]  the facts and the other fact is that nobody's talking about in the major
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:40.180]  media the mainstream media is that hey who created these conditions who
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:46.980]  destroyed entire nations who killed millions of people who who laid the
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:51.980]  groundwork for the radicalism now let's take it anybody out there yourself
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:59.660]  myself anyone listening you live in a rock boy or neighboring country like
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:04.220]  Syria oh by the way just going back to Obama before I go ahead you know he
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:08.620]  was yelling about those Christians on the mountain over there in Syria but the
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:13.660]  cat had locked your when they were slaughtering Christians those ISIS
[02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:18.060]  people that you were mentioning that the Arab Little League funded when they
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:23.860]  wiped out entire Christian villages in Syria destroyed ancient Christian
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:30.340]  villages in Syria but that was okay so now fast-forwarding to where we are here
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:35.980]  you live in one of these countries everybody that you love has been killed
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:41.660]  you have no future you didn't have enough money to get out of there but the
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:46.740]  people that did the tens of millions of that left you know they saw what was
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:54.020]  coming your whole nation is destroyed the places in ruins you think you want
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:17:02.620]  to get even for the people that did it for you no man you is a radical you're
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:10.340]  a fundamentalist and a terrorist don't you know that it's better for you to
[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:15.860]  listen to the occupiers and the puppets the corrupt puppets that they put in
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:21.300]  place to run and ruin your life than to think for yourself to be on your own so
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:29.220]  no one's talking about the war criminals that started these wars based on lies
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:39.900]  BS Blair Dick Cheney Bush Rumsfeld Colin Powell Condoleezza Rice all the ones
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:48.380]  that saw these wars based on lies or maybe I got they got a better word in
[02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:53.820]  that white shoe world they misled us isn't that a nice word so what I'm
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:59.540]  saying to you Paul they created conditions for this horror and now the
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:06.420]  same mad men and mad women that got it going we got a new plan new strategies
[02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:11.420]  we're gonna fix it this time they have nothing but track records of failure
[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:17.500]  behind them and now they're shooting off their mouths every retired general
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:26.740]  military strategist think tank expert are showing up on the news and telling us
[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:30.940]  here's what we got to do we got to do this we got to do that when all they
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:39.180]  have is failure and disaster as a track record of credentials they're leading us
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:46.460]  as we wrote before in the trends journal to the first great war of the 21st
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:54.340]  century it's underway you mentioned that again the the airstrikes flooding the
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:58.860]  region with with weapons I mean we have this false dichotomy being imposed on
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:03.140]  as you know obama is being weak on ISIS we hear that from Fox News and a lot of
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:09.100]  the right-wing media when every single statistical academic study has proven
[02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:13.500]  that flooding the Middle East with weapons and carrying out airstrikes
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:19.340]  radicalizes the region and creates more terrorists this is a known fact it's not
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:23.740]  conjecture you know this this idea of oh we have to we have to be strong we have
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:27.220]  to bomb them out of existence it doesn't work it only ever creates more
[02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:30.820]  resentment it radicalizes the region creates more terrorists I mean look at
[02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:35.820]  Obama in Libya funding the radical jihadists they later went into Syria now
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:40.020]  those those secular governments Gaddafi Assad have been destabilized we're seeing
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:44.380]  this radical jihadist militant ideology spread across the region and it's a
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:48.340]  deliberate result of the airstrikes of flooding the region with weapons we'll
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:52.820]  be back after the break with Gerald Salente this is the Alex Jones show live

[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:43.740]  the left hand side there Gerald's forecast and scroll down the page you
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:48.620]  will see a list a number of different events a development so over the past
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:52.540]  20 or so years Gerald has accurately predicted of course he's known for
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:57.260]  predicting the panic of 08 the financial meltdown but also the stock market
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:03.140]  crash 1987 the gold bull run which began in December 2001 and what's
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:06.860]  interesting is he has links to the trends journal next to each of these
[02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:11.940]  predictions where he accurately made the forecast and it's not just you know
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:16.700]  wider events like the financial collapse it's it's smaller cultural type of
[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:20.860]  things which I always find interesting like the the clean food revolution if
[02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:25.260]  you keep scrolling down there the decline of US auto makers even things like
[02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:31.300]  gourmet coffee as far back as 1988 Gerald was talking about the rise in
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:35.420]  interest in that sort of thing too big to fail trend the ghost mauling of
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:41.580]  America just a number of different events and little developments both in
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:45.140]  culture and health in food basically anything anything you want to think
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:49.780]  about the secessionist movement we now see that rising again across Europe so
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:54.940]  Gerald I mean basically you've got this down to a fine art I mean how what's the
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:58.140]  secret how do you do it is it just looking back at history and and
[02:25:58.140 --> 02:26:02.260]  transposing that onto current events how do you make all these forecasts and get
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:08.780]  it right so often thank you current events form future trends but people look
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:14.140]  at them in a sense of this is what I believe this is what I want this is what
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:21.060]  I think and we look at them as just facts we try to get as many facts as we can so
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:27.140]  for example each day I'll read from Fars news agency in Iran to Al Jazeera to
[02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:35.740]  Hades the Israeli Jerusalem post to the BBC Guardian blacklisted news on and
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:40.580]  on and on all I'm doing is looking for facts are they real facts I don't know
[02:26:40.580 --> 02:26:45.660]  but you put enough together and you can get the sense so what happens again Paul
[02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:50.780]  is that when you go to a doctor or you listen to a scientist all you want are
[02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:54.380]  the facts you don't care what their belief systems are what their gender
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:27:00.220]  creed is so when you're looking you mentioned before about Fox too many
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:04.460]  people out there have an agenda so what they're doing is just skewing the
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:09.740]  information to fit their belief system we're looking at it for what it is so
[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:15.900]  for example people are now following Barack Obama again to war again the
[02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:21.460]  numbers are there 73% support the bombing of a sovereign nation called
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:29.860]  Syria okay now what's Obama's track record well he has six years of nothing
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:36.340]  but broken promises a string of failures and a real bad attitude so why would I
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:42.780]  believe anything else that he's going to do yet they do and they'll defend him so
[02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:47.540]  what happens is and you look around the world the same things happen in a time
[02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:52.220]  of crisis and they made up the story of hey we got to watch them ISIS they're
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:57.420]  everywhere the fear and hysteria sells real well so I'm going to give you a
[02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:04.180]  forecast not only has the first great war of the 21st century occurred get
[02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:08.700]  ready for a terrorist strike or that's what they're going to call it you could
[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:12.980]  call it as we used to say in the Bronx paybacks a bitch it's going to be
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:18.140]  reprisal strikes for what the United States and its allies are doing in the
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:24.020]  slaughter of millions of innocent people the facts show 90% of wars I
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:30.620]  believe since World War one 90% of the casualties of civilians so will it be
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:38.180]  false flag or real it's incidental it'll be an excuse it'll be an excuse to rob us
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:43.980]  of more of our rights you're hearing it already it's more of an excuse for the
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:50.340]  militarization of the police force it's more of an excuse for fascism the
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:55.420]  merger of state and corporate powers and take over our lives how could any how
[02:28:55.420 --> 02:29:00.060]  could any sensible human being believe what's coming out of the mouth of the
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:05.340]  congressmen and these politicians around the world saying that they're going to
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:10.460]  put in plans to stop them terrorists from striking the homeland let me get
[02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:17.140]  this straight you can't stop a guy from jumping over the White House fence you
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:23.540]  can't stop a guy from running inside and running through the joint you can't
[02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:31.020]  stop millions of illegals coming over the border including tens of thousands of
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:35.940]  little kids unescorted but now you're gonna rob me of my money and rob me of
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:42.420]  my rights under the line that you're gonna protect us from terrorists okay
[02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:46.780]  more from Gerald Flante coming up after the break stay there your calls coming

[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:34.100]  info wars.com we're right on top of that but for the moment we're talking with
[02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:39.420]  Gerald Solente trends research.com and if you missed it before the break Gerald
[02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:44.740]  made a pretty big forecast he's saying that as a result of the attacks in the
[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:49.740]  Middle East supposedly targeting ISIS there will be whether it's a false flag
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:56.300]  or an organic genuine attack there will be a terror attack within the US here
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:34:00.900]  coming up in the imminent future and as I said you know every single university
[02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:06.300]  study proves that bombing the Middle East radicalizing jihadists flooding the
[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:12.180]  region with weapons only ever causes blowback only ever causes more violence
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:18.540]  Gerald just before you go to calls finishing off your point on that. Yes you
[02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:22.900]  know we have to really go back to the beginning when it not the beginning the
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:27.820]  beginning but this latest round and that really happened after World War one
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:34.620]  when a bunch of colonial powers led by the United Kingdom and France caught the
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:39.580]  joint up from the Ottoman Empire I mean look at the map the Sykes-Picot lines
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:44.580]  these straight lines making up these countries that never existed before and
[02:34:44.580 --> 02:34:50.620]  the colonization that's continued so there's no end in sight as long as the
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:55.780]  colonial powers continue their imperialism I just want to shift gears
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:35:01.180]  here for just a moment because as we were on the air there's a lot of
[02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:09.180]  destabilization going on in the equity markets the Dow is down about 220 points
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:16.980]  crude oil after being up over a buck both West Texas and Brent is down now in
[02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:22.620]  negative territory and it's very significant and gold prices are moving
[02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:29.580]  back up a little bit I'm saying this because oil prices are a real big one
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:34.580]  to look at I've been at this since you know I began my career I was a lobbyist
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:40.100]  a government affairs specialist for the chemical industry I was in DC during a
[02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:49.780]  1973 oil embargo this is the first time since that time that Saudi Arabia has
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:57.460]  pushed and has been successful in cutting oil production it's not because
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.620]  there's an oversupply on the contrary if you look out today's numbers with West
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:08.420]  Texas supplies a way down demand is way off and when you look at the World
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:14.180]  Energy Institute and other data you can see that demand is now down it's about
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:21.100]  down to two year lows and so is the pricing so this is really significant
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:26.220]  because oil is telling a true story right now with all of this political
[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:31.540]  unrest in the Middle East as you've mentioned a destabilization caused by
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:36.300]  that so-called humanitarian mission launched by President Obama the Nobel
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:41.900]  Peace Prize winner and his staff of associates Samantha Powers Susan Rice
[02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:47.580]  and Hillary Clinton and the production levels have dropped so dramatically
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:53.820]  there and in Iraq oil prices should go up as this destabilization increases
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:59.220]  they're not that's showing you the fundamental weaknesses of the global
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:10.940]  economy and this just out recently from the my glasses on here a second record
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:19.780]  level of 158 trillion dollars in global debt together with low economic
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:27.540]  growth is creating serious threat of a new financial crisis says the 16th
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:35.140]  annual Geneva report total world debt excluding the financial financial
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:41.780]  sector you ready for this has risen from a hundred and eighty percent of global
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:52.900]  output in 2008 to 2012 percent last year there's no way of getting out of this
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:59.380]  financial crisis you know how you get out of it when all else fails they take
[02:37:59.380 --> 02:38:04.620]  you to war all things are connected you asked me before about how we forecast
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:09.100]  trends we make connections between different fields you read over some of
[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:15.700]  the list from my courting the term clean food back in 1993 to talking about
[02:38:15.700 --> 02:38:21.460]  geopolitics and finance it's all connected but most people don't connect
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:25.300]  them they only look at specific fields so when we're looking at the Middle East
[02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:31.380]  we're looking at oil prices we're looking at GDP data coming out debt levels
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:35.780]  increasing you look at today's manufacturing indexes coming out of
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:42.140]  Germany and Europe they're down now into negative territory under 50 percent so
[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:47.180]  you can see where this is leading and you can see where the leaders are
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:53.500]  leading us the same people that have led us through nothing but a series of great
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:39:00.740]  financial and military disasters are in control and leading us down the path of
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:08.900]  more doom and decline we're talking the Middle East oil debt with Gerald Solante
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:12.220]  we're going to go to some calls now James in Illinois you're on the air with
[02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:15.900]  Gerald Solante go ahead James
[02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:24.380]  Gerald are you there I'm here yeah great show I got a quick question I just
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:29.660]  sold my house I got about a hundred and twenty K I got two and a half years to go
[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:34.780]  before I can start pulling my pension I want to move to the south where do I put
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:40.500]  my money if I put it in gold or in silver that's my question is that a good
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:47.300]  place for and where can I let me see how can I do that with through a reputable
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:51.860]  reputable dealer that doesn't that doesn't catch me to the government no
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:56.860]  strings that's my question yeah you know I wish I could answer that question for
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:40:03.020]  you I can't I'm not a financial analyst or and I don't have I'm not licensed so
[02:40:03.020 --> 02:40:08.100]  if I said anything to you they would come clamping down on me and you know the
[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:12.100]  motto of the Trends Journal talked to me by my dear father made a soul rest in
[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:16.380]  peace anytime I'd be saying something he'd say think for yourself and that's
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:20.460]  where I would leave it with you think for yourself real estate doesn't
[02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:25.020]  necessarily have to be a bad deal you know it depends what you're buying and
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:30.420]  what your plans are to do with it if it's a speculative deal I would say that's
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:36.540]  not for me gold I'll tell you where I'm going with gold and I'm by the way I'm
[02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:42.580]  only invested in gold major and real estate but I buy I buy historic
[02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:50.580]  buildings I have a 1750 a 1774 and a 1763 plus the building we're in here the
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:55.260]  Mohegan markets which is a beautiful old you know hundred-year-old building and
[02:40:55.260 --> 02:41:01.620]  but I buy and I believe in gold prices but here's what I think is going to
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:08.420]  happen I believe that they're going to have to raise interest rates the economy
[02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:12.540]  cannot sustain itself with interest rates going up because that's the only
[02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:16.540]  thing that's propping up the housing market which is now softening again and
[02:41:16.540 --> 02:41:21.020]  the equity markets which are now softening again when they raise interest
[02:41:21.020 --> 02:41:26.340]  rates they'll be panic on the street back to gold I believe the downside gold
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:36.380]  is 1150 around there but the upside potential is well over 2000 so for me
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:42.060]  I'm in gold for my golden years I used to trade it as a young guy my first buy
[02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:47.940]  was in 19 late 1970s at a hundred and a hundred eighty seven dollars and fifty
[02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:53.900]  cents an ounce so to me when you invest in these things again I invest in real
[02:41:53.900 --> 02:41:57.500]  estate with my heart I'm not you know I'm not stupid I'm not going to do it to
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:02.300]  lose money but if I don't make a lot of money on it it's okay because I know I
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:07.580]  have a valuable asset in buying historic buildings in gold as I said I'm in it
[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:12.860]  long term and I believe in it because why would I want paper that's been the
[02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:19.740]  valued over 90 percent in a hundred years thanks for the call James Jim in
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:24.500]  Illinois you're on the eye with Gerald Salante go ahead Jim hi how you doing
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:31.860]  today good I've got a question for you this Alex Jones is scared myself and
[02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:35.540]  probably half the nation as far as these globalists are concerned the fear
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:40.260]  they put into all of us and I have a way to try out suggestion to stop these
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:47.540]  people and it can be done with the help of him if he puts out a website with
[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:52.740]  their names phone numbers and addresses on it and I guarantee in six months the
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:56.420]  people of America will make it very uncomfortable for these people to even
[02:42:56.420 --> 02:43:03.300]  exist and try and do harm to America okay go ahead Gerald they're in front of you
[02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:09.460]  already I mean they call the president the Congress I mean what what's self

[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:34.940]  decrepit old man pulling the levers it's what you see and by the way we're
[02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:42.260]  doing something to change it on May 2nd of 2015 from the most historic corner in
[02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:47.380]  the United States the only place where there's a pre-revolutionary war stone
[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:52.060]  building we have permission to close down the cross streets and we're setting
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:44:00.500]  up our movement occupy peace dot us you can go to the website no foreign
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:06.620]  entanglements this is the foundation upon which the Constitution was founded
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:11.300]  right in this area every one of the founding fathers beginning with
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:18.300]  Washington a real commander-in-chief a guy that fought not these little chicken
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:23.460]  hooks they can't fight their way out of a paper bed no foreign entanglements in
[02:44:23.460 --> 02:44:30.180]  his farewell address Madison Jefferson every one of them Franklin so we're
[02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:37.020]  doing something we believe that America can return to the greatness that it was
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:43.060]  that made it the land of opportunity no foreign entanglements rebuild America I
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:49.060]  have a story for you right out of today's Wall Street Journal here it is
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:55.100]  fighting Islamic State strains the budget Congress and the president are
[02:44:55.100 --> 02:45:01.300]  under pressure to bolster Pentagon coffers to fund expanding efforts in the
[02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:06.300]  Middle East and you're heard by our commander-in-chief if you listen to his
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:14.100]  UN speech which we broke down we may be there for another 10 years or more
[02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:21.860]  unending war one after another and then you pick up the news and what do you see
[02:45:21.860 --> 02:45:29.020]  over there in Detroit federal judge rules Detroit residents have no
[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:35.700]  fundamental right to water you got it we have all this money to fight and
[02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:42.140]  kill other people but can't pay your water bill the hell with you and by the
[02:45:42.140 --> 02:45:48.660]  way as I look at it again only speaking for myself anyone that that supports
[02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:54.660]  war these kinds of war a supporting murder and I'm not a pacifist I'm a
[02:45:54.660 --> 02:46:00.020]  close combat practitioner at my own school for many years I believe in
[02:46:00.020 --> 02:46:06.420]  self-defense but I don't believe in murdering innocent people and here you
[02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:11.820]  have it they're calling for more of our money that Eisenhower warned us against
[02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:18.660]  the military industrial complex from stealing it as the nation's infrastructure
[02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:25.660]  rats and they this judge could give a flying anything about people that are
[02:46:25.660 --> 02:46:32.400]  too poor to pay for their water hey Obama where's you the humanitarian mission
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:39.460]  Motown is no town but we got to save them your zitties on the mountain but
[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:43.820]  hey Gerald I mean Raytheon Boeing Northrop gunman they're all doing really
[02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:47.300]  well that stocks are through the roof I mean who cares about people in Detroit
[02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:51.060]  they've got no free water the the military industrial complex is really
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:55.940]  making good out of this new war on ISIS isn't it it's doing great and that's
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:47:00.860]  why people say you know mr. Solange you point out the problems but you don't

[02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:08.140]  copper depleted population parasites require an iron supply in the host to
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:12.540]  thrive and replicate just as chemical poisons parasites are propagated via
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:17.300]  the food and water supply and vaccines those born after 1945 have the vaccine
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:21.340]  parasites the vaccine parasites have a virulence level that will trigger mass
[02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:25.500]  activation now due to iron accumulating at an unprecedented rate this is why
[02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:28.900]  disease symptoms and conditions are exploding in prevalence disease is
[02:52:28.900 --> 02:52:32.380]  caused by the same underlying condition iron poisoning and low copper status
[02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:37.460]  measles Ebola entero viruses are nanoparticle parasites so when the
[02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:41.180]  officials say to prepare for pandemics it is because they know of attempts to
[02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:44.780]  release a virulent parasites into the population and they know the vaccine
[02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:48.780]  parasites are about to activate on a mass scale this is the plan for expedient

[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:22.620]  final segment of the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente Gerald I just wanted to
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:25.860]  get your take on this because I know you've covered the secessionist movement
[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:30.580]  in many issues of the trends journal a couple of days ago I wrote an article
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:35.580]  about how the CFR in their foreign affairs magazine basically admitted
[02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:39.860]  that this populist uprising was sweeping America was sweeping Europe of course we
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:43.140]  saw a narrow defeat for Scottish independence recently but we see
[02:54:43.140 --> 02:54:48.180]  similar a similar wave of uprisings in places like Catalonia Finland the UK
[02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:52.820]  Denmark of course with the rejection of the European Union they said in their
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:58.300]  own words they need to quote co-opt this populist uprising and kind of dismiss
[02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:03.020]  it away you know the squirrel it down a rabbit hole to diffuse its impact
[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:08.500]  diffuse its power so how do you see them stopping this juggernaut of populism or
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:11.500]  is it simply to run away too powerful to stop
[02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:15.980]  well the way they'll try to stop it is they'll try to they'll beat up any body
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:21.700]  and any groups that that want to have it so you see with any kind of street
[02:55:21.700 --> 02:55:25.900]  protest and by the way what's going on in Hong Kong certainly not a populist
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:31.340]  movement but in in many ways it is in that they want to break away from the
[02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:37.220]  communist rule of China who has put a law into place that the Communist Party
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:41.540]  vets the candidates who they can vote for and it's the young people that are
[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:46.140]  doing that are uprising because they have no jobs and the jobs that they do
[02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:50.860]  have that are available they're giving it to cheaper Chinese labor that they're
[02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:55.620]  bringing in and then we have of course coming up in Catalonia and you have
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:56:00.300]  Rahoy the prime minister of Spain trying to stop that from coming even to a
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:04.860]  vote saying it's illegal and as you mentioned the other populist movements
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:10.140]  going on in Germany with their new party in Sweden and it's very important
[02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:17.740]  also Paul to listen to the language if it's an upright if it's a populist
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:22.700]  movement it's very funny in in Germany where they want to bail out of the
[02:56:22.700 --> 02:56:28.500]  Euro and they want to bring nationalism back to the nation how dare they they
[02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:32.820]  call it a right-wing movement what's happening in Sweden however they're
[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:37.180]  calling it a left-wing movement even though they're also against their big
[02:56:37.180 --> 02:56:41.420]  anti-immigration movement because what's happened again going back to our
[02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:45.860]  global nomic methodology of tracking trends all things are connected where
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:50.060]  are the immigrants coming from you I mean you're over there in Europe you know
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:56.540]  the deal they're coming over by boats that are that are sinking that desperate
[02:56:56.540 --> 02:57:01.940]  people fleeing whether it's Palestine whether it's fleeing Libya Tunisia
[02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:08.820]  Egypt Mali the other country that thanks to the overthrow of Qaddafi has been
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:13.180]  overrun by the so-called Islamic militants and by the way this has nothing
[02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:17.300]  to do with Islam it's a bunch of desperate crazy people that are doing
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:21.540]  anything they can in places that have been corrupt and robbed and destroyed
[02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:26.140]  but anyway so you see the massive immigration flows coming into Europe
[02:57:26.140 --> 02:57:30.740]  there's no stopping them you see them coming into the United States there's
[02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:34.980]  no stopping them oh by the way one of the plans of occupied peace and bringing
[02:57:34.980 --> 02:57:40.420]  home the troops seal the borders we got a job for the military so what I'm
[02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:45.020]  saying is these populist movements are going to continue to gain in strength as
[02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:50.100]  a matter of fact I believe it was yesterday that Ron Paul was again
[02:57:50.100 --> 02:57:55.180]  brought up the popular the secessionist movements it's the future and the people
[02:57:55.180 --> 02:58:01.020]  can have the future if they choose to take it in their own hands okay Gerald
[02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:05.260]  Tolent say that brings us nicely to the end of the show trends research comm
[02:58:05.260 --> 02:58:10.340]  and occupy peace dot us is the other website correct that's correct Gerald
