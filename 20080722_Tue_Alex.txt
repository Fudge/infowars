[00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:06.535]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:08.316]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:10.056]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:11.637]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.198]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:17.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:30.126]  A lot of very important economic developments have been taking place in the last 24 hours.
[00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:33.528]  We'll be covering them for 30 minutes.
[00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:40.698]  In an hour and a half from now, with Bob Chapman, our first guest.
[00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:54.110]  Then, for two hours, Dr. Nick Begich to talk about a host of issues, from what GMO foods are doing, to the government deploying microwave guns and sound weapons against the population.
[00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.716]  A lot of the different patents that are declassified, but still little known to the general public.
[00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:11.055]  Some of the different surveillance tools and mind control devices already deployed for decades against the people of this country and the rest of the world.
[00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:24.260]  We'll be talking to Dr. Nick Begich about that and a host of other issues, always very compelling and very engaging, very thought-provoking, with Dr. Nick Begich coming up in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:31.968]  Now, I said yesterday I wanted to take a lot of calls in the first hour, and then I get on a rant, and I don't do it.
[00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:34.869]  I mean, we took some, but not as many as I'd like.
[00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.093]  I have said this many times, and I've succeeded a few times and failed most.
[00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:51.700]  I'm going to attempt to take a whole bunch of calls today in the first hour into the second hour, and then continuing throughout with Dr. Nick Baggage today.
[00:01:53.502 --> 00:01:55.584]  First-time callers go to the head of the line.
[00:01:55.584 --> 00:02:01.768]  The only card that can trump a first-time caller is someone who says that they disagree with me.
[00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:03.049]  We do not screen your calls, though.
[00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:10.275]  If you just wish to say your name's John Doe from Timbuktu, you can even declare yourself the King of Pluto.
[00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:10.915]  It doesn't matter.
[00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:11.476]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:11.636]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:12.777]  Now, in the news story here,
[00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.647]  Is imminent.
[00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:27.948]  Canada will be the test case.
[00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:35.652]  And Internet2, the international consortium, has announced their plan to shut down the web.
[00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:39.795]  I first learned of their public declaration about six years ago.
[00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:43.136]  We've written scores of articles on it.
[00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:50.380]  But now it is materializing in an even more bold and accelerated fashion than we had predicted.
[00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:55.348]  Generally, things are worse than we even say here on the show.
[00:02:55.348 --> 00:03:06.935]  Contrary to some people's conception that we fearmonger or exaggerate, no, I'd have to say 8 times out of 10 or so, it's much worse than we say.
[00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:17.841]  And then the other 20% of the time, it's pretty much split between we say it's worse than it is, or we get it dead on right.
[00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:23.184]  We're dead on absolutely right about 10% of the time.
[00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:24.605]  It's worse 80% of the time.
[00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:28.348]  That's my dead reckoning guesstimation.
[00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:32.812]  And about 10% of the time it's not as bad as we thought.
[00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:36.775]  And we certainly wish things were not as bad as they certainly clearly are.
[00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:43.440]  I mean with each passing day, each passing month, year, it becomes more apparent that our worst
[00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:54.824]  Our worst conclusions are the ones that appear to be correct.
[00:03:54.824 --> 00:04:06.197]  That the situation is far worse than even some of the greatest pessimists had thought with the psychopathic elite that's going for broke against humanity to set up a worldwide tyranny.
[00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:08.786]  Death of the free internet is imminent.
[00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:11.128]  Canada will be the test case.
[00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:13.930]  Also, the global economy is at the point of maximum danger.
[00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.436]  I mentioned this at the end of the show yesterday, but I want to read part of this London Telegraph article we have a link to up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:24.618]  If you want to find it, it's easy to find there.
[00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:28.841]  Also, American Express profit falls on higher defaults.
[00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:33.945]  These numbers are from Bloomberg, are some of the scariest we've seen in a while.
[00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:35.466]  It isn't just the housing market.
[00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:39.198]  Disintegrating.
[00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:43.041]  But other sectors of debt and commerce.
[00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:45.863]  Another report here about the Swan Song of Fannie Mae.
[00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:48.044]  It's gonna implode.
[00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:52.927]  And Top Rocket Scientist says there's no evidence for CO2 causing global warming.
[00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:57.950]  No, we won't be talking about Christian Bale who plays Batman being arrested.
[00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.353]  You got the wrong show.
[00:05:01.353 --> 00:05:03.834]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:05.595]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:06.376]  In the near future.
[00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.473]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:10.473 --> 00:05:13.295]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:16.078]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:19.281]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:26.567]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:35.075]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.075 --> 00:05:38.937]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:41.499]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world.
[00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:42.660]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.440]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.721]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:45.161]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.863]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:51.606]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:55.568]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:55.568 --> 00:05:56.349]  In Game.
[00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.350]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.411]  You have been warned.
[00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:07.719]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.665]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:17.809]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:19.811]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing
[00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:22.312]  I think so.
[00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:39.326]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:03.857]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:11.582]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:19.426]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:25.710]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:33.099]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:35.923]  Beware, be smart, and be ready.
[00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.965]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:48.593]  Families need this high-quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:52.555]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[00:07:52.555 --> 00:08:00.639]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.842]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:08.323]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:22.433]  We're going to go to your calls right now.
[00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:23.633]  Things are a little bit different today.
[00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:27.216]  At the bottom of the hour, I'll get into the death of the free internet is imminent.
[00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:32.399]  Canada will be the test case.
[00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:35.801]  Just like we've been telling you, the death of the dollar is imminent.
[00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:38.022]  And people deny it until it starts happening.
[00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:41.264]  Well, it has already started in mass.
[00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:44.967]  From China to the United States, from England to France.
[00:08:45.982 --> 00:08:54.404]  There is a concerted cocktail of different mechanisms being used to dismantle it wholesale in front of you.
[00:08:54.404 --> 00:09:05.846]  We are only two years, unless the people are awakened and start trying to block these different actions away from the Internet as you know it, no longer existing.
[00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:09.267]  T-minus two years.
[00:09:09.267 --> 00:09:10.507]  Mid-2010, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:14.309]  According to their announced numbers.
[00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:16.830]  They have declared war on it.
[00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:22.693]  But we've been bred from birth, trained from birth to live in denial.
[00:09:22.693 --> 00:09:24.374]  Don't say you weren't warned yet again.
[00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:28.976]  And there are tools, there are ways to fight this and we'll talk about some of those today.
[00:09:28.976 --> 00:09:31.377]  And of course what's happening with the economy and a lot more.
[00:09:31.377 --> 00:09:34.599]  Dr. Nick Baggage is joining us coming up about two hours from now.
[00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:40.542]  Bob Chapman about an hour and a half with popping in multiple times weekly to give us the latest developments in the markets.
[00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.113]  Right now let's go to your phone calls.
[00:09:45.113 --> 00:09:48.415]  Don in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:49.576]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.137]  Good.
[00:09:51.137 --> 00:10:05.525]  I would just like to say that I've kind of been in the rabbit hole for about 27 years and never have I seen anyone work so hard to explain the truth as you and I think you just keep pushing forward and don't worry about those other people because
[00:10:07.045 --> 00:10:21.392]  What I've seen happen in the 27 years that I've been aware of, down to the chemtrails and heart and everything else, it's just... If someone can't see by now, I don't know what you say to them.
[00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:26.275]  I've grown tired of even... I go reach people that want to talk and want to listen and leave the rest alone.
[00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:28.156]  I don't think those people can be saved.
[00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:38.214]  Well, what gets to me is that there are a lot of people who claim that they're even, you know, with the Truth Movement or the Awakening, just people who love liberty and don't want to be slaves.
[00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:39.694]  I mean, people say, who are we?
[00:10:39.694 --> 00:10:41.755]  People who want to control our own destinies.
[00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:47.357]  People that want to have some modicum of freedom and dignity and respect and to live in peace.
[00:10:47.357 --> 00:10:48.637]  And that's who we are.
[00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:50.338]  And to see our own movement just
[00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:58.435]  Totally controlled by COINTELPRO, where they can punch our buttons and pull our chains, myself included, many times.
[00:10:58.435 --> 00:11:01.237]  You know, I've learned a lot in the process.
[00:11:01.237 --> 00:11:04.400]  And it's just so sad that you're right.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.082]  It's all unfolding now in front of us.
[00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:09.365]  And on one hand, people are waking up like never before.
[00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:12.067]  That's wonderful and positive and great.
[00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:13.349]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[00:11:13.349 --> 00:11:15.571]  But on the other hand, so many people
[00:11:16.417 --> 00:11:38.438]  Just don't have any discernment, and they know the New World Order exists, they know the government's corrupt and tyrannical and abusive and very dark, but they still just don't understand the basics of moving forward against tyranny and how much power we all really have, and we just end up just ascending into arguments and mindlessness while the enemy's tearing down the front gate.
[00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:50.157]  But from your perspective, don't you see the people yearning for the truth becoming more exponential, and those people becoming smaller and smaller?
[00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:53.258]  You've seen it the last 10 or 12 years, I've been listening to you.
[00:11:53.258 --> 00:12:02.980]  No, I have certainly heard it with the general public, and I appreciate your call, and it's a great point you make, Don.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.600]  I have seen it
[00:12:06.354 --> 00:12:16.920]  Just doing radio interviews on radio shows that are positive towards my views, radio shows that are negative, radio broadcasts that are neutral.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:24.585]  I've gone from half the callers disagreeing with me 10, 12, 13 years ago to 90 plus percent agreeing.
[00:12:24.585 --> 00:12:30.428]  And we've seen that in the poll numbers, Congress again with a 9% approval rating.
[00:12:30.428 --> 00:12:33.350]  But I'm talking about then once people wake up,
[00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:43.149]  There's kind of this dark malaise or this morbidity where people are just become extremely cynical and upset and depressed.
[00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:45.270]  And I understand that.
[00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.971]  I mean, sometimes I get very upset and saddened.
[00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:54.432]  I wouldn't call it depressed, but just more saddened by what's happening because there's so much beauty in the world.
[00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:59.594]  There are so many wonderful, just enchanting things and mysterious things and
[00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:05.829]  Wonderful things about life that I can't find words to describe it.
[00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:11.072]  And that's what makes the evil so much more horrible.
[00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:13.353]  It freaks me out.
[00:13:13.353 --> 00:13:26.460]  It makes me go into angry rages to know that DynCorp and Halliburton run giant child kidnapping operations on an industrial scale.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.021]  Hundreds and thousands a year.
[00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:29.342]  Millions total.
[00:13:30.939 --> 00:13:32.340]  That flips me out.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.322]  I mean, I think about that and things like that.
[00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:40.747]  Hundreds of these horrible things run through my mind every time I go to sleep at night.
[00:13:40.747 --> 00:13:44.050]  And I think, how is this possible?
[00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.594]  How is there so much evil?
[00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.394]  But I digress.
[00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:52.397]  I said I'm taking a lot of your calls, so there isn't time for me to really sound off.
[00:13:53.184 --> 00:13:56.266]  But yes, things are very, very positive.
[00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:57.807]  But the enemy knows that.
[00:13:57.807 --> 00:14:00.249]  They know that there is an awakening taking place.
[00:14:00.249 --> 00:14:02.810]  That's why they're trying to bring the police state in.
[00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.334]  The overt, black-uniformed, iron-fisted grid.
[00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:22.003]  They would much rather it be kind of like the Stepford Wives, manicured lawns, you know, happy people in colorful suits of clothes, smiling, beaming, as, you know, we all die of cancer and
[00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:23.566]  Hey, what's up?
[00:14:23.566 --> 00:14:24.287]  How you doing?
[00:14:51.363 --> 00:14:53.104]  Thank you, and thanks for everything you do.
[00:14:53.104 --> 00:15:05.049]  Hey, I just want to touch on, yeah, people do wake up, but this evil system, they play a good game of manipulation and psychology against us.
[00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:16.155]  You know, say one thing and do another, or do something or some act that makes them look like they're for the people, or they're doing something for us.
[00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:17.355]  I'm sure it's all laid out.
[00:15:20.488 --> 00:15:45.924]  The scenarios are played out to, you know, to manipulate us and, you know, George Bush can't do that, but now he wants to start drilling offshore and, you know, that's a good thing for us and he's trying to help us when I'm sure it was something that was laid out and a scenario that they put in place to, you know, maybe kind of regain some of the public's confidence in them.
[00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.809]  And it's just things like that.
[00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:51.333]  And then, you know, when you wake up and you figure it out, like, what can I do?
[00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:54.496]  You know, what, what, where do I start?
[00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.597]  What, what can I say?
[00:15:55.597 --> 00:15:56.538]  What can I do?
[00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:57.459]  And how do I change it?
[00:15:57.459 --> 00:15:59.501]  It's just really good.
[00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:02.544]  And politicians will give you silver bullet answers.
[00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:02.965]  You know, we,
[00:16:04.205 --> 00:16:06.786]  Discuss the fact of take control of your local governments.
[00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:09.248]  That's where you have 8% turnout.
[00:16:09.248 --> 00:16:13.210]  That's where you still don't have total fraud with the voting system in every case.
[00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:24.715]  You have a chance to take control of your city governments now to keep the fraudulent voting machines from coming in and hold your ground at the local level.
[00:16:24.715 --> 00:16:30.338]  That's where the real power is to then educate the public and use those governmental bully pulpits
[00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.379]  As fulcrums to leverage resistance against the New World Order.
[00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:38.021]  I appreciate your call and your point, Steve.
[00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:45.226]  Again, we're not going to have a lot of time to spend with each caller because we are going to try to get to more of you, so it's a catch-22.
[00:16:45.226 --> 00:16:48.388]  But I love the points you're making.
[00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:51.150]  Here's what's happening with the offshore drilling.
[00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:57.755]  Bush knows that Congress, because they'd already polled the Congress in the months previous,
[00:16:59.358 --> 00:17:10.431]  They had already consulted with Congress, and they knew that Congress, at least for the time being, will not lift the ban on offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:14.816]  That has more oil than all of Saudi Arabia combined discovered.
[00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:17.479]  In the 60s, they discovered fields.
[00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:20.323]  There's one about 150 miles up the coast of Mississippi.
[00:17:21.538 --> 00:17:28.180]  That is 640 something square miles, we've covered it on air, that has as much as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.862]  Natural gas, oil, just blast out under super high pressure.
[00:17:31.862 --> 00:17:33.962]  Anywhere they drill.
[00:17:33.962 --> 00:17:37.524]  And they're relatively shallow as well and inexpensive.
[00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:43.185]  But an illustration of how that is a fraud, and I could go through hundreds of points.
[00:17:43.185 --> 00:17:50.468]  One of the first actions Bush did when he got into office was of course to block congressional investigations of Bill Clinton, but the second thing he did
[00:17:53.547 --> 00:18:09.137]  Was to give tens of thousands of square miles of United States territorial water that had been seized from Mexico during one of our innumerable wars and skirmishes with them.
[00:18:09.137 --> 00:18:14.461]  They gave those waters back to Mexico and Pemex is
[00:18:15.445 --> 00:18:23.030]  Now for eight years, seven and a half years exploring those, and that's why they pay a lot less for gas in Mexico than we pay here.
[00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:31.815]  It is not, quote, because it's subsidized.
[00:18:31.815 --> 00:18:33.095]  But I already digress.
[00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:44.442]  So, Bush just quickly and quietly, with an executive directive, and then Congress quietly removed its restriction.
[00:18:46.047 --> 00:18:49.349]  And that's because that's what the establishment wants.
[00:18:49.349 --> 00:18:54.752]  That's what the globalists are putting into play.
[00:18:54.752 --> 00:18:57.354]  Because they are monopoly men.
[00:18:57.354 --> 00:19:03.518]  Another example is how we're only allowed one pipeline out of Alaska.
[00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:13.904]  And 80% on average, it fluctuates, of the oil and natural gas taken out of the few fields that are allowed to operate in Alaska
[00:19:15.205 --> 00:19:17.787]  It's a veritable goldmine like Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:17.787 --> 00:19:21.049]  He is sent to China and Japan.
[00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:26.072]  See, it's a global managed economy.
[00:19:26.072 --> 00:19:31.596]  And so Bush comes out and says, I'm going to open up some drilling.
[00:19:31.596 --> 00:19:34.158]  You can put in permits for certain areas.
[00:19:34.158 --> 00:19:36.439]  But that was only his restrictions.
[00:19:36.439 --> 00:19:39.842]  The Congress isn't going to remove the restrictions.
[00:19:41.256 --> 00:19:47.219]  It is total theater, but you're right, the average person doesn't understand how that works.
[00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:49.100]  Okay?
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:57.483]  So it is more smoke and mirrors, a cruel stunt, plus the oil companies bought up the refineries and shut them down.
[00:19:57.483 --> 00:20:01.065]  Doesn't matter how much oil they pump out of the ground, we can't refine it.
[00:20:01.065 --> 00:20:01.785]  May I have everybody's
[00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:08.271]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:09.452]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:09.452 --> 00:20:11.152]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:14.053]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:14.053 --> 00:20:19.094]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.R.?
[00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:27.336]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:20:27.336 --> 00:20:32.197]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:40.078 --> 00:20:43.686]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:46.271]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:49.698]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be.
[00:20:51.861 --> 00:20:52.882]  Truth Rising.

[00:21:03.189 --> 00:21:05.090]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.412]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[00:21:07.412 --> 00:21:09.473]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.473 --> 00:21:13.276]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.636 --> 00:21:15.578]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.578 --> 00:21:18.020]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:26.106]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[00:22:03.358 --> 00:22:07.220]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.282]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:22:10.282 --> 00:22:14.065]  Introducing SFR's Protecta Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:22:14.065 --> 00:22:16.807]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:22:16.807 --> 00:22:20.329]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:24.273]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[00:22:24.273 --> 00:22:30.159]  Protector cleans up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tankful and is safe for all cars.
[00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:37.326]  Tests conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:45.652]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.

[00:23:00.009 --> 00:23:00.710]  Hey, Bonnie.
[00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.392]  No more pickpocketing for us.
[00:23:02.392 --> 00:23:06.736]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[00:23:06.736 --> 00:23:08.018]  How so, Clyde?
[00:23:08.018 --> 00:23:10.961]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:15.806]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[00:23:15.806 --> 00:23:16.327]  Just watch.
[00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:19.024]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[00:23:19.024 --> 00:23:20.505]  You gotta be kidding me.
[00:23:20.505 --> 00:23:20.905]  Nope.
[00:23:20.905 --> 00:23:25.187]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[00:23:25.187 --> 00:23:27.628]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[00:23:27.628 --> 00:23:28.148]  Why?
[00:23:28.148 --> 00:23:30.129]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[00:23:30.129 --> 00:23:31.669]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:35.251]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[00:23:35.251 --> 00:23:38.332]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[00:23:38.332 --> 00:23:39.193]  No way.
[00:23:39.193 --> 00:23:42.554]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:45.496]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[00:23:45.496 --> 00:23:46.597]  I already got some.
[00:23:46.597 --> 00:23:48.498]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[00:23:48.498 --> 00:23:53.481]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDStronghold.com.
[00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:55.343]  IDStronghold.com?
[00:23:55.343 --> 00:23:55.823]  Right.
[00:23:55.823 --> 00:23:56.824]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.691]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:24:15.691 --> 00:24:31.595]  Carl, in the great north of Montreal, Canada, you are on the air.
[00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:33.136]  Thanks for holding.
[00:24:33.136 --> 00:24:35.617]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:24:35.617 --> 00:24:38.478]  Did you get the article that my lawyer sent to you?
[00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:40.478]  I don't know.
[00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:41.939]  The article your lawyer sent me?
[00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.159]  You have to tell me more about it.
[00:24:43.741 --> 00:24:49.244]  Well, I'm the American that's been detained by Immigration Canada for 15 months.
[00:24:49.244 --> 00:24:54.247]  And a couple American Free Press ran my story and a couple other international papers ran my story.
[00:24:54.247 --> 00:24:57.808]  Yes, you've called into the show from time to time.
[00:24:57.808 --> 00:25:02.371]  I don't remember seeing your lawyer's email.
[00:25:02.371 --> 00:25:02.571]  Okay.
[00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.348]  I just was checking to see if you got it or not.
[00:25:05.348 --> 00:25:08.531]  And I forget, why are they holding you up there for 15 months?
[00:25:08.531 --> 00:25:12.495]  Well, supposedly because I'm a flight risk, even though I've offered to put up a bond.
[00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:15.017]  Immigration just can hold somebody indefinitely here.
[00:25:15.017 --> 00:25:17.539]  There's no time limit on how long they can hold somebody.
[00:25:17.539 --> 00:25:21.163]  Yeah, it's just like China or England now.
[00:25:21.163 --> 00:25:24.526]  It's 40-something days, like 45 days.
[00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:26.848]  But yeah, Canada is really
[00:25:27.623 --> 00:25:29.785]  The velvet-gloved iron fist.
[00:25:29.785 --> 00:25:33.548]  I mean, in every category, I don't think Canadians understand.
[00:25:33.548 --> 00:25:40.833]  You've got a hardcore, I mean, very vicious police state growing up around you, and it's scary.
[00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:51.681]  It's now, really, after China and North Korea and maybe Uzbekistan and a few others, it is one of the worst countries in the world, and I don't think Canadians know that.
[00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:53.543]  Yeah, most of them are blind, you know?
[00:25:53.543 --> 00:25:54.804]  Don't see what's going on at all.
[00:25:56.098 --> 00:25:57.700]  Well, I mean, normally that's what you'll see.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:03.126]  You've got really nice, friendly... I mean, the clichés are true, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:26:03.126 --> 00:26:14.320]  The clichés are true in that they're really nice, friendly, good-looking, hard-working people, but right beneath the surface... See, that's the kind of tyranny they'd rather have here.
[00:26:16.198 --> 00:26:19.920]  See, they don't want it to be a black ski mask tyranny in your face, but they have to now.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:26.342]  But in Canada, it could just be the, oh, we're free, we're, we're, it's so wonderful up here, but they're the ones going after the internet.
[00:26:26.342 --> 00:26:29.283]  They're the ones shutting down free speech.
[00:26:29.283 --> 00:26:35.806]  I mean, I've been in third world countries and not had them just scream and yell at me and tell me I'm filth and a piece of bleepin' American.
[00:26:35.806 --> 00:26:41.088]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Harold in New York.
[00:26:41.088 --> 00:26:42.108]  You're on the air.
[00:26:42.108 --> 00:26:45.710]  Yeah, um, yeah, aw, aw, damn, I'm nervous, but um, yeah.
[00:26:46.713 --> 00:26:48.233]  Four years ago, right?
[00:26:48.233 --> 00:26:49.494]  Um, no, no, no.
[00:26:49.494 --> 00:26:52.715]  Let me start from the beginning.
[00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:55.015]  I visited this forum one time, right?
[00:26:55.015 --> 00:27:01.017]  And then, um, somebody posted a link, like your link, right?
[00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:05.879]  And then I went to your website and then you was talking about the New World Order and stuff like that.
[00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:10.380]  I knew about that since like the early 90s, but I remember you saying that, um,
[00:27:11.877 --> 00:27:15.638]  That, um, that 9-11 was an inside job, which didn't, um, surprise me.
[00:27:15.638 --> 00:27:20.660]  And then you saying that the AIDS virus was a bioweapon and stuff like that.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.540]  Okay.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.281]  So, okay.
[00:27:22.281 --> 00:27:23.501]  So we have all the documents.
[00:27:23.501 --> 00:27:24.921]  It's all declassified.
[00:27:24.921 --> 00:27:25.221]  Okay.
[00:27:25.221 --> 00:27:31.364]  But on the AIDS virus, somebody else posted a link of Boyd Graves, right?
[00:27:31.364 --> 00:27:35.045]  And he said, and it was numerous links of his comments.
[00:27:35.045 --> 00:27:37.206]  He showed the documents for the flow trial.
[00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.986]  This was probably back, I think this was in 2003, 2004, right?
[00:27:42.372 --> 00:27:55.675]  He was saying how, like, in one article he was saying how, like, there's agents in, um, um, in black hospitals, black universities, they give it to blacks.
[00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:57.296]  Yes, that's true, mm-hmm.
[00:27:57.296 --> 00:28:01.597]  Okay, you, you're not gonna believe what I'm gonna tell you right now.
[00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:06.258]  I was on the phone with my cousin, like, I think it was, like, August 2004, right?
[00:28:08.618 --> 00:28:10.700]  And I was telling him, I was telling him about it.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.723]  You know, my cousin, he was like, Harold, I gotta go.
[00:28:14.723 --> 00:28:16.464]  You know?
[00:28:16.464 --> 00:28:18.066]  You're not gonna believe it.
[00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:21.748]  Half an hour later, I see a helicopter outside my house.
[00:28:21.748 --> 00:28:23.450]  Matter of fact, they're flying over my house right now.
[00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.210]  Hold on.
[00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.933]  Hey, can you hear it?
[00:28:26.933 --> 00:28:30.395]  No, I don't hear it, sir.
[00:28:30.395 --> 00:28:32.277]  Listen, I appreciate your call, um...
[00:28:34.085 --> 00:28:38.568]  We've had scores of medical doctors on the show just last week.
[00:28:38.568 --> 00:28:41.630]  I'm going to set them up for a full two hours to go through more of the documentation.
[00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:52.957]  A medical doctor who we've had on the show again just last week, Dr. Stan Monteith, going over it.
[00:28:52.957 --> 00:28:57.200]  And it was in the Communicable Cancer Research Weapons Program.
[00:28:58.388 --> 00:29:07.891]  And this has even been on History Channel and Discovery Channel, where the CIA by the 50s had created fast-acting communicable cancer.
[00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:14.774]  And then for the last 13 years on air, I've covered how, because I had the documents and statistics, how cancer is exploding.
[00:29:14.774 --> 00:29:23.737]  Most cancer is not caused by, you know, the toxic waste you come in contact with, or poisons.
[00:29:23.737 --> 00:29:24.797]  Though some cancer is.
[00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:27.627]  It is viral in nature.
[00:29:27.627 --> 00:29:28.727]  People would laugh at me now.
[00:29:28.727 --> 00:29:30.747]  Everybody knows most cancer is viral.
[00:29:30.747 --> 00:29:40.470]  But only because the government wanted to tell you so they could sell you vaccines with the live viruses that cause cancer that then actually give it to you.
[00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:44.051]  I mean, it is so sick.
[00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:45.191]  And that's the horror.
[00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:51.153]  That's what freaks me out, is they're just murdering us right in front of us.
[00:29:51.153 --> 00:29:52.533]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:54.054]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.072 --> 00:29:57.756]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:04.336]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:09.837]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:09.837 --> 00:30:15.558]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:15.558 --> 00:30:17.039]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:25.941]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:30:26.281 --> 00:30:26.361]  Yes.
[00:30:26.361 --> 00:30:28.203]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:32:25.523 --> 00:32:25.883]  I think so.

[00:33:16.972 --> 00:33:20.434]  I'm going to get into this very important article.
[00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:22.895]  Death of free internet is imminent.
[00:33:22.895 --> 00:33:24.956]  Canada will be the test case.
[00:33:24.956 --> 00:33:28.798]  Also, the global economy is at the point of maximum danger.
[00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:32.339]  But I want to... We're doing a pretty good job of getting to your calls right now.
[00:33:32.339 --> 00:33:33.420]  I want to take a whole bunch.
[00:33:34.304 --> 00:33:45.473]  And then when we start the next hour, in fact even before then in the next segment, I will get into these articles on the internet and of course what's happening with the markets and just how dangerous it is.
[00:33:45.473 --> 00:33:49.937]  Even mainline analysts are now saying that this could be catastrophic.
[00:33:51.357 --> 00:33:51.777]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:51.777 --> 00:34:07.026]  Briefly, I do want to encourage everyone to remember that I have one of the best online video and bookstores online, where we have all 19 of my films, including the new one, Truth Rising, and the best films out there.
[00:34:07.026 --> 00:34:18.133]  All the other films that I think are the most informative on a host of subjects in dealing with the false war, government-sponsored terrorism, mind control, you name it, all available at
[00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:23.582]  Infowars.com, the secure online video and bookstore as well.

[00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:36.653]  Kevin Booth, send it to discounted by the way.
[00:34:36.653 --> 00:34:43.118]  Two-hour film with three plus hours of extras, American Drug War.
[00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:43.459]  Of course,
[00:34:44.364 --> 00:34:56.895]  The preeminent film on the fellow reserve, The Money Masters, all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:34:56.895 --> 00:35:04.561]  No library is complete without The Money Masters and Road to Tyranny and the other films that we carry.
[00:35:06.746 --> 00:35:06.967]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:06.967 --> 00:35:17.070]  You're authorized and encouraged to make copies of all of my films for non-profit educational purposes to give to your friends, family, and neighbors.
[00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.631]  People ask what a solution is.
[00:35:18.631 --> 00:35:19.911]  That's the biggest one.
[00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:21.132]  Paul Revere.
[00:35:21.132 --> 00:35:25.113]  They didn't run out to Paul Revere and say, what's your solution?
[00:35:25.113 --> 00:35:27.614]  You know, you're just riding around warning people.
[00:35:27.614 --> 00:35:28.794]  Well, they knew what to do.
[00:35:28.794 --> 00:35:30.295]  Now, he was saying to arms to arms,
[00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:34.114]  And that's your decision whether it's time for arms.
[00:35:34.114 --> 00:35:35.495]  I don't think it's the time for that.
[00:35:35.495 --> 00:35:45.121]  I'm out riding with millions of other heroic men and women of every race, color, and creed, all over the world, warning people about the globalists.
[00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:47.082]  You know, how do you stop GMO food?
[00:35:47.082 --> 00:35:47.803]  You expose it.
[00:35:47.803 --> 00:35:48.643]  You demonize it.
[00:35:48.643 --> 00:35:53.126]  You educate people with the facts, and it is demonic.
[00:35:53.126 --> 00:35:54.808]  How do you expose the gun grabbers?
[00:35:54.808 --> 00:35:58.130]  You show their agenda that they want to disarm us to control our lives.
[00:36:00.194 --> 00:36:06.536]  And then you show their own documents where they admit it's not about keeping children safe, it's about making you a slave.
[00:36:06.536 --> 00:36:11.217]  Again, it's education, it's information, it's counter propaganda.
[00:36:11.217 --> 00:36:14.217]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:36:14.217 --> 00:36:20.039]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:36:20.039 --> 00:36:23.600]  Alright, let's try to move quickly here.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.300]  James in Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:36:28.996 --> 00:36:30.136]  Go ahead, James, in Michigan.
[00:36:30.136 --> 00:36:31.497]  You're on the air.
[00:36:31.497 --> 00:36:32.237]  James just dropped.
[00:36:32.237 --> 00:36:34.297]  Let's go to Derek in Minnesota.
[00:36:34.297 --> 00:36:35.017]  First time caller.
[00:36:35.017 --> 00:36:37.978]  Welcome, Derek.
[00:36:37.978 --> 00:36:47.120]  I heard yesterday that Lindsey Williams was on a radio show and he was claiming that they found oil in such and such a country.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.360]  I don't know the exact details.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.760]  He's on Dr. Stan yesterday, I believe.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.721]  Saying that oil will go down to $50 a barrel.
[00:36:53.721 --> 00:36:54.501]  Have you heard this?
[00:36:55.782 --> 00:36:58.743]  This was just yesterday on Dr. Stan, I believe.
[00:36:58.743 --> 00:36:59.743]  I didn't actually hear it.
[00:36:59.743 --> 00:37:03.824]  I heard somebody call in and talk about it on a different radio show.
[00:37:03.824 --> 00:37:06.685]  Well, I like Lindsey Williams.
[00:37:06.685 --> 00:37:09.266]  It's just that, and I can be accused of this, too.
[00:37:09.266 --> 00:37:10.746]  He's a great guy.
[00:37:10.746 --> 00:37:13.407]  It's pretty much the same story when you have him on.
[00:37:13.407 --> 00:37:15.288]  I've probably had him on 20 times.
[00:37:15.288 --> 00:37:22.570]  And he talks about how he was a chaplain for Atlantic Ridgefield in Alaska.
[00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:32.498]  And he saw the things that a lot of other people that worked in Alaska have told me, and I've interviewed some of the oil company executives on air, and those discoveries are admitted.
[00:37:32.498 --> 00:37:33.579]  It's not secret.
[00:37:33.579 --> 00:37:42.663]  He's a good eyewitness report, and what he's saying is accurate, and the Energy Non-Crisis is a great video and book.
[00:37:42.663 --> 00:37:46.044]  It's a video and a book under the same title, and it's all free on Google Video.
[00:37:46.044 --> 00:37:48.345]  So he's a great guy.
[00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:51.587]  I had not heard this new development, but
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.661]  I'll have to call him.
[00:37:55.661 --> 00:37:58.644]  I really don't go off of rumors and what callers say.
[00:37:58.644 --> 00:38:01.225]  And you're not going to see oil go down to $50 a barrel.
[00:38:01.225 --> 00:38:02.827]  I don't care how much they discover.
[00:38:02.827 --> 00:38:07.750]  They could discover a thousand times what's in Saudi Arabia.
[00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:17.337]  And it's not going to go down a lot because the oil companies in 1995 met, and the AP reported on this in 2001.
[00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:18.438]  We've written big articles on it.
[00:38:19.102 --> 00:38:20.584]  I mean, this is a smoking gun.
[00:38:20.584 --> 00:38:21.445]  It's open and shut.
[00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:22.345]  It's admitted.
[00:38:22.345 --> 00:38:30.134]  And they bought up 200-plus refineries in the U.S., a whole bunch in Canada and Europe as well, but 200-plus in the U.S.
[00:38:30.134 --> 00:38:30.674]  I think it's 214.
[00:38:30.674 --> 00:38:33.537]  You can go look it up for yourself.
[00:38:33.537 --> 00:38:34.839]  And they said there's too much oil.
[00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:44.935]  We've got to artificially shut down refineries because it was too inexpensive in the mid-1990s.
[00:38:44.935 --> 00:38:57.004]  Whenever I say the oil companies aren't behind the current rise, they were behind having it at $1.50, $1.70 a gallon by buying up and shutting down the refineries that were owned by smaller companies.
[00:38:59.415 --> 00:39:02.678]  But that's a small part of the increase.
[00:39:02.678 --> 00:39:17.090]  The main reason is you have global oligopolies, that is, different groups that combine into combines or cartels, artificially not allowing, through government regulation and through corporate decisions, exploration.
[00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:23.556]  Because only the top seven or eight giants can explore in the North Sea or extract in the North Sea.
[00:39:23.556 --> 00:39:27.239]  And then in other areas, like Alaska or the Stans,
[00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:34.362]  Uh, or the Gulf of Mexico, they have governmental control and can just block the development.
[00:39:34.362 --> 00:39:41.105]  People think that they went into Afghanistan to block oil coming out of the 10 or 11 stands, other nations around it.
[00:39:41.105 --> 00:39:43.446]  You know, people think they were there to get the oil.
[00:39:43.446 --> 00:39:48.289]  No, they were there to block the oil coming out.
[00:39:48.289 --> 00:39:54.892]  Yeah, and I, you know, I'm not, I'm trying to find the archives of Dr. Stanton to try to actually hear that, that statement.
[00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:57.033]  Well, he's here on this network, I think, at, uh,
[00:39:57.751 --> 00:39:58.811]  Four or five o'clock.
[00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.072]  So, you know what I'll do?
[00:40:00.072 --> 00:40:01.792]  I will, uh... You know what?
[00:40:01.792 --> 00:40:07.434]  It's time to have Williams on, even if it's just... I mean, I could almost go get... In fact, it's a pitch.
[00:40:07.434 --> 00:40:09.775]  It's a script he goes off of, which is fine.
[00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:10.315]  He's a preacher.
[00:40:10.315 --> 00:40:11.375]  That's what they do.
[00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:14.976]  But I could... Okay, we'll get Williams on.
[00:40:14.976 --> 00:40:15.497]  How's that sound?
[00:40:15.497 --> 00:40:16.697]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:40:16.697 --> 00:40:21.719]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:25.820]  Let's talk to... I didn't mean to get him on anyways.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.020]  I just...
[00:40:28.152 --> 00:40:30.374]  I guess up next is John in California.
[00:40:30.374 --> 00:40:31.855]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:40:31.855 --> 00:40:33.797]  Alex, hey, good morning.
[00:40:33.797 --> 00:40:42.185]  I can't hear the program too well on shortwave, and briefly yesterday I heard something about a quarter million coffin liners out in Atlanta.
[00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:51.213]  Well, no one's counted them, but they're stacked about 40 to a stack, and there are just thousands and thousands of stacks.
[00:40:52.195 --> 00:40:59.608]  And some people estimate it's over 500,000, some close to a million, some a lesser amount, but let me be clear about this.
[00:41:00.822 --> 00:41:05.785]  People always love stories about a 18-wheeler that jumped over and had martial law signs.
[00:41:05.785 --> 00:41:10.188]  But then they never talk about the Houston Chronicle, admitting they've got FEMA cams for martial law.
[00:41:10.188 --> 00:41:22.996]  Or people always want to talk about they heard somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody's brother who knew an aunt who had an uncle who was friends with a man who worked at a store who saw shackles in the trains.
[00:41:22.996 --> 00:41:24.377]  When I've seen the shackles myself.
[00:41:24.998 --> 00:41:38.092]  Okay, instead of going to the Corps Research or Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, operating secretly since 86, declassified in 97, in my book, Descent to Tyranny, on the Army's own website.
[00:41:38.092 --> 00:41:41.116]  So my problem with this is that
[00:41:42.728 --> 00:41:46.391]  We have mainstream news articles, and I asked Kurt and Paul to do articles Sunday.
[00:41:46.391 --> 00:41:56.598]  I guess they just didn't want to do articles on it, but we need an article on it where we go through all the evidence and then add in the plastic coffin containers, because here's the evidence.
[00:41:56.598 --> 00:42:01.941]  In 2002, Rocky Mountain News headline was something like, Crematoriums for Bio-Attack.
[00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:04.843]  Governor announces crematoriums for bio-attack.
[00:42:04.843 --> 00:42:05.804]  I believe that was the headline.
[00:42:05.804 --> 00:42:07.305]  Somebody find it and give it to my guys.
[00:42:07.305 --> 00:42:08.446]  We don't have the staff to do the research.
[00:42:09.288 --> 00:42:14.651]  And then I remember other articles about millions of body bags ordered.
[00:42:14.651 --> 00:42:17.813]  All those rumors have roots in admissions.
[00:42:17.813 --> 00:42:26.717]  So this is just where somebody found a stockpile of them by a railway station near the airport in Georgia, outside Atlanta.
[00:42:26.717 --> 00:42:27.738]  So they are coffins.
[00:42:27.738 --> 00:42:29.078]  We know the company name.
[00:42:29.078 --> 00:42:31.199]  We tracked it down.
[00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:33.841]  It is confirmed that there are coffins stockpiled there.
[00:42:33.841 --> 00:42:36.542]  And now we're having a big debate about whether, yes, there are coffins.
[00:42:36.542 --> 00:42:38.403]  Yes, there's a program stockpiling coffins.
[00:42:38.763 --> 00:42:39.743]  Yes, it's real, folks.
[00:42:39.743 --> 00:42:40.644]  Go ahead.
[00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:43.384]  Okay, um, I've got photos in my hands right now.
[00:42:43.384 --> 00:42:51.326]  They're about five years old, of about, from what I understand, four million coffin liners outside the boonies of Atlanta.
[00:42:51.326 --> 00:42:53.627]  And, uh, what happened was... Did you take those photos?
[00:42:53.627 --> 00:42:54.227]  No, I didn't.
[00:42:54.227 --> 00:42:56.788]  They were given to me by Rick Wiles at True News.
[00:42:56.788 --> 00:43:01.109]  He, um, received them from a lady in Atlanta, Georgia, and told me about them.
[00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:02.189]  I don't have internet.
[00:43:02.734 --> 00:43:07.158]  He sent them to me, and he was trying to go and figure out what they were.
[00:43:07.158 --> 00:43:13.824]  He had just about got FEMA to admit they belonged to them, but they wouldn't identify them.
[00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:18.087]  And I have a volunteer friend of mine in FEMA who's very, very high up there.
[00:43:18.087 --> 00:43:20.950]  And I showed her the photos, and I asked her if these were coffins.
[00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.671]  She said, no, they're coffin liners.
[00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:24.573]  And I asked her, are you sure?
[00:43:24.573 --> 00:43:25.513]  How do you know?
[00:43:25.513 --> 00:43:26.895]  And she said, because we've got them in LA.
[00:43:27.631 --> 00:43:30.452]  And I asked her, do you have 4 million coffin liners in L.A.?
[00:43:30.452 --> 00:43:35.114]  She said, I don't think we have 4 million, but we've got a bunch of them and we've got a bunch of... Yeah, let me just stop you.
[00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:35.814]  Let me just stop you.
[00:43:35.814 --> 00:43:37.274]  I don't understand this.
[00:43:37.274 --> 00:43:42.076]  It's almost like our minds have been programmed to disassociate with any threatening fact.
[00:43:42.822 --> 00:43:44.282]  That's what we're saying.
[00:43:44.282 --> 00:43:51.265]  These are coffin liners, but it says on the company that makes them, it can also be used to just put the body in.
[00:43:51.265 --> 00:43:57.627]  Yes, you can put a smaller coffin in them, or you can put a body in them, or a body bag in them.
[00:43:57.627 --> 00:44:04.329]  So technically, it's meant to have a body bag stuck in it, and yes, I've seen people now debating, no, they're not coffins, they're coffin liners.
[00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:08.830]  The point is, they're massing a bunch of coffin liners, and they're coffin liners.
[00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.131]  We have the company, we posted links to it,
[00:44:11.951 --> 00:44:13.632]  Uh, but we need a big article on this.
[00:44:13.632 --> 00:44:16.733]  I keep explaining to my guys, this is a big deal.
[00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:19.234]  And I'd have limited, that's why we're moving into a bigger office.
[00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:20.455]  We're trying to get internet in there.
[00:44:20.455 --> 00:44:22.316]  Everything's slow as molasses.
[00:44:22.316 --> 00:44:25.097]  And we have such a small staff that it's hard to build up.
[00:44:25.097 --> 00:44:29.719]  But, uh, in the future, we will, we're gonna get, we're getting more writers, more web people.
[00:44:29.719 --> 00:44:32.940]  And, uh, we will get a big report out on this in the next day or two.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.302]  Can I get a phone number or a, uh, fax number to your office?
[00:44:36.889 --> 00:44:37.329]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:37.909]  Look, look.
[00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:40.970]  Let me just give you my FedEx number.
[00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:50.933]  Let me off-air give you the hotline number, call it, and we'll give you my FedEx number, and you can, I mean, we've already got video of the coffins.
[00:44:50.933 --> 00:44:55.174]  So, I mean, I mean, and we've got the company that sells them and makes them.
[00:44:55.174 --> 00:44:59.395]  So, it's all open and shut, but I mean, what are these photos?
[00:44:59.395 --> 00:45:05.577]  They're colored photos of stacks of these blue-black plastic cubs on pallets.
[00:45:06.338 --> 00:45:13.421]  I don't think there's any need for me to blow 30-40 bucks.
[00:45:13.421 --> 00:45:17.943]  I just try to be somewhat of a good steward of our funds to give you the FedEx number.
[00:45:17.943 --> 00:45:21.425]  I can fax the photos to you if you want me to.
[00:45:21.425 --> 00:45:26.287]  Yeah, but see if you fax them and then it's something dynamite, I really then it isn't good to scan and put on the web.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.882]  Plus, Rick Wiles is a territorial person.
[00:45:28.882 --> 00:45:30.384]  I really don't want anything he has.
[00:45:30.384 --> 00:45:32.606]  I mean, we know about it.
[00:45:32.606 --> 00:45:47.363]  I would suggest you get to a internet site and yourself and Flickr or something like that and put them up for the world because, I mean, we have the company advertising them, but sells them and says they sell them to the government.
[00:45:47.363 --> 00:45:48.384]  I mean, we know what they are.
[00:45:49.176 --> 00:45:51.997]  And see, everybody's running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:45:51.997 --> 00:45:56.198]  That's why we have to put the definitive word out at PrisonPlanet.com and we're going to do that.
[00:45:56.198 --> 00:45:59.919]  I'm going to call Paul Watson and see that he puts something together right now, or Kurt.
[00:45:59.919 --> 00:46:01.319]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:04.760]  And listen, I want to thank you for calling me with the information.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.841]  It's just... I'm not going to get into it.
[00:46:08.841 --> 00:46:11.062]  The point is, thank you very much.
[00:46:11.062 --> 00:46:13.103]  I appreciate that info.
[00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:16.724]  But, I mean... You know, I don't want to turn down information.
[00:46:16.724 --> 00:46:18.284]  You are welcome to fax some to us.
[00:46:19.219 --> 00:46:21.461]  And, uh, I got two different fax numbers.
[00:46:21.461 --> 00:46:27.625]  I forget which one to give out, and I guess I can just look at them, but it's probably... There's YouTube videos, there's photos, there's a bunch of videos.
[00:46:27.625 --> 00:46:29.526]  We got them all up on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:29.526 --> 00:46:31.928]  This fellow's just not on the internet, so he doesn't know that.
[00:46:31.928 --> 00:46:34.590]  Yeah, this coffin thing's been out for years.
[00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.372]  Uh, let's go ahead, just, and I'm tired of it.
[00:46:37.372 --> 00:46:40.394]  It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and people are debating whether it's real.
[00:46:40.394 --> 00:46:42.135]  Yes, it's real!
[00:46:42.135 --> 00:46:43.356]  They got crematoriums!
[00:46:43.356 --> 00:46:45.698]  Rocky Mountain News, okay?
[00:46:45.698 --> 00:46:46.919]  Yes, it's part of the...
[00:46:48.815 --> 00:46:54.018]  There's been hundreds of articles where they've got the police ready to forcibly inoculate you and lock down every city.
[00:46:54.018 --> 00:46:55.579]  It's called Dark Winter.
[00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:57.140]  That's the name of the government program.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.821]  Dark Winter.
[00:46:58.821 --> 00:47:01.983]  Associated Press.
[00:47:01.983 --> 00:47:03.324]  July 2001.
[00:47:03.324 --> 00:47:05.585]  I mean, I can just keep on going here.
[00:47:06.562 --> 00:47:07.783]  Dark Winter.
[00:47:07.783 --> 00:47:08.404]  Top Off.
[00:47:08.404 --> 00:47:11.306]  The Top Off drills they did in 2000-2001.
[00:47:11.306 --> 00:47:14.248]  Martial Law Takeover drills of Denver.
[00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:17.111]  They've done Top Off Takeover drills in Seattle.
[00:47:17.111 --> 00:47:19.553]  In Chicago.
[00:47:19.553 --> 00:47:25.398]  See, I want to go to your calls, and a caller brings up a key area, and I've just got to go off into a rampage on it.
[00:47:25.398 --> 00:47:28.020]  Who's up next here?
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.740]  Leo and Mash.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.822]  You're on the air.
[00:47:30.822 --> 00:47:31.823]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:31.823 --> 00:47:32.744]  Hello.
[00:47:32.744 --> 00:47:34.585]  Yeah.
[00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:35.506]  You bring up the most
[00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:45.610]  Incredible issues, but the one we really need to focus on and create a large infrastructure is this whole death of the internet thing.
[00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:46.871]  This is key.
[00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:48.452]  This is our platform.
[00:47:48.452 --> 00:47:49.333]  They want to destroy it.
[00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.096]  I can't even get our own movement to admit it.
[00:47:52.096 --> 00:47:55.339]  I mean, it's like, I've never lied to anybody.
[00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.600]  I do the best job I can.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.623]  I discovered internet two, six, seven years ago.
[00:47:59.623 --> 00:48:00.904]  We've written scores of articles.
[00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:06.331]  And, I mean, I have their own admission saying we are going to kill the internet.
[00:48:06.331 --> 00:48:07.531]  That's a quote.
[00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:18.474]  Governments are saying this and then the media will, like, praise some bloggers who go, we had somebody tell us at a major media outfit that they might start shutting it down.
[00:48:18.474 --> 00:48:19.714]  It's like, did you hear?
[00:48:19.714 --> 00:48:23.875]  It's all rumor mongering instead of we have the facts.
[00:48:23.875 --> 00:48:30.076]  Well, what I'm trying to say is we need Ron Paul type meetup groups to be doing this nationwide and creating a
[00:48:30.586 --> 00:48:36.568]  A physical infrastructure of people knowledgeable that is the only way we're going to stop this.
[00:48:36.568 --> 00:48:45.472]  I mean, you and I and the rest of us who are listening are in a think tank and we're not thinking, we're not the choir, we don't understand how to sing!
[00:48:45.472 --> 00:48:48.213]  No, no, I agree with you.
[00:48:48.213 --> 00:48:49.373]  Well, we try to give solutions.
[00:48:49.373 --> 00:48:53.575]  I mean, my solution is they are doing this.
[00:48:53.575 --> 00:48:59.897]  Tell Comcast, tell Time Warner, who have already started one of the multi-pronged attacks, one of the missiles,
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.120]  We're good to go.
[00:49:20.555 --> 00:49:26.339]  I mean, remember when Cogent and Level 3 shut down a few years ago, just for a week, and a third of the web was down?
[00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:31.603]  We barely beat that by a few votes, and then the senator trying to pass it was caught in a corruption scandal.
[00:49:31.603 --> 00:49:33.344]  We barely beat it.
[00:49:33.344 --> 00:49:35.005]  And that was just one prong.
[00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:40.189]  See, they're launching like ten torpedoes at us, knowing one or two of them will do us in.
[00:49:40.189 --> 00:49:43.411]  And this is the big torpedo.
[00:49:43.411 --> 00:49:46.013]  This is the one we have to engage the whole country in.
[00:49:46.013 --> 00:49:50.056]  No, I'm saying they've launched about ten torpedoes, one of which will kill the web.
[00:49:52.205 --> 00:49:56.467]  I'm not that pessimistic.
[00:49:56.467 --> 00:49:59.768]  I mean, sir, there's nothing pessimistic about what I just said.
[00:49:59.768 --> 00:50:11.513]  If they're able to implement any one of their announced plans, one of them, net neutrality, subscription-based taxes, it's over.
[00:50:11.513 --> 00:50:15.875]  I mean, there's nothing pessimistic about that.
[00:50:15.875 --> 00:50:19.516]  I'm saying if the enemy breaches the wall, they are going to take the city.
[00:50:20.515 --> 00:50:22.677]  We've got to hold the wall.
[00:50:22.677 --> 00:50:24.219]  How is that pessimistic?
[00:50:24.219 --> 00:50:31.787]  Well, I'm not saying you're totally pessimistic, but I think we have to build the infrastructure along with people like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:50:31.787 --> 00:50:34.629]  Hey, I can barely keep my websites up!
[00:50:34.629 --> 00:50:37.633]  You know, I run around paying bills so the power doesn't get turned off.
[00:50:37.633 --> 00:50:38.353]  I understand.
[00:50:38.353 --> 00:50:43.879]  But see, and I appreciate your call, there is this idea that anybody in authority or anybody on the air is like Superman.
[00:50:45.006 --> 00:50:46.888]  I mean, folks, I brush my teeth like everybody else.
[00:50:46.888 --> 00:50:50.172]  I put my pants on one leg on the other.
[00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:52.595]  And, uh, yes, somebody go with it.
[00:50:52.595 --> 00:50:53.796]  Some billionaire out there.
[00:50:53.796 --> 00:50:55.538]  Start a group to defend the Internet.
[00:50:55.538 --> 00:50:56.359]  I mean, come on.
[00:50:56.359 --> 00:50:57.200]  Let's get together.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.502]  The elites have gotten together.
[00:50:58.502 --> 00:50:59.863]  That's why they're in power.
[00:50:59.863 --> 00:51:01.085]  They do combine forces.
[00:51:01.986 --> 00:51:08.130]  Have you ever suffered from Giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:14.693]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[00:51:14.693 --> 00:51:24.159]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.
[00:51:24.159 --> 00:51:30.983]  FPP, or Fossilized Phytoplankton Powder, is a 100% natural, organic product with absolutely no additives.
[00:51:31.343 --> 00:51:36.626]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:39.627]  Many believe it is the key to a healthy digestive tract.
[00:51:39.627 --> 00:51:50.933]  To find an FPP distributor near you or to buy it now online, go to www.freshwaterorganics.com.
[00:51:50.933 --> 00:51:52.494]  You can also call toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[00:51:52.494 --> 00:51:52.714]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:52:00.911 --> 00:52:06.615]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:52:06.615 --> 00:52:07.896]  And we knew what to do.
[00:52:07.896 --> 00:52:09.957]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:52:09.957 --> 00:52:16.962]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:52:16.962 --> 00:52:22.146]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:25.869]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:52:25.869 --> 00:52:32.976]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:52:32.976 --> 00:52:36.139]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:52:36.139 --> 00:52:41.224]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:52:41.904 --> 00:52:44.985]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:52:44.985 --> 00:52:51.028]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:52:51.028 --> 00:52:53.949]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:52:53.949 --> 00:53:00.432]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:53:00.432 --> 00:53:05.314]  Do you still think that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your worst problem in this country?
[00:53:05.314 --> 00:53:11.057]  Bank failures, rising food prices, and an ever-weakening dollar are only the beginning of a much larger crisis.
[00:53:11.852 --> 00:53:17.376]  Why have America's politicians abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule of men?
[00:53:17.376 --> 00:53:25.361]  The majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power and illusion of authority that only lawless men and women seek.
[00:53:25.361 --> 00:53:32.867]  They no longer strive to protect American ideals, but rather they have abandoned the very rule book that they have sworn an oath to defend.
[00:53:32.867 --> 00:53:35.849]  Will the American people let these crimes go unpunished?
[00:53:35.849 --> 00:53:39.551]  Do the American people even understand the crimes that have been committed?
[00:53:39.551 --> 00:53:40.312]  Where does it stop?
[00:53:41.149 --> 00:53:47.416]  Washington You're Fired is a film about true change in DC with true solutions to our everyday problems.
[00:53:47.416 --> 00:53:49.719]  We invite you to get your copy today.
[00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:52.222]  Visit washingtonyourfired.com.
[00:53:52.222 --> 00:53:55.806]  Understanding what has happened is key to fixing our problems.
[00:53:55.806 --> 00:53:59.370]  Visit washingtonyourfired.com and understand true change today.
[00:54:03.223 --> 00:54:05.824]  I think a parasitic dream will never come back.
[00:54:05.824 --> 00:54:09.506]  It painted my hands and my face blue.
[00:54:09.506 --> 00:54:18.670]  And suddenly, in the fast wind, it took me away.
[00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:23.092]  And made me fly in the infinite sky.
[00:54:38.405 --> 00:54:43.828]  You know, the last caller was right about the internet being so important and so central.
[00:54:43.828 --> 00:54:48.350]  So I'm going to move Bob Chapman to the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:51.551]  If he can do it, if not, we'll set him on tomorrow.
[00:54:51.551 --> 00:55:01.876]  Because I want to spend some time to calmly go over the new developments and announcements at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:01.876 --> 00:55:02.997]  So coming up in about 35 minutes.
[00:55:05.456 --> 00:55:07.617]  I want now to continue with your phone calls.
[00:55:07.617 --> 00:55:16.321]  I'll also get into the economy later in the show, but I'm trying to put your calls first today because I missed taking calls.
[00:55:16.321 --> 00:55:17.781]  Well, there's so many here on the board.
[00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:20.503]  Who was next in line?
[00:55:20.503 --> 00:55:21.943]  Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:55:21.943 --> 00:55:22.343]  Go ahead.
[00:55:22.343 --> 00:55:23.484]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:23.484 --> 00:55:29.126]  Alex, for the last seven years, you've been fighting the New World Order tirelessly, seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
[00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:35.171]  And if you don't return somebody's email, you're automatically a zero.
[00:55:35.171 --> 00:55:37.592]  But anyway, you're still a hero of mine.
[00:55:37.592 --> 00:55:50.460]  And for the last seven years, when I've spoken to people about what happened on September 11th and talked to them about the inside of trading and the buildings were filled with asbestos and should have been condemned, they said, I didn't hear that part.
[00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:53.342]  And I said, well, tune into InfoWars.com.
[00:55:53.342 --> 00:55:54.622]  You will see that.
[00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:59.925]  You will see plants that were infected and grown by our government with HIV virus.
[00:55:59.925 --> 00:56:01.085]  People didn't hear that story.
[00:56:01.085 --> 00:56:12.130]  But what I wanted to talk to you today about, Alex, is that with George Bush finishing his administration, who do you predict on some of the pardons that he's going to do this year?
[00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.171]  Do you think he's going to pardon Scooter Libby?
[00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:17.692]  And do you see anybody else on that?
[00:56:19.697 --> 00:56:20.418]  Absolutely.
[00:56:20.418 --> 00:56:26.021]  But those are all just low-level worker ants inside the larger New World Order pyramid colony.
[00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:29.083]  And so I'm not too particularly really concerned with it.
[00:56:29.083 --> 00:56:29.984]  We know they're lawless.
[00:56:29.984 --> 00:56:31.545]  We know they're criminal.
[00:56:31.545 --> 00:56:34.887]  We know they commit whatever crimes they want.
[00:56:34.887 --> 00:56:37.568]  Or they pass laws excusing themselves.
[00:56:37.568 --> 00:56:44.713]  You know, there are hundreds of laws that Congress has passed special exemptions for themselves.
[00:56:44.713 --> 00:56:45.894]  And here's an example.
[00:56:45.894 --> 00:56:47.715]  The New York Stock Exchange has allowed
[00:56:48.442 --> 00:56:56.685]  To launder drug money and to solicit narcotics funds as long as it is done directly outside the U.S.
[00:56:56.685 --> 00:56:58.326]  and wired in.
[00:56:58.326 --> 00:57:15.713]  I mean, they'll SWAT team your house for, you know, one for, for, from Texas folks, they will SWAT team your house for, you know, I guess one gram of cocaine, but they publicly launder the money into the Federal Reserve Banks.
[00:57:16.568 --> 00:57:19.209]  So, and that's just one example of hundreds.
[00:57:19.209 --> 00:57:20.730]  And don't roll your eyes, police.
[00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.611]  You can go look that law up.
[00:57:22.611 --> 00:57:29.854]  The Reuters has reported on it in connection to Richard Grasso, former head of the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:57:29.854 --> 00:57:31.315]  Just, in fact, you know what?
[00:57:31.315 --> 00:57:32.755]  You're rolling your eyes again.
[00:57:32.755 --> 00:57:41.639]  Google Richard Grasso, spark gorillas, and you'll get all the mainstream news articles from years ago about it.
[00:57:41.639 --> 00:57:43.460]  It's just so lawless.
[00:57:44.492 --> 00:57:49.435]  Uh, so cancerous, and it's going to seed.
[00:57:49.435 --> 00:57:51.075]  They can't help themselves.
[00:57:51.075 --> 00:58:03.842]  It's like weevils that get into a bag of grain in your pantry, and it's just a bunch of weevils in there basically now, and we're just trying to wake the people up so we have something to salvage.
[00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:14.476]  Alex, the story that caught my attention yesterday was where our federal government took veterans' records and commercial truck drivers' license information, their date of birth,
[00:58:15.089 --> 00:58:25.091]  And they're trying to say that 50% of our independent truck drivers right now are 100% disabled or they're collecting a social security check and they're double dipping.
[00:58:25.091 --> 00:58:32.393]  And with fuel prices being over $5 a gallon right now, that's the next industry, the big business in a new world order.
[00:58:32.393 --> 00:58:32.953]  Exactly.
[00:58:32.953 --> 00:58:37.394]  More police, more checkpoints, being squeezed, everyone being harassed.
[00:58:37.394 --> 00:58:39.955]  The government's not going to back off in that economy.
[00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.581]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:04.561 --> 00:59:15.206]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[00:59:19.027 --> 00:59:20.768]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.

[00:59:45.178 --> 00:59:46.379]  Truth is our weapon.

[00:59:53.826 --> 00:59:56.228]  Waging war on corruption.

[01:00:05.623 --> 01:00:10.467]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:12.049]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.949]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:17.793]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.793 --> 01:00:23.138]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:26.221]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to calmly as I can
[01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.251]  Run through the plan to shut down and kill the internet.
[01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.292]  Big new developments on that front.
[01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:36.573]  Also on the economy, then Ford.
[01:00:36.573 --> 01:00:41.635]  An hour and a half, we're joined by Dr. Nick Baggage coming up.
[01:00:41.635 --> 01:00:48.978]  But I love taking your calls because you never know what direction will take us in next as we spin the wheel of fortune here.
[01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:53.340]  Let's go to Greg in Iowa, then Jefferson, Adam, Issa, Mason, and others.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.961]  You're on the air, Greg.
[01:00:54.961 --> 01:00:55.281]  Welcome.
[01:00:56.002 --> 01:00:59.784]  Alex, I would like your opinion about something.
[01:00:59.784 --> 01:01:04.407]  A while ago, a friend of my son's was back.
[01:01:04.407 --> 01:01:10.251]  He's going to be starting his third tour in Iraq.
[01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:18.676]  And at the base, he said that the CIA gathered a group of soldiers.
[01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:20.497]  He was one of them.
[01:01:20.497 --> 01:01:24.240]  And they showed him pictures
[01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:25.263]  Oh,
[01:01:55.852 --> 01:02:14.771]  Uh, people that were there, uh, was, uh, showing them a picture of the Pentagon, and it showed a picture of a plane coming in, and the, the guy was saying, okay, watch this, plane, plane, plane, and then he pushed stop, and there was a missile.
[01:02:14.771 --> 01:02:16.472]  And he goes, missile.
[01:02:16.472 --> 01:02:18.614]  Alright, listen, I'm going to hold you over if you need me.
[01:02:20.308 --> 01:02:31.384]  Greg, I don't want you to hang up, but if this is true, this is the kind of stuff that will get a hit team sent to your house, and us as well, and your son.
[01:02:31.384 --> 01:02:34.429]  If it's true, is your son in Special Operations?
[01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:36.512]  No.
[01:02:36.512 --> 01:02:36.652]  No.
[01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:42.451]  Well, I mean, either, either, I don't, you don't sound like you're lying, but, but, but either you're lying.
[01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:43.751]  No, let me stop you.
[01:02:43.751 --> 01:02:44.571]  Let me stop you.
[01:02:44.571 --> 01:02:48.493]  Or it was some type of psychological warfare test.
[01:02:48.493 --> 01:02:52.234]  Uh, well, I mean, what was their, why did they, when was this?
[01:02:52.234 --> 01:02:59.277]  Um, a couple months ago.
[01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:02.338]  I, this is why it's not my son.
[01:03:02.338 --> 01:03:03.498]  It's a friend of my son.
[01:03:09.784 --> 01:03:11.885]  Okay, go ahead and finish telling your story.
[01:03:11.885 --> 01:03:15.686]  Well, a friend of my son's was telling him this.
[01:03:15.686 --> 01:03:17.067]  Not my son.
[01:03:17.067 --> 01:03:23.889]  Okay, I had somebody coming in talking to me, but while you were talking, asking me about a guest, so I missed about five seconds what you said.
[01:03:23.889 --> 01:03:24.349]  Start over.
[01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:35.794]  No, I was a friend of my son's was telling my son this story that happened to him.
[01:03:35.794 --> 01:03:35.934]  And I
[01:03:36.857 --> 01:03:43.461]  Just, you know, I'm sitting there going, I can't believe why this would occur.
[01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:45.962]  Was this person in Special Operations?
[01:03:45.962 --> 01:03:48.484]  I don't know what he does.
[01:03:48.484 --> 01:03:49.705]  I'm not sure.
[01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:51.306]  But see, that's just total rumor.
[01:03:51.306 --> 01:03:58.950]  It's kind of, I don't know what this guy does, and my son talked to him and he told me this, but he said he was in the Army?
[01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:59.791]  Yes.
[01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:02.732]  And that they called in how many of them?
[01:04:02.732 --> 01:04:04.333]  A group.
[01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:05.514]  That's all he said, a group.
[01:04:06.204 --> 01:04:08.585]  And then she said, we blew the towers up.
[01:04:08.585 --> 01:04:13.747]  Showed them.
[01:04:13.747 --> 01:04:19.010]  Well, I would imagine if I had to guess what this is, that it was a person.
[01:04:21.192 --> 01:04:33.357]  In intelligence, who's actually a 9-11 truther, and showed a group of people, because our films are all over the bases, and we know we've got people in every level of government, and then they misconstrued it and thought they were being shown some secret footage.
[01:04:33.357 --> 01:04:43.822]  Because we do have up-close footage, and we do clearly have the blast squibs going off, and we can clearly pause the video of the, quote, plane coming in, and it doesn't look like a plane, and it's a missile.
[01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:46.706]  I would imagine that that is what happened.
[01:04:46.706 --> 01:04:52.675]  And then, you ever seen the game where you get around a table and tell one person one thing, and then the next person the next thing?
[01:04:52.675 --> 01:04:53.556]  But stay there.
[01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:53.857]  Stay there.
[01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:55.339]  I don't want you to hang up, and I'm glad you called.
[01:04:55.339 --> 01:04:56.921]  I mean, I don't think you're lying.
[01:04:56.921 --> 01:04:57.903]  I don't think your son's lying.
[01:04:57.903 --> 01:04:59.826]  I just think there's probably a misunderstanding here.
[01:05:01.753 --> 01:05:10.661]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:15.826]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:05:15.826 --> 01:05:26.956]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:05:27.336 --> 01:05:33.121]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:33.121 --> 01:05:39.387]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:39.387 --> 01:05:40.428]  What about you?
[01:05:40.428 --> 01:05:44.531]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:05:52.939 --> 01:05:53.299]  I've come
[01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:07.889]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:06:07.889 --> 01:06:09.451]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:11.152]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:06:11.152 --> 01:06:14.055]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:06:14.055 --> 01:06:19.099]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:06:19.099 --> 01:06:27.346]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:06:27.346 --> 01:06:32.231]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:06:40.075 --> 01:06:43.678]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:06:43.678 --> 01:06:46.299]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:06:46.299 --> 01:06:52.904]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:47.662]  I was just talking to Greg during the break and he said,
[01:08:13.732 --> 01:08:20.353]  Well, he said some more things, so it looks like it may have actually happened, or he actually knows the young man, so it's not nebulous.
[01:08:20.353 --> 01:08:22.514]  I thought it was some rumor.
[01:08:22.514 --> 01:08:27.074]  And pretty scary stuff, so we'll talk to him about that in about 10 minutes.
[01:08:27.074 --> 01:08:35.456]  And then we'll also go to Jefferson, Adam, Essa, Mason, and others.
[01:08:35.456 --> 01:08:36.696]  Wide open phones today.
[01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:38.817]  Dr. Nick Maggott's coming up in about 50 minutes.
[01:08:41.471 --> 01:08:55.240]  I'm gonna get into what's happening with the attack on the internet in about 20, but I am always honored once a month to have him come and visit us, not just because he's a great guy, World War II vet, close to 61 years, they've been around since 1947.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:11.091]  He and his father set up Calbin Pure Soap when he got out of the Chemical Corps in the military over in Japan, and he came back and set up a company that his father and he started, and now his son and family run it out of Oakland, California.
[01:09:12.327 --> 01:09:13.548]  I want to be clear.
[01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:25.153]  When you buy organic soap at the store, you normally pay about twice what you would pay for the chemical detergent byproducts of petrochemical.
[01:09:25.153 --> 01:09:33.917]  You see, in the refining of oil, in the gasoline, they want to use everything that's left, including the fluoride.
[01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:35.998]  And so they say, oh, fluoride's nutritious for your teeth.
[01:09:36.853 --> 01:09:39.735]  No, it's a toxic sedative, and they put it in your water.
[01:09:39.735 --> 01:09:43.338]  Or they would have to store it and get rid of it, and that would cut into profits.
[01:09:43.338 --> 01:09:52.564]  And they've got all these other chemicals and sulfurs and things, and they end up turning that into the products that go into your soaps.
[01:09:52.564 --> 01:10:02.571]  I know this because my great-uncle, just retired a few years ago, ran, all the way from Roughneck up, was the head of a plant that made everything.
[01:10:03.183 --> 01:10:05.124]  One of the biggest plants in Houston.
[01:10:05.124 --> 01:10:10.125]  But side issue, I remember being a little kid and getting a tour of it and being told all about it.
[01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:11.245]  But side issue.
[01:10:11.245 --> 01:10:26.790]  The point is, is that you end up paying about twice as much for something based out of orange, or cherry, or other fruits, other citruses, excellent as cleaners, other vegetable products.
[01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.991]  Well, that doesn't happen with Calvin Tersel because you cut out all the middlemen.
[01:10:31.005 --> 01:10:40.012]  It isn't some Johnny-come-lately organic soap company, and it's not in Whole Foods or something else that then has a huge yuppie, you know, trendy markup.
[01:10:40.012 --> 01:10:46.437]  No, you don't pay twice for clean, healthy, real soap, chemical and tear-free.
[01:10:46.437 --> 01:11:00.167]  You pay 85% off what you would pay, not for organic soap, you pay double that, but chemical soaps that aren't really soap, soap in name only, kind of like Republican in name only.
[01:11:01.209 --> 01:11:01.929]  Rhinos.
[01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:12.533]  So this is just great stuff and I've told you, I was sent a box of this because the sales manager was a conservative but also an environmentalist.
[01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:14.214]  He was into great values.
[01:11:14.214 --> 01:11:20.636]  He also had allergies and didn't like regular soaps and said, hey man you ought to hear about this this Marty and Calvin Versoap.
[01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:25.152]  He wants to send you some, and I said, okay, this is about six, seven years ago now, I forget.
[01:11:25.152 --> 01:11:26.393]  Sends me a box.
[01:11:26.393 --> 01:11:27.813]  It runs out a year later.
[01:11:27.813 --> 01:11:29.774]  Little, I mean, it was not a little box, but not a huge box.
[01:11:29.774 --> 01:11:30.694]  Lasted all year.
[01:11:30.694 --> 01:11:31.794]  He goes, I want more of that.
[01:11:31.794 --> 01:11:33.795]  So I said, why not get him as a sponsor?
[01:11:33.795 --> 01:11:36.836]  So we did, and that's the rest of the story.
[01:11:36.836 --> 01:11:40.037]  But I bring you great deals.
[01:11:40.037 --> 01:11:42.018]  You know, I tell you to buy gold, and it goes from $264 an ounce to $1,000.
[01:11:42.018 --> 01:11:45.119]  I tell you to get silver when it's $6 an ounce and it's $19.
[01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:51.762]  I tell you, buy firearms, they're gonna go up in value.
[01:11:51.762 --> 01:11:53.923]  Get ammo five years ago, it's gonna go up in value.
[01:11:53.923 --> 01:11:56.004]  Ammo's quadrupled in cost.
[01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:57.605]  I mean, I just, I track things.
[01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:58.706]  I interview the experts.
[01:11:58.706 --> 01:12:00.567]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:12:00.567 --> 01:12:05.949]  And you hurt the New World Order and the oil companies, you're not gonna be able to save on your gas.
[01:12:05.949 --> 01:12:15.934]  But at least you don't have to then go buy their petrochemical detergents that they call soap and cleaners that give you asthma and fry you and attack your mucous membranes.
[01:12:15.934 --> 01:12:17.075]  No, you can save money
[01:12:18.283 --> 01:12:26.865]  Support Marty, support this show, and not give the oil company some money when they're already taking so much from you.
[01:12:26.865 --> 01:12:29.186]  So, uh, Marty, good to have you with us.
[01:12:29.186 --> 01:12:30.306]  Good talk to you, Alex.
[01:12:30.306 --> 01:12:32.107]  I'd like to make an opening statement.
[01:12:32.107 --> 01:12:33.187]  Sure.
[01:12:33.187 --> 01:12:37.448]  If you don't read a newspaper, you're uninformed.
[01:12:37.448 --> 01:12:41.629]  If you do read a newspaper, you are misinformed.
[01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:48.031]  If you listen to Alex Jones, you are not only informed, but awakened and enlightened.
[01:12:50.273 --> 01:12:51.075]  Well, we try, Marty.
[01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.578]  Thank you.
[01:12:52.578 --> 01:12:53.760]  My pleasure.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.611]  Good talking to you and to your listeners, and trying to save them lots of money.
[01:12:59.366 --> 01:13:09.773]  We're the only company in the United States that offers pure soaps to save money from the pinch of rising costs of everything.
[01:13:09.773 --> 01:13:10.933]  There's no one else left.
[01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:27.084]  We are the only ones still making soap, still sticking to that old-fashioned formula, which doesn't burn the clothes, deteriorate the clothing, burn the skin, corrode everything it comes in contact with, and costs a fortune.
[01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:34.589]  We're still there, we're still working, we're still doing, and we appreciate your endorsement of our Pure Soil product.
[01:13:34.589 --> 01:13:36.452]  It's been really gratifying.
[01:13:36.452 --> 01:13:44.241]  Well, Marty, run down how you started the company, the same formulas you had 60, almost 61 years ago.
[01:13:46.821 --> 01:13:52.526]  Run down what is in it, why it's so good, and how you're able to give it to people for 85% off.
[01:13:52.526 --> 01:13:57.250]  Well, in 1947, my father retired from civil service.
[01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:07.659]  I just got out of the Chemical Warfare Corps after serving a couple years in the Army, and we were sort of looking at what was going on in the country, being together again.
[01:14:07.659 --> 01:14:11.983]  He said, you know, I see something happening in the supermarkets.
[01:14:11.983 --> 01:14:12.764]  There's been more soap.
[01:14:13.436 --> 01:14:15.678]  And my dad says, oh yeah, there's always soap.
[01:14:15.678 --> 01:14:18.321]  Then no, it's detergent.
[01:14:18.321 --> 01:14:19.842]  Soap is a history.
[01:14:19.842 --> 01:14:21.224]  Soap is an antique.
[01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:26.729]  It's all detergents now, coming from formulas of captured Germany.
[01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:27.730]  This is what's going on.
[01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:32.795]  And we decided, well, why don't we start a very small family soap company?
[01:14:33.559 --> 01:14:35.600]  And my father says, yeah, we can do that.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:43.304]  And I said, well, I don't know how we could do that to compete against Procter, Lever, and Colgate, billion-dollar corporations.
[01:14:43.304 --> 01:14:49.087]  And here we are, just two individuals with our wives to start a little soap company.
[01:14:49.087 --> 01:14:54.110]  And he gave me the four magic words, which I live by all these years.
[01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:56.151]  And those were the four words were,
[01:15:00.188 --> 01:15:01.588]  Did we just lose, Marty?
[01:15:01.588 --> 01:15:03.809]  No, no, I'm looking for my four words.
[01:15:03.809 --> 01:15:05.009]  Oh, oh, good.
[01:15:05.009 --> 01:15:08.150]  Be twice as good.
[01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:09.631]  And you can make it.
[01:15:09.631 --> 01:15:18.333]  And that's been our philosophy, that our products are literally twice as good as what's available on the shelves at the marketplace.
[01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:20.674]  And we stand by it, we guarantee it.
[01:15:20.674 --> 01:15:27.076]  There's nothing like our pure soap bars, our shampoo, our dish soap, our laundry soap.
[01:15:27.076 --> 01:15:28.276]  That's all our products.
[01:15:28.276 --> 01:15:29.577]  And they'll do a hundred jobs.
[01:15:30.157 --> 01:15:31.158]  And we're staying with it.
[01:15:31.158 --> 01:15:32.860]  We've got savings.
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.782]  Unbelievable savings.
[01:15:34.782 --> 01:15:43.730]  I've got a formula here that if you bought a one-year supply and invested, including the freight and everything, $180.
[01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:45.271]  That's your investment for a year.
[01:15:45.271 --> 01:15:46.753]  That comes out to $3.50 a week.
[01:15:46.753 --> 01:15:46.913]  Now,
[01:15:50.865 --> 01:15:56.768]  An average family right now is spending over $20 a week for cleaning products.
[01:15:56.768 --> 01:16:03.251]  That is, for every dollar they spend at a supermarket, 20 cents of that dollar goes for cleaning chemicals.
[01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:16.798]  Well, it don't take much, and this is a 10-year-old figure, to spend $100 a week at the marketplace for your steaks and vegetables and canned goods and bakery goods and cleaning products.
[01:16:16.798 --> 01:16:17.518]  $100 a week!
[01:16:17.518 --> 01:16:19.199]  That's a pretty low-ball figure.
[01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:20.280]  That's poverty level.
[01:16:20.856 --> 01:16:36.740]  Now out of that hundred, $20 of that goes for Tide, and Oil, and Dash, and Cheer, and Dial, and Dash, and an endless array of chemicals for the floor, for the windows, for the body, for the hair, for the laundry.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:37.701]  Endless.
[01:16:37.701 --> 01:16:38.001]  At $20 a week.
[01:16:47.006 --> 01:16:53.731]  Now, we're not bashing some of the other organic companies that have come along, but a lot of that's real harsh.
[01:16:53.731 --> 01:16:56.733]  You know, they're having to pay for advertising in the market with a store.
[01:16:56.733 --> 01:17:07.320]  That's another reason you're getting this shit 85% off what the detergent garbage is, is because it's directly from the man who makes it right there in Oakland, California, Marty.
[01:17:08.214 --> 01:17:22.418]  People should get a free brochure, they should go to 5 Star Soap, that's just the number 5, starsoap.com, or calvinpearsoap.com, they should call the toll-free number, get a brochure, but they shouldn't wait around and procrastinate and then forget about this interview.
[01:17:22.418 --> 01:17:28.440]  They need to call, and they need to get your tote bag, tell folks about that so they can try it out.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.321]  Soap is an essential service.
[01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:35.406]  I mean, you know, without cleanliness, we have no civilization.
[01:17:35.406 --> 01:17:38.631]  And, you know, you could say, oh, that's too good to be true.
[01:17:38.631 --> 01:17:44.900]  It's good, and it's true, and we can prove it unconditionally, unconditionally, I guarantee.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.382]  They can get a sample pack.
[01:17:47.404 --> 01:17:49.385]  These are the people who say, well, I don't know.
[01:17:49.385 --> 01:17:50.166]  I'm not sure.
[01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.588]  I've never heard of it before.
[01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:52.548]  That's right.
[01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:54.550]  We're the world's best kept secret.
[01:17:54.550 --> 01:18:08.143]  They can get a one month supply, a six pound package of triple concentrated products of bath soap and hair soap and dish soap and laundry soap and a cleaning nylon scouring pad, a book of instructions for $20.
[01:18:09.264 --> 01:18:11.084]  Marty, we're almost out of time.
[01:18:11.084 --> 01:18:15.605]  5starsoap.com, order the tote bag there, get a month or a year supply, whatever you want.
[01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:20.186]  Really, it hits the old companies where it hurts, or call the toll-free number.
[01:18:20.186 --> 01:18:22.126]  Marty, give them the number.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:37.641]  Area code 510-886-6789 or 1-800-340.
[01:18:48.202 --> 01:18:48.222]  7091.
[01:18:48.222 --> 01:18:49.802]  That's 800-340-7091.
[01:18:49.802 --> 01:18:55.965]  Or our website, 5starsoap.com.
[01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:59.987]  And again, that number, if you missed it, folks, 1-800-340-7091.
[01:18:59.987 --> 01:19:01.788]  I really do believe in this fine product.
[01:19:01.788 --> 01:19:02.828]  Give Marty a call.
[01:19:02.828 --> 01:19:05.569]  This is how you hurt the big boys and stop being ripped off by them.
[01:19:05.569 --> 01:19:07.030]  Get out of their system.
[01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:11.432]  1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com.
[01:19:11.432 --> 01:19:13.513]  Marty, give me a limerick.
[01:19:13.513 --> 01:19:15.394]  There was a young lady of Venice
[01:19:16.363 --> 01:19:20.344]  Who used hard-boiled eggs to play tennis.
[01:19:20.344 --> 01:19:24.525]  When they said, you are wrong, she said, go along.
[01:19:24.525 --> 01:19:28.805]  You don't know how prolific my hen is.
[01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:31.246]  Alright, counter.
[01:19:31.246 --> 01:19:37.767]  A silly, a silly young fella named Hyde, in a funeral procession, was spied.
[01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:43.068]  When asked, who is dead, he giggled and said, I don't know, I just came for the ride.
[01:19:44.588 --> 01:19:45.850]  Marty, thank you so much.
[01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:47.032]  We'll talk to you next month.
[01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.935]  FiveStarSoap.com, 1-800-340-7091.
[01:19:48.935 --> 01:19:50.678]  Thank you, Marty.
[01:19:50.678 --> 01:19:52.801]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:52.801 --> 01:19:53.502]  Have a great week.
[01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:54.584]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:19:54.584 --> 01:19:56.487]  You can get back to that caller with that info about 9-11.
[01:20:01.238 --> 01:20:03.220]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.822]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:20:06.822 --> 01:20:09.284]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:20:09.284 --> 01:20:12.326]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:12.326 --> 01:20:18.070]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:21.973]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:22.293 --> 01:20:27.495]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:20:27.495 --> 01:20:30.537]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:20:59.385 --> 01:21:00.147]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:21:01.886 --> 01:21:05.668]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:05.668 --> 01:21:10.691]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:16.154]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:16.154 --> 01:21:26.640]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.524]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:31.524 --> 01:21:34.307]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:21:34.307 --> 01:21:37.890]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:50.402]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:06.591]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:22:06.591 --> 01:22:09.893]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:22:09.893 --> 01:22:16.757]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:22:16.757 --> 01:22:18.878]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:22:19.378 --> 01:22:22.662]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:22:22.662 --> 01:22:27.447]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:31.391]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:22:31.391 --> 01:22:33.013]  Travel less, meet online.

[01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:05.487]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:23:05.487 --> 01:23:06.909]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:23:06.909 --> 01:23:10.774]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:23:10.774 --> 01:23:13.698]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:23:13.698 --> 01:23:15.781]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:23:15.781 --> 01:23:17.924]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:23:19.105 --> 01:23:24.772]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:23:24.772 --> 01:23:27.275]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:23:34.784 --> 01:23:36.886]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:23:36.886 --> 01:23:39.448]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:43.151]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.873]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:23:45.873 --> 01:23:46.513]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.461]  Okay, let's go back to Greg in Iowa.
[01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:13.802]  He just came out of the gates earlier with an amazing statement.
[01:24:13.802 --> 01:24:17.362]  You've got the floor with as much detail as you can.
[01:24:17.362 --> 01:24:22.643]  You say you know this young man, friends with your son, you know he's in the army, you know he's been in Iraq.
[01:24:22.643 --> 01:24:27.304]  He comes back freaking out, calling his family, telling your son about all this.
[01:24:27.304 --> 01:24:29.125]  Specifically, start at the beginning again.
[01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:31.925]  Alright.
[01:24:31.925 --> 01:24:35.226]  This is, you know, the only thing that I know
[01:24:36.255 --> 01:25:05.381]  is that at his base a group of soldiers were brought in a room I guess by the CIA and shown films of the World Trade Center bombing and the Pentagon and it was
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.621]  You know, just what I told you.
[01:25:09.621 --> 01:25:17.704]  They showed films of bombs going off is what they said.
[01:25:17.704 --> 01:25:25.887]  And then they showed a film of a plane coming in to the Pentagon and they said, plane, plane, plane.
[01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:31.309]  And then they put it on still and then they said missile.
[01:25:31.309 --> 01:25:35.050]  Can we go back for a minute?
[01:25:35.863 --> 01:25:37.663]  Because we talked off air and you told me some things.
[01:25:37.663 --> 01:25:46.925]  Uh, specifically here, sir, let's talk about, you talked about it flashing secret across the video.
[01:25:46.925 --> 01:25:52.786]  Let's go back and talk about, uh, whatever else was said concerning bombs in the buildings.
[01:25:52.786 --> 01:26:01.688]  And, uh, was, was this friend of your son's from the military, the army saying to be clear on record that the CIA was saying we did this?
[01:26:01.688 --> 01:26:05.269]  They, I don't know if they ever said, uh,
[01:26:06.485 --> 01:26:08.546]  That they did it.
[01:26:08.546 --> 01:26:15.209]  They just said, you know, here's... Well, I... I'm not really sure, I guess.
[01:26:15.209 --> 01:26:22.133]  The, uh... But the whole point is he's freaked out and came home, and, and... I mean, let's be clear here about what you're saying, sir.
[01:26:22.133 --> 01:26:24.754]  Make it simple for us to understand.
[01:26:24.754 --> 01:26:25.615]  Okay.
[01:26:25.615 --> 01:26:26.155]  Yeah.
[01:26:26.155 --> 01:26:31.358]  I mean, in a nutshell, you were implying, and then off air you were saying that he came back freaked out, thinking the government did it.
[01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:34.239]  I mean, that's what he brought away from this.
[01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:35.900]  Yes.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:36.060]  Yes.
[01:26:36.747 --> 01:26:48.372]  Okay, I mean, I'm not trying to interrogate you, I'm trying to find out... I know, I know, it's just... You know, it's just... Yeah, he was freaked out.
[01:26:48.372 --> 01:26:57.516]  He called his parents from the base afterwards and he didn't know what to do and he was freaking out then.
[01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:57.876]  Okay.
[01:26:57.876 --> 01:27:03.298]  And then he came back home a while ago.
[01:27:03.298 --> 01:27:05.319]  For a brief time.
[01:27:05.319 --> 01:27:05.419]  And...
[01:27:07.344 --> 01:27:07.704]  Yeah.
[01:27:07.704 --> 01:27:10.446]  And you told me this happened off-air two months ago?
[01:27:10.446 --> 01:27:12.488]  Approximately.
[01:27:12.488 --> 01:27:13.308]  Okay.
[01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:14.789]  Well, I appreciate you calling with this.
[01:27:14.789 --> 01:27:23.555]  It may have been of some psych warfare test, because that kind of... Well, see, this is why I wanted to run it by you, just to get your opinion on it.
[01:27:23.555 --> 01:27:35.383]  I don't know exactly what it is, and I've been like, you know, why... I'm just trying to understand why, even if it were true,
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.322]  Why they would be doing this.
[01:27:49.946 --> 01:27:50.566]  Yeah.
[01:27:50.566 --> 01:27:52.207]  Sounds like some kind of nasty test.
[01:27:52.207 --> 01:28:13.695]  You see, that coincides around the time that they know we're flooding the troops with Terrorist Storm and Loose Change Final Cut with Mark Dice's operation, and they may have been psych testing, psych warfare testing, what the response would be, you know, if the troops were told by authority figures that the government did it.
[01:28:13.695 --> 01:28:18.557]  And I'm not trying to say, oh my God, we've got the smoking gun and poo-poo that the government would admit they did it.
[01:28:19.658 --> 01:28:46.134]  It's just that it's so highly compartmentalized, we know the government did do it at Criminal Elements, but to have those compartments then telling the troops that they did it, it's just extremely bizarre, so I'm just... That's what I was having, you know, I really couldn't, you know, what this guy was saying, although I do believe every word he said, but
[01:28:47.338 --> 01:28:50.080]  I'm trying to understand the rationale.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.324]  Well, specifically, anything else they said, I mean, after.
[01:28:54.324 --> 01:28:57.806]  I mean, so they said, that's a missile, you know, you think it's a plane, but it's really a missile.
[01:28:57.806 --> 01:29:01.609]  What else did they say to him?
[01:29:01.609 --> 01:29:04.351]  Well, that's about all he would disclose.
[01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:05.392]  Well, you say about all.
[01:29:05.392 --> 01:29:06.733]  I mean, think, go back.
[01:29:06.733 --> 01:29:07.373]  There's more.
[01:29:07.373 --> 01:29:08.874]  Believe me, there's always more.
[01:29:08.874 --> 01:29:09.735]  What else did he say?
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:15.480]  Take your time.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.121]  We're going to break.
[01:29:16.121 --> 01:29:17.701]  I want you to think about it during the break.
[01:29:17.701 --> 01:29:19.942]  You can hold over, right?
[01:29:19.942 --> 01:29:20.522]  Yeah.
[01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:20.923]  Okay.
[01:29:20.923 --> 01:29:23.864]  I want to, because you sound like you believe it.
[01:29:23.864 --> 01:29:28.266]  And I have no doubt that, that this is probably what happened.
[01:29:28.266 --> 01:29:32.007]  It's just take Chris Jones who snuck into Bohemian Grove and got the footage.
[01:29:32.007 --> 01:29:37.790]  He showed it to teenage kids in the neighborhood and they arrested him saying that he showed a video of a baby being killed.
[01:29:38.797 --> 01:29:41.878]  And then he went to court and then he went to prison for it.
[01:29:41.878 --> 01:29:49.060]  So see, America's so dumbed down that they might watch Star Wars and think Luke Skywalker's real.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.781]  They might have been watching one of our films.
[01:29:51.781 --> 01:29:53.161]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.161 --> 01:29:55.682]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:58.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.684 --> 01:30:07.648]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:30:07.648 --> 01:30:12.431]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:30:12.431 --> 01:30:17.854]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:30:17.854 --> 01:30:21.236]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:30:21.776 --> 01:30:30.304]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[01:30:30.304 --> 01:30:36.089]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[01:30:36.089 --> 01:30:42.095]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:30:42.095 --> 01:30:44.397]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[01:30:44.617 --> 01:30:44.978]  I think so.
[01:31:02.933 --> 01:31:10.396]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[01:31:10.396 --> 01:31:14.418]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[01:31:14.418 --> 01:31:18.460]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:07.273]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:32:07.273 --> 01:32:08.534]  And we knew what to do.
[01:32:08.534 --> 01:32:10.595]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:32:10.595 --> 01:32:16.958]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:32:19.036 --> 01:32:26.519]  The EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:32:26.519 --> 01:32:33.622]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:32:33.622 --> 01:32:36.784]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:41.866]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:32:42.546 --> 01:32:45.627]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:32:54.589 --> 01:33:02.452]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:08.273]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.273 --> 01:33:10.554]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:16.801 --> 01:33:28.306]  This is why we need to take more calls on this show because so many times we get amazing leads from listeners and are able to ferret out what's really happening and we break major stories.
[01:33:28.306 --> 01:33:35.229]  This could have really happened the way our listener is interpreting it.
[01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:42.712]  I find it likely, I don't know how likely, but likely that someone in intelligence
[01:33:44.212 --> 01:33:55.060]  Showed them, somebody who's on our side and we know we've got a lot of them, showed them footage except for the part about secret being across the tape.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:34:01.405]  I would have to talk to this young man to try to ferret out exactly what he's saying.
[01:34:01.405 --> 01:34:04.688]  Is he back in Iraq or is he here in the United States?
[01:34:04.688 --> 01:34:09.291]  He's in the United States for a while.
[01:34:09.878 --> 01:34:12.098]  Well, I can give you my phone number.
[01:34:12.098 --> 01:34:13.099]  I've got your phone number.
[01:34:13.099 --> 01:34:37.784]  The only other thing that I remember, you asked me to remember, and the other thing that I remember is that he was saying that in the film they showed him, the explosions at the World Trade Center started at the bottom.
[01:34:37.784 --> 01:34:38.884]  That's what he was saying.
[01:34:39.693 --> 01:35:01.355]  That that and this is why I think there was a different camera set up because they were this camera was like evidently in a position that others weren't.
[01:35:01.355 --> 01:35:03.577]  And that's the one thing that kind of
[01:35:04.164 --> 01:35:07.466]  Really surprised me from what... Well, no, that actually fits.
[01:35:07.466 --> 01:35:15.931]  They had explosives at the top and on the bottom from the different eyewitnesses, police, firemen, William Rodriguez and others.
[01:35:15.931 --> 01:35:16.952]  It's on record.
[01:35:16.952 --> 01:35:22.715]  Hundreds of witnesses of bombs going off, explosions in the basement in the first levels.
[01:35:22.715 --> 01:35:31.280]  And there's even on video, on the news, you hear big booms, booms before they start blowing the top of the building as well.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.702]  Well, this is what he said.
[01:35:34.412 --> 01:35:37.453]  I mean, did he say why the quote CIA was showing him?
[01:35:37.453 --> 01:35:40.894]  Did he say the number of people that were taken aside and shown this?
[01:35:40.894 --> 01:35:42.774]  No.
[01:35:42.774 --> 01:35:43.494]  No.
[01:35:43.494 --> 01:35:50.836]  It could be a handful, it could be 50, 100, I don't know.
[01:35:50.836 --> 01:35:56.998]  And so, you know this young man you were telling me, and then you say you believe your son.
[01:35:56.998 --> 01:36:01.139]  Did this young man tell you this, or did your son tell you this about the young man you know?
[01:36:01.139 --> 01:36:01.899]  My son told me.
[01:36:03.459 --> 01:36:04.820]  And when did your son tell you this?
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.382]  A couple of months ago.
[01:36:07.382 --> 01:36:10.164]  And you just now are calling into the show?
[01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:13.546]  Yeah, I tried a few times, but... No, I understand.
[01:36:13.546 --> 01:36:18.630]  We only take calls about, well, we take calls about four or five days a week, but just in small sections today.
[01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:26.996]  I'm going to try to make myself, just so many great guests I want to interview, phase back in two or three days a week, really having half the show be phone calls.
[01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:29.232]  Some people want me just to cover news.
[01:36:29.232 --> 01:36:30.493]  Others want me to just take calls.
[01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:31.934]  Others want me to just have guests.
[01:36:31.934 --> 01:36:32.695]  I love guests.
[01:36:32.695 --> 01:36:33.455]  I love calls.
[01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:45.024]  I also love covering news, but what I really like doing is ranting and raving, and that is good radio, but I don't think it's as effective as it would be just covering information.
[01:36:45.024 --> 01:36:46.425]  So I'm going to try to control myself.
[01:36:46.425 --> 01:36:48.987]  All day I've been really controlling myself.
[01:36:48.987 --> 01:36:52.609]  People may have noticed no ranting in now an hour and 37 minutes.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:59.525]  So even though this type of information makes me want to rant, try to find out more, sir.
[01:36:59.525 --> 01:37:08.934]  And I'm going to give you the hotline number at the network so that from like 7 in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon when John Harmon's there.
[01:37:08.934 --> 01:37:09.895]  John's a great guy.
[01:37:09.895 --> 01:37:11.156]  You can trust him.
[01:37:11.156 --> 01:37:12.057]  He runs my show.
[01:37:12.057 --> 01:37:16.501]  If there's any messages for me or any new developments or you want me to get in contact with this individual,
[01:37:17.396 --> 01:37:17.676]  Very good.
[01:37:17.676 --> 01:37:18.697]  Well, that's about all I know right now.
[01:37:18.697 --> 01:37:18.817]  Yes.
[01:37:18.817 --> 01:37:19.698]  Actually, he was very quiet.
[01:37:19.698 --> 01:37:22.040]  I mean, that's how my son freaks out.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.341]  He just gets quiet and into himself for a couple
[01:37:51.483 --> 01:37:53.424]  Absolutely, I do know how that is.
[01:37:53.424 --> 01:37:55.624]  That's what I do when I'm not on air and something freaks me out.
[01:37:55.624 --> 01:38:00.145]  In fact, most of the time now, I really don't talk a lot when I'm not on air.
[01:38:00.145 --> 01:38:02.086]  I just, I don't know what to do anymore.
[01:38:02.086 --> 01:38:10.088]  When you're holding your hands, all the declassified, this is certified admitted, they created HIV, hundreds of cancer viruses.
[01:38:10.088 --> 01:38:13.029]  I mean, all these people dying around us, they're killing most of them.
[01:38:13.029 --> 01:38:18.330]  It's just going to go on and on and on because the people are too afraid to admit it to themselves.
[01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:20.571]  And we could change this tomorrow, but it isn't going to stop.
[01:38:21.289 --> 01:38:27.690]  It's just going to get wilder and crazier and more evil, and I just can't believe it because life's so good.
[01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:29.771]  I don't want to be fighting this.
[01:38:29.771 --> 01:38:31.371]  I'm about to get upset.
[01:38:31.371 --> 01:38:43.653]  I want to be fishing, and I want to be boating, and I want to be hiking, and I want to be camping, and a garden, and I want to be oil painting, and fiddling around, and visiting family, and going to the beach, and building sandcastles, and working.
[01:38:43.653 --> 01:38:45.234]  You know, I do not like this.
[01:38:45.234 --> 01:38:46.154]  This is not fun.
[01:38:47.536 --> 01:38:49.178]  And I'm starting to rant.
[01:38:49.178 --> 01:38:55.803]  Thank you so much for your courage in calling in, Greg, and I believe that you are putting this out as you interpret it.
[01:38:55.803 --> 01:39:08.634]  I only hope it's something else, and we already know it's an inside job, but if they're arrogantly telling select troops they did it, it's... God knows the method of these people's madness, but I appreciate you calling in.
[01:39:08.634 --> 01:39:09.354]  Really appreciate it.
[01:39:09.354 --> 01:39:10.095]  I'll give him the number.
[01:39:10.095 --> 01:39:10.375]  Thank you.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.061]  I talk about it a lot because it really is just the end of the road.
[01:39:20.061 --> 01:39:23.763]  It's the put up or shut up, make a decision point.
[01:39:23.763 --> 01:39:30.565]  For all the police out there listening, the military, government people, social engineers, social workers, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[01:39:30.565 --> 01:39:32.626]  I know some of you are good, some of you are bad.
[01:39:32.626 --> 01:39:37.608]  Most of you are like all of us, dumbed down, compartmentalized, not fully cognizant.
[01:39:37.608 --> 01:39:38.688]  The world's complex.
[01:39:38.688 --> 01:39:44.110]  I don't blame you for trying to, you know, tune out of reality.
[01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:45.671]  I mean, I understand how that's alluring.
[01:39:46.678 --> 01:39:56.472]  And a lot of you just muddle through life not thinking about the ramifications of what you're involved in, but I have medical doctors and scientists on all the time.
[01:39:56.472 --> 01:40:03.782]  I read to you where you can get the documents, how you can go to the Library of Congress, where you can get them on government websites, how they have created
[01:40:06.443 --> 01:40:08.106]  Hundreds of cancer viruses.
[01:40:08.106 --> 01:40:11.912]  I played Dr. Salk in a CBC outtake they just released last year.
[01:40:11.912 --> 01:40:18.943]  The guy that invented it, who was a eugenicist by the way, the polio vaccine, the evidence shows it was a bioweapon, he invented that as well.
[01:40:18.943 --> 01:40:19.584]  Weaponized it.
[01:40:20.695 --> 01:40:29.360]  Bragging and laughing about how they use monkeys from bioweapons tests to create the vaccines and how hundreds of millions of Americans got cancer from it.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:38.945]  Now, we already knew that and told you that 10 years ago on this show, but to have that son of a bitch sitting there laughing in his white lab coat, IT ISN'T FUNNY!
[01:40:38.945 --> 01:40:42.126]  Alright, I said I wasn't gonna get mad.
[01:40:42.126 --> 01:40:45.748]  See, I can't... It freaks me out.
[01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:47.209]  But it freaks me out worse that
[01:40:47.876 --> 01:40:54.738]  A lot of you out there just laugh about me and laugh about the stuff that's going on.
[01:40:54.738 --> 01:41:07.761]  So many people think they're part of the system and part of the elite and so many of you think that it's all funny and you just laugh at everything that people that care enough to warn you are telling you.
[01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:11.462]  People that have the courage to go up against this evil system.
[01:41:11.462 --> 01:41:12.102]  You see, imagine
[01:41:13.123 --> 01:41:30.197]  The establishment people out there, the wannabe establishment folks that think they're part of the system, and who just bootlick it, and lie to themselves, and engage in doublethink, and crimestop in their minds, in this Orwellian world, they think we're crazy.
[01:41:30.197 --> 01:41:33.339]  They think we're nuts.
[01:41:33.339 --> 01:41:42.627]  And there are a lot of disinfo people, and people that are unstable in this movement, but they're like that in life.
[01:41:43.616 --> 01:41:51.741]  Itself, and the alternative, and the dark side of the world is going to attract unstable people.
[01:41:51.741 --> 01:41:56.463]  So the establisher can always point at the disinfo that's put out and say, oh see, you're all full of bull.
[01:41:56.463 --> 01:42:00.786]  No, we're not full of bull here on this show.
[01:42:00.786 --> 01:42:04.848]  I mean, we tell you they created the HIV virus, we give you the documents.
[01:42:04.848 --> 01:42:07.190]  We have the guest on, we tell you where to get them.
[01:42:07.190 --> 01:42:07.770]  From the government.
[01:42:09.326 --> 01:42:10.166]  We tell you the U.S.
[01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:15.329]  government funded Israel to irradiate 110,000 of their children, killing more than half of them.
[01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:21.431]  I mean, we're talking killing more than 50,000 children.
[01:42:21.431 --> 01:42:30.475]  And that's even on Israeli television, and Haratz in the Jerusalem Post, and you still laugh and deny it's going on.
[01:42:30.475 --> 01:42:37.838]  And the atomic testing on children, and GIs, and their wives, and the spraying of bases, and the military, and cities, and
[01:42:39.073 --> 01:42:43.115]  A bunch of power mad, mad scientists.
[01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:47.317]  Now there's a reason that's an archetype in literature, because that's real.
[01:42:47.317 --> 01:42:57.862]  Just having their way with us, getting away with all of this darkness.
[01:42:57.862 --> 01:43:08.508]  And I know it's hard to believe, as I've said, I mean, that some family man would dress up like a clown with a big red face,
[01:43:09.719 --> 01:43:21.789]  And go out and pick up teenagers, and take them back, and torture them, and rape them, and then kill them, and then... The wife would smell the stench and didn't know what it was, and then... When the police finally pulled up the boards of the floor, she couldn't believe it.
[01:43:21.789 --> 01:43:22.870]  I don't know, what was it?
[01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:24.051]  15, 20 kids in there?
[01:43:24.051 --> 01:43:24.592]  I forget.
[01:43:24.592 --> 01:43:25.693]  We can look it up.
[01:43:25.693 --> 01:43:27.434]  John Wayne Gacy.
[01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:37.443]  Or Ted Bundy, or... The Hillside Strangler, Son of Sam... The Zodiac Never Caught... Probably a cop.
[01:43:41.630 --> 01:43:47.992]  Man, that guy up in Missouri who was the government official killing all those women, and he said he did it because he was bored.
[01:43:47.992 --> 01:43:50.053]  It was fun.
[01:43:50.053 --> 01:43:53.134]  It brought excitement to life.
[01:43:53.134 --> 01:44:02.957]  Whereas I want to pull over and go into a Mexican food restaurant and drink big goblets of beer and eat enchiladas, but I don't because it's unhealthy.
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.643]  You know, normal people have those type of desires.
[01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:14.589]  No, no, they don't want to pull over and eat enchiladas and drink beer.
[01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:21.717]  They want to pull over and pick a hitchhiker off the road and take them back to a cabin somewhere and torture them for two weeks.
[01:44:22.677 --> 01:44:27.460]  I mean, you think about the cases they've caught with these pedophile rings in Europe and the U.S.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.962]  where they'll find whole basements full of dead toddlers.
[01:44:29.962 --> 01:44:39.768]  And after they're done selling the toddlers out to the European Union chiefs, that came out in the news, they just lock the door and the three-year-olds all starve to death in the dark.
[01:44:39.768 --> 01:44:47.934]  Can you imagine closing three-year-olds up and letting them starve to death?
[01:44:47.934 --> 01:44:49.595]  But see, to them, that's fine.
[01:44:50.478 --> 01:45:01.380]  To hear them, and in fact it was reported in some of these cases, they would just sit there for hours listening to the begging and crying, loving it, whereas that would tear my guts out and tear my very soul out.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:02.620]  They love it.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.201]  They feed on it.
[01:45:05.201 --> 01:45:12.082]  And you can't tell me that doesn't exist, but see, I tell you that that exists in the power elite, and that's too scary.
[01:45:12.082 --> 01:45:14.583]  And so you say, no, it's not true.
[01:45:14.583 --> 01:45:15.643]  Well, it is true.
[01:45:15.643 --> 01:45:19.704]  And you look at history, it's been proven over and over and over again.
[01:45:22.538 --> 01:45:26.963]  And every night when I go to sleep, I think, oh my gosh, I have picked a fight with these people.
[01:45:26.963 --> 01:45:31.829]  I go, I have gone head up against them.
[01:45:31.829 --> 01:45:33.631]  And we've woken a lot of people up.
[01:45:33.631 --> 01:45:41.720]  Thanks to the courage of the listeners of this show and all the tireless, wonderful work you've done and the brave, valiant, knightly,
[01:45:44.568 --> 01:46:07.886]  Commitments that so many of you have made to fighting tyranny, and to get a chance to meet you, and know you, and know what great people you are, and to know that I don't even live up to the lofty view you have of me, and to realize that we have millions of listeners, and the responsibility of that, realizing that every day millions of people tune in, and to realize there's a giant throng, a sea of people out there listening right now, and
[01:46:10.473 --> 01:46:12.914]  I don't know what to say or what to do.
[01:46:12.914 --> 01:46:14.856]  I don't have all the answers, all the solutions.
[01:46:14.856 --> 01:46:17.597]  We are in a world of hurt, folks.
[01:46:17.597 --> 01:46:20.899]  It's bad!
[01:46:20.899 --> 01:46:31.285]  Our government would radiate 110,000 children in Israel, tens of thousands in the U.S., 4,301 tests to death.
[01:46:31.285 --> 01:46:34.587]  They would march our troops into chambers and nerve gas them, murder them.
[01:46:34.587 --> 01:46:37.609]  Our own government!
[01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:39.970]  And then there's people who are in denial about it, or
[01:46:40.742 --> 01:46:54.896]  Well, most of the people attacking me say on YouTube, as a case point example, and I don't spend much time on it, I only look at it a few minutes, about five minutes this morning, to try to monitor enemy activity, and a lot of them are so boastful they admit they're in PsyOps.
[01:46:54.896 --> 01:46:57.439]  I mean, this is the quality of the agents they have?
[01:46:58.201 --> 01:47:08.889]  Giggling, burbling people that chant and brag about killing Iraqis and that go on my message boards on the YouTube and the dig and say, yes, we're going to kill you.
[01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:10.690]  Yes, we're going to take you to camps.
[01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:19.897]  And then you get their handle name and you go to their MySpace or their Flickr page and they are in the military and they do have PSYOP patches and
[01:47:21.952 --> 01:47:23.533]  They're so unprofessional.
[01:47:23.533 --> 01:47:30.918]  I mean, even if they're going to be evil, it's the unprofessionalism adds another layer of just horrifyingness to it.
[01:47:30.918 --> 01:47:37.402]  Because you can tell they're just young dumb kids and they have no idea the type of deep black water they're swimming in.
[01:47:37.402 --> 01:47:39.884]  They think they're immune from what they've joined.
[01:47:39.884 --> 01:47:46.088]  They think they are immune from the system that they've gotten involved with.
[01:47:46.088 --> 01:47:49.931]  And they think everybody else's sorrow and pain and horror is cute and funny.
[01:47:51.323 --> 01:47:56.426]  And they laugh on these things about dead kids and dead puppies when we post the videos.
[01:47:56.426 --> 01:47:59.569]  And they talk about how they're going to put us in camps.
[01:47:59.569 --> 01:48:02.450]  And they talk about how they're going to kill us.
[01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:06.033]  I know the listeners of this show go, many of you have seen it.
[01:48:06.033 --> 01:48:07.414]  And you find out it's not a joke.
[01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:10.576]  I mean, so many times I think, this is some patriot posing.
[01:48:11.605 --> 01:48:16.587]  Uh, as a New World Order person to make them look bad, some weird reverse propaganda, and it's not!
[01:48:16.587 --> 01:48:29.812]  You go and they're in CENTCOM, they're in Black Ops, they're in Special Operations, they're in the Marines, they're in Iraq with other videos next to them, really believing this!
[01:48:29.812 --> 01:48:38.176]  In fact, John, I sent you a video, do you have the one that's a clip of me screaming death, death, death, death to America?
[01:48:38.176 --> 01:48:38.816]  Okay, now now,
[01:48:39.617 --> 01:48:43.721]  I had it printed out, but I can't find it here in my stack.
[01:48:43.721 --> 01:48:47.004]  I forget the title of the video, but it's one of the new ones in the last two days.
[01:48:47.004 --> 01:48:51.269]  I saw it this morning, and I couldn't spend all day on this.
[01:48:51.269 --> 01:49:00.258]  So I'm asking listeners to... I'm asking listeners to go and find it, because it was about six, eight months ago I did...
[01:49:01.613 --> 01:49:15.481]  I was doing a rant about soldiers killing children in Iraq, shooting them for fun, and the video of them shooting families, and I said, this is their attitude, this is their chant, as they kill America, death, death, death, death, death to America.
[01:49:15.481 --> 01:49:23.646]  And it's clear that I'm saying, this is the New World Order people killing America, and killing the soul of America, and in five minutes I didn't have time to find the clip.
[01:49:23.646 --> 01:49:25.347]  I know you, the listeners, can find it.
[01:49:25.347 --> 01:49:26.228]  I want you to take it,
[01:49:27.088 --> 01:49:46.175]  And then edit what I really said into what this guy said, because when you look at the propaganda he puts out, and I'm seeing this everywhere, and the sick part is, some people are actually taking the bait with these edits that people are doing of me.
[01:49:46.175 --> 01:49:50.016]  I mean, they'll do edits where it sounds like I'm attacking Jews, and they'll do edits where it sounds like
[01:49:50.715 --> 01:50:05.722]  I'm saying I work for the Vatican or they'll do edits where it's I'm saying I use drugs or they'll do edits all sorts of things and and again it isn't about me being attacked it's that I don't even hate this person I just feel sorry for them.
[01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:06.663]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[01:50:09.728 --> 01:50:10.048]  Alright.
[01:50:10.048 --> 01:50:10.169]  Now!
[01:50:34.159 --> 01:50:39.323]  And in there he has text of saying, see, Alex Jones says he hates America, wants to kill America.
[01:50:39.323 --> 01:50:41.024]  I mean, imagine!
[01:50:41.024 --> 01:50:51.832]  Not just that it's a lie, but that these guys are so delusional, they don't even understand that people are going to take that and show how that's a lie and further discredit them.
[01:50:51.832 --> 01:50:52.772]  I mean, that's what's scary.
[01:50:52.772 --> 01:50:56.015]  They're not even good.
[01:50:56.015 --> 01:51:02.079]  They're just ham-fisted psyops admitting they're psyops.
[01:51:02.079 --> 01:51:03.380]  It is a big idea.
[01:51:04.531 --> 01:51:06.292]  A New World Order.
[01:51:06.292 --> 01:51:11.394]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:51:11.394 --> 01:51:14.015]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:14.015 --> 01:51:16.816]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:51:16.816 --> 01:51:19.998]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:19.998 --> 01:51:27.301]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:30.347 --> 01:51:35.791]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:35.791 --> 01:51:39.653]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:39.653 --> 01:51:42.215]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:51:42.215 --> 01:51:43.376]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:43.376 --> 01:51:44.176]  They're not after money.
[01:51:44.176 --> 01:51:45.457]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:45.457 --> 01:51:46.438]  They're after power.
[01:51:46.438 --> 01:51:47.579]  That's what they're after.

[01:53:52.579 --> 01:53:53.059]  Call today.
[01:54:10.247 --> 01:54:19.799]  These guys that serve evil, they say, well, we're Americans, so we're just gonna kill everybody.
[01:54:31.617 --> 01:54:37.263]  And then they post on their websites pictures of Ronald Reagan?
[01:54:37.263 --> 01:54:45.511]  You can debate whether Ronald Reagan was good or bad, but the point is, everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by George Bush.
[01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:46.993]  But I won't even have that debate with you.
[01:54:46.993 --> 01:54:49.755]  George Bush is a puppet.
[01:54:49.755 --> 01:54:52.939]  I refuse to live in this false reality with you.
[01:54:52.939 --> 01:54:54.160]  The country is dying!
[01:54:54.784 --> 01:54:56.684]  We've been de-industrialized.
[01:54:56.684 --> 01:54:59.925]  We've been strip-mined politically, economically, and spiritually.
[01:54:59.925 --> 01:55:03.746]  All we had left was our fiat dollar.
[01:55:03.746 --> 01:55:08.006]  And it's hundreds of billions of dollar deficits per month with China alone.
[01:55:08.006 --> 01:55:15.368]  Now all those dollars are coming back, buying up our entire country.
[01:55:15.368 --> 01:55:18.428]  And I burn with passion for this nation.
[01:55:18.428 --> 01:55:19.228]  Warts and all.
[01:55:19.228 --> 01:55:20.848]  I know we're not perfect.
[01:55:20.848 --> 01:55:24.049]  I burn with passion for this nation.
[01:55:25.757 --> 01:55:39.708]  And I am so upset, I am so saddened by how far we've fallen, by what we've turned into, and then to know that every word I say, everything I do, it's all over the web, it has to be concerted.
[01:55:39.708 --> 01:55:47.835]  Now I'm not saying they're all government agents, but most of them admit they're in the military, and a lot of them say they're in PSYOPs, and that they're countering us.
[01:55:47.835 --> 01:55:51.558]  And then other copycats and weak-minded people pick up on it,
[01:55:52.524 --> 01:56:03.652]  And, uh, go out and start doing it, and it's just... I'm amazed that they are serving evil and that they really think we're the bad guys.
[01:56:03.652 --> 01:56:05.213]  And I guess that's the thing about evil people.
[01:56:05.213 --> 01:56:06.894]  A lot of them are delusional.
[01:56:06.894 --> 01:56:14.039]  I guess reading about psychopaths that would pick up women and torture them and kill them, you know, and once they'd get caught, they'd say, that ugly bitch, she was looking at me wrong.
[01:56:14.039 --> 01:56:15.280]  She deserved to die.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.881]  She was bad.
[01:56:16.881 --> 01:56:18.122]  She was dressed dirty.
[01:56:19.091 --> 01:56:24.314]  You know, I guess even evil people rationalize what they're doing.
[01:56:24.314 --> 01:56:27.496]  It's like, those Iraqis deserve to die.
[01:56:27.496 --> 01:56:29.337]  It's, you know, we need to kill more of them.
[01:56:29.337 --> 01:56:31.979]  We need to nuke the whole place.
[01:56:31.979 --> 01:56:37.102]  But then I have to hear the news, the troops are there to love the Iraqis and give them freedom and democracy.
[01:56:37.102 --> 01:56:39.363]  Meanwhile, you go read what the troops that like it are saying.
[01:56:39.363 --> 01:56:47.828]  It's, let's murder all of them and just kill them and slaughter everything and oh my god, I love it.
[01:56:47.828 --> 01:56:48.389]  It's so
[01:56:49.522 --> 01:56:50.943]  Dark!
[01:56:50.943 --> 01:56:53.244]  And they think it's not going to blow back on them.
[01:56:53.244 --> 01:57:01.989]  You think you've got a global elite that has created monsters like you, and that you are pet puppies and that you're going to be taken care of?
[01:57:01.989 --> 01:57:11.615]  And then I get amazed that I'm the radical, I'm the wild man, oh, I had Alex Jones, he's so extreme!
[01:57:11.615 --> 01:57:18.119]  My goodness, you know, he will read about plans to shut down the internet, declaratives
[01:57:19.762 --> 01:57:25.165]  Declarations of war against free speech everywhere!
[01:57:25.165 --> 01:57:27.927]  And then, I'm not supposed to be concerned about it.
[01:57:27.927 --> 01:57:29.468]  I said I would get Dr. Nick Megachon.
[01:57:29.468 --> 01:57:31.449]  Let's call him and get him on about 15 after.
[01:57:31.449 --> 01:57:32.990]  He's always flexible.
[01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:36.592]  Because I want to come back and get into the attack on the internet.
[01:57:36.592 --> 01:57:37.633]  It is very, very important.
[01:57:37.633 --> 01:57:39.474]  I'm late getting into that.
[01:57:39.474 --> 01:57:47.439]  I know we have, uh, Jefferson, Adam, Issa, Mason, Rusty, and others, and I'll get to you.
[01:57:48.129 --> 01:57:53.610]  I did good taking calls in the first hour and a little bit in the second, but all these important issues come up.
[01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:58.511]  But the only way to counter a lie is to deal with that lie and expose that lie.
[01:57:58.511 --> 01:58:06.253]  But the problem is, when there just becomes a background shatter of noise, there's no point in even countering it.
[01:58:06.253 --> 01:58:08.693]  You just have to judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:58:08.693 --> 01:58:10.013]  You will know them by their fruits.
[01:58:10.013 --> 01:58:12.714]  Our fruits are good and decent and honorable.
[01:58:12.714 --> 01:58:13.374]  Are we perfect?
[01:58:13.374 --> 01:58:13.514]  No.
[01:58:15.053 --> 01:58:26.156]  Let's fade that music down for a moment, and let's leave them with this hour with me edited to sound like, with disinfo by the military, to sound like I hate America.
[01:58:26.156 --> 01:58:29.077]  Here's the line.
[01:58:29.077 --> 01:58:30.577]  Death to America!
[01:58:30.577 --> 01:58:31.817]  Death to freedom!
[01:58:31.817 --> 01:58:33.378]  Death to America!
[01:58:33.378 --> 01:58:34.858]  Yes, yes, yes!
[01:58:34.858 --> 01:58:37.239]  Death to America!
[01:58:37.239 --> 01:58:42.260]  Then it says, see, Alex Jones hates and wants to kill America.
[01:58:43.692 --> 01:58:46.214]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:48.636 --> 01:58:53.740]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:56.181]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:58:56.181 --> 01:58:58.463]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:58:58.463 --> 01:59:00.024]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:59:00.024 --> 01:59:01.626]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:59:01.626 --> 01:59:04.628]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:59:04.628 --> 01:59:08.711]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:59:17.903 --> 01:59:24.045]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:59:24.045 --> 01:59:26.565]  An inside job?
[01:59:26.565 --> 01:59:30.667]  How dare you?
[01:59:30.667 --> 01:59:34.227]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:34.227 --> 01:59:36.968]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:36.968 --> 01:59:39.769]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years...
[01:59:42.444 --> 01:59:43.425]  Truth Rising.

[01:59:54.256 --> 01:59:56.658]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.658 --> 01:59:59.421]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.879 --> 02:00:07.200]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:08.960]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.721]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.721 --> 02:00:12.301]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.301 --> 02:00:13.242]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.242 --> 02:00:18.043]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.043 --> 02:00:22.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.785 --> 02:00:34.312]  There is an excellent story out of Reality Check posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:34.312 --> 02:00:36.193]  Death of the free internet is imminent.
[02:00:36.193 --> 02:00:38.815]  Canada will be the test case.
[02:00:38.815 --> 02:00:54.268]  I'm going to cover part of this article in one moment, but first let me, in most basic of terms, give you the declared, publicly stated plan by a consortium of universities, corporations, and governments.
[02:00:56.792 --> 02:01:00.795]  This is very, very important.
[02:01:00.795 --> 02:01:04.777]  Six years ago, I learned of an organization called InternetTube.
[02:01:04.777 --> 02:01:09.440]  They've met in London, Austin, Texas, Tokyo, Chicago.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:16.705]  This consortium puts out a declaration each year, the Internet is dead, and we killed it.
[02:01:16.705 --> 02:01:23.850]  They report that they have built, and were building over the last ten years, but I learned of it six years ago, seven years ago.
[02:01:23.850 --> 02:01:26.612]  I guess it was about in 2001, so I guess it's almost seven years.
[02:01:27.486 --> 02:01:32.949]  That they are building a new high-speed internet grid.
[02:01:32.949 --> 02:01:36.951]  The phone companies and the government and the universities are working together to do it.
[02:01:36.951 --> 02:01:51.237]  And that they are going to force the old internet traffic over onto that system and not upgrade the original switching hubs and systems within what we knew as the organic internet.
[02:01:51.237 --> 02:01:52.258]  Now when Cogent and Level 3
[02:01:54.082 --> 02:01:58.305]  Just a couple years ago, we're in a fight for a week and a half, about a third of the internet was down.
[02:01:58.305 --> 02:01:58.986]  Remember that?
[02:01:58.986 --> 02:02:02.749]  That was just two backbone providers who were smaller, by the way.
[02:02:02.749 --> 02:02:11.035]  There's scores of them not letting traffic go over each other's systems because they were in a fight with each other and it crippled the internet.
[02:02:11.035 --> 02:02:20.182]  Well, if they would have just passed a law ending net neutrality a year ago, you would have seen the internet descend into that overnight.
[02:02:21.055 --> 02:02:26.704]  So there's a lot of different facets that Internet2 is using, but they don't want to do that until Internet2 is fully in place.
[02:02:26.704 --> 02:02:32.013]  Now they have built Internet2, and they're going to say, well, you come over here and get on this Internet, but you've got to...
[02:02:32.725 --> 02:02:33.345]  Be tracked.
[02:02:33.345 --> 02:02:34.746]  Your ISP's got to be tracked.
[02:02:34.746 --> 02:02:36.007]  You're going to be taxed.
[02:02:36.007 --> 02:02:37.848]  You've got to pay to be on this Internet.
[02:02:37.848 --> 02:02:43.272]  There's only going to be a few thousand websites and choices on this Internet.
[02:02:43.272 --> 02:02:53.539]  Some people will be allowed to have sub-sites on those, like MySpace, but you'll sign a contract where they can restrict you or control you or automatically block certain keywords or videos.
[02:02:53.539 --> 02:02:56.040]  This is all being announced.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:00.563]  And so the Internet as you know it is being ended, is being dismantled.
[02:03:00.563 --> 02:03:01.524]  Then, Time Warner
[02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:24.229]  And Comcast in Texas and New York and other places, as well as England, two big internet providers have announced they will control and give preferential treatment to go to certain classes of websites, big corporate sites, but slow down or block altogether other individual sites that aren't on these master lists.
[02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:27.172]  So it's a filter they make you go through.
[02:03:28.718 --> 02:03:34.281]  Say you're on Time Warner Cable in Austin, you'll notice if you type in a wrong URL, it's on a computer error on your screen now.
[02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:36.242]  You're on the Time Warner screen.
[02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:39.244]  They're now directing everything through their system.
[02:03:39.244 --> 02:03:45.047]  Do you understand?
[02:03:45.047 --> 02:03:46.448]  Just amazing.
[02:03:46.448 --> 02:03:51.390]  And so they've got a multi-faceted attack that they are carrying out.
[02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:56.413]  They're forcing everybody over to Internet 2 where they can regulate, control, tax, trace, everything you're doing.
[02:03:58.081 --> 02:03:59.783]  Make you pay to get on.
[02:03:59.783 --> 02:04:10.216]  While they don't repair the old hubs, while the companies start ending agreements with each other saying, well, we're allowed to let Internet 1 die, and then forcing you over to Internet 2.
[02:04:11.457 --> 02:04:14.199]  But that isn't killing things fast enough for them.
[02:04:14.199 --> 02:04:29.127]  France, England, Canada, China, and scores of other nations are building firewalls with tens of thousands of names, websites, and systems from InfoWars.com to the BBC that are being blocked out.
[02:04:29.127 --> 02:04:30.628]  There's other censorship.
[02:04:30.628 --> 02:04:36.851]  Companies, universities, schools, libraries, city free Wi-Fi systems that aren't free.
[02:04:36.851 --> 02:04:37.812]  You pay for it with tax money.
[02:04:38.579 --> 02:04:41.700]  They're now getting master list and blocking things.
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.483]  So see, it's a whole witch's brew of systems to bring it down.
[02:04:46.483 --> 02:04:49.264]  But now there's been new developments.
[02:04:49.264 --> 02:04:52.625]  We will cover these huge developments on the other side of this break.
[02:04:52.625 --> 02:04:56.027]  This is how they are killing the internet right now.
[02:04:56.027 --> 02:04:57.147]  It's happening now.
[02:04:57.147 --> 02:04:58.688]  You're not going to have to wait to see it happen.
[02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:04.651]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:06.212]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:05:06.212 --> 02:05:08.353]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:05:08.353 --> 02:05:10.253]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:05:10.253 --> 02:05:11.754]  The late, great USA.
[02:05:11.754 --> 02:05:13.514]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:06:10.998 --> 02:06:12.519]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:07:01.403 --> 02:07:12.149]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:21.574]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter Water Ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:07:21.974 --> 02:07:23.256]  Drinking water?
[02:07:23.256 --> 02:07:24.918]  Now that's something I can handle.
[02:07:24.918 --> 02:07:30.604]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.

[02:08:12.579 --> 02:08:13.459]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.459 --> 02:08:18.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.322 --> 02:08:23.325]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.325 --> 02:08:25.606]  We got Dr. Nick Beggins joining us in about five minutes.
[02:08:25.606 --> 02:08:28.648]  I'm going to bring this up to him and get his take on it as well.
[02:08:30.768 --> 02:08:32.829]  The death of the free internet is imminent.
[02:08:32.829 --> 02:08:35.090]  Canada will be the test ground.
[02:08:35.090 --> 02:08:37.411]  So I've gone over the basics.
[02:08:37.411 --> 02:08:39.612]  They're trying to end net neutrality.
[02:08:39.612 --> 02:08:48.276]  They want to cover that and just label it differently by saying, well, companies have a right to not service and feed these old systems into other companies.
[02:08:48.276 --> 02:08:52.897]  We're just moving on to a more advanced, but more limited and more elite network.
[02:08:52.897 --> 02:08:56.279]  And yes, this is a private slash governmental network.
[02:08:56.279 --> 02:08:58.640]  And so you don't have free speech on this system.
[02:08:59.272 --> 02:09:06.233]  And they also have censorship of speech and prosecution of speech and calls to tax the internet.
[02:09:06.233 --> 02:09:10.694]  And to control how much you can download or how much you can surf.
[02:09:10.694 --> 02:09:24.777]  But now the big, the two big telecoms in Canada, France is also calling for this, have now come out and said, we're going to limit the number of sites you can go to, period.
[02:09:24.777 --> 02:09:25.758]  See, there you go.
[02:09:25.758 --> 02:09:27.878]  Just to end that wild surfing.
[02:09:30.876 --> 02:09:32.978]  Because it's killing the mainstream media.
[02:09:32.978 --> 02:09:34.218]  That's one of the big reasons.
[02:09:34.218 --> 02:09:38.241]  It is discrediting the establishment.
[02:09:38.241 --> 02:09:47.348]  DARPA dubbed it in the 80s the World Wide Web, after they'd fully developed it and launched it, because they wanted to use it as a worldwide wiretap.
[02:09:47.348 --> 02:09:48.389]  And they've done that.
[02:09:48.389 --> 02:09:53.973]  But people aren't intimidated, and aren't scared by all the, we're spying on you, we're watching you, we're tracking you.
[02:09:53.973 --> 02:09:55.374]  People said, so what, tyrants?
[02:09:55.374 --> 02:09:56.414]  Okay, follow me.
[02:09:56.414 --> 02:09:56.835]  Track me.
[02:09:56.835 --> 02:09:57.275]  Go to hell.
[02:09:57.853 --> 02:09:59.233]  That's basically what they've said.
[02:09:59.233 --> 02:10:02.434]  So now they're like, oh yeah, we'll just get rid of it.
[02:10:02.434 --> 02:10:03.795]  Death of the free internet is imminent.
[02:10:03.795 --> 02:10:05.755]  Canada will be the test case.
[02:10:05.755 --> 02:10:13.497]  The last 15 years or so as a society, we have access to more information than ever before in modern history because of the internet.
[02:10:13.497 --> 02:10:22.360]  There are approximately 1 billion internet users in the world, and any one of these users can theoretically communicate in real time with anyone else in the planet.
[02:10:23.795 --> 02:10:28.758]  The internet has been the greatest technological achievement of the 20th century by far.
[02:10:28.758 --> 02:10:31.120]  It's bigger than the A-bomb.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:34.422]  And has been recognized as such by the global community.
[02:10:34.422 --> 02:10:41.567]  The free transfer of information, uncensored, unlimited, and untainted still seems to be a dream when you think about it.
[02:10:42.378 --> 02:10:51.380]  Whatever field that is mentioned, education, commerce, government, news, entertainment, politics, countless other areas, have been radically affected by the introduction of the internet.
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:57.142]  It lowered the playing field, and the elite are losing the ballgame now, so they're going to turn over the checkerboard.
[02:10:57.142 --> 02:10:59.242]  I added that part.
[02:10:59.242 --> 02:11:04.963]  And mostly, it's good news, except with poor judgments are made and people are taken advantage of.
[02:11:04.963 --> 02:11:06.264]  But that happens with freedom, folks.
[02:11:06.264 --> 02:11:07.724]  It's much better than tyranny.
[02:11:07.724 --> 02:11:10.865]  Security and oversight are needed, especially when children are involved.
[02:11:10.865 --> 02:11:11.265]  However,
[02:11:12.136 --> 02:11:16.838]  When there are potential profits open to corporations, the needs of society don't count.
[02:11:16.838 --> 02:11:19.940]  See, they're hijacking the web we paid for and we built.
[02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:22.181]  That's the key here.
[02:11:22.181 --> 02:11:30.025]  Take the recent case in Canada with the behemoths TELUS and Rogers rolling out a charge for text messaging without any warning to the public.
[02:11:30.025 --> 02:11:34.567]  It was an arrogant and risky move of the telecommunications giant because it backfired.
[02:11:34.567 --> 02:11:35.228]  And that's the key.
[02:11:35.228 --> 02:11:37.769]  You've got to leave them when they do this.
[02:11:37.769 --> 02:11:39.530]  Because once they all do it, you can't escape.
[02:11:40.228 --> 02:11:47.530]  Because actually use internet technology to deliver a loud and clear message to these companies and that was to scrap the extra charge.
[02:11:47.530 --> 02:11:51.971]  The people use the power of the internet against the big boys and the little guys won.
[02:11:51.971 --> 02:12:02.893]  However, the issue of text messaging is just the tip and a tiny blip on the radar screens of TELUS and another company, Bell Canada, the two largest internet service providers or ISPs in Canada.
[02:12:02.893 --> 02:12:08.895]  Our country is being used as a test case for dramatically change the delivery of internet service forever.
[02:12:08.895 --> 02:12:09.515]  So is Texas.
[02:12:10.316 --> 02:12:21.340]  The charge will be so radical, and the change will be so radical, that it has the potential to send us back to the horse and buggy days of information sharing and access.
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:33.505]  In the upcoming weeks, not months, watch for a report in Time Magazine that will attempt to smooth over the rough edges of a diabolical plot by Bell Canada and Telus.
[02:12:33.505 --> 02:12:35.326]  Now listen to me carefully folks, this is huge.
[02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:41.906]  They'll begin charging per-site fees on most internet sites.
[02:12:41.906 --> 02:12:46.889]  See, they're going to charge you to go to InfoWars and Prison Planet, but you won't be charged to go to Time Warner.
[02:12:46.889 --> 02:12:48.090]  They admit that.
[02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:51.293]  Thousands of the big boys are going to pay fees to be listed.
[02:12:51.293 --> 02:12:55.976]  And if it isn't on the allowed list on the firewall, then you don't go there.
[02:12:55.976 --> 02:12:57.978]  Well, see, then next it'll be you're not allowed to go there.
[02:12:57.978 --> 02:13:00.400]  Canada's already called to block my website and others.
[02:13:01.610 --> 02:13:10.739]  The plan is to convert the internet into a cable-like system where consumers sign up for specific websites and then pay to visit sites beyond a cut-off point.
[02:13:10.739 --> 02:13:13.202]  Now, they have links to the announcement.
[02:13:13.202 --> 02:13:22.592]  It's happening, ladies and gentlemen, and if they're able to get this over, on the well-meaning, jolly, head-in-the-clouds Canadians,
[02:13:23.826 --> 02:13:32.753]  I mean, Americans are completely ignorant and brainwashed, but Canadians tend to be more informed on international politics, but have no idea how tyrannical their government is.
[02:13:32.753 --> 02:13:36.916]  Because it's velvet-fisted tyranny.
[02:13:36.916 --> 02:13:48.324]  The corporate marauders will iron out the wrinkles in Canada and then spring the new, castrated version of the Internet on the rest of the world, probably with little fanfare except for some dire warnings about the evil of the Internet and
[02:13:49.341 --> 02:13:54.448]  The free internet and the CEO spouting about safety and security, these buzzwords usually work pretty well.
[02:13:54.448 --> 02:14:00.316]  And then they go into, what will the internet look like in 2010?
[02:14:00.316 --> 02:14:02.840]  And I want to get Nick Medish's take on this.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:03.361]  Do we have him?
[02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:08.070]  We now go to Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:13.072]  Dr. Nick Begich serves as Executive Director of the Lay Institute of Technology, Inc., a Texas nonprofit corporation.
[02:14:13.072 --> 02:14:17.514]  He's also the publisher and co-author of Earth Pulse Press, Inc., an Alaskan-based organization.
[02:14:17.514 --> 02:14:24.357]  Dr. Begich is the eldest son of the late United States Congressman from Alaska, Nick Begich Sr., and political activist Peggy Begich.
[02:14:24.357 --> 02:14:27.399]  He is well-known in Alaska for his own political activities.
[02:14:27.399 --> 02:14:30.220]  He has twice been elected President of both the Alaska Federation
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:33.461]  of teachers and the Anchorage Council of Education.
[02:14:33.461 --> 02:14:38.382]  He has been pursuing independent research in the sciences and politics for most of his adult life.
[02:14:38.382 --> 02:14:44.023]  Begich received his doctorate in traditional medicine from the Open International University of Complementary Medicines in 94.
[02:14:44.023 --> 02:14:50.385]  He co-authored with Gene Manning the book Angels Don't Play This Harp, Advances in Tesla Technology.
[02:14:50.385 --> 02:14:52.746]  Begich also authored Pulse 1 and 2,
[02:14:53.806 --> 02:14:56.187]  With the late James Roderick.
[02:14:56.187 --> 02:15:05.731]  He has published articles in science, politics and education, and is a well-known lecturer, having presented throughout the United States and in 19 countries, including to the European Parliament.
[02:15:05.731 --> 02:15:13.334]  He has been featured as a guest on thousands of radio broadcasts, reporting his research activities, including new technologies, health and earth science-related issues.
[02:15:13.334 --> 02:15:20.957]  He has also appeared on dozens of television documentaries and other programs throughout the world, including BBC and CBC TV Telemundo.
[02:15:21.317 --> 02:15:39.331]  And I would add he's one of the leading experts on patents and declassified information on mind control, weather manipulation, bioweapons, chemical weapons, surveillance that is admitted but not known, not generally known, so for all intents and purposes secret, because people are not aware of it.
[02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:47.358]  So I want to talk to him on about a host of issues the next hour and 35-40 minutes that we have him for really honored to be talking to him.
[02:15:48.695 --> 02:16:00.582]  I did find the story today, it's up on InfoWars.com from Reality Check, and did go and confirm that the big ISPs in Canada are going to go ahead and go to Internet 2 in the next few months.
[02:16:00.582 --> 02:16:09.867]  They're going to try it, and I wanted to get, because I know you've been on top of this, to talk about the multi-pronged attack on the Internet that is now happening.
[02:16:10.988 --> 02:16:20.955]  Time Warner's doing this in some towns in Texas and I wanted to get your expert take on that as a technologist on what we're facing A and how you think we should counter it, Dr. Begich.
[02:16:20.955 --> 02:16:23.197]  Well, you know, the internet itself has been
[02:16:24.749 --> 02:16:28.331]  When it first started, everybody was sort of non-commercial.
[02:16:28.331 --> 02:16:36.195]  It was all about geeks and high technology, and eventually it became a big commercial enterprise.
[02:16:36.195 --> 02:16:43.338]  When you really think about it, from a globalist perspective, it's always been about markets and building patterns.
[02:16:44.031 --> 02:16:45.252]  And incomes.
[02:16:45.252 --> 02:16:54.898]  And when you start to look at what they've amassed, the biggest issue with the Internet is personal privacy, which is still not adequately guarded in my view.
[02:16:54.898 --> 02:17:06.565]  You know, when you think about all of the data banks surrounding our lives today, it used to be that the doorway to your home was the threshold to your privacy, and today it's really a digital doorway.
[02:17:06.565 --> 02:17:07.966]  And so when you talk about the Internet,
[02:17:08.701 --> 02:17:19.969]  It's more than just the commercial aspects, and certainly making money on the internet has been, in the way of tracking data, has been one thing.
[02:17:19.969 --> 02:17:21.470]  But the data itself is valuable.
[02:17:21.470 --> 02:17:33.858]  When you can look at a person's profile, when you start to look at millions and millions of people's activity and their political persuasions, sort of their background, you can really refine.
[02:17:33.858 --> 02:17:35.940]  Profiling becomes an art form.
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:37.321]  We're good to go.
[02:17:57.912 --> 02:18:07.655]  And it's tying the entire world population into an NSA snooping grid so they can build detailed psychological algorithms and truly know your heart of hearts.
[02:18:07.655 --> 02:18:09.595]  It's much worse than physically surveilling you.
[02:18:09.595 --> 02:18:20.238]  It surveils your most innermost secrets and it's also done in the comfort of your own home with our evolutionary development for feeling like we have privacy in our cave.
[02:18:20.238 --> 02:18:24.979]  Truly scanning, and I'm not getting into an evolution debate, I mean our development as humans.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.001]  Just absolutely amazing.
[02:18:28.001 --> 02:18:29.282]  But first, we're about to break.
[02:18:29.282 --> 02:18:34.105]  I want to get your take on their attempts to come in and regulate it and shut it down now.
[02:18:34.105 --> 02:18:37.407]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:37.407 --> 02:18:42.091]  You know, when you look at the military side of it, it's already been moved aside.
[02:18:42.091 --> 02:18:49.976]  You know, they have their own sort of search networks kind of excluded from what most people deal with.
[02:18:49.976 --> 02:18:55.360]  The research sites are getting pressed down as well, where there's less and less access
[02:18:56.564 --> 02:19:05.270]  And that whole constraining of data is really working against modern democracy in this century.
[02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:09.613]  Okay, Doc, I want to skip the break for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and people listening on the internet.
[02:19:09.613 --> 02:19:13.396]  For everybody else who's listening on another stream, you'll miss the next four minutes.
[02:19:13.396 --> 02:19:16.418]  If not, go to mfallwars.com and click on the Listen Live button.
[02:19:16.418 --> 02:19:17.779]  You'll be able to hear us talk.
[02:19:17.779 --> 02:19:21.121]  I'm going to skip some of these breaks so that we don't waste time with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:19:21.121 --> 02:19:23.423]  We'll continue discussing everything with him right now.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.224]  Okay, Doc, we're going to come back in four minutes to the full audience, but let's not waste time.
[02:19:31.224 --> 02:19:35.927]  Keep going with how you're chronicling what's happening to the web.
[02:19:35.927 --> 02:19:55.201]  Well, when you start to look at all of it together, and this is what we've tried to say in all of our writing and all of our work the last 15 years, is when you start to look at any one of these little snapshots within the sort of public bubble of information, and the way the military and planners, NSA, Homeland Insecurity, whoever it is,
[02:19:56.099 --> 02:19:57.000]  Look at this.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:57.920]  It's incremental.
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:19:59.301]  It's like one slice at a time.
[02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:03.584]  Something hits the news, stays in the news for about 30 seconds, and it's gone.
[02:20:03.584 --> 02:20:17.712]  And when you start to connect it, when you start to look at the aspects of the Internet that truly created an environment where people could communicate at an unprecedented level, exchange ideas without the filtering of a controlled media.
[02:20:17.712 --> 02:20:22.155]  And that is a dangerous thing from a globalist perspective, ultimately.
[02:20:22.155 --> 02:20:23.276]  When you start to look at
[02:20:24.099 --> 02:20:25.640]  Then what was being gained by it?
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:27.200]  I mean, think about Google recently.
[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:36.024]  I mean, the Chinese get to pick their brains to find out who to go beat up in the street or whatever thug approach to government they want to operate over there.
[02:20:36.024 --> 02:20:38.705]  The cooperation of telecommunications companies.
[02:20:39.204 --> 02:20:51.408]  First, surveillance of American populations, then retroactively, you know, sort of saying, oh, we're sorry, but no one's going to prosecute you, even though you violate the civil liberties of everyone in the country.
[02:20:51.408 --> 02:21:04.032]  When you look at the shutdown of the Freedom of Information Act under this administration, at a level that has been the slowest amount of information coming forward to the public that deserves to be public, much of it 40, 50 years old, for goodness sake.
[02:21:05.154 --> 02:21:06.715]  And, you know, that's been constrained.
[02:21:06.715 --> 02:21:09.717]  Declassifying of information at an unprecedented level.
[02:21:09.717 --> 02:21:14.681]  You know, you made me think there, before I forget, let me ask you about this to elaborate there.
[02:21:14.681 --> 02:21:19.784]  People always ask me, well, why did they declassify things 50, 60 years ago that was incriminating, or 20 years ago?
[02:21:19.784 --> 02:21:22.206]  Well, back then we were more of a free society.
[02:21:22.206 --> 02:21:26.709]  We hadn't been fully taken over under the National Security Act of 47.
[02:21:26.709 --> 02:21:31.011]  There was a process of usurpation going on.
[02:21:32.112 --> 02:21:38.556]  But now they do have to ban basically declassifying anything, because now it can actually be used.
[02:21:38.556 --> 02:21:49.582]  Twenty, thirty years ago, the corporate press was so narrowly controlled and regulated, and had so many spooks in it, that so what if you got a declassified document that Gulf of Tonkin was staged?
[02:21:49.582 --> 02:21:59.387]  You might labor and get a self-published book made that maybe a thousand people will read, but then... So now, this knowledge can damage them.
[02:22:00.279 --> 02:22:08.474]  Oh yeah, because people like you, people like me, a lot of others all over the country, and a lot of individual committees are one listening to this broadcast.
[02:22:08.474 --> 02:22:10.698]  Pick up information and pass it on.
[02:22:12.003 --> 02:22:15.564]  You know, the true democracy in the 21st century is about information.
[02:22:15.564 --> 02:22:19.966]  It's about being able to make sure that the integrity of information is good, number one.
[02:22:19.966 --> 02:22:26.248]  Because if we digitize everything, we put it all on the net, you know, history kind of becomes flexible.
[02:22:26.248 --> 02:22:27.428]  I like paper.
[02:22:27.428 --> 02:22:34.510]  You know, I'm a paper fiend when it comes to saving data, because in the early days of the Internet, it was very unreliable.
[02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:38.852]  You know, you'd have to go pull the documents and stuff was quoted out of context and so on.
[02:22:39.532 --> 02:22:41.493]  And you'd really have to look the paper up.
[02:22:41.493 --> 02:22:48.897]  When we published our first book, the book Angels Don't Play This Harp, it was about library work more than the internet.
[02:22:48.897 --> 02:22:56.081]  You know, our last book... Oh, and I mean, my first films, back when I was first doing radio in 95-96, well, TV 95, radio 96, I remember going to the library every week!
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:00.481]  Right.
[02:23:00.481 --> 02:23:01.982]  That's where we got our good information.
[02:23:01.982 --> 02:23:04.764]  The Internet might have gave us a lead or a tip, but you couldn't trust it.
[02:23:04.764 --> 02:23:12.751]  Well, then it changed and became more mainstream and more trustworthy, but at the same time recognized data goes up, data goes down.
[02:23:12.751 --> 02:23:14.873]  A lot of things all of a sudden are gone.
[02:23:14.873 --> 02:23:17.415]  Things you were referencing to people, they're gone.
[02:23:17.415 --> 02:23:19.937]  And this is why we've always printed out the paper.
[02:23:19.937 --> 02:23:26.322]  And when you do that and you retain it, and then you start to string it together in a reasonable, coherent form... Stay there.
[02:23:26.322 --> 02:23:27.944]  We're going to come back to the full audience right now.
[02:23:27.944 --> 02:23:28.304]  Continue.
[02:23:29.650 --> 02:23:35.473]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:41.556]  Dr. Bagich is giving us a general lecture on some of the history of the Internet.
[02:23:41.556 --> 02:23:44.537]  How it gave rise to a huge researching community.
[02:23:44.537 --> 02:23:54.362]  How now the government doesn't want to declassify anything because that information can now be shared and actually damage them whether they could declassify 20 years ago evidence about staging Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:23:55.473 --> 02:23:57.194]  Nobody could share it.
[02:23:57.194 --> 02:24:01.856]  You had a few little research communities that knew about it, and they could never get on television or the radio.
[02:24:01.856 --> 02:24:05.258]  Now that's all been shattered, they have to shut down the web.
[02:24:05.258 --> 02:24:07.339]  Dr. Begich, I don't see any choice.
[02:24:07.339 --> 02:24:09.700]  They've tried to put out a bunch of background chatter.
[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:14.082]  The Pentagon's admitted for the last five years they're engaging in propaganda in the U.S.
[02:24:14.082 --> 02:24:18.544]  and worldwide, quote, countering disinfo on the web.
[02:24:18.544 --> 02:24:22.506]  Now Wikipedia engages in all sorts of lies and disinfo.
[02:24:23.626 --> 02:24:25.808]  Uh, and is now very disreputable.
[02:24:25.808 --> 02:24:29.231]  I mean, a few years ago they were a little bit better, but still questionable.
[02:24:29.231 --> 02:24:42.962]  Uh, so we're just seeing a lot of dirty tricks, but now they're saying, look, we're just going to not let you have free access to the web, and we're going to block out millions of websites and only let you go to a few thousand corporate sites, which sounds like a lot of choices, but really isn't.
[02:24:42.962 --> 02:24:43.802]  Uh, Dr. Bagich?
[02:24:43.802 --> 02:24:46.865]  This is, this is exactly, uh, the wrong direction.
[02:24:46.865 --> 02:24:52.089]  And, you know, when you look at telecommunications law and sort of how it's evolved, it's really, you know, once again,
[02:24:52.964 --> 02:24:55.085]  You can't look at any of these things in a vacuum.
[02:24:55.085 --> 02:24:57.906]  And I know you and your audience don't do that.
[02:24:57.906 --> 02:25:06.469]  You look at the whole picture and you start to see a very finely woven carpet that works against the average person, works against individual sovereignty.
[02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:10.510]  And the Internet represents individual sovereignty in the 21st century.
[02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:19.453]  Our technologies of this century have the potential to enslave us or absolutely free us to some incredible possibilities.
[02:25:19.873 --> 02:25:23.494]  The kind of possibilities that I think were envisioned a couple hundred years ago.
[02:25:23.494 --> 02:25:26.075]  I'm glad you always make that point.
[02:25:26.075 --> 02:25:30.036]  I'm glad you always make that point under baggage because it isn't just that we don't want tyranny.
[02:25:30.036 --> 02:25:35.858]  No, we want all the incredible unimaginable dividends of true liberty.
[02:25:35.858 --> 02:25:37.078]  Go back to your founding father comment.
[02:25:37.557 --> 02:25:47.790]  Well, you know, and when you look back on that, you know, it was about being creative, being an individual, being able to take to your highest potentials with a government that didn't interfere with that.
[02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:49.232]  In fact, supported that.
[02:25:49.232 --> 02:25:50.614]  Supported that possibility.
[02:25:50.614 --> 02:25:53.297]  And the government we've got today works against us.
[02:25:53.297 --> 02:25:55.781]  It comes at us in a way that never before.
[02:25:56.541 --> 02:26:05.943]  In the history of this country, have we lived through a period such as this, where people are really asleep at the switch in a lot of ways, mostly because we're all fatigued.
[02:26:05.943 --> 02:26:09.744]  You know, everybody's working a couple of jobs, trying to stay ahead.
[02:26:09.744 --> 02:26:16.026]  And the reality is, that is the first step in what has reshaped so much of what's around us.
[02:26:16.026 --> 02:26:20.847]  And when you look at the technologies that are available to us, the internet, where we're starting this conversation today,
[02:26:21.531 --> 02:26:22.953]  You know, what have we gotten from that?
[02:26:22.953 --> 02:26:29.560]  Well, a community that actually can communicate in the scientific world, not through the controls of that world.
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:31.121]  You know, science is controlled as well.
[02:26:31.121 --> 02:26:40.671]  A lot of people don't realize it, but it's the academic institutions that become the switching center for what gets validated and what gets set on the shelf until 50 years later.
[02:26:40.671 --> 02:26:44.095]  Everybody dies with their dissortations and so new ideas can come.
[02:26:44.295 --> 02:26:52.781]  And that's predominantly done with funding, and 90 plus percent of research funding is funded by the federal government and DARPA.
[02:26:52.781 --> 02:26:53.421]  Right.
[02:26:53.421 --> 02:27:04.529]  And the military, you know, then what happens is they fund all these projects, and then if someone gets a little bit too out there in terms of talking to the public, they sideline them and deny they ever participated.
[02:27:04.529 --> 02:27:10.533]  You know, it's what happened with Ben Eastwood, with his work on the HAARP project initially.
[02:27:10.533 --> 02:27:12.855]  You know, they disavow him after the fact.
[02:27:13.482 --> 02:27:16.464]  And he passed away just a few months ago.
[02:27:16.464 --> 02:27:21.587]  In fact, I'm doing an interview with Wired Magazine on HAARP in the next couple of days.
[02:27:21.587 --> 02:27:27.431]  And his family sent me up the letterhead documents from APTI and from ARCO.
[02:27:28.234 --> 02:27:34.900]  Supporting the fact that he actually set this program up, something the military denies, you know, to this day.
[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:44.428]  Which is remarkable, you know, when you start to think about it, because that is the approach they've taken, is they initiate all this activity, then deny it until you extract it from them.
[02:27:44.428 --> 02:27:47.210]  A good friend of mine's dad was a U.S.
[02:27:47.210 --> 02:27:52.735]  Supreme Court Justice, and he was trained as an attorney, and what the guy told me one time is, he said,
[02:27:53.357 --> 02:27:55.078]  You never concede a point.
[02:27:55.078 --> 02:27:57.200]  You make them extract it from you.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:59.261]  And that's how the government operates today.
[02:27:59.261 --> 02:28:11.650]  Instead of giving you information, it's about withholding information from the public so the public doesn't get a chance to weigh in on the very important decisions that are affecting us right now and will affect us far into the future.
[02:28:12.577 --> 02:28:18.459]  You know, I think when you start to look at that whole panorama of technology, you can go, oh, we don't need any of this.
[02:28:18.459 --> 02:28:19.900]  But the fact is, we have it.
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:21.221]  It's going to be here.
[02:28:21.221 --> 02:28:23.001]  We need to make sure it serves our interests.
[02:28:23.001 --> 02:28:25.182]  And that's what is not happening.
[02:28:25.182 --> 02:28:34.346]  That's why, you know, when you start to look at the ineffectiveness of our Congress today and why it's in the toilet, I mean, it's ratings are lower than the president's right now.
[02:28:34.346 --> 02:28:36.427]  And it's because of their ineffectiveness at
[02:28:37.068 --> 02:28:41.130]  Safeguarding an economy, working in the interest of the common person.
[02:28:41.130 --> 02:28:44.251]  They're so detached, so distant.
[02:28:44.251 --> 02:28:50.213]  And then the technologies we have are being turned against us when they ought to be turned into a situation where we're solving our problems.
[02:28:50.213 --> 02:28:56.176]  I mean, think about the energy nonsense, crisis, so-called crisis we're in.
[02:28:56.176 --> 02:28:59.197]  Totally unavoidable on the backdrop of American technology.
[02:29:00.916 --> 02:29:07.261]  We're going to come back with Dr. Nick Begich after this quick three-minute break and get into the Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:29:07.261 --> 02:29:16.609]  Stay with us.
[02:29:16.609 --> 02:29:20.512]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:30:26.832 --> 02:30:28.894]  Life has changed.
[02:30:28.894 --> 02:30:30.735]  We're not 21 anymore.
[02:30:30.735 --> 02:30:33.897]  We have responsibilities.
[02:30:33.897 --> 02:30:36.819]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[02:30:36.819 --> 02:30:38.520]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:39.321]  Yeah, dude.

[02:32:53.517 --> 02:32:54.318]  I'll be gone.
[02:32:54.318 --> 02:32:56.761]  I'll be gone like I said.
[02:32:59.926 --> 02:33:12.653]  I know we've got a lot of people holding a lot of phone calls.
[02:33:12.653 --> 02:33:16.015]  I'm going to get your calls before this hour is out with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:33:16.015 --> 02:33:17.315]  He'll be with us into the next hour.
[02:33:17.315 --> 02:33:19.636]  You can bring up any issue or topic with him.
[02:33:19.636 --> 02:33:24.059]  He is a scientist who has a lot of basic general knowledge.
[02:33:25.089 --> 02:33:27.653]  Across many different disciplines.
[02:33:27.653 --> 02:33:38.948]  Dr. Begich, continuing with what we were talking about, I don't think the average person realizes how managed our society is or how managed major technological movements or rollouts
[02:33:40.455 --> 02:33:55.426]  Truly are, and the fact that there is giant oil reserves in the Gulf and Alaska and all over the world, the oil companies have decided not to remove it, that they're artificially keeping prices up, and they love to blame it on the Arabs.
[02:33:55.426 --> 02:33:58.488]  Well, yeah, they're part of it, but it's part of the same elite
[02:33:59.068 --> 02:34:05.592]  Just like the oil companies are part of it, buying up refineries and closing them, but that's only one small area as you know.
[02:34:05.592 --> 02:34:22.421]  Then there's all these other incredibly advanced technologies that are decades and decades old that they could have put into place and government then only offers incentives for a few of these late in the game so they can control those developments and now they've got their global greenhouse tax
[02:34:23.061 --> 02:34:27.305]  Fraud, which is meant to bring in a new dark age of control.
[02:34:27.305 --> 02:34:41.460]  I want to get your response to that, but please continue walking through what you were beginning to get into about just how technologically hamstrung and held back we are by these vested interests.
[02:34:42.085 --> 02:34:42.365]  Right.
[02:34:42.365 --> 02:34:47.288]  You know, let me talk about oil and gas as a starting point, because that's in everybody's mind right now.
[02:34:47.288 --> 02:34:55.593]  And Alaska is, the Arctic actually holds 25% of all of the undiscovered oil and gas is what they estimate.
[02:34:55.593 --> 02:35:05.179]  And Alaska actually has, in proven and probable reserves, tens of thousands of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas.
[02:35:05.179 --> 02:35:05.880]  Let me say that again.
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:07.741]  Tens of thousands of trillions
[02:35:08.343 --> 02:35:10.224]  Of cubic feet of natural gas.
[02:35:10.224 --> 02:35:18.426]  Prudhoe Bay, which everybody talks about, is just one small dot of sand on the beach of oil and gas in Alaska and the Arctic.
[02:35:18.426 --> 02:35:21.127]  And the reality is, it's been held hostage.
[02:35:21.127 --> 02:35:26.368]  They've had the rights to develop it since 1969 and have failed to bring it into production.
[02:35:26.368 --> 02:35:31.330]  The existing oil pipeline is running at 40% of its capacity, of its design capacity.
[02:35:31.890 --> 02:35:37.516]  Not for a shortage of oil, but a shortage of a willingness to put our oil, domestic oil, through our pipeline.
[02:35:37.516 --> 02:35:38.216]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:35:38.216 --> 02:35:44.362]  We're not even talking about new pipelines to add 60% more to the West Coast.
[02:35:44.362 --> 02:35:46.884]  It's paying on average $5 a gallon now.
[02:35:46.884 --> 02:35:48.005]  National average about $4.20.
[02:35:48.005 --> 02:35:51.248]  And this is a scientific
[02:35:52.185 --> 02:35:58.868]  Undebatable fact, and there's a lot of evidence that your father was killed for trying to bring this oil in as well.
[02:35:58.868 --> 02:36:20.559]  That's right, and the other part of it is, because of that empty capacity in the existing pipeline, you could put in within two years, or even less if it was an important enough issue, a liquefaction plant on the North Slope and you could liquefy natural gas and have it go all the way through that pipeline along with that oil, have it separated at Valdez and be putting on tankers within two years rather than ten or fifteen.
[02:36:21.227 --> 02:36:23.548]  In the way it's being pushed forward today.
[02:36:23.548 --> 02:36:25.309]  The fact, no one's asking these questions.
[02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:32.872]  You know, when Dad was in the Congress in the early 70s, he was, um, that was a time where the oil embargo was about to take shape in 73.
[02:36:32.872 --> 02:36:38.595]  Uh, the pipeline was on the, the drawing boards, uh, in terms of building the oil pipeline in Alaska.
[02:36:38.595 --> 02:36:42.276]  And they couldn't build it until they had a settlement of the indigenous issues here.
[02:36:42.276 --> 02:36:46.318]  So they made an attempt at that with the Native Land Claims Settlement Act, the biggest in the history
[02:36:47.118 --> 02:36:48.899]  Uh, of the United States.
[02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:53.040]  And you've been one of the elected leaders of the tribes as well, so you're involved in that.
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:57.741]  Well, I've been a tribal administrator, which is not unelected, but I did work directly for the chief.
[02:36:57.741 --> 02:37:01.462]  Well, your brother is a mayor of a major city.
[02:37:01.462 --> 02:37:07.244]  That's right, and he's also a candidate against Senator Ted Stevens in this year's elections.
[02:37:07.244 --> 02:37:13.346]  Who, by the way, is the architect of trying, with one fell swoop, to kill the internet with ending net neutrality.
[02:37:14.099 --> 02:37:19.380]  Right, and he was on the Technology and Science Committee and referred to the internet as a tubes and pipes.
[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:24.481]  I mean, this is a guy making the decisions that doesn't even understand the technology.
[02:37:24.481 --> 02:37:33.062]  Brother Mark actually is leading him in the polls right now and has raised about a million and a quarter for his election in the first four months of his campaign.
[02:37:33.062 --> 02:37:41.124]  You know, I don't say this jokingly, and I know it's serious to you because it's your brother, he better be real careful and not fly on any private planes.
[02:37:41.932 --> 02:38:01.418]  Well, you know, Mark is, you know, he is careful and hopefully things will go smoothly and he'll win this election, get into Washington and, you know, and on technology issues... Well, you know, Stevens is like a mob boss, so... Oh yeah, we've got, you know, the IRS and the FBI raided his home here not too many months ago, his son is...
[02:38:02.094 --> 02:38:05.018]  I've been named in a couple of criminal investigations.
[02:38:05.018 --> 02:38:08.342]  Several legislators are now in federal prison in California and Oregon.
[02:38:08.342 --> 02:38:19.295]  In fact, the guy I ran against in 2004 and had asserted he was corrupted by oil is actually in jail for oil corruption today and serving five years for that and another year for
[02:38:20.436 --> 02:38:22.658]  Lying to the judge for perjury.
[02:38:22.658 --> 02:38:30.022]  You know, and this thing, what's happening here, that people are not seeing in the mainstream media, is this is our opportunity.
[02:38:30.022 --> 02:38:31.884]  We're talking about the National Treasury.
[02:38:31.884 --> 02:38:37.187]  They are leasing the offshore resources right now like it's a fire sale.
[02:38:37.187 --> 02:38:39.369]  I mean, for pennies on the dollar.
[02:38:39.369 --> 02:38:44.292]  And there's enough money in these natural resources that we, you and I, all own in common in this country.
[02:38:44.292 --> 02:38:45.653]  They're the public's resources.
[02:38:47.414 --> 02:38:57.100]  Now, Dr. Begich, I want you to go over all that evidence because your family's all involved in politics there and you've studied it and your dad was a congressman.
[02:38:57.100 --> 02:38:59.001]  I've studied the situation and what you're saying is accurate.
[02:38:59.001 --> 02:39:00.702]  I want listeners to know that.
[02:39:00.702 --> 02:39:06.566]  But for those that don't understand, they have the image that five guys with beards and sandals have stopped
[02:39:07.006 --> 02:39:14.051]  Drilling off the shore of Alaska, off the shore of California, that five guys in sandals stopped drilling in the Gulf.
[02:39:14.051 --> 02:39:15.812]  That is their front.
[02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:20.835]  The big banks, the big oil companies use environmentalists as their front.
[02:39:20.835 --> 02:39:28.740]  Meanwhile, the big corporations engage in cross-species, chimeras, seriously dangerous to the planet, all sorts of toxic waste dumping.
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:29.801]  You know, you're a progressive.
[02:39:29.801 --> 02:39:33.403]  We're talking about there's real environmentalism and then there's fake environmentalism.
[02:39:34.183 --> 02:39:35.604]  I'll tell you the story on that, Alex.
[02:39:35.604 --> 02:39:36.484]  You'll appreciate this.
[02:39:36.484 --> 02:39:45.868]  Back after the Native land claims, we had a sectioner, because Dad got him to override the chairman, Mo Udall, on this bill and got it passed.
[02:39:45.868 --> 02:39:47.869]  Subsequently, the pipeline passed.
[02:39:47.869 --> 02:39:53.572]  In fact, it was a tie vote in the Senate, 50-50, and Agnew broke the tie to get us an oil pipeline in the first place.
[02:39:54.227 --> 02:40:01.451]  And what they did is afterwards, D2 was a section of Alaska law that said they were going to set up parks and preserves.
[02:40:01.451 --> 02:40:14.879]  So Carter comes in, he does this major survey in the 70s, and they decide that we have 32 of the 33 strategic minerals that the country needs absolutely for our economy and our military in mineable quantities.
[02:40:14.879 --> 02:40:16.740]  In fact, world-class quantities.
[02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:20.202]  A lot of people don't know this, but we have the largest molybdenum deposit in the world.
[02:40:20.202 --> 02:40:22.263]  It's not even being worked, it's sitting at tidewater.
[02:40:22.839 --> 02:40:30.002]  We have 600 foot coal seams on the coastline that are available that are low sulfur.
[02:40:30.002 --> 02:40:33.064]  Tremendous resources all through the state.
[02:40:33.064 --> 02:40:36.665]  Gold, silver, platinum, tin, everything.
[02:40:36.665 --> 02:40:38.206]  It's a veritable South Africa.
[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:40.280]  It is unbelievable.
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:46.102]  It dwarfs South Africa, as a matter of fact, because landmass-wise, take a look at what Alaska represents.
[02:40:46.102 --> 02:40:52.284]  In terms of fisheries, we're the largest fishery left on the planet, and most of it being taken by foreign fleets.
[02:40:52.284 --> 02:40:55.185]  The fact is, Alaska is a treasure house.
[02:40:55.185 --> 02:41:03.948]  That is the potential of turning this country's economic situation around, because these are natural resources held in common.
[02:41:03.948 --> 02:41:05.489]  An application of technology.
[02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:06.429]  We can do today
[02:41:07.029 --> 02:41:08.530]  Earth penetrating tomography.
[02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:16.376]  We can look several miles deep into the Earth's crust and determine all of the mineral deposits and all of the oil and gas deposits
[02:41:16.758 --> 02:41:19.521]  With 99.9% accuracy.
[02:41:19.521 --> 02:41:21.263]  Well, here's an example.
[02:41:21.263 --> 02:41:34.937]  Here in Texas, they found a giant oil and gas field from Dallas to Houston, and the really big majors have been trying to use environmental grids on the people to shut down drilling, which has no environmental impact.
[02:41:34.937 --> 02:41:38.761]  I mean, they literally create maybe an acre pad and drill it and bring it out completely cleanly.
[02:41:39.641 --> 02:41:45.924]  And the oil companies have been caught buying up all the oil refineries so that they just can't take it to market.
[02:41:45.924 --> 02:41:48.125]  And that's even been in the Associated Press.
[02:41:48.125 --> 02:41:54.747]  So they're busy blaming five hippies wearing sandals and the five hippies think they're King Kong and go, man, we got power.
[02:41:54.747 --> 02:41:56.228]  No, you don't have power.
[02:41:56.228 --> 02:41:58.989]  You're being used and scammed and laughed at.
[02:41:58.989 --> 02:42:04.771]  And so imagine what's going on in Texas, which is a fraction of what Alaska has.
[02:42:04.771 --> 02:42:06.852]  I mean, the oil price could be cut in half tomorrow.
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:07.860]  Right.
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:18.150]  And you know, the other thing is what happened in D2, all the environmental groups got all enamored because the Rockefeller Foundation and all these foundations, these industrialist foundations, were given them money.
[02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:19.291]  And they couldn't figure it out.
[02:42:19.291 --> 02:42:29.141]  Well, when they locked all this land, what they did is once they surveyed all this, they locked a big portion of it up in parks and preserves so you couldn't mine it except under one condition.
[02:42:29.141 --> 02:42:30.322]  It was open to you and me.
[02:42:30.322 --> 02:42:31.924]  As American citizens, we could go out
[02:42:32.464 --> 02:42:36.507]  And make a discovery, and stake that claim, and have the ownership of those mineral rights.
[02:42:36.507 --> 02:42:40.309]  We could go to patent if it was federal land, and if it was state, you could go to lease.
[02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:41.790]  But you had that right.
[02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:52.396]  When they locked up this federal land in this way, the only time it'll ever be available is in a national crisis, and then the multinationals will be invited in, because they're the only ones that can mobilize.
[02:42:52.396 --> 02:42:56.919]  And then the real environmentalists, the ones who are concerned about a legitimate way of approaching development,
[02:42:57.862 --> 02:43:01.405]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:43:01.405 --> 02:43:02.827]  Let's be clear.
[02:43:02.827 --> 02:43:04.328]  Five guys in sandals.
[02:43:04.328 --> 02:43:04.888]  Earth first.
[02:43:04.888 --> 02:43:05.969]  You run nothing.
[02:43:05.969 --> 02:43:06.610]  You're a joke.
[02:43:06.610 --> 02:43:07.791]  You're funded by the globalists.
[02:43:07.791 --> 02:43:09.152]  I know you won't admit that.
[02:43:09.152 --> 02:43:10.453]  Losing's too important for you.
[02:43:10.453 --> 02:43:14.397]  Being scammed is always the object of, you know, being a chump.
[02:43:14.397 --> 02:43:20.823]  But I'm giving you the facts here, and Dr. Begich is giving you the facts, and they pretty clearly killed his dad over all this trying to bring out the facts.
[02:43:21.443 --> 02:43:30.827]  Understand, this belonged to the American people, and it was stolen, just like they find giant clean-burning coal deposits enough to run the whole U.S.
[02:43:30.827 --> 02:43:45.993]  for 200 years in Utah, and Bill Clinton says, off-limits, and then they mine dirty coal in Texas, lignite, and then dump it in the plants and spew mercury and take the environmental rules off so they can burn mercury-filled coal.
[02:43:45.993 --> 02:43:48.114]  And the environmentalists dance around loving that, too.
[02:43:48.114 --> 02:43:48.954]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:43:49.557 --> 02:43:52.839]  Yeah, we have anthracite here, which is very clean-burning.
[02:43:52.839 --> 02:43:56.681]  In fact, we used to fuel, during World War I, Alaskan coal fueled the Pacific Fleet.
[02:43:56.681 --> 02:43:57.901]  A lot of people don't know this.
[02:43:57.901 --> 02:44:00.522]  They shut them all down after the war was over.
[02:44:00.522 --> 02:44:05.525]  Copper, Alaska has, and there'll be a story to tell on this someday, but Alaska has
[02:44:06.283 --> 02:44:07.964]  Huge deposits of copper.
[02:44:07.964 --> 02:44:19.690]  The Guggenheim family, when they owned all the copper in the country back during the 1870s and on, they owned all of it in Colorado, then they owned everything in Alaska, then they owned everything in Chile.
[02:44:19.690 --> 02:44:21.671]  They had a worldwide monopoly with J.P.
[02:44:21.671 --> 02:44:23.052]  Morgan up here.
[02:44:23.052 --> 02:44:31.697]  And what they left behind, because they left Alaska after not mining out the copper, it's just that labor was so much cheaper in Latin America.
[02:44:31.697 --> 02:44:33.918]  There are only 30,000 people living in Alaska.
[02:44:34.618 --> 02:44:48.802]  A hundred years ago when they discovered copper, and yet the copper deposit that was being mined at Kennecott was with five on a ratio of 15 times what they would mine per person in Montana.
[02:44:48.802 --> 02:44:57.644]  In other words, the copper ore was so rich at Kennecott that 15 times as much money was produced per person.
[02:44:57.644 --> 02:45:00.105]  They had an unbelievable
[02:45:00.958 --> 02:45:01.578]  Discovery.
[02:45:01.578 --> 02:45:02.358]  Well, they left it.
[02:45:02.358 --> 02:45:11.800]  They just, I mean, they left the buildings, everything, the machinery, pulled up the railroad and went to Chile because Chile had a million people that had their own agricultural basin.
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:13.421]  They could pay them peanuts.
[02:45:13.421 --> 02:45:19.582]  And Alaskan labor was expensive in those days and, you know, I mean, an egg cost a hundred years ago a buck.
[02:45:19.582 --> 02:45:24.443]  You know, you talk about an egg costing money today, it was a dollar during the gold rush era.
[02:45:24.443 --> 02:45:27.644]  But, you know, the thing about all of this is when you start to look
[02:45:28.264 --> 02:45:29.525]  At the National Resources.
[02:45:29.525 --> 02:45:31.066]  I'll give you another example.
[02:45:31.066 --> 02:45:39.730]  It's all been locked away through phony conservation and it's all... It's like a safety deposit box for the multinationals.
[02:45:39.730 --> 02:45:42.232]  They get to break it out later when the price is high enough.
[02:45:42.232 --> 02:45:43.653]  You know why oil is so high?
[02:45:43.653 --> 02:45:52.777]  It's because the alternatives are about to come in and the oil industry is getting as much money together in the big pile as they can because they're going to own that industry.
[02:45:52.777 --> 02:45:57.440]  Whatever those alternatives are, they're going to be in such a heavy cash position they'll buy out whoever's in the game.
[02:45:58.070 --> 02:46:02.512]  And that is the reason I believe they're capitalizing right now.
[02:46:02.512 --> 02:46:18.740]  They want to own the energy industry, whatever that looks like in the 21st century, and make sure you're stuck on a meter when the 21st century should offer us the opposite and it does, where we shouldn't have any meters and we ought to be totally independent and our households with energy and our businesses with energy with the
[02:46:18.900 --> 02:46:30.825]  Well, I want to hear about some of those advanced technologies that they're suppressing and that they plan to own, and you're absolutely right with your research, and I know you can elaborate and teach us a lot, but this is economic warfare.
[02:46:30.825 --> 02:46:45.531]  They have built a society, especially in the United States and Western Europe, completely dependent on fossil fuels, with these sprawling cities and rural areas where you have to have the carb.
[02:46:46.371 --> 02:46:53.833]  They have strategically blocked the development of other fuels and other energy platforms.
[02:46:53.833 --> 02:47:09.357]  And then now, as you said, they're not just getting a pile of money for investment, they state that they are now literally waging war on the population and are squeezing the middle class into extinction and transferring
[02:47:10.497 --> 02:47:25.183]  Masses of the wealth to themselves in a predatory fashion to pre-position themselves in the 21st century to fully build a corporate control grid police state system that they call their New World Order.
[02:47:25.183 --> 02:47:26.404]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[02:47:26.404 --> 02:47:36.988]  And I think when you look at the interlocking boards of directors in these corporations, when you start to analyze the relationships politically on a national and a state level, and you watch how that whole machine operates,
[02:47:37.894 --> 02:47:54.945]  You know, if people fully had disclosure, and we work with unclassified materials and put together the picture pretty clearly, but if people had full disclosure of things that are truly not national secrets but are national embarrassments, we would be changing this government out in a dramatic way.
[02:47:54.945 --> 02:48:06.132]  And not to say that it should be violent or anything like that, but the fact of the matter is, the truth, the truth of what has happened, and this is why the technology is so threatening,
[02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:23.455]  to this establishment because they recognize that you know when people hear and they feel the pain of the results of this truth which is fear of your loss, your pension, your social security, worry about your money in the bank and your money markets that could collapse.
[02:48:23.455 --> 02:48:27.617]  And you find out it was all done predatorily by design.
[02:48:27.617 --> 02:48:32.901]  You're going to get mad so they preemptively have a police state surveillance grid in place.
[02:48:32.901 --> 02:48:34.702]  We've got a break but before we break
[02:48:35.903 --> 02:48:40.006]  Finish up the point you're making, but I want to get into the fraud of the global carbon tax, but go ahead.
[02:48:40.006 --> 02:48:42.368]  Yeah, and you know, that's another, you know, that whole issue.
[02:48:42.368 --> 02:48:50.174]  The technology on the sciences, I mean, the simple things on the models taught in business school that make sure you get the customer coming back.
[02:48:50.174 --> 02:48:55.478]  So they don't want you independent energy where you buy something that'll last for 20 years and provides all your power.
[02:48:55.478 --> 02:48:58.600]  They want something that you have to go get a meter and plug into.
[02:48:59.306 --> 02:49:04.149]  This is why Tesla never got his free power grid on the planet, because J.P.
[02:49:04.149 --> 02:49:13.354]  Morgan, the same guy that financed the monopolies of almost every monopolist of the last part of the last century, you know, all of that was about control.
[02:49:13.354 --> 02:49:22.640]  Well, the new solar systems that the cities are paying for, that the feds are paying, you know, subsidizing a discount for you to get, hook into the grid!
[02:49:23.864 --> 02:49:24.665]  I'll give you an example.
[02:49:24.665 --> 02:49:26.567]  My brother Mark is mayor of Anchorage.
[02:49:26.567 --> 02:49:28.429]  They have a municipal light and power.
[02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:30.290]  They bought gas rights from Shell Oil.
[02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:32.733]  They bought them out of the Cook Inlet gas field they own.
[02:49:32.733 --> 02:49:38.458]  So the city bought the gas rights for $1.40 per thousand cubic feet.
[02:49:38.458 --> 02:49:39.579]  And what is it today?
[02:49:39.579 --> 02:49:39.819]  You know, $13?
[02:49:41.235 --> 02:49:46.558]  And so the ratepayers are paying this incredibly good rate in the municipality of Anchorage for power.
[02:49:46.558 --> 02:49:50.000]  Seven cents, I think, a kilowatt hour on natural gas.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.502]  You're paying $1.13 to buy it.
[02:49:52.502 --> 02:49:57.305]  You're paying $1.13 with what everybody else pays, and the media calls that subsidized.
[02:49:57.305 --> 02:49:59.346]  No, that's what it really costs!
[02:49:59.346 --> 02:50:04.429]  Yeah, that's actually what it costs, and the city was smart enough to buy those rights in a commercial market.
[02:50:04.429 --> 02:50:06.511]  You know, he wanted to look into selling them, right?
[02:50:06.511 --> 02:50:08.412]  He wanted to sell them into the marketplace.
[02:50:08.932 --> 02:50:09.493]  Here we go.
[02:50:09.493 --> 02:50:10.593]  We're going to skip the break.
[02:50:10.593 --> 02:50:10.854]  Here we go.
[02:50:26.573 --> 02:50:28.254]  May I have everybody's attention?
[02:50:28.254 --> 02:50:33.536]  Doc, we're going to come back and take everybody's phone calls for folks that are patiently holding.
[02:50:33.536 --> 02:50:35.217]  I've got so many calls here on screen.
[02:50:35.217 --> 02:50:37.738]  We've got to do this more often, Alex.
[02:50:37.738 --> 02:50:39.099]  Oh, you bet.
[02:50:39.099 --> 02:50:41.300]  We've got so many calls here on screen, John.
[02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:44.601]  Just re-input them so I know who's who or who's hung up.
[02:50:44.601 --> 02:50:45.622]  Okay, just close your window.
[02:50:46.457 --> 02:50:48.138]  Okay, I'll do that.
[02:50:48.138 --> 02:50:49.439]  Thank you, sir.
[02:50:49.439 --> 02:50:50.720]  Doc, we are continuing.
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:53.783]  There's still a lot of people listening in this behind-the-scenes discussion.
[02:50:53.783 --> 02:51:03.731]  I just skipped some of the breaks now that we're streaming this live via PrisonPlanet.tv for the members, and then also people listening for free on the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:03.731 --> 02:51:06.693]  Let's start getting into the global warming fraud right now in about three minutes.
[02:51:08.393 --> 02:51:28.126]  Because obviously there's climate change going on, they're manipulating the weather, obviously there's real environmental crises, but even if you believe that carbon dioxide is causing warming, which the evidence shows it's not, their solution would ship all production to the third world with no controls and would actually boost, I've seen the studies, boost greenhouse gases.
[02:51:28.126 --> 02:51:38.353]  So even if you don't debate it and say it's real, their solution's a fraud and they admit now you will buy the carbon tax credit from the private central banks, making them the world's
[02:51:38.353 --> 02:51:38.616]  We're good.
[02:51:39.580 --> 02:51:42.601]  Right, you know, this is, um, it's really nature.
[02:51:42.601 --> 02:51:57.085]  And you can look at, there's a great BBC special on this that was very well done, laying the case, and we've said it, it's solar energy that contributes to the changes on the planet, and other conditions, undersea volcanics that also contributes.
[02:51:57.085 --> 02:52:01.726]  We published that back in the mid-90s, and eventually you'll see that.
[02:52:01.726 --> 02:52:05.707]  It is really not man making this happen, it's nature.
[02:52:05.707 --> 02:52:08.568]  We did a video on this, I think you guys carried it, the Earth
[02:52:09.228 --> 02:52:26.342]  It changes the ripple effect, and the subtitle is Alaska Sounds the Alarm, because in my lifetime, I'll be 50 this year, and in my lifetime, I've watched our glaciers recede, disappear up here, because it is getting warmer, but not for the reasons that are posed in the mainstream media.
[02:52:26.342 --> 02:52:32.166]  And the other issue is, when you talk about no regulation outside of the country, you're absolutely dead on right.
[02:52:33.547 --> 02:52:34.428]  If the U.S.
[02:52:34.428 --> 02:52:47.585]  stopped everything, just shut down the whole thing today, it wouldn't matter one iota because China and India will surpass whatever we're saving within a year or two of stopping everything, and that's not realistic.
[02:52:47.585 --> 02:52:48.546]  The other issue is,
[02:52:49.281 --> 02:52:54.226]  You know, what we're really more concerned about is the toxins that are being put into the environment.
[02:52:54.226 --> 02:53:02.195]  Those are legitimate concerns, but the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomena, largely the excuse of taxing everyone.
[02:53:02.195 --> 02:53:05.779]  And basically, the globalists are looking at it from this perspective.
[02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:20.526]  They had 300 million people to test out how to create and do marketing, consumers and taxpayers, and forget that we're human beings, and now they want to experiment with that on 6.3 billion people they would like to catch up.
[02:53:20.526 --> 02:53:25.208]  And the money, and the resources, and the government... Hey, let's stay there.
[02:53:25.208 --> 02:53:26.348]  We're coming back to the full audience.
[02:53:26.348 --> 02:53:28.129]  Recap that thought and continue.
[02:53:28.129 --> 02:53:28.409]  Here we go.
[02:53:31.991 --> 02:53:33.332]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest.
[02:53:33.332 --> 02:53:37.094]  The website is InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:37.094 --> 02:53:40.056]  We have links up on InfoWars.com to his website.
[02:53:40.056 --> 02:53:41.577]  You can go to EarthPulse.com.
[02:53:41.577 --> 02:53:43.298]  That's EarthPulse.com.
[02:53:43.298 --> 02:53:44.799]  And he has some others as well.
[02:53:44.799 --> 02:53:48.962]  We carry quite a few of his books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:48.962 --> 02:53:52.204]  So be sure and check those out on the online video and bookstore.
[02:53:53.184 --> 02:53:57.928]  Your calls, when we start the next hour, we're going directly to all of you that are holding patiently.
[02:53:57.928 --> 02:54:01.130]  Mason, Rusty, James, Paige, JD, thank you for holding.
[02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:02.511]  We're going to get to you.
[02:54:02.511 --> 02:54:08.376]  During the behind-the-scenes, for folks listening on the InfoWars.com streams, I brought up global warming.
[02:54:08.376 --> 02:54:11.198]  Obviously, it's been every angle of science.
[02:54:11.198 --> 02:54:22.287]  The hoax is, hundreds of thousands of scientists say it's not man-made, that it's natural, and then they've got a few hundred the UN hired who are quacks that say it is man-made, and we were just going over that.
[02:54:23.007 --> 02:54:24.769]  Now, are there real environmental things?
[02:54:24.769 --> 02:54:26.831]  Absolutely.
[02:54:26.831 --> 02:54:28.153]  Are we in a lot of trouble?
[02:54:28.153 --> 02:54:29.494]  Absolutely.
[02:54:29.494 --> 02:54:43.349]  But the globalists are just offering you a tax that will actually increase greenhouse emissions even if you capitulate and believe the fraud that it's man-driven when the UN's own report says 6% of the greenhouse gas emissions
[02:54:43.809 --> 02:54:47.832]  Greenhouse gas emissions are 6% of the increase in temperature.
[02:54:47.832 --> 02:54:55.399]  But Doctor, you were talking about why they're doing this, coming in, trying to block a renaissance, an excuse to bring us into a new technological dark age.
[02:54:56.331 --> 02:54:59.293]  Yeah, I think that's really what it is about.
[02:54:59.293 --> 02:55:04.576]  The fact that they want to keep us dependent until the last drop is drug out.
[02:55:04.576 --> 02:55:06.478]  But more than that, it's the wealth transfer.
[02:55:06.478 --> 02:55:14.242]  It's the markets that are seen as 6.3 billion people trying to catch up with what America has built.
[02:55:15.303 --> 02:55:17.324]  For that to happen, America has to lose.
[02:55:17.324 --> 02:55:18.865]  We have to be decapitalized.
[02:55:18.865 --> 02:55:21.686]  The money has to go out of this country to somewhere else.
[02:55:21.686 --> 02:55:23.227]  So they won't catch up.
[02:55:23.227 --> 02:55:25.308]  We're going to be lowered down to their level.
[02:55:25.308 --> 02:55:29.009]  And they even say that on NPR, like it's wonderful.
[02:55:29.009 --> 02:55:35.312]  And the fact that, you know, what we saw here, you know, people don't realize, like, the coming banking crisis, which we haven't seen the beginnings of yet,
[02:55:35.985 --> 02:55:43.591]  And here in Alaska, when oil went the other way, when it was like $8, $9 a barrel in the mid-80s, people don't remember it.
[02:55:43.591 --> 02:55:44.671]  It took a big drop.
[02:55:44.671 --> 02:55:47.814]  Well, here in Alaska, one in three banks failed.
[02:55:47.814 --> 02:55:49.615]  One in three went out of business.
[02:55:50.169 --> 02:55:53.072]  One in ten homes went into foreclosures.
[02:55:53.072 --> 02:55:55.495]  The bankruptcies were off the charts.
[02:55:55.495 --> 02:56:04.285]  And when we saw that happen here, and what it did, and then the roll-up, because businesses have been here 50, 60 years, we're caught in that trap.
[02:56:04.285 --> 02:56:10.832]  As housing developers defaulted, and contractors defaulted, and their subcontractors defaulted, and then their employees defaulted.
[02:56:11.413 --> 02:56:13.538]  And people fell all around us.
[02:56:13.538 --> 02:56:17.206]  And that has not yet happened to the country for the opposite reason.
[02:56:17.206 --> 02:56:19.271]  Because oil now is, you know, $130, $140 a barrel.
[02:56:22.254 --> 02:56:22.935]  That impacts.
[02:56:22.935 --> 02:56:24.195]  We are all counter-cyclic.
[02:56:24.195 --> 02:56:27.558]  Alaska is an oil state, so when oil's high, our state thrives.
[02:56:27.558 --> 02:56:34.342]  When oil's low, we suffer greatly because 85% of our revenue stream is oil-driven.
[02:56:34.342 --> 02:56:45.929]  And when you start to look at the national resources that are being auctioned off today, in the case of one of the big ones that just went off in northwest Alaska off the coast,
[02:56:46.761 --> 02:56:53.026]  That auction brought $2.5 billion today at oil at $140 a barrel.
[02:56:53.026 --> 02:57:00.192]  Prudhoe Bay, with one-tenth of the projected reserves, brought in $1 billion when oil was $3 back in 1969.
[02:57:00.192 --> 02:57:02.314]  Okay, Doc, stay there.
[02:57:02.314 --> 02:57:02.654]  Stay there.
[02:57:02.654 --> 02:57:04.095]  I want to finish up with that when we come back.
[02:57:04.095 --> 02:57:05.436]  We're about to start the fourth hour.
[02:57:05.436 --> 02:57:07.078]  We're going to go to your calls, but stay there.
[02:57:07.078 --> 02:57:11.021]  Before we end this hour, I want to encourage everybody to go to Infowars.com.
[02:57:12.302 --> 02:57:15.327]  Link through on the bookstore and video store shopping cart.
[02:57:15.327 --> 02:57:16.368]  Get the DVD.
[02:57:16.368 --> 02:57:21.496]  Angels still don't play this Harp DVD.
[02:57:21.496 --> 02:57:23.619]  Latest info on Harp.
[02:57:23.619 --> 02:57:27.725]  Also, we have his mind control video, his energy video, books.
[02:57:28.266 --> 02:57:31.610]  We've got all his best stuff at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:31.610 --> 02:57:35.475]  This is important material that needs to be seen by everybody.
[02:57:35.475 --> 02:57:40.921]  So please, go to InfoWars.com and get Angel's Still Don't Play This Harp.
[02:57:40.921 --> 02:57:42.203]  You've read the book.
[02:57:42.203 --> 02:57:42.924]  A lot of you will.
[02:57:42.924 --> 02:57:43.765]  Get the video.
[02:57:43.765 --> 02:57:44.526]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:57:45.006 --> 02:57:50.167]  Get the mind control video as well, where he goes over all the admissions of what they've gotten.
[02:57:50.167 --> 02:57:52.128]  Later I want to speak to him about that.
[02:57:52.128 --> 02:57:57.749]  Also want to get from Dr. Nick Baggage his take on where the economy's going and how bad he thinks it will really get.
[02:57:57.749 --> 02:58:01.070]  But first, we're going to take about 30 minutes of your phone calls.
[02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:03.110]  When we get back in just 70 seconds.
[02:58:03.110 --> 02:58:04.851]  Stay with us.
[02:58:04.851 --> 02:58:08.792]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:08.792 --> 02:58:14.473]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:16.610 --> 02:58:18.592]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:18.592 --> 02:58:22.214]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:22.214 --> 02:58:24.656]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:24.656 --> 02:58:27.699]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:27.699 --> 02:58:33.443]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:33.443 --> 02:58:37.346]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:58:37.666 --> 02:58:42.873]  In the Infowar, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:58:42.873 --> 02:58:45.937]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:58:45.937 --> 02:58:53.167]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[02:58:53.167 --> 02:58:55.009]  Thousands of special video reports are
[02:58:55.009 --> 02:58:59.110]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[02:58:59.110 --> 02:59:03.971]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:59:03.971 --> 02:59:06.812]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:59:06.812 --> 02:59:09.913]  Join prison- And terrorism preparedness, Bill.
[02:59:09.913 --> 02:59:17.534]  As said, Bill, requests emergency response funding up to and including- I'm sorry, this section is classified.
[02:59:17.534 --> 02:59:21.635]  Dollars to prepare for a national level- Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:21.635 --> 02:59:24.296]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:59:27.913 --> 02:59:28.354]  I'm on air.
[02:59:45.677 --> 02:59:47.518]  We've got Otterding and Beggins for most of the hour.
[02:59:47.518 --> 02:59:54.383]  We're going to be taking your phone calls right now, but you were going to, when we hit the break, you were interrupted by that.
[02:59:54.383 --> 03:00:03.829]  Tell us specifically, you were getting into the value of the Prudhoe Bay Proven Reserves, a tiny area in Alaska.
[03:00:03.829 --> 03:00:09.032]  Right, it was, they projected 900 million barrels of oil there, and the auction was
[03:00:10.222 --> 03:00:11.863]  A billion dollars, basically.
[03:00:11.863 --> 03:00:15.925]  Just under a billion dollars in 1969, when oil was three dollars a barrel.
[03:00:15.925 --> 03:00:27.209]  Now, here in Alaska, under this federal administration, a lease just took place that they raised two and a half billion on an oil reserve that's projected to have ten billion barrels in it.
[03:00:27.209 --> 03:00:35.912]  In other words, ten times as much at a price that is like forty times higher than it was in 1969.
[03:00:35.912 --> 03:00:37.673]  And we only get two and a half times the money?
[03:00:38.123 --> 03:00:43.064]  Now, this is the fuzzy math of the biggest rip-off since the railroad barons.
[03:00:43.064 --> 03:00:44.164]  And people don't remember that.
[03:00:44.164 --> 03:00:47.705]  You know, they controlled all the corridors so the farmer beats his brains out.
[03:00:47.705 --> 03:00:49.326]  No, they convinced the public.
[03:00:49.326 --> 03:00:54.767]  They convinced the public there's no elite, no corruption, and then of course they just totally took over.
[03:00:54.767 --> 03:01:01.809]  Yeah, and what they're doing now is this acceleration of the offshore leasing because it's the biggest giveaway in the history of the country.
[03:01:01.809 --> 03:01:06.830]  If we did look at these resources differently in terms of how do we maximize
[03:01:07.406 --> 03:01:09.808]  There are potentials for the public benefits.
[03:01:09.808 --> 03:01:15.892]  Here in Alaska, a lot of people don't know this, but because of our oil revenue and what it does, we don't have a state income tax.
[03:01:15.892 --> 03:01:17.093]  We don't have a state sales tax.
[03:01:17.093 --> 03:01:20.015]  In fact, the government pays you to live in Alaska.
[03:01:20.015 --> 03:01:20.495]  That's right.
[03:01:20.495 --> 03:01:30.762]  In fact, right now our legislature is in a special session and residents who have been here a year at the end of this session are likely going to see a $1,200 check show up for every resident.
[03:01:30.862 --> 03:01:33.704]  Folks, that's how rich this whole country is.
[03:01:33.704 --> 03:01:38.927]  And Mexico has triple the resources of the lower 48, but they're one of the poorest in the world.
[03:01:38.927 --> 03:01:42.669]  Because the elites want you poor as a mode to control you.
[03:01:42.669 --> 03:01:45.130]  It's in their own handbooks.
[03:01:45.130 --> 03:01:52.815]  You know, the public resources are enough to supply the national treasury, retire the debt, eliminate income tax for individuals.
[03:01:53.437 --> 03:01:57.040]  Uh, and tax corporations when they use public resources.
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:03.024]  But instead we have a Federal Reserve that has set up a system where it's impossible to get out of debt.
[03:02:03.024 --> 03:02:05.386]  For money to be created, debt is created.
[03:02:05.386 --> 03:02:06.306]  It is a total fraud.
[03:02:06.306 --> 03:02:07.587]  Let's go to the calls.
[03:02:07.587 --> 03:02:10.009]  Mason in Florida, Rusty, James, and others.
[03:02:10.009 --> 03:02:11.450]  Go ahead, Mason.
[03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:12.190]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:02:12.190 --> 03:02:12.691]  Yes, I can.
[03:02:12.691 --> 03:02:18.635]  Okay, um, hey Alex, I've, um, been wanting to call in for a while, but I'm only, um, 17.
[03:02:18.635 --> 03:02:20.556]  I live in Florida.
[03:02:20.556 --> 03:02:22.778]  When I first found out about this, I thought, like,
[03:02:23.482 --> 03:02:27.170]  Not to be rude or anything, but I thought you were crazy and my friend was crazy.
[03:02:27.170 --> 03:02:33.284]  Once I saw Endgame and looked everything up, I found out, but ever since then I've been trying to wake people up, but...
[03:02:34.221 --> 03:02:38.422]  It's basically been like you're some crazy conspirator, you're in some fantasy world.
[03:02:38.422 --> 03:02:49.205]  Hey, listen, I got neocons who on their own websites, because they send me their links, are in the military and they say the dollar's not devalued, everything's fine.
[03:02:49.205 --> 03:02:56.386]  Dr. Begich, what is, I mean, it's like people are in a spell, at least some of them, where they cannot face reality.
[03:02:56.386 --> 03:02:58.487]  It seems to be more than denial.
[03:02:58.487 --> 03:03:02.648]  I mean, is it that they're so invested in lies they can't admit they were wrong?
[03:03:03.288 --> 03:03:12.254]  Yeah, I think that's a lot of it, and it's that idea of never concede a point, you know, and most people never analyze a point, you know, and they bank on that.
[03:03:12.254 --> 03:03:20.720]  Well, when people are suffering, and this is what they're not banking on, and people are suffering in this country, and the inflation hasn't even started, I mean, the worst is yet to come.
[03:03:21.644 --> 03:03:26.905]  That, in and of itself, although we hate to see it happen, is what it takes sometimes to wake up the American public.
[03:03:26.905 --> 03:03:28.006]  And you can say it.
[03:03:28.006 --> 03:03:29.466]  I can say it.
[03:03:29.466 --> 03:03:30.146]  You can say it.
[03:03:30.146 --> 03:03:30.766]  I can say it.
[03:03:30.766 --> 03:03:32.367]  We told you so.
[03:03:32.367 --> 03:03:34.787]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:34.787 --> 03:03:42.469]  And yet, the hope is still there, because it's not over until it's over, and we still have a chance to take this republic back.
[03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:43.129]  And that's the thing.
[03:03:43.129 --> 03:03:45.290]  And I think people are feeling this all over the world.
[03:03:45.290 --> 03:03:47.650]  When I travel, I travel quite a bit.
[03:03:47.650 --> 03:03:48.931]  I run into this in Europe.
[03:03:48.931 --> 03:03:49.951]  I run into it every place.
[03:03:51.229 --> 03:04:00.335]  When you start to think about it, it's just a different spin on the same formula, which is to enslave the public, to be dependent, when we used to be independent.
[03:04:00.335 --> 03:04:02.177]  And in this century, we should be independent.
[03:04:02.177 --> 03:04:06.540]  Our technologies offer us the potentials that are just incredible.
[03:04:06.540 --> 03:04:09.001]  I mean, the solutions are already here.
[03:04:09.001 --> 03:04:12.424]  We just need a different political will to bring them into reality.
[03:04:12.424 --> 03:04:15.706]  Alright, on the InfoWars streams, we're going to skip this break, too.
[03:04:15.706 --> 03:04:16.607]  Stay there, Mason.
[03:04:16.607 --> 03:04:17.888]  Calls, everybody.
[03:04:17.888 --> 03:04:19.729]  We're going to continue right now.
[03:04:26.624 --> 03:04:29.647]  Okay, anything else, Mason?
[03:04:29.647 --> 03:04:31.108]  One more thing.
[03:04:31.108 --> 03:04:32.849]  I was thinking about buying a rifle.
[03:04:32.849 --> 03:04:34.611]  You think I should?
[03:04:34.611 --> 03:04:34.871]  Yes.
[03:04:34.871 --> 03:04:37.754]  Okay, I was thinking about getting like a semi-automatic AK.
[03:04:38.612 --> 03:04:50.838]  Well, I wouldn't call it an AK, because your weak-minded neighbors will say he's got an AK, and an AK is a fully automatic, and without your federal firearms stamp, you'll be SWAT team rated, and they'll call you a terrorist.
[03:04:50.838 --> 03:04:53.819]  Plus, you don't want fully auto, or self-defense.
[03:04:53.819 --> 03:05:00.122]  You want what they call a MAC-90, or whatever the variant term is.
[03:05:00.122 --> 03:05:04.484]  Chinese is more inexpensive, but Bulgarian, Russian, Hungarian, that is a good 7.6239.
[03:05:06.825 --> 03:05:32.112]  30 round I would go with Eastern European and then try to get a few thousand rounds of ammo and then try to get proficient be able to shoot bullseye at a hundred yards and if you haven't owned guns in your life and weren't trained with a rifle like a lot of people from Texas and other areas were you need to go out and take some classes at the local shooting range and and you know treat that gun as an important tool before you start using it on your own.
[03:05:32.112 --> 03:05:33.873]  Okay and one last thing once the
[03:05:34.659 --> 03:05:37.520]  Internet basically gets, like, re-ordered.
[03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:40.162]  I think it's pretty much over.
[03:05:40.162 --> 03:05:41.562]  Well, we're not going to let that happen.
[03:05:41.562 --> 03:05:44.904]  They've already tried a bunch of these Internet attacks, and we've hammered them.
[03:05:44.904 --> 03:05:45.744]  I appreciate your call.
[03:05:45.744 --> 03:05:47.105]  In fact, your take on that?
[03:05:47.105 --> 03:05:48.806]  Dr. Begich, we have a lot of power.
[03:05:48.806 --> 03:05:50.546]  We've been affecting change.
[03:05:50.546 --> 03:05:51.927]  You know, I think that's true.
[03:05:51.927 --> 03:06:02.712]  And, you know, when you go back to other things that have happened where the Internet served us and talk radio served us, you go back to when the FDA wanted to regulate everything out of existence back in the 90s again.
[03:06:03.493 --> 03:06:08.738]  And people, you know, the biggest response ever, 30,000 letters to the FDA.
[03:06:08.738 --> 03:06:10.020]  They've never seen anything like it.
[03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:14.124]  And, you know, the fact is, as long as information does remain free, we have a fighting chance.
[03:06:14.124 --> 03:06:18.688]  But it's not over, I think, until it's really, truly over.
[03:06:18.688 --> 03:06:19.849]  And I think we're far from it.
[03:06:19.849 --> 03:06:24.154]  You know, the American public is always two minutes to midnight, but boy, that two minutes a lot of.
[03:06:24.901 --> 03:06:29.768]  Exactly, the sleeping giant always two minutes to midnight there in sudden death overtime.
[03:06:29.768 --> 03:06:32.471]  We don't have a choice and it's the fighting spirit.
[03:06:32.471 --> 03:06:37.078]  It's knowing that we can affect change and that we're not going to give up no matter how bad it gets.
[03:06:38.905 --> 03:06:42.568]  That's what allows us to win, and of course, trusting God, our Creator.
[03:06:42.568 --> 03:06:56.739]  I mean, looking at history, just modern time, I mean, haven't you in your personal life, I mean, I've seen this, but I'm guessing you've seen it, seen just people go from calling us kooks to almost everybody agreeing with us?
[03:06:56.739 --> 03:07:03.364]  Oh yeah, and the thing about it is, and you're careful with this as well, you know, you always have the sources, you always have the citations.
[03:07:03.996 --> 03:07:06.218]  And eventually, the mainstream does catch up.
[03:07:06.218 --> 03:07:10.261]  People start, they hear it, and then they go, oh wait, now the mainstream's reporting a little bit of this.
[03:07:10.261 --> 03:07:14.985]  And then it starts to make sense in the context of the experience that we're all living together.
[03:07:14.985 --> 03:07:22.211]  And when the predictions start coming true in terms of how technology gets used, and you made them 10, 12 years ago, you know, the record's clear.
[03:07:22.211 --> 03:07:26.594]  And it's not so much, I told you so, as it's, hey, it isn't over yet.
[03:07:26.594 --> 03:07:33.660]  You know, let's still get in the game, recognize that things that are in front of each of us, we all have a sphere of influence that we can impact.
[03:07:34.133 --> 03:07:35.954]  We just need to step into what we can do.
[03:07:35.954 --> 03:07:36.054]  Sure.
[03:07:36.054 --> 03:07:38.036]  It might be talking to our neighbors, it might be more than that.
[03:07:38.036 --> 03:07:38.196]  Sure.
[03:07:38.196 --> 03:07:43.880]  Here we go, back to the main transmission.
[03:07:43.880 --> 03:07:47.622]  Alright, Dr. Nick Baggage, EarthPulse.com is our guest.
[03:07:47.622 --> 03:07:51.305]  Get his books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[03:07:51.305 --> 03:07:54.387]  Discounted out of the gates, hope you'll order them there today.
[03:07:54.387 --> 03:07:56.728]  Support both of our works, we can continue onward.
[03:07:56.728 --> 03:08:02.813]  We were talking to Rusty here in just a moment, but I want to go back to what the last caller was saying about
[03:08:03.573 --> 03:08:05.154]  People laugh at me, they don't want to listen.
[03:08:05.154 --> 03:08:11.200]  Well, that may be your circle of friends, but I have found with the general public, most people are finally paying attention.
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:15.944]  And Dr. Begich and myself and others aren't saying, nanny nanny, boo boo, you were wrong, we were right.
[03:08:15.944 --> 03:08:18.246]  It's like, hey, it's okay, it's not too late.
[03:08:18.246 --> 03:08:20.708]  Now join us, we gotta fix things quick.
[03:08:20.708 --> 03:08:24.151]  We have a very wicked, very ruthless elite in control.
[03:08:25.132 --> 03:08:34.545]  Extremely psychopathic, very unstable, very intelligent and inbred, but very dangerous, like hybrid dogs or hybrid horses.
[03:08:34.545 --> 03:08:38.791]  They can run real fast, but they'll bite you and they're nuts.
[03:08:38.791 --> 03:08:39.932]  This is what we're facing.
[03:08:41.494 --> 03:08:45.255]  Before we go back to the calls, well, let's go to calls, but don't let me forget under baggage.
[03:08:45.255 --> 03:08:47.876]  I want to get your view on the Elites in-game.
[03:08:47.876 --> 03:08:51.697]  From their documents, from their source research, you are a big stickler on this.
[03:08:51.697 --> 03:08:53.357]  What you believe they want to build.
[03:08:53.357 --> 03:08:55.918]  What type of world they want to construct.
[03:08:55.918 --> 03:08:59.839]  When they talk about a Matrix-like grid, before you leave us.
[03:08:59.839 --> 03:09:01.680]  But right now, let's go to Rusty in Arkansas.
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:03.880]  You're on the air, Rusty.
[03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:09.302]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to first come out and say I apologize for the way my call went last Friday when I called in.
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:12.541]  And I just want to tell you, I'm sorry about that.
[03:09:12.541 --> 03:09:15.823]  I didn't mean for you to get on the rant and go the way that it went.
[03:09:15.823 --> 03:09:17.244]  Well, don't apologize for calling in, sir.
[03:09:17.244 --> 03:09:17.965]  Go ahead.
[03:09:17.965 --> 03:09:28.270]  But I'm an Info Warrior, as well as the rest of the callers, and we're out there pumping out CDs and trying to get out there and informing the public the best way we can.
[03:09:28.270 --> 03:09:34.354]  And I just want to call on all of you to remember Alex in your prayers, if you're a spiritual person.
[03:09:34.354 --> 03:09:37.375]  And all of the guests, remember them in your prayers as well.
[03:09:37.375 --> 03:09:38.176]  For your guests today,
[03:09:38.874 --> 03:09:56.008]  I just wanted to ask where he thought that the antivirus software companies might end up going due to the fact that they won't be needed with the Internet 2 and with all the Internet security software providers and everything they're out there now basically when they go to this
[03:09:58.782 --> 03:10:15.139]  Well, let me just say, even on their grids, you're still going to have viruses and things, so they're going to have more of that, and virus software companies have been caught before making the viruses, so, oh, don't worry, the viruses won't be going away, Dr. Baggage.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:16.681]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:10:16.681 --> 03:10:21.104]  In fact, most people don't know this, but I think it's going to be used in the propaganda.
[03:10:21.104 --> 03:10:34.954]  It's going to be because terrorists, and China in particular, have basically gone in and analyzed every commercial and every governmental site as far into it as even the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been hacked.
[03:10:34.954 --> 03:10:38.637]  And what a lot of people don't realize is that residing in a lot of people's software
[03:10:39.242 --> 03:10:42.403]  Our programs that can be activated.
[03:10:42.403 --> 03:10:53.707]  We develop our own software, so our engineers went through ours periodically, and we find periodically, right in the middle of it, a code that's been coded in Chinese.
[03:10:53.707 --> 03:11:00.849]  It's a table and a matrix that has not been activated, but is sleeping in our website that we have to clean out every once in a while.
[03:11:00.849 --> 03:11:04.430]  And we built safeguards now to keep them out, but the fact is,
[03:11:05.134 --> 03:11:06.916]  Most people have already been hacked.
[03:11:06.916 --> 03:11:12.681]  Most of the utilities in the country, most of the things that we rely on have been hacked through.
[03:11:12.681 --> 03:11:13.581]  Well, here's an example.
[03:11:13.581 --> 03:11:15.203]  And I think there will be a crisis.
[03:11:15.203 --> 03:11:17.485]  Well, there's economic hacking.
[03:11:17.485 --> 03:11:27.874]  Microsoft, this has all happened because they built things for their own back doors, and they built it so their NSA snoop systems can plug right in, and now that's opened them up to all the other hackers.
[03:11:28.604 --> 03:11:28.864]  Right.
[03:11:28.864 --> 03:11:33.451]  Plus, at the same time, it's a case of building that commercial information.
[03:11:33.451 --> 03:11:39.979]  I mean, knowing wherever you go is a very useful thing for commercial purposes and extremely valuable.
[03:11:39.979 --> 03:11:42.623]  Data valence, something we reported on as far back as 2000.
[03:11:43.914 --> 03:11:46.015]  In the book, Earth Rising, The Revolution.
[03:11:46.015 --> 03:11:51.017]  You know, we got into this whole concept before it was even in people's minds.
[03:11:51.017 --> 03:11:51.557]  No, no, you did.
[03:11:51.557 --> 03:11:52.537]  I remember having it on.
[03:11:52.537 --> 03:11:55.758]  Well, the British News yesterday, and it was in my stack.
[03:11:55.758 --> 03:11:59.680]  I didn't get to it, but it was on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:01.400]  So much there that isn't on the show, folks.
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:03.501]  Be sure and visit those sites.
[03:12:03.501 --> 03:12:05.822]  And right there, it said, oh, the government
[03:12:06.582 --> 03:12:13.005]  Tracks your Bluetooth, and tracks your phone, and uses it as a beacon to follow you.
[03:12:13.005 --> 03:12:24.531]  Well, that was built in to all the cell phones by international law by 2001, but see they're just now announcing that yes, they built it in, and they're tracking you.
[03:12:24.531 --> 03:12:28.273]  Yeah, and it was in those days, and it was actually laid out even further back in 1989,
[03:12:30.330 --> 03:12:33.673]  There was a document that was put together by the U.S.
[03:12:33.673 --> 03:12:45.220]  Army War College, and we talk about it all the time, and it was laying out this sort of plan for using GPS to track business travelers in case there was some conflict, they'd be able to extract them.
[03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:52.425]  And it morphed into, well, what later became cell phone technology and personal pagers, and then OnStar on your automobile.
[03:12:52.425 --> 03:12:57.789]  And, you know, now most people, I'm probably one of the few that don't carry a cell phone, you know?
[03:12:58.953 --> 03:13:05.815]  And it's not so much because of the idea of sticking a microwave next to my head and the health consequences alone.
[03:13:05.815 --> 03:13:08.016]  It's basically the whole package.
[03:13:08.016 --> 03:13:13.478]  Not only do I get unhealthy, but I'm enslaved to this device that I'm on 24-hour call.
[03:13:13.478 --> 03:13:17.619]  And then thirdly, it's the invasiveness of the invasion in your personal privacy.
[03:13:18.149 --> 03:13:19.470]  And I resent that.
[03:13:19.470 --> 03:13:21.310]  And I think it should have been safeguarded.
[03:13:21.310 --> 03:13:26.132]  And the thing about a lot of the laws is they don't, not only do they not provide safeguards, but they're civil.
[03:13:26.132 --> 03:13:29.554]  These things need to be criminal laws that nail people and put them in jail.
[03:13:29.554 --> 03:13:37.357]  You know, when a few CEOs go to jail for illegal wiretapping instead of making it legal and getting people basically clemency for whatever evil they've done.
[03:13:38.488 --> 03:13:42.269]  We need to put some people in jail over this, and then the game changes.
[03:13:42.269 --> 03:13:48.910]  And the American public is sick and tired of having our digital doors kicked in by the Nazis of the 21st century.
[03:13:48.910 --> 03:13:49.610]  I agree.
[03:13:49.610 --> 03:13:50.510]  Anything else, Rusty?
[03:13:50.510 --> 03:13:51.490]  We gotta move quicker.
[03:13:51.490 --> 03:13:51.730]  Go.
[03:13:51.730 --> 03:13:52.231]  No, that's it.
[03:13:52.231 --> 03:13:52.851]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:13:52.851 --> 03:13:53.491]  Thank you, Rusty.
[03:13:53.491 --> 03:13:54.791]  Paige in Michigan.
[03:13:54.791 --> 03:13:55.971]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:13:55.971 --> 03:13:57.131]  Welcome.
[03:13:57.131 --> 03:13:59.432]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:13:59.432 --> 03:14:05.173]  I wanted to ask Dr. Begich, because I know he works a lot with electromagnetic technologies.
[03:14:06.159 --> 03:14:11.565]  If he had ever heard about this thing called the Clark Zapper.
[03:14:11.565 --> 03:14:27.280]  Yes, Hilda Clark's device and there's she wrote a really excellent book on the subject and you know it's one of many technologies the idea of using electromagnetic fields to affect health and being able to quantify and qualify that you know there's a lot of material
[03:14:27.953 --> 03:14:28.313]  I don't
[03:14:45.069 --> 03:14:50.293]  That's used for acupuncture treatments has been very effective in treating a number of disorders.
[03:14:50.293 --> 03:14:55.738]  But these are again, these are technologies that sort of give you back your power because they're curative.
[03:14:55.738 --> 03:15:01.223]  Whereas most of the pharmaceutical industry is based on this idea of coming back for more.
[03:15:01.223 --> 03:15:05.526]  In fact, there's an excellent book, it's called Dirty Medicine, maybe out of print.
[03:15:05.526 --> 03:15:11.251]  It was published in Great Britain back in the nineties, 900 page expose on the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:15:11.673 --> 03:15:15.336]  With over, I think it was like a thousand reference sources or more.
[03:15:29.727 --> 03:15:30.247]  That is exactly right.
[03:15:30.247 --> 03:15:32.149]  And this is where people need to be careful.
[03:15:32.149 --> 03:15:33.190]  Don't look at testimonials.
[03:15:33.190 --> 03:15:34.871]  Look at real scientific evidence.
[03:15:34.871 --> 03:15:35.852]  And there's plenty of it around.
[03:15:55.515 --> 03:15:56.976]  And that's the point.
[03:15:56.976 --> 03:15:58.676]  And today, it's easy.
[03:15:58.676 --> 03:15:59.597]  We ought to be able to find it.
[03:15:59.597 --> 03:16:00.517]  We can.
[03:16:00.517 --> 03:16:02.978]  And there's a lot of medical practice.
[03:16:02.978 --> 03:16:03.898]  A simple thing.
[03:16:03.898 --> 03:16:05.679]  Artificial discs for your back.
[03:16:05.679 --> 03:16:07.479]  Just came in the United States two years ago.
[03:16:07.479 --> 03:16:10.461]  They've been done in Germany since 1983.
[03:16:10.461 --> 03:16:11.301]  And successfully.
[03:16:11.301 --> 03:16:17.783]  Where a guy working a jackhammer, getting his L1 and L2 replaced, his back working a jackhammer in ten weeks.
[03:16:17.783 --> 03:16:20.804]  But they would rather go in and cut a piece of your hip out.
[03:16:20.804 --> 03:16:22.245]  Does it cost three times as much?
[03:16:23.012 --> 03:16:28.333]  Right, and not only that, but the Germans have to post their medical procedures or total cost.
[03:16:28.333 --> 03:16:28.854]  Post them.
[03:16:28.854 --> 03:16:29.414]  They're online.
[03:16:29.414 --> 03:16:30.534]  You can actually look them up.
[03:16:30.534 --> 03:16:37.716]  And German technology is not a slouch technology, and their public health departments are very much more active than ours.
[03:16:37.716 --> 03:16:41.177]  In fact, the German public health department warned schools
[03:16:41.758 --> 03:16:46.020]  That Wi-Fi was a risk to adolescents and small children.
[03:16:46.020 --> 03:16:52.482]  And the Germans are also, years ago, said vaccines are bad for small children, they have mercury in them.
[03:16:52.482 --> 03:17:02.846]  Showing that not all the mid-level elites are bad, it's that the higher up elites know exactly what they're doing, and it's just so cold-blooded.
[03:17:02.846 --> 03:17:05.927]  And then we tell people... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:17:05.927 --> 03:17:07.628]  I was going to say the science knowledge in Germany.
[03:17:07.628 --> 03:17:11.129]  See, the average person has a little bit higher science knowledge, but they can't lie so readily.
[03:17:11.448 --> 03:17:20.435]  You know, and what people know at high school in chemistry is sufficient for them to look at a report and understand, hey, wait a minute, this doesn't make sense.
[03:17:20.435 --> 03:17:22.837]  And we've dumbed our population down.
[03:17:22.837 --> 03:17:27.841]  That's right, the Germans are real sharp, and it's hard to get stuff past them compared to us.
[03:17:27.841 --> 03:17:32.544]  Of course, in the past, we were known as the smartest and most cunning people, and now... Absolutely.
[03:17:32.544 --> 03:17:37.108]  I guess we've had it good so long, we've been under the microscope of the New World Order being brainwashed, and we've just...
[03:17:38.140 --> 03:17:41.922]  I mean, it's this built-in denial by people, denying things.
[03:17:41.922 --> 03:17:44.643]  I remember ten years ago, people saying, there's no mercury in shots.
[03:17:44.643 --> 03:17:47.944]  And I'd go, here is the handout that comes with the shot.
[03:17:47.944 --> 03:17:48.705]  Yes, it's in there.
[03:17:48.705 --> 03:17:49.825]  And they'd say, alright.
[03:17:49.825 --> 03:17:52.626]  And then the government said, okay, it's in there, but it's good for you.
[03:17:52.626 --> 03:17:54.047]  Then they said, oh, we took it out.
[03:17:54.047 --> 03:17:56.968]  Now they say, no, we never took it out, but it is good for you.
[03:17:56.968 --> 03:17:59.749]  Well, now they say it's in there, but it's bad for you.
[03:17:59.749 --> 03:18:02.771]  I mean, how many lies, Dr. Baggage, do we have to get
[03:18:03.311 --> 03:18:07.732]  Well, and you know, it is, it's unfortunately the truth, and it's time to recognize things that have corrupted.
[03:18:07.732 --> 03:18:13.074]  And when you start to look at all these issues combined, I mean, I still think Americans
[03:18:25.185 --> 03:18:31.228]  You generate some pretty creative people, and some of the most outstanding, it's interesting, are homeschooled.
[03:18:31.228 --> 03:18:41.012]  Which is, you know, as a past president of a teacher's organization, I'm one of, I am the only one that I know of that was president of a statewide teacher's organization that supports homeschooling nationally.
[03:18:41.012 --> 03:18:43.613]  And the reason I do is because it works.
[03:18:43.613 --> 03:18:45.654]  And it works very, very effectively.
[03:18:45.654 --> 03:18:52.457]  And the things that, the way we used to teach and educate, it was about reading, about studying, and about mentoring.
[03:18:53.352 --> 03:18:59.175]  Now it's about script reading and propaganda, and this is where homeschooling and public schooling differs.
[03:18:59.175 --> 03:19:00.795]  All these things do link together.
[03:19:00.795 --> 03:19:02.856]  It's one big package.
[03:19:02.856 --> 03:19:07.919]  We're going to skip this break to continue getting through the calls, then I'm going to ask the big question to Dr. Begich.
[03:19:07.919 --> 03:19:08.959]  What is the endgame?
[03:19:08.959 --> 03:19:12.881]  If the globalists win, if this unified, technocratic elite
[03:19:13.641 --> 03:19:15.242]  Funded by the private central banks.
[03:19:15.242 --> 03:19:16.882]  Has their way.
[03:19:16.882 --> 03:19:17.923]  What will it look like?
[03:19:17.923 --> 03:19:21.264]  What are we facing in the short, medium, and long term?
[03:19:21.264 --> 03:19:23.264]  EarthPulse.com is his website.
[03:19:23.264 --> 03:19:27.026]  Stay with us.
[03:19:27.026 --> 03:19:29.447]  Okay, Doc, let me ask you in front of all the internet listeners.
[03:19:29.447 --> 03:19:33.688]  I know we had you until the bottom of the hour, but I want to... This is so interesting.
[03:19:33.688 --> 03:19:35.069]  We've got to do this more often.
[03:19:35.069 --> 03:19:36.429]  We're just both so busy.
[03:19:36.429 --> 03:19:40.490]  I want to go ahead and keep you to the end of the show, which is in about 35 minutes.
[03:19:40.490 --> 03:19:41.651]  If you can't do it, that's okay.
[03:19:42.605 --> 03:19:49.149]  Just, um, if we can just give me about 5 to 12, because I've got to change and run to a meeting at 12.30, but that would be fine.
[03:19:49.149 --> 03:19:51.110]  Okay, so... So, 5 until the hour, we can go until then.
[03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.530]  That's fine.
[03:19:51.530 --> 03:19:53.991]  In fact, I'll let you get out of here at 51 after.
[03:19:53.991 --> 03:19:54.992]  Alright, that's perfect.
[03:19:54.992 --> 03:19:57.113]  That must be one of the breaks that we keep missing.
[03:19:57.113 --> 03:20:02.176]  Yeah, so you're saying, I mean, as long as you're gone by the last 5 minutes, you're fine.
[03:20:02.176 --> 03:20:03.577]  I'm good, yeah.
[03:20:03.577 --> 03:20:05.638]  So, you're good until 51 after this hour?
[03:20:06.431 --> 03:20:06.992]  That's good.
[03:20:06.992 --> 03:20:07.672]  Good, good.
[03:20:07.672 --> 03:20:11.817]  Okay, let's continue so we don't waste the time we've got.
[03:20:11.817 --> 03:20:12.738]  Go ahead.
[03:20:12.738 --> 03:20:29.035]  You know, when you start to look at all of this as it connects together, you know, when you think about education as an example, some of the technologies that are out there that could accelerate the educational process in some pretty dramatic ways, in terms of being able to retain information, being able to use that information more creatively, and yet
[03:20:29.642 --> 03:20:34.864]  These technologies stay on the shelf for 20-30 years before public education ever gets a grip of them.
[03:20:34.864 --> 03:20:54.613]  In the case of attention deficit disorders, as an example, there are technologies today that in 80% of the children that have used them, within 30-45 days they can be taken off of all their psychoactive drugs, their brain capacity in terms of being able to moderate their brain activity into the range where you're ideally suited for intellectual learning.
[03:20:55.228 --> 03:20:56.508]  Yeah, Alex, can you hear me okay?
[03:20:56.508 --> 03:20:56.708]  Okay, I was
[03:21:24.642 --> 03:21:33.248]  Lookin' on C-SPAN, and I was gonna tape this thing, and it had EPA on there, and, uh, had three of them.
[03:21:33.248 --> 03:21:44.357]  Two EPAs types, and another Independent, and, uh, they swore him in, and then they gave their opening statements.
[03:21:44.357 --> 03:21:54.104]  Well, the Independent, and I call him the whistleblower, he was about to, he was about to spill the beans on the whole thing, and C-SPAN cut him off.
[03:21:54.690 --> 03:21:58.813]  Right in the middle of his testimony and went to another program.
[03:21:58.813 --> 03:22:00.134]  His own global warming.
[03:22:22.017 --> 03:22:24.377]  It was a Senate committee investigation.
[03:22:24.377 --> 03:22:34.219]  They were going to have a testimony, and then they were going to tell the Senate what they needed to do to fix it.
[03:22:34.219 --> 03:22:35.659]  Well, let me bring this up.
[03:22:35.659 --> 03:22:50.542]  The guy's name is Roy Spencer, and he's a former senior climate scientist, former NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.
[03:22:51.656 --> 03:22:53.537]  And his name is Roy Spencer.
[03:22:53.537 --> 03:22:58.319]  Sounded like a good guy you need to get in touch with and get him on the program.
[03:22:58.319 --> 03:23:00.419]  And did it say where he was from or who he's with now?
[03:23:00.419 --> 03:23:06.242]  Because he's a former senior climate... Scientist.
[03:23:06.242 --> 03:23:09.243]  Scientist at the Marshall Space Center?
[03:23:09.243 --> 03:23:10.503]  Well, yeah.
[03:23:10.503 --> 03:23:12.344]  N.A.S.A.
[03:23:12.344 --> 03:23:14.225]  Marshall Space Flight Center.
[03:23:15.290 --> 03:23:17.092]  I don't understand all that.
[03:23:17.092 --> 03:23:19.754]  Sure, let me bring this up to Dr. Begich.
[03:23:19.754 --> 03:23:37.728]  One of the top climatologists who studies carbon load in Australia has come out and said he was wrong and bullied into saying it was man-made, that it's not man-made, that they have a huge exodus of top scientists saying that it's not man-made and that it's natural.
[03:23:37.728 --> 03:23:39.309]  Dr. Begich, that's going to be a problem.
[03:23:39.309 --> 03:23:40.771]  Well, we're coming back to the live program.
[03:23:40.771 --> 03:23:41.031]  Here we go.
[03:23:46.152 --> 03:23:47.813]  We were just talking to J.D.
[03:23:47.813 --> 03:23:55.077]  in Texas about C-SPAN cutting off a climatologist, formerly with NASA.
[03:23:55.077 --> 03:23:59.139]  Dr. Begich, they have top rocket scientists, top climatologists.
[03:23:59.139 --> 03:24:03.681]  I mean, every day they're going public saying it's all fraud, it's lies.
[03:24:03.681 --> 03:24:05.882]  People who they claim had signed on to U.N.
[03:24:05.882 --> 03:24:07.884]  agreements are saying it's all lies.
[03:24:07.884 --> 03:24:08.764]  They're in trouble.
[03:24:08.764 --> 03:24:10.465]  I mean, their little hoax is in trouble.
[03:24:11.294 --> 03:24:14.655]  Well, you know, the biggest contributors are not man.
[03:24:14.655 --> 03:24:17.356]  Man contributes less than 1%.
[03:24:17.356 --> 03:24:17.976]  It's nature.
[03:24:17.976 --> 03:24:26.778]  You know, right now we have two volcanoes going off in Alaska that are producing more than man's producing at any given moment, I can assure you, on this planet.
[03:24:26.778 --> 03:24:39.621]  When you start to look at the real releases, you know, methane gas, which is a big contributor, 20 times more than CO2, and methane is being released because of natural climate change here in the Arctic.
[03:24:40.071 --> 03:25:01.945]  We have permafrost across the Arctic regions of Alaska, Russia, Canada, and the permafrost is like 100,000 years of soil that hasn't had a chance to fully degrade, of organic matter that is now degrading and releasing methane 20 times more potent, and that is actually accelerating the cycle, but it's a natural cycle.
[03:25:01.945 --> 03:25:05.708]  It happens from time to time, and people don't recognize it as such.
[03:25:06.161 --> 03:25:09.122]  There are other contributing factors for climate change.
[03:25:09.122 --> 03:25:12.282]  Pole shift, which happens fairly regularly geologically.
[03:25:12.282 --> 03:25:18.964]  The last time it happened was 15,000 years ago, which correlates to the last ice age.
[03:25:18.964 --> 03:25:29.166]  It's starting to end, and when you start to look at all these things together, and we do in our videos and books, we analyze a lot of this, and the reality is nature is doing it.
[03:25:29.166 --> 03:25:32.987]  Well, that's why I had one of the Rothschilds on, the guy pushing
[03:25:34.011 --> 03:25:40.407]  All this stuff, and I brought up, well why is the, why are the ice caps melting on Mars?
[03:25:40.407 --> 03:25:40.527]  And...
[03:25:41.599 --> 03:26:04.632]  He just said because Mars is closer to the sun than Earth and I said no it's not and he just laughed knowing that the average American is so dumbed down they're just going to believe him and then I was debating another one of these guys on air and he just said there are no ice caps on Mars and I was like you know there's ice caps they just don't care they they are counting on people being dumbed down and that's a great insult to people.
[03:26:05.454 --> 03:26:06.475]  You know, and it is.
[03:26:06.475 --> 03:26:09.657]  And it's the system that, you know, and scientists are very elite.
[03:26:09.657 --> 03:26:11.438]  You know, you think there's a lot of competition in business.
[03:26:11.438 --> 03:26:14.219]  You've not seen anything until you've met scientists.
[03:26:14.219 --> 03:26:17.761]  And these guys are ruthless.
[03:26:17.761 --> 03:26:20.503]  And in terms of how they behave towards one another.
[03:26:20.503 --> 03:26:21.964]  And it's amazing.
[03:26:21.964 --> 03:26:29.909]  And yet, they claim almost like it's... If you challenge them outside of their discipline, they're supposed to be an expert in everything.
[03:26:29.909 --> 03:26:30.509]  And nobody is.
[03:26:30.509 --> 03:26:31.149]  None of us are.
[03:26:31.149 --> 03:26:32.070]  And the fact is,
[03:26:32.905 --> 03:27:01.737]  Even Ben Eason, we first were dealing with Ben, you know, he and I, we had a good rapport and we've always, we're always friends up until his death, but he started to, he listened, you know, he looked at what we raised and he analyzed that and then he actually started talking about activists not being ignored but actually being listened to because people can get educated outside of their discipline and this is where the arrogance of so much science and the expectation that the average person won't ask the questions and science feels like
[03:27:02.321 --> 03:27:10.523]  Somehow they're above the challenge, and they should be challenged just as vigorously as anyone else, whether you're in politics, business, or the arts.
[03:27:10.523 --> 03:27:19.525]  Well, I agree, but bottom line, the message is the ice caps and the ice moons of Jupiter and Saturn are not melting because of SUVs.
[03:27:19.525 --> 03:27:22.746]  That's right, and it is reality, and they know it.
[03:27:23.186 --> 03:27:27.469]  And they've monitored it, and all of that tells us, again, it's the solar cycle.
[03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:30.392]  And there's many, many scientists saying this today.
[03:27:30.392 --> 03:27:37.377]  And now they want to tax on carbon dioxide, that is one of the four ingredients of life.
[03:27:37.377 --> 03:27:39.799]  Light, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.
[03:27:40.259 --> 03:27:43.002]  Gotta have those four things or you don't have life on this planet.
[03:27:43.002 --> 03:27:51.952]  But by being able to tax one of the key, basic factors of life, that gives the private banks total control.
[03:27:51.952 --> 03:27:56.797]  And think of the boldness, the arrogance of brainwashing for decades about the environment
[03:27:57.538 --> 03:28:05.301]  It hijacks any real environmental concerns of the cross-species engineering and the toxic waste dumping and rainforest chopping.
[03:28:05.301 --> 03:28:12.404]  All accelerates, but we all feel good and tax our evil carbon that the rainforest breathes.
[03:28:12.404 --> 03:28:20.927]  It is just so diabolical to see it and then they, as I told people they would do, as I read it in Think Tank documents, then they announced six months ago
[03:28:21.607 --> 03:28:27.670]  You're going to buy your carbon credit from the private central banks, making them the government.
[03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:30.152]  Let's go to another call and we'll go into break with J.D.
[03:28:30.152 --> 03:28:31.112]  in Texas.
[03:28:31.112 --> 03:28:34.294]  J.D., you're on the air with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[03:28:34.294 --> 03:28:40.858]  Yeah, Alex, I told you about the Roy Spencer.
[03:28:40.858 --> 03:28:42.098]  Yes, you were just telling me about that.
[03:28:42.098 --> 03:28:43.279]  You want to finish up?
[03:28:43.279 --> 03:28:44.660]  I got some more information.
[03:28:44.660 --> 03:28:50.423]  He's a University of Alabama principal research scientist.
[03:28:52.619 --> 03:28:54.040]  You know, I think we may have interviewed him.
[03:28:54.040 --> 03:28:55.580]  Okay, thank you so much.
[03:28:55.580 --> 03:28:59.362]  We're going to go to break, talk behind the scenes with Dr. Nick Baggage, take more of your calls.
[03:28:59.362 --> 03:29:04.324]  Again, behind the scenes means PrisonPlanet.tv viewers are watching us live on TV.
[03:29:04.324 --> 03:29:07.145]  We'll still be live behind the scenes during this break.
[03:29:07.145 --> 03:29:09.306]  And then for internet streams, we're going to keep talking.
[03:29:09.306 --> 03:29:11.006]  For everybody else, we'll be right back.
[03:29:11.006 --> 03:29:13.427]  I don't want to waste any time with guests like Dr. Nick Baggage.
[03:29:13.427 --> 03:29:15.308]  Go to InfoWars.com to listen right now.
[03:29:17.398 --> 03:29:18.438]  Okay, thank you.
[03:29:18.438 --> 03:29:21.439]  University of Alabama, Roy Spencer.
[03:29:21.439 --> 03:29:26.001]  So I'll have to check in to him and we'll see about getting him on.
[03:29:26.001 --> 03:29:31.463]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jonas in Canada.
[03:29:31.463 --> 03:29:32.163]  You're on the air.
[03:29:32.163 --> 03:29:34.244]  Welcome.
[03:29:34.244 --> 03:29:35.084]  Welcome.
[03:29:35.084 --> 03:29:35.704]  Can you hear me?
[03:29:35.704 --> 03:29:36.805]  Yes, I can.
[03:29:36.805 --> 03:29:38.105]  Okay.
[03:29:38.105 --> 03:29:41.426]  Hey, I watched your documentary, The End Game.
[03:29:41.426 --> 03:29:42.767]  I'm here from Montreal, Quebec.
[03:29:42.767 --> 03:29:43.407]  It's amazing.
[03:29:44.019 --> 03:29:44.660]  That's amazing.
[03:29:44.660 --> 03:29:48.523]  I've never seen a documentary like this in my life.
[03:29:48.523 --> 03:29:57.551]  And may Jesus bless you for this work, because this is the information I was looking and investigating for years.
[03:29:57.551 --> 03:29:58.912]  I wanted this information.
[03:29:58.912 --> 03:30:01.094]  Now I have the truth.
[03:30:01.094 --> 03:30:09.682]  Well, as an evangelist, my job is to save souls and to do the same work as you do to awaken, you know, those who are sleeping.
[03:30:10.782 --> 03:30:13.710]  You know, the churches here are sleeping.
[03:30:13.710 --> 03:30:16.497]  You know, they don't seem to see this evil in front of them.
[03:30:16.497 --> 03:30:18.021]  And I see it, you know, very well.
[03:30:19.191 --> 03:30:21.072]  Yes sir, you're on air.
[03:30:21.072 --> 03:30:24.134]  What do you think about the issues that we've been discussing?
[03:30:24.134 --> 03:30:25.975]  Do you have any comments for Dr. Nick Begich?
[03:30:25.975 --> 03:30:43.644]  I'm going to come back when we finish a few calls and we are going to, for the rest of the audience, talk about what he believes their endgame is, what drives the New World Order, what their master plan is, what this great work is they're building, how they want to build a world government to reduce our population.
[03:30:43.644 --> 03:30:44.985]  I mean, that's their stated goal, but I want to get
[03:30:45.345 --> 03:30:46.506]  Yeah, I have another question.
[03:30:46.506 --> 03:30:48.427]  In Quebec, I want you to explain to me.
[03:30:48.427 --> 03:30:48.747]  Okay?
[03:30:48.747 --> 03:30:49.127]  Hello?
[03:30:49.127 --> 03:30:49.748]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:30:49.748 --> 03:30:49.928]  Okay.
[03:30:49.928 --> 03:30:57.413]  Okay, there's a new driver's license in December is coming here.
[03:30:57.413 --> 03:30:57.553]  Okay?
[03:31:14.544 --> 03:31:24.852]  It says all Quebecers will have to choose between a traditional driver's license and another one with a microchip called RFID.
[03:31:24.852 --> 03:31:28.355]  Can you explain to me what is RFID?
[03:31:28.355 --> 03:31:30.877]  Radio Frequency Identification Devices.
[03:31:30.877 --> 03:31:33.659]  They can track everywhere you're going and what you're doing.
[03:31:33.659 --> 03:31:34.540]  And this is how they're doing it.
[03:31:34.540 --> 03:31:35.361]  They're phasing it in.
[03:31:35.361 --> 03:31:36.541]  You have to have it with a U.S.
[03:31:36.541 --> 03:31:37.302]  passport now.
[03:31:37.302 --> 03:31:38.243]  The new passports have it.
[03:31:39.964 --> 03:31:43.025]  It is going into all the driver's licenses here and you don't have a choice.
[03:31:43.025 --> 03:31:48.467]  In some areas of the world, they are saying you have a choice for a few years, but then no one has a choice.
[03:31:48.467 --> 03:31:58.170]  It destroys any privacy, allows thieves to steal it, but that's designed to cause greater identity theft, and then they come in with more regulation and more control.
[03:31:58.170 --> 03:31:59.831]  Let me get Dr. Begich's comment on that.
[03:31:59.831 --> 03:32:00.371]  Thanks for the call.
[03:32:01.367 --> 03:32:02.008]  Absolutely.
[03:32:02.008 --> 03:32:12.417]  In fact, RFID, first they said you couldn't read them except right up close, and the fact is from two kilometers away you can read them, and that was announced a couple years ago.
[03:32:12.417 --> 03:32:24.288]  And the idea of density, the amount of information stored on one of these and the miniaturization of them on a nanoscale is happening at such a tremendous rate as things get smaller and information density gets bigger.
[03:32:24.793 --> 03:32:29.555]  The amount of information on that little microcircuit about you becomes significant.
[03:32:29.555 --> 03:32:37.578]  And the fact that, because it's technology-based, readers will be decoded like every cell phone secret is and every internet... They've already caught him doing it!
[03:32:37.578 --> 03:32:38.898]  Here we go to the main audience.
[03:32:38.898 --> 03:32:39.158]  Here we go.
[03:32:52.574 --> 03:33:06.232]  I remember about six years ago it was in the San Francisco Chronicle that the instant pay toll road RFID stickers they were putting on their cars, the feds had paid for a grant all over the city.
[03:33:07.213 --> 03:33:09.934]  To track you by your name and by your vehicle everywhere you went.
[03:33:09.934 --> 03:33:18.279]  That was going in a database and now with TexasTag and KTag and Securitag and all these companies are tracking everywhere you go, your cell phone.
[03:33:18.279 --> 03:33:20.540]  The caller was asking about RFID.
[03:33:20.540 --> 03:33:23.182]  Dr. Begich, break down RFID for us.
[03:33:23.182 --> 03:33:32.787]  Yeah, this is again, you know, instead of a barcode which was unique, say of an item or a product, RFID is unique information about that specific
[03:33:33.366 --> 03:33:33.646]  I don't.
[03:33:50.346 --> 03:33:54.189]  An insurance company could use it in terms of tracking you coming in.
[03:33:54.189 --> 03:34:01.193]  They would also know the whole history of all those goods to know if you were engaging in what's going to be totally illegal.
[03:34:01.193 --> 03:34:04.516]  In fact, they're about to pass a law that also will shut down shopping carts.
[03:34:04.516 --> 03:34:18.325]  You have to report on yourself in real time to the feds through the merchant accounts and they're saying that barter and swap meets and that it will be a federal felony offense to have even garage sales.
[03:34:18.325 --> 03:34:18.605]  Go ahead.
[03:34:19.431 --> 03:34:35.679]  You know, when you want to talk about the predictions, this is about the most directed and controlled society ever envisioned, or at least ever envisioned since the book of Revelations and the revelation of John on the island of Patmos.
[03:34:35.679 --> 03:34:47.065]  You know, the fact is, it's about total, absolute control over what you do, where you go, whether you buy, whether you sell, whether you're part of the system or excluded from it.
[03:34:49.215 --> 03:34:51.636]  That is a significant transfer of power.
[03:34:51.636 --> 03:34:56.799]  And by the way, you wrote 10-12 years ago about all this and said it would be used in a predatory fashion.
[03:34:56.799 --> 03:34:58.040]  Everything you said has come true.
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:34:59.961]  In fact, I remember reading your stuff a decade ago.
[03:34:59.961 --> 03:35:05.884]  It's worse than what you said because I know you knew it was worse, but you held back just to be credible.
[03:35:05.884 --> 03:35:10.707]  And now you have an institute up that just studies all of this with some folks involved in the lay fortune.
[03:35:11.147 --> 03:35:24.839]  So a lot of serious people are really concerned about all this, but when you go to RFID conferences or you read their minutes that are on the web, they say, this is predatory, this is to control, this is a defense department directive.
[03:35:24.839 --> 03:35:31.044]  This whole grid going in, you want to explain to people that it isn't just us saying this has bad uses.
[03:35:31.044 --> 03:35:35.488]  We're told it has some everyday commercial use, but that's only to fund it.
[03:35:36.248 --> 03:35:36.989]  They're very smart.
[03:35:36.989 --> 03:35:38.670]  They fund it through the free market.
[03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:40.731]  They have us pay for our own enslavement.
[03:35:40.731 --> 03:35:44.253]  They admit it's diabolical.
[03:35:44.253 --> 03:35:46.454]  You know, and it's the tagging of the individual.
[03:35:46.454 --> 03:35:47.655]  You already have a number.
[03:35:47.655 --> 03:35:52.577]  Your social security number tags you to everything you do and is supposed to be safeguarded.
[03:35:52.577 --> 03:35:54.438]  You have other identifiers.
[03:35:54.438 --> 03:36:02.363]  And when you look at the data banks, the groups that have lost data and got nailed for it, or groups we reported on before anybody even knew their names,
[03:36:02.850 --> 03:36:13.316]  Because they had DOD, Department of Defense, contracts to develop that data, and they were looking at ways to create, sort of from cradle to grave, the whole profile of the individual.
[03:36:13.316 --> 03:36:22.201]  And a couple of these programs got shut down in the 90s, and then renamed and relabeled and regurgitated right back at us.
[03:36:22.771 --> 03:36:37.741]  And this is the problem is these long-standing bureaucracies that hide behind privacy as national security and in fact are working against every one of our security by using this system of government to corrupt the very systems that should be protecting us.
[03:36:37.741 --> 03:36:52.591]  The idea of a totally controlled financial institution as people are looked at as consumers and taxpayers as just contributors in that way and it is an elite attitude because the best in science, the best in religion, the best
[03:36:53.044 --> 03:36:57.885]  And everything that we do came from the mavericks that stood out that weren't part of some elite.
[03:36:57.885 --> 03:37:05.587]  Whether you look at the airplane, microcomputers, the best things that affect us in the most profound way happened by you and me.
[03:37:05.587 --> 03:37:08.007]  Average people who saw things just a little bit differently.
[03:37:08.007 --> 03:37:08.627]  Well that's it.
[03:37:08.627 --> 03:37:15.189]  The elites always, when they get full control, create stagnant dark ages and persecute
[03:37:16.391 --> 03:37:16.751]  We're good to go.
[03:37:42.563 --> 03:37:51.851]  Who the elite are, what they planned on building, this high-tech police state, the plans to reduce our numbers forcibly, controlled bioweapon releases.
[03:37:51.851 --> 03:37:59.097]  I mean, break down what, from the evidence you have, what their in-game goals are and what we're facing if we don't fight back.
[03:37:59.097 --> 03:38:00.278]  Well, I think it's two things.
[03:38:00.278 --> 03:38:04.622]  You know, when you really look at it, sort of what works against us and what works in their favor.
[03:38:04.622 --> 03:38:11.027]  And there's only a certain level they want the populations to be driven down to, because they lose too if it all collapses.
[03:38:11.721 --> 03:38:12.942]  So you need to control it.
[03:38:12.942 --> 03:38:14.904]  You need to actually manipulate it.
[03:38:14.904 --> 03:38:17.387]  Whether liberal or conservative, it doesn't really matter.
[03:38:17.387 --> 03:38:25.976]  It's a different rationale for control, but the rationale is still there, and it's exploited by the same organizations that are behind the scenes.
[03:38:25.976 --> 03:38:28.959]  It's the global corporations, predominantly.
[03:38:31.005 --> 03:38:50.404]  Once the founders die, our soulless creatures that live forever, that exist on a foundation of greed, you need to reshape sort of that and build into it the kind of safeguards that hold people accountable, not just in government, but within corporations when they can have such a huge impact on human populations as they do.
[03:38:50.404 --> 03:38:52.826]  When you look at reduced populations as a big issue,
[03:38:53.556 --> 03:39:02.183]  You see it, but you know the real official population is so understated because in the third world, the cost of a birth certificate is more than a week's wages and most people don't even have them.
[03:39:02.183 --> 03:39:04.045]  They're born in their homes.
[03:39:04.045 --> 03:39:09.890]  So the unofficial population is probably 50% more than what we hear officially reported.
[03:39:09.890 --> 03:39:21.379]  And when you look at disease, disorder, and the price of food alone, and how many people will die in the next decade, just because food, although the third world is emerging, they'll be starving.
[03:39:21.379 --> 03:39:22.400]  And you're already seeing it
[03:39:22.813 --> 03:39:27.216]  Food riots that aren't reported on the mainstream media, imagine that in this country.
[03:39:27.216 --> 03:39:33.620]  And here's what someone said to me, and they're talking about how horrible it's going to be in the U.S., and, you know, they're giving this Armageddon picture.
[03:39:33.620 --> 03:39:39.463]  For somebody living in the suburbs of Bombay, Armageddon already happened, and they're living the experience.
[03:39:39.463 --> 03:39:49.389]  And we need to recognize that on this planet, we are going to be subjected to that same Armageddon, or we're going to avoid it, based upon how we use our judgment.
[03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:52.631]  The responsibility of having this economy rests with every one of us.
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:40:01.565]  The responsibility of doing the right things with our economy and our government rests with every one of us, not with elites from somewhere else with no national identity.
[03:40:01.565 --> 03:40:17.576]  We need to take back our government, our natural resources, and make sure they're working in the interest of the populations that live in this country, in this sovereign country, and at the same time be a light to the rest of the world as was originally intended, not a dictator to the rest of the world.
[03:40:17.576 --> 03:40:19.377]  Well, I agree with you, Dr. Baggage.
[03:40:19.377 --> 03:40:22.319]  I want to take a few final calls here before you have to leave us, but
[03:40:25.762 --> 03:40:36.468]  There is a debate within the elite, and I mention this every few days because it's such a big deal, that local Texas papers reported what I've witnessed and what I know you've witnessed being all over the world.
[03:40:36.468 --> 03:40:47.335]  This anti-humanism, this teaching us to be guilty about our own life, that is only the elite training us to take away our life force instinct, our survival instinct
[03:40:47.955 --> 03:40:55.320]  To create some type of psychological love affair with death.
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:02.005]  That is only the elite wanting to basically remove our propulsion system from society.
[03:41:02.005 --> 03:41:04.767]  What propels humanity forward
[03:41:05.728 --> 03:41:13.915]  They're trying to destroy and teach us to basically hate ourselves, and so you have a debate between the elite.
[03:41:13.915 --> 03:41:21.782]  A minority only believes that half of us should be killed, and they say phase that in, one-shot policies, euthanasia.
[03:41:22.683 --> 03:41:31.331]  The majority say 80% need to be killed and that bioweapons need to be released and they have to have a global police state to do that in orderly fashion.
[03:41:31.331 --> 03:41:37.857]  They need to have smaller bioweapon releases to test covering it up and test how it spreads and to prepare larger releases.
[03:41:38.698 --> 03:41:52.467]  But then, now it's radicalizing where the largest minority of elitists and their minions say 90% need to die, with another subset minority that's growing saying all humans need to be killed.
[03:41:52.467 --> 03:42:03.034]  And then these people, you will notice who are even talking like this on their own websites, graduate students, doctorates, are working in bioweapon labs and bioweapon lab related systems
[03:42:04.174 --> 03:42:08.938]  And the government is recruiting them to work in the facilities.
[03:42:08.938 --> 03:42:12.580]  I mean, this is a mega threat.
[03:42:12.580 --> 03:42:25.349]  And I put out calls for this, and basically my listeners demanded it, and the FBI did go visit some of the UT professors and others that were calling for the death of 90% of us who were connected to bioweapons production.
[03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:31.334]  But still, they should be removed from their positions near bioweapons and weaponized agents.
[03:42:31.334 --> 03:42:32.555]  Can you comment on that?
[03:42:33.408 --> 03:42:34.749]  You know, I would agree with you.
[03:42:34.749 --> 03:42:40.134]  Anyone who makes those kind of statements obviously shouldn't be developing those kinds of systems.
[03:42:40.134 --> 03:42:45.359]  The thing about global population, that's another fallacy in my mind.
[03:42:45.359 --> 03:42:49.183]  When you look at global populations and the true resources of the world,
[03:42:49.761 --> 03:42:51.322]  There are sufficient resources.
[03:42:51.322 --> 03:42:53.243]  And this is the biggest secret.
[03:42:53.243 --> 03:42:56.985]  I'm not talking about everybody going back... We need to build ocean cities!
[03:42:56.985 --> 03:43:03.568]  Ocean cities very cheaply, inexpensively, off the coastlines that will become huge natural reefs and then mine the reefs.
[03:43:03.568 --> 03:43:04.168]  Exactly!
[03:43:04.168 --> 03:43:09.251]  And we have the opportunity to solve all of these problems.
[03:43:09.251 --> 03:43:12.413]  But again, it's about denying really what we are.
[03:43:12.413 --> 03:43:15.494]  You know, we're created in the image of the Creator.
[03:43:15.494 --> 03:43:16.595]  Many of us believe that.
[03:43:16.595 --> 03:43:18.956]  And that means we have an access point
[03:43:19.437 --> 03:43:34.204]  That scares the hell out of the elite, because if we were fully actualized as human beings, if we were fully manifesting the gifts of the spirit, which have been documented in science in many, many ways, then, you know, and that is really where the fear is on their side.
[03:43:34.204 --> 03:43:41.167]  You know, when we talk about all these issues, the best way to keep people from reaching those high latitudes is by fear.
[03:43:41.167 --> 03:43:42.168]  Fear raises your
[03:43:43.290 --> 03:43:49.793]  Your brain activity into the high beta ranges where you cannot reach these higher states of creative consciousness.
[03:43:49.793 --> 03:44:03.779]  Where we are in our most creative states, our most intellectual places, where artists thrive, where the painter thrives, where the politician thrives when they're doing the right work, where the person has that sense of who they are, it happens at a different
[03:44:04.201 --> 03:44:06.823]  ...brain frequency that cannot be realized.
[03:44:06.823 --> 03:44:11.445]  Let me say it again, if you're in a state of fear... They are knocking out... ...that's what the government perpetuates.
[03:44:11.445 --> 03:44:16.829]  They are knocking out our sense of purpose and our sense of building the species.
[03:44:16.829 --> 03:44:22.472]  Because let's face it, our lives are twinklings of an eye, but the species goes on forever.
[03:44:22.472 --> 03:44:23.072]  You understand?
[03:44:23.072 --> 03:44:25.574]  And so that's why you have this eternal feeling.
[03:44:25.574 --> 03:44:28.616]  That's why you love nostalgia and love thinking about your ancestors.
[03:44:29.522 --> 03:44:35.903]  Because we all realize that we live on, even if you don't believe in the spirit, we live on through the species.
[03:44:35.903 --> 03:44:37.924]  My ancestors live on through me.
[03:44:37.924 --> 03:44:40.744]  My progeny, I will live on through them.
[03:44:40.744 --> 03:44:51.587]  And I really think about my great-great-grandchildren, when we've terraformed Mars, when we beat the New World Order, when we're going out to Alpha Centauri, I actually get excited
[03:44:52.327 --> 03:45:05.916]  Thinking about them and all the wonders they're going to see, and I want to beat the New World Order even if I get killed, because I literally have a passion for my progeny, and that just doesn't mean my flesh and blood, but all of us, the same genetic code.
[03:45:05.916 --> 03:45:19.025]  We are magical, powerful, dynamic creatures, and the globalists are jealous, envious, hoarding, greedy little bastards who are, you're right, who are trying to hoard this for themselves, and they say it.
[03:45:19.025 --> 03:45:21.367]  They say, we're going into the future, you're not.
[03:45:21.707 --> 03:45:25.348]  And folks need to know that they're trying to damn us off from the future.
[03:45:25.348 --> 03:45:28.769]  And this is the fight we're facing.
[03:45:28.769 --> 03:45:37.311]  You know, when you look at all of it, when you look at it in the backdrop, again, of what's possible, and that's what all of the research and technology tells me all the horrible things.
[03:45:37.311 --> 03:45:46.794]  And in the mind control area, the thing that the government discovered that scared the heck out of them was when they started unraveling the fact that human beings have all these latent potentials
[03:45:47.338 --> 03:45:53.722]  I mean, can you imagine the average person being able to look through government and see what is hidden in those dark places?
[03:45:53.722 --> 03:45:58.105]  There'd be a lot of people gnashing their teeth in that scenario.
[03:45:58.105 --> 03:46:01.187]  And the fact of the matter is, we do have those capabilities.
[03:46:01.187 --> 03:46:02.468]  They documented them.
[03:46:02.468 --> 03:46:07.752]  The fact is, artificially within the lab, it's been created where you can actually see that play out.
[03:46:07.752 --> 03:46:12.355]  It's just as bizarre as 500 years ago, the average person being able to read a book.
[03:46:13.218 --> 03:46:20.320]  You know, the fact is, science is doubling from the invention of the wheel to where we are at the moment every nine to ten months.
[03:46:20.320 --> 03:46:23.221]  The possibilities are also doubling.
[03:46:23.221 --> 03:46:25.442]  And it's a case of re-looking at it.
[03:46:25.442 --> 03:46:35.125]  You know, keep the internet free, which is where we started this today, because that is an opportunity to exchange ideas where the guy in the bicycle shop invents the next airplane.
[03:46:35.578 --> 03:46:39.779]  You know, the guy in the garage invents the next microcomputer, as an example.
[03:46:39.779 --> 03:46:45.261]  You know, these are things that are possible today like no other time in history, and they're being taken from us.
[03:46:45.261 --> 03:46:45.821]  I agree.
[03:46:45.821 --> 03:46:47.362]  Because of the fear of the elite.
[03:46:47.362 --> 03:46:50.743]  Because they fear the average man, the average woman on this planet.
[03:46:50.743 --> 03:46:52.723]  They want to hoard their control!
[03:46:52.723 --> 03:46:58.565]  And they're blocking developments and systems that could give them life extension, that could give them so much.
[03:46:58.565 --> 03:47:00.085]  Their greed is only hurting them.
[03:47:00.085 --> 03:47:01.306]  Let's take a few final calls.
[03:47:02.106 --> 03:47:04.827]  And for TV viewers, this is a salacious crumb.
[03:47:04.827 --> 03:47:11.170]  I was joking about how he looked like David Rockefeller, so Burmess ordered me one off eBay and he just came in and gave it to me.
[03:47:11.170 --> 03:47:12.450]  That's David Rockefeller.
[03:47:12.450 --> 03:47:12.990]  You're laughing.
[03:47:12.990 --> 03:47:14.951]  You know who Salacious Crumb is?
[03:47:14.951 --> 03:47:15.931]  No.
[03:47:15.931 --> 03:47:18.873]  You know that creature that Jabba the Hutt's little pet?
[03:47:18.873 --> 03:47:20.193]  Okay, okay.
[03:47:20.193 --> 03:47:21.634]  David Rockefeller.
[03:47:21.634 --> 03:47:24.015]  David Rockefeller is in studio today.
[03:47:24.015 --> 03:47:25.495]  A little bit of fun here.
[03:47:25.495 --> 03:47:29.497]  Let's go ahead and talk to Archangel from Pittsburgh, PA.
[03:47:29.497 --> 03:47:29.817]  Go ahead.
[03:47:32.995 --> 03:47:34.455]  Come in, Archangel.
[03:47:34.455 --> 03:47:36.156]  Alex, Dr. Begich, how are you doing?
[03:47:36.156 --> 03:47:36.436]  Good.
[03:47:36.436 --> 03:47:37.396]  Good, thanks.
[03:47:37.396 --> 03:47:41.616]  Hey, I just wanted to bring up some quick things about the energy they're keeping.
[03:47:41.616 --> 03:47:42.817]  Four quick points.
[03:47:42.817 --> 03:47:47.257]  What about the free energy out of the air that was originally designed by Nikola Tesla?
[03:47:47.257 --> 03:47:52.918]  The water car Stan Meyer produced, and they murdered him for it, and the government came and took it.
[03:47:52.918 --> 03:48:01.760]  The anti-gravity drive, or the hydrogen drive that they have, that they use on the Astra TRB3, that's a black project, NEXOPS, like Aurora,
[03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:06.532]  And, uh, they have cold fusion developed already and gravity warping.
[03:48:06.532 --> 03:48:08.754]  What about those things there?
[03:48:08.754 --> 03:48:16.759]  You know, all of those, there's, there's quite a bit, uh, out there on, but you know, the ones that are the most, um, uh, potential are these exotic technologies.
[03:48:16.759 --> 03:48:17.800]  They tend to be suppressed.
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:22.303]  So there's one in particular I saw, which was using, um, microwave energy.
[03:48:22.303 --> 03:48:28.487]  And what they did is they oscillated the microwave at a point where it oscillates the same frequency as water.
[03:48:28.487 --> 03:48:32.050]  And what it caused through resonance, a very little amount of energy in,
[03:48:32.611 --> 03:48:39.913]  Cause the two elements to split the hydrogen and the oxygen very efficiently and it would burn instantly.
[03:48:39.913 --> 03:48:52.237]  We had for a while a posting of that video on our website, but the fact is there are many methods to get us energy just by recognizing how to sort of crack the elements.
[03:48:52.237 --> 03:48:59.700]  Another one is sodium borohydrate, which is an element that can be electrolyzed with water that will cause it to split very vigorously.
[03:49:00.174 --> 03:49:02.474]  You know, a lot of science has been developed.
[03:49:02.474 --> 03:49:14.137]  MIT, even, in the mainstream, with GE, showed a fuel cell two years ago that was producing energy at the equivalent of three dollars a gallon of gasoline, and you haven't heard a word about that.
[03:49:14.137 --> 03:49:19.498]  Well, Flange and the other guy actually made something that was giving off power.
[03:49:19.498 --> 03:49:25.739]  Now, hundreds of universities have done it, but because the media tried to discredit that then, people just say, oh, that's fake.
[03:49:25.739 --> 03:49:26.679]  That doesn't matter.
[03:49:26.679 --> 03:49:28.840]  It doesn't matter how many journals it's published in.
[03:49:28.840 --> 03:49:29.520]  Absolute fact.
[03:49:30.327 --> 03:49:35.069]  And it was, and it was replicated, I think, 6,000 times was the last number I read.
[03:49:35.069 --> 03:49:39.211]  And, you know, it still doesn't explain it fully, but that's okay.
[03:49:39.211 --> 03:49:46.814]  You know, this is where, again, science is ruthless, and the mainstream and the academic institutions, it's a very...
[03:49:48.740 --> 03:49:53.704]  Jealous environment of experts that are afraid of their own shadow.
[03:49:53.704 --> 03:50:02.212]  And you've got a lot of them who have developed theories that have been proven false, and they're not about to be made laughingstocks of, and so they're going to continue to put their disinfo out.
[03:50:02.212 --> 03:50:05.134]  Dr. Baggage, we're going to let you go after this break.
[03:50:05.134 --> 03:50:06.215]  You're going to be gone in three minutes.
[03:50:06.215 --> 03:50:08.337]  We're going to talk to Brian, Brian and Jeff.
[03:50:08.337 --> 03:50:09.338]  They'll each get about a minute.
[03:50:09.798 --> 03:50:11.800]  And then I'm going to let you go because you've got to go to that meeting.
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:13.822]  Final segment after this break.
[03:50:13.822 --> 03:50:21.630]  For everybody listening on the AM and FM dial and global shortwave, for InfoWars.com stream listeners, the show will continue with Baggage right now.
[03:50:21.630 --> 03:50:26.895]  Be right back.
[03:50:26.895 --> 03:50:28.617]  Attention GCN listeners.
[03:50:28.617 --> 03:50:30.819]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and talk to Baggage here.
[03:50:30.819 --> 03:50:33.101]  Doc, let's go to Brian in Texas real fast.
[03:50:33.101 --> 03:50:33.822]  Brian, you're on the air.
[03:50:37.841 --> 03:50:40.263]  For some reason I can't hear Brian there, John.
[03:50:40.263 --> 03:50:41.363]  Hello?
[03:50:41.363 --> 03:50:42.144]  Yeah, Brian.
[03:50:42.144 --> 03:50:44.485]  Go ahead, bro.
[03:50:44.485 --> 03:50:45.626]  I'm on air.
[03:50:45.626 --> 03:50:46.827]  He's just gonna keep saying that.
[03:50:46.827 --> 03:50:47.867]  Okay, thanks, Brian.
[03:50:47.867 --> 03:50:48.808]  That was Brian in Texas.
[03:50:48.808 --> 03:50:50.329]  Let's go to Brian in New York.
[03:50:50.329 --> 03:50:51.710]  Brian in New York, you're on the air.
[03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:52.130]  Go ahead.
[03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:53.491]  Hey, Alex.
[03:50:53.491 --> 03:50:54.912]  Hey, go ahead.
[03:50:54.912 --> 03:51:05.619]  My question was about ARP and would all these cell phone towers that are everywhere, would they possibly be used for the same
[03:51:09.352 --> 03:51:18.879]  For some purposes, you know, any electromagnetic carrier, cell phones in particular, can be used for transmitting signals that will affect, for instance, emotional states of people.
[03:51:18.879 --> 03:51:24.503]  And you can do it in sort of the background of your normal phone communications, as an example.
[03:51:24.503 --> 03:51:32.289]  Any electromagnetic carrier, there is an article, and I know Alex has reported on this from before, it's The Mind Has No Firewalls at the U.S.
[03:51:32.289 --> 03:51:34.411]  Army War College Quarterly Perimeters.
[03:51:35.131 --> 03:51:57.784]  And any carrier, whether it be power lines, radio, TV broadcast, the internet, cell phones, etc., can be used to influence behaviors of people over either narrow bandwidths, like cell phones, you could even... The new antenna designs allow you to sort of focus on a specific individual within one meter, so you could target an individual or you could use it for a larger population.
[03:51:58.547 --> 03:52:04.972]  And of course, Dr. Begich, I should have gotten you on today and gotten you to talk about all the chemical, biological, radiological testing on the people.
[03:52:04.972 --> 03:52:13.958]  In fact, let me set you up in a couple weeks, have Trey call you in the next few days, just to come on, get all your files out, and get into testing.
[03:52:13.958 --> 03:52:15.019]  Perfect.
[03:52:15.019 --> 03:52:15.740]  That sounds great.
[03:52:15.740 --> 03:52:23.145]  Because, you know, this is again an important area, because when you start to talk about all of this, the people that have paid the price are the Americans.
[03:52:23.145 --> 03:52:24.646]  You know, we've been the victims.
[03:52:24.646 --> 03:52:25.747]  Oh yeah, we've had the victims.
[03:52:26.892 --> 03:52:35.897]  Because we've been the superpower, we've had the big aggressive elite that wants more, more, more, and so they've used us basically as their tool shed, mercilessly.
[03:52:35.897 --> 03:52:37.338]  Brian, anything else?
[03:52:37.338 --> 03:52:44.942]  Yeah, real quickly, if they were to spray, say, aluminum and barium into the atmosphere, could that enhance PARP's capabilities?
[03:52:44.942 --> 03:52:48.424]  It's a possibility, and I've heard this before, and actually there's
[03:52:49.148 --> 03:53:05.860]  We'd have to talk more about it than we've got time today, but the barium and aluminum also appear as pollutants coming in from Asia, naturally within our environments, and in many areas, in the area of bauxite and aluminum production, they have a lot of aluminum, particular material.
[03:53:05.860 --> 03:53:07.101]  You don't need that.
[03:53:07.101 --> 03:53:09.623]  You don't need any of that in order to enhance the signal.
[03:53:09.623 --> 03:53:14.547]  The Chinese burn a lot of their trash, and it blows right into the jet stream, right across the U.S.
[03:53:15.168 --> 03:53:15.808]  That's correct.
[03:53:15.808 --> 03:53:23.133]  In fact, there's a dissertation that became a book called The Secret Lives of Dust, which I would recommend to this listener.
[03:53:23.133 --> 03:53:24.413]  Doc, we're out of time.
[03:53:24.413 --> 03:53:26.615]  And thank you, Brian.
[03:53:26.615 --> 03:53:27.395]  Doc, we're out of time.
[03:53:27.395 --> 03:53:28.496]  I'm going to have Trey call you.
[03:53:28.496 --> 03:53:30.037]  I want to set you up for two hours.
[03:53:30.037 --> 03:53:32.838]  Talk about chemical biological testing soon, okay?
[03:53:32.838 --> 03:53:33.499]  Sounds good.
[03:53:33.499 --> 03:53:35.320]  Thanks for having me on, and God bless your audience.
[03:53:35.320 --> 03:53:35.720]  You bet.
[03:53:35.720 --> 03:53:37.121]  EarthPulse.com.
[03:53:37.121 --> 03:53:37.621]  Take care, Doc.
[03:53:40.745 --> 03:54:06.836]  Perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head See the world spinning round
[03:54:15.020 --> 03:54:25.765]  Back live, worldwide transmission.
[03:54:25.765 --> 03:54:28.967]  Salacious Crumb is our guest.
[03:54:28.967 --> 03:54:30.628]  In studio.
[03:54:30.628 --> 03:54:38.352]  You know, couldn't David Rockefeller just repent of all his evil and just be happy and help people and not be so wicked?
[03:54:41.004 --> 03:54:44.305]  But in their own sick way, they think what they're doing is good to the world.
[03:54:44.305 --> 03:54:46.745]  It's actually horrible.
[03:54:46.745 --> 03:54:48.385]  But we're basically out of time.
[03:54:48.385 --> 03:54:55.727]  I want to cram Jeff in, Marilyn in, and I do want to tell everybody, we carry his new video on HAARP.
[03:54:55.727 --> 03:54:57.507]  It's from the book, but updated.
[03:54:57.507 --> 03:54:58.387]  Great DVD.
[03:54:58.387 --> 03:55:00.747]  Dr. Nick Baggage at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:00.747 --> 03:55:02.808]  Angels still don't play this HAARP.
[03:55:02.808 --> 03:55:08.049]  We have his Mind Control video, several other documentaries and presentations he has made available at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:09.534 --> 03:55:13.415]  More by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[03:55:13.415 --> 03:55:17.616]  And a lot of people are calling in, ranting and raving about Endgame.
[03:55:17.616 --> 03:55:19.337]  That film is really getting big.
[03:55:19.337 --> 03:55:23.058]  My films always kind of have a delayed response.
[03:55:23.058 --> 03:55:25.678]  We don't have time for that with Truth Rising.
[03:55:25.678 --> 03:55:28.259]  If you have the DVD, please make copies.
[03:55:28.259 --> 03:55:34.021]  If you have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership downloaded in super high quality, please burn it on disc or CD.
[03:55:34.021 --> 03:55:35.061]  Give it to people now.
[03:55:37.799 --> 03:55:40.079]  Because it's just such a powerful film.
[03:55:40.079 --> 03:55:41.100]  I don't have time to get into it.
[03:55:41.100 --> 03:55:41.880]  Just check it out.
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:43.060]  Get the film today.
[03:55:43.060 --> 03:55:48.301]  Again, I want to go to Jeff, but before we do that, the sponsor of the day is Acola Bloom.
[03:55:48.301 --> 03:55:52.142]  They are just an amazing company.
[03:55:52.142 --> 03:55:54.102]  We have one here in the office.
[03:55:54.102 --> 03:55:56.163]  It grabs gallons and gallons.
[03:55:56.163 --> 03:55:58.263]  Up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[03:55:58.263 --> 03:55:59.843]  7.5 gallons.
[03:55:59.843 --> 03:56:02.764]  That's in high humidity, but in the desert it produces 2 gallons a day.
[03:56:03.821 --> 03:56:05.782]  Atmospheric water generator.
[03:56:05.782 --> 03:56:07.523]  It's got five filters in it.
[03:56:07.523 --> 03:56:09.403]  Easy maintenance.
[03:56:09.403 --> 03:56:11.264]  Just an amazing system.
[03:56:11.264 --> 03:56:14.465]  And I'd seen these years ago in companies and places, and then I saw them online.
[03:56:14.465 --> 03:56:15.926]  I said, get that as a sponsor.
[03:56:15.926 --> 03:56:16.666]  That is really neat.
[03:56:16.666 --> 03:56:18.267]  You can hook it up to solar panels.
[03:56:18.267 --> 03:56:20.768]  You can get water anywhere, even if you're off the grid.
[03:56:20.768 --> 03:56:23.609]  Anywhere, this sucker gets water, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56:24.850 --> 03:56:28.212]  It's totally clean and pure.
[03:56:28.212 --> 03:56:40.041]  866-585-4044, Ecolablue, 866-585-4044, or Ecolablue.com, big banner on Infowars.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:56:40.041 --> 03:56:44.545]  Okay, you're our tail gunner, Jeff in Maryland, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:56:44.545 --> 03:56:45.685]  Welcome.
[03:56:45.685 --> 03:56:48.868]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to throw in a little something and say that
[03:56:49.523 --> 03:56:51.204]  You know, with your guests and everything.
[03:56:51.204 --> 03:57:15.279]  For some four decades, a period roughly spanning seven administrations, the government's intelligence agencies and police agencies have broken the law and violated the Constitution, and I think it's unnerving to think that the kind of totalitarianism that's taking place in America, and I think that it's just mind-boggling that the American people are not recognizing it.
[03:57:15.279 --> 03:57:19.101]  And, you know, people talk about the NSA spying program, Alex, but
[03:57:19.622 --> 03:57:32.978]  You know, for more than two decades, with the collusion of the communications companies, the NSA and Operation Shamrock received copies of billions of cables and other things sent through the United States from, I think it was around 55 to 75.
[03:57:32.978 --> 03:57:35.821]  You know, the FBI investigated
[03:57:36.967 --> 03:57:43.531]  Almost a billion subversive targets and the CIA indexed hundreds of thousands... Man, you listen, you're an awesome caller.
[03:57:43.531 --> 03:57:44.431]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:57:44.431 --> 03:57:47.253]  I'm going to have a lot of open phones this week.
[03:57:47.253 --> 03:57:47.953]  You're great, Jeff.
[03:57:47.953 --> 03:57:49.694]  I wish I would have gotten to you earlier.
[03:57:49.694 --> 03:57:52.036]  But absolutely, thank you so much.
[03:57:52.036 --> 03:57:52.456]  Exactly.
[03:57:52.456 --> 03:57:53.977]  They're violating the Fourth Amendment.
[03:57:53.977 --> 03:57:56.298]  We have a criminal government, a criminal elite.
[03:57:56.298 --> 03:57:57.499]  We've got to get America back.
[03:57:57.499 --> 03:57:59.460]  Retransmission starts in ten seconds.
[03:58:00.180 --> 03:58:03.683]  at InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[03:58:03.683 --> 03:58:04.243]  Go there now.
[03:58:04.243 --> 03:58:06.685]  Everybody else, see you back live tomorrow at InfoWars.com.
