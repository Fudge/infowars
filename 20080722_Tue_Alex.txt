[00:36.640 --> 00:42.120]  hour and a half from now with bob Chapman our first guest then for two hours
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.880]  dr. nick a baggage to talk about a host of the issues from what gmo foods are
[00:47.880 --> 00:53.280]  doing to the government deploying microwave guns and sound weapons against
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.040]  the population a lot of the different patents that are declassified but still
[00:58.040 --> 01:03.200]  little known to the general public with some of the different surveillance tools
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.080]  and mind control devices already deployed for decades against the people of this
[01:09.080 --> 01:13.160]  country and the rest of the world will be talking to dr. nick baggage about that
[01:13.160 --> 01:17.840]  and a host of other issues always very compelling and very engaging very
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.440]  thought-provoking with dr. nick a baggage coming up in the third and fourth
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.760]  hour today now I said yesterday I wanted to take a lot of calls in the first
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.040]  hour and then I get on a rant and I don't do it and we took some but not as
[01:33.040 --> 01:39.080]  many as I'd like I have said this many times and I've succeeded a few times and
[01:39.080 --> 01:46.200]  failed most I'm gonna attempt to take a whole bunch of calls today in the first
[01:46.200 --> 01:50.800]  hour into the second hour and then continuing throughout with dr. nick
[01:50.800 --> 01:56.400]  baggage today first-time callers go to the head of the line that the only card
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.440]  that can trump a first-time caller is someone who says if they disagree with
[02:00.440 --> 02:04.800]  me we do not screen your calls though if you just wish to say your names John
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.320]  Doe from 10 buck to you can even declare yourself the king of Pluto it
[02:10.320 --> 02:21.200]  doesn't matter 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 now in the news story here
[02:21.200 --> 02:29.840]  death of the free internet is imminent Canada will be the test case and internet
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.000]  to the International Consortium has announced their plan to shut down the
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.920]  web I first learned of their public declaration about six years ago we've
[02:39.920 --> 02:46.360]  written scores of articles on it but now it is materializing and in an even
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.400]  more bold and accelerated fashion than we had predicted generally things are
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.480]  worse than we even say here on the show contrary to some people's conception
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.560]  that we fear monger or exaggerate no I'd have to say eight times out of ten or
[03:03.560 --> 03:12.720]  so it's much worse than we say and then by the other 20% of the time it's
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.400]  pretty much split between we say it's worse than it is or we get it dead on
[03:17.400 --> 03:24.240]  right we're dead on absolutely right about 10% of the time it's worse 80% of
[03:24.240 --> 03:29.120]  the time that's my dead wrecking dead reckoning estimation and about 10% of
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.880]  the time it's it's not as bad as we thought and we certainly wish things
[03:33.880 --> 03:38.400]  were not as bad as they certainly clearly are I mean with each passing day
[03:38.400 --> 03:48.800]  each passing month a year it becomes more apparent that our worst our worst
[03:48.800 --> 03:56.280]  inclusions are the ones that appear to be correct that the situation is far
[03:56.280 --> 04:01.200]  worse than even some of the greatest pessimists had thought with the
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.240]  psychopathic elite that's going for broke against humanity to set up a
[04:05.240 --> 04:09.960]  worldwide tyranny death of the free internet is imminent Canada will be the
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.360]  test case also the global economy is at the point of maximum danger I mentioned

[08:33.200 --> 08:37.520]  you the death of the dollar is imminent and people deny it until it starts
[08:37.520 --> 08:42.920]  happening well it has already started in mass from China to the United States
[08:42.920 --> 08:49.160]  from England to France there is a concerted cocktail of different
[08:49.160 --> 08:54.920]  mechanisms being used to dismantle it wholesale in front of you we are only
[08:54.920 --> 09:00.400]  two years unless the people are awakened and start trying to block these
[09:00.400 --> 09:06.440]  different actions away from the internet as you know it no longer existing t-minus
[09:06.440 --> 09:13.880]  two years mid 2010 ladies and gentlemen according to their announced numbers
[09:13.880 --> 09:20.320]  they have declared war on it but we've been bred from birth trained from birth
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.120]  to live in denial don't say you weren't warned yet again and there are tools
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.160]  there are ways to fight this and we'll talk about some of those today and of
[09:29.160 --> 09:32.160]  course what's happening with the economy and a lot more than a baggage is
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.640]  joining us coming up about two hours from now Bob Chapman about an hour and a
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.880]  half with popping in multiple times weekly to give us the latest developments
[09:39.880 --> 09:46.680]  in the markets right now let's go to your phone calls Don in Texas you're on
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.920]  the air welcome Alex how are you good I would just like to say that I've kind
[09:52.920 --> 09:57.200]  of been in the rabbit hole for about 27 years and never have I seen anyone work
[09:57.200 --> 10:03.760]  so hard to explain the truth as you and I think you just keep pushing forward and
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.160]  don't worry about those other people because what I've seen happen in the
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.440]  27 years that I've been aware down to the chemtrails and harp and everything
[10:12.440 --> 10:19.920]  else is it's just uh if someone can't see by now I don't know what you say to
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.320]  them and I'm I've grown tired of even I go reach people that want to talk and
[10:24.320 --> 10:27.800]  want to listen and leave the rest alone and I don't think those people can be
[10:27.800 --> 10:33.800]  safe well what what gets to me is that there are a lot of people who claim that
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.720]  they're even you know with the truth movement or the awakening just people
[10:36.720 --> 10:39.320]  who love liberty and don't want to be slaves and that people say who are we
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.160]  people who want to have control our own destinies people that want to have some
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.600]  modicum of freedom and dignity and respect and to live in peace and that's
[10:47.600 --> 10:53.000]  who we are and and to see our own movement just totally controlled by
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.440]  COINTELPRO where they can punch our buttons and pull our chains myself
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.840]  included many times you know I've learned a lot in the process and it's just so
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.240]  sad that that you're right it's all unfolding now in front of us and on
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.720]  one hand people are waking up like never before that's wonderful and positive
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.080]  and great the best of times the worst of times but on the other hand so many
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.240]  people just don't have any discernment and they know the new world order exists
[11:19.240 --> 11:24.160]  they know the government's corrupt and tyrannical and abusive and very dark but
[11:24.160 --> 11:31.000]  they still just don't understand the basics of moving forward against
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.040]  tyranny and how much power we all really have and we just end up just ascending
[11:35.040 --> 11:38.360]  into arguments and mindlessness while the enemies tearing down the front gate
[11:38.360 --> 11:44.880]  but from but from your perspective don't you see the don't you see the people
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.120]  yearning for the truth becoming more exponential and those people becoming
[11:49.120 --> 11:52.600]  smaller and smaller you've seen it the last 10 or 12 years up and listening to
[11:52.600 --> 11:58.280]  it no I have certainly heard it with the general public and I appreciate your
[11:58.280 --> 12:06.960]  call and it's a great point you make Don I have seen it just doing radio
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.560]  interviews on radio shows that are positive towards my views radio shows
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.840]  that are negative radio broadcasts that are neutral I have gone from half the
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.480]  callers disagreeing with me 10 12 13 years ago to 90 plus percent agreeing
[12:23.480 --> 12:28.880]  and we've seen that the poll numbers Congress again with a 9% approval
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.840]  rating but I'm talking about then once people wake up there's kind of this
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.800]  dark malaise or this morbidity where people are just become extremely
[12:40.800 --> 12:46.040]  cynical and upset and depressed and I understand that I mean sometimes I get
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.160]  very upset and and and saddened I wouldn't call it depressed but but just
[12:50.160 --> 12:54.080]  more saddened by what's happening because there's so much beauty in the
[12:54.080 --> 12:59.320]  world there are so many wonderful just enchanting things and mysterious things
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.560]  and and and wonderful things about life that I can't find words to describe it
[13:04.560 --> 13:13.360]  and and that's what makes the evil so much more horrible it freaks me out it
[13:13.360 --> 13:21.240]  makes me go into angry rages to know that Dinecore and Halliburton run giant
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.440]  child kidnapping operations on an industrial scale hundreds and thousands
[13:27.440 --> 13:34.000]  a year millions total that flips me out I mean I think about that and things like
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.720]  that hundreds of these horrible things run through my night run through my mind
[13:37.720 --> 13:44.120]  every time I go to sleep at night and I think what how is this possible how how
[13:44.120 --> 13:50.920]  was there so much evil but I digress I said I'm taking a lot of your calls so
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.080]  there isn't time for me to really sound off but yes things are very very
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.520]  positive but the enemy knows that they know that there is an awakening taking
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.720]  place that's why they're trying to bring the police state in the overt black
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.120]  uniformed iron fisted grid they would much rather it be kind of like the
[14:10.120 --> 14:17.080]  steppford wives manicured lawns you know happy people and in colorful suits of
[14:17.080 --> 14:23.600]  clothes smiling beaming as you know we all die of cancer and all the other
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.760]  soft-kill weapons that they're launching against us you know they'd rather
[14:27.760 --> 14:31.480]  just everybody roll their sleeves up voluntarily and take the shots and with
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.840]  the appear pressure march into the control grid but now because they know
[14:36.840 --> 14:40.440]  that the people are waking up and the internet is turning against them they're
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.480]  preparing to bring in the iron fist okay let's talk to Steve in Utah Steve
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.560]  thanks for holding her on the air hey what's up how you doing good sir thank
[14:51.560 --> 14:55.360]  you and thanks for everything you do I just want to touch on yeah people do
[14:55.360 --> 15:02.680]  wake up but this this evil system they play a good game of manipulation and
[15:02.680 --> 15:09.040]  psychology against us you know say one thing and do another or do a thing do
[15:09.040 --> 15:13.080]  something or some act that makes them look like they're for the people or
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.360]  they're doing something for us and you know I'm sure it's all laid out and you
[15:18.360 --> 15:26.920]  know the scenarios are played out to you know to manipulate us and you know
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.480]  George Bush can't be that bad now he wants to start drilling offshore and you
[15:31.480 --> 15:36.040]  know that's a good thing for us and he's trying to help us when I'm sure it was
[15:36.040 --> 15:41.040]  something that was laid out and a scenario that they put in place to you
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.840]  know maybe kind of regain some of the public confidence in them and it's just
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.360]  things like that and then you know when you wake up and you figure it out it's
[15:50.360 --> 15:55.440]  like what can I do you know what what where do I start what what can I say
[15:55.440 --> 16:00.760]  what can I do and how do I change it and just really and politicians will give
[16:00.760 --> 16:05.760]  you silver bullet answers you know we discuss the fact of take control of
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.680]  your local governments that's where you have a percent turnout that's where you
[16:09.680 --> 16:13.480]  still don't have total fraud with the voting system in every case you have a
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.840]  chance to take control of your city governments now to keep the fraudulent
[16:17.840 --> 16:24.240]  voting machines from coming in and and and and hold your ground at the local
[16:24.240 --> 16:28.920]  level that's where the real power is to then educate the public and use those
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.880]  governmental bully pulpits as fulcrums to leverage resistance against the New
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.760]  World Order I appreciate your call and and your point Steve again we're not
[16:38.760 --> 16:41.680]  going to have a lot of time to spend with each caller because we are going to try
[16:41.680 --> 16:46.720]  to get to more of you it's so it's a catch 22 but I love the points you're
[16:46.720 --> 16:53.640]  making here's what's happening with the offshore drilling Bush knows that
[16:53.640 --> 16:59.480]  Congress because they'd already pulled the Congress in the months previous they
[16:59.480 --> 17:03.160]  had already consulted with Congress and they knew that Congress at least the
[17:03.160 --> 17:09.320]  time being will not lift the ban on offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
[17:09.320 --> 17:15.440]  that has more oil than all of Saudi Arabia combined discovered in the 60s
[17:15.440 --> 17:19.720]  they discovered fields what there's one about 150 miles up the coast of
[17:19.720 --> 17:25.240]  Mississippi that is 640 something square miles we've we've covered it on air
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.280]  that has as much as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska natural gas oil just blast out
[17:30.280 --> 17:35.160]  under super high pressure anywhere they drill and they're relatively shallow as
[17:35.160 --> 17:39.840]  well and inexpensive but but an illustration of how that is a fraud and
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.000]  I go through hundreds of points one of the first actions Bush did when he got
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  into office was of course to block congressional investigations of Bill
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.520]  Clinton but the second thing he did was to give tens of thousands of square
[17:56.520 --> 18:04.040]  miles of United States territorial water that had been seized from Mexico
[18:04.040 --> 18:11.160]  during one of our innumerable wars and scrimmages with them they gave those
[18:11.160 --> 18:17.120]  waters back to Mexico and PIMEX is now for eight years seven and a half years
[18:17.120 --> 18:22.760]  exploring those and that's why they pay a lot less for gas in Mexico than we pay
[18:22.760 --> 18:26.840]  here it is not quote because it's subsidized
[18:26.840 --> 18:35.880]  but I already digress so Bush just quickly and
[18:35.880 --> 18:43.840]  quietly with an executive directive and then Congress quietly removed its
[18:43.840 --> 18:49.480]  restriction and that's because that's what the establishment wants that's
[18:49.480 --> 18:57.520]  what the globalist are putting into play because they are monopoly men another
[18:57.520 --> 19:04.960]  example is how we're only allowed one pipeline out of Alaska and 80 percent on
[19:04.960 --> 19:11.440]  average it fluctuates of the oil and natural gas taken out of the few fields
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.760]  that are allowed to operate in Alaska it's a veritable gold mine like Saudi
[19:16.760 --> 19:26.280]  Arabia is sent to China and Japan see it's a global managed economy and so
[19:26.280 --> 19:32.160]  Bush comes out and says I'm going to open up some drilling you can put in
[19:32.160 --> 19:38.280]  permits for certain areas but that was only his restrictions the Congress isn't
[19:38.280 --> 19:42.960]  going to remove the restrictions so it is total theater but you're right the
[19:42.960 --> 19:50.880]  average person doesn't understand how that works okay so it is more smoke and
[19:50.880 --> 19:57.000]  mirrors a cruel stunt plus the oil companies bought up the refineries and
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.840]  shut them down doesn't matter how much oil they pump out of the ground we can't
[19:59.840 --> 20:14.280]  refine it you like being a puppet sir you like being a puppet for the new world order I'll do the American people know that not 11 was the stage was the

[35:25.600 --> 35:29.400]  writing around warning people well they knew what to do now he was saying to
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.520]  arms to arms and that's your decision whether it's time for arms I don't think
[35:34.520 --> 35:39.680]  it's the time for that I'm out writing with millions of other heroic men and
[35:39.680 --> 35:44.640]  women of every race color and creed all over the world warning people about the
[35:44.640 --> 35:48.760]  globalist you know how do you stop GMO food you expose it you demonize it you
[35:48.760 --> 35:53.760]  you you you educate people with the facts and it is demonic how do you expose
[35:53.760 --> 35:57.680]  the gun grabbers you show their agenda but they wanted as armist to control our
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.360]  lives and then you show their own documents where they admit it's not
[36:02.360 --> 36:06.920]  about keeping children safe it's about making you a slave again it's
[36:06.920 --> 36:13.640]  education it's information it's counter propaganda all right I'm already
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.760]  digressing can also write to me Alex Jones at 3001 Shelf Lamar sweet 100
[36:18.760 --> 36:24.840]  Austin Texas 78704 let's try to move quickly here James in Michigan you're
[36:24.840 --> 36:32.200]  on the air go ahead James in Michigan you're on the air James just dropped
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.440]  let's go to Derek in Minnesota first-time caller welcome there
[36:36.440 --> 36:40.840]  uh... they uh... I heard yesterday that when the williams was on a radio show
[36:40.840 --> 36:43.440]  and he was claiming that
[36:43.440 --> 36:44.340]  uh...
[36:44.340 --> 36:47.880]  that they that they follow oil and such and such a country on all the exact
[36:47.880 --> 36:50.760]  details he's a doctor stand yesterday i believe
[36:50.760 --> 36:53.720]  and that will go down to fifty dollars a barrel
[36:53.720 --> 36:55.240]  have you heard that
[36:55.240 --> 36:58.960]  uh... this is this was just yesterday and doctor stand i believe i didn't
[36:58.960 --> 37:02.600]  actually hear it i heard somebody call in and talk about it on a different
[37:02.600 --> 37:03.840]  radio show
[37:03.840 --> 37:05.640]  well i like uh...
[37:05.640 --> 37:08.040]  lindsay williams it's just that
[37:08.040 --> 37:10.680]  and i can be accused of this too he's a great guy
[37:10.680 --> 37:14.080]  it's pretty much the same story when you have him on i've probably had him on
[37:14.080 --> 37:15.280]  twenty times
[37:15.280 --> 37:18.880]  and he talks about how he was a uh...
[37:18.880 --> 37:20.360]  chaplain for
[37:20.360 --> 37:23.320]  atlantic richfield in alaska
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.980]  and he saw the things
[37:24.980 --> 37:28.240]  that a lot of other people that worked in alaska have told me
[37:28.240 --> 37:31.240]  and i've interviewed some of the oil company executives on air and those
[37:31.240 --> 37:33.560]  discoveries are admitted it's not secret
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.520]  he's a good eyewitness report
[37:35.520 --> 37:37.520]  and what he's saying is accurate
[37:37.520 --> 37:42.600]  uh... and uh... the energy non-crisis is a great video and and you know book
[37:42.600 --> 37:44.440]  his video and a book under the same title
[37:44.440 --> 37:46.040]  it's all free on google video
[37:46.040 --> 37:47.480]  so he's a great guy
[37:47.480 --> 37:51.000]  uh... i had not heard this uh... new development
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.840]  uh... but uh...
[37:53.840 --> 37:57.720]  i'll have to call him and i really don't go off of rumors and what
[37:57.720 --> 38:00.240]  what collars say and you're not going to see oil
[38:00.240 --> 38:02.840]  go down to the dollars a barrel i don't care how much they discover
[38:02.840 --> 38:04.000]  they could discover
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.540]  uh... thousand times what's in saudi arabia
[38:07.540 --> 38:11.680]  and you do it it's not going to go down uh... a lot because
[38:11.680 --> 38:15.440]  the oil companies in nineteen ninety five met
[38:15.440 --> 38:17.760]  and the a p reported on this in two thousand and one we've written big
[38:17.760 --> 38:19.080]  articles on it
[38:19.080 --> 38:22.320]  i mean this is a smoking gun it's it's open and shut it's admitted
[38:22.320 --> 38:25.480]  and they bought up two hundred plus refineries in the u.s
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.040]  a whole bunch in canada and europe as well but two hundred and plus in the
[38:29.040 --> 38:30.000]  u.s
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.400]  i think it's two hundred and fourteen i i i you know look it up yourself
[38:33.400 --> 38:35.880]  and they said there's too much oil
[38:35.880 --> 38:39.520]  uh... we've got to artificially shut down refineries
[38:39.520 --> 38:42.420]  because it was too expensive i mean too inexpensive
[38:42.420 --> 38:44.240]  in the mid nineteen ninety show
[38:44.240 --> 38:47.640]  so well whenever i say the oil companies are behind the current rise
[38:47.640 --> 38:49.880]  they were behind having it a dollar fifty
[38:49.880 --> 38:51.940]  a dollar seventy again
[38:51.940 --> 38:55.360]  okay by buying up and shutting down the refineries
[38:55.360 --> 38:57.800]  that were owned by smaller companies
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.360]  uh...
[38:59.360 --> 39:02.640]  but but that's a small part of the increase
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.280]  the main reason is you have global oligopolies that is
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.160]  different groups in that the combined into combines or cartels
[39:10.160 --> 39:11.600]  artificially
[39:11.600 --> 39:14.640]  uh... not allowing through government regulation
[39:14.640 --> 39:16.300]  and corporate decisions
[39:16.300 --> 39:18.240]  exploration because only
[39:18.240 --> 39:21.760]  but top seven or eight giants can explore in the north sea
[39:21.760 --> 39:23.520]  or extract in the north sea
[39:23.520 --> 39:25.920]  and then in other areas like alaska
[39:25.920 --> 39:27.880]  uh... or the stands
[39:27.880 --> 39:30.020]  uh... or the gulf of mexico
[39:30.020 --> 39:32.240]  they have governmental control
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.680]  and can just block the development people think that they
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.140]  when in afghanistan to block oil coming out of the ten or eleven stands
[39:40.140 --> 39:41.540]  other nations around it
[39:41.540 --> 39:43.360]  you know people think they were there to get the oil
[39:43.360 --> 39:48.260]  now they were there to block the oil coming out
[39:48.260 --> 39:50.320]  yeah i i i you know i'm not
[39:50.320 --> 39:54.160]  i'm trying to find the archive of doctor stand to try to actually hear that
[39:54.160 --> 39:57.760]  that statement well he's here on this network i think it uh...
[39:57.760 --> 40:00.600]  or five o'clock so you you know what i'll do
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.480]  i will uh... we know what it's time to have williams on even if it's just
[40:04.480 --> 40:06.120]  i mean i could almost go get
[40:06.120 --> 40:09.720]  in fact it's a it's a pitch it's a it's a script he goes off of which is fine
[40:09.720 --> 40:11.320]  he's a preacher that's what they do
[40:11.320 --> 40:13.560]  but i i i i i could
[40:13.560 --> 40:16.600]  okay we'll get williams on outside i appreciate your call sir
[40:16.600 --> 40:18.600]  okay uh... let's go ahead
[40:18.600 --> 40:21.600]  and uh... take a another call
[40:21.600 --> 40:24.440]  let's uh... talk to
[40:24.440 --> 40:28.120]  about me to get him on anyways i just
[40:28.120 --> 40:31.720]  i guess up next is john in california on the air go ahead
[40:31.720 --> 40:36.720]  alex say good morning uh... i can't hear the program too well on shortwave and
[40:36.720 --> 40:40.120]  briefly yesterday i heard something about a quarter million coffin liners
[40:40.120 --> 40:42.200]  out in uh... atlanta
[40:42.200 --> 40:45.000]  well no one's counted them but they're stacked
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.440]  uh... about
[40:46.440 --> 40:48.360]  forty uh... to a stack
[40:48.360 --> 40:51.960]  and there are just thousands and thousands of stacks
[40:51.960 --> 40:55.360]  and and and and some people estimate it's over five hundred thousand some close
[40:55.360 --> 40:56.760]  to a million some
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.800]  uh... a lesser amount but but but but let me be clear about this
[41:00.800 --> 41:03.180]  people always love stories about a
[41:03.180 --> 41:05.820]  eighteen-wheeler that come to over and had martial law signs
[41:05.820 --> 41:07.760]  but then they never talk about the houston chronicle
[41:07.760 --> 41:10.160]  and then they've got fema cams for martial law
[41:10.160 --> 41:13.760]  or people always want to talk about this heard somebody who knew somebody
[41:13.760 --> 41:16.240]  who knew somebody's brother who knew an aunt
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.600]  who had an uncle who was friends with a man who worked at a store
[41:19.600 --> 41:20.720]  who saw
[41:20.720 --> 41:22.960]  uh... shackles in the trains
[41:22.960 --> 41:24.920]  when i've seen the shackles myself
[41:24.920 --> 41:27.400]  okay instead of going to the core research or
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.560]  civilian inmate labor camp program
[41:29.560 --> 41:31.720]  operating secretly since eighty six
[41:31.720 --> 41:34.800]  declassified in uh... ninety seven
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.960]  in my book to send to terry on the army's own website
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.200]  so so my problem with this is
[41:42.200 --> 41:46.360]  the we have mainstream news articles and i ask her and paul to do article sunday
[41:46.360 --> 41:49.280]  i guess they just didn't want to do articles on it but we need an article on
[41:49.280 --> 41:49.880]  it
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.360]  where we go through all the evidence and then add in
[41:53.360 --> 41:56.560]  the plastic coffin containers because here's the evidence
[41:56.560 --> 41:59.360]  in two thousand two rocky mountain news headline
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.760]  was something like crematoriums for bio attack governor
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.040]  announces crematoriums for bio attack i believe that was the headline somebody
[42:06.040 --> 42:09.000]  find it give it to my guys we don't have a staff to the research
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.440]  uh... and uh... that i remember
[42:11.440 --> 42:14.200]  other articles about millions of body bags ordered
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.800]  that all those rumors have roots in admissions
[42:17.800 --> 42:19.400]  so this is just where
[42:19.400 --> 42:21.560]  somebody found a stockpile of them
[42:21.560 --> 42:23.880]  by a railway station in near the airport
[42:23.880 --> 42:26.640]  uh... in in in georgia outside atlanta
[42:26.640 --> 42:29.040]  so they are coffins we know the company name
[42:29.040 --> 42:30.520]  we tracked it down
[42:30.520 --> 42:33.840]  uh... it is confirmed that they're coughing stockpile there
[42:33.840 --> 42:36.480]  and now we're having a big debate about whether yes they're coffins
[42:36.480 --> 42:38.680]  yes there's a program stockpiling coffins
[42:38.680 --> 42:40.560]  yes it's real folks go ahead
[42:40.560 --> 42:45.120]  okay um... i've got photos in my hands right now there about five years old of
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.720]  about what i understand four million coffin liners
[42:48.720 --> 42:51.160]  outside the boonies of atlanta
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.960]  and uh... what happened to take those photos no i didn't they were given to me
[42:54.960 --> 42:57.640]  by rick wiles at true news he uh...
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.440]  received a from a lady in atlanta georgia and told me about them i don't
[43:01.440 --> 43:02.700]  have internet
[43:02.700 --> 43:04.000]  he sent him to me
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.120]  and uh... he was trying to go and figure out what they were he had just about
[43:08.120 --> 43:12.280]  got female to identify to uh... admit they belong to them but they wouldn't
[43:12.280 --> 43:13.600]  identify him
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.880]  and i have a volunteer friend of mine in femur who's very very high up there
[43:17.880 --> 43:21.320]  and i showed her the photos and i asked her if these were coffin she said no
[43:21.320 --> 43:22.600]  they're coffin liners
[43:22.600 --> 43:23.640]  and i asked her
[43:23.640 --> 43:25.440]  are you sure how do you know
[43:25.440 --> 43:27.560]  and she said because we've got him in l a
[43:27.560 --> 43:31.040]  and i asked to do you have four million coffin liners in l a she said i don't
[43:31.040 --> 43:32.480]  think we have four million
[43:32.480 --> 43:35.200]  we've got a bunch of them and we've got a bunch of them let me stop you let me
[43:35.200 --> 43:37.200]  just stop you i don't understand this
[43:37.200 --> 43:40.920]  it's almost like our minds have been programmed to disassociate
[43:40.920 --> 43:42.760]  with any threatening fact
[43:42.760 --> 43:44.240]  that's what we're saying
[43:44.240 --> 43:48.440]  these are coffin liners but they it says on the company that makes them
[43:48.440 --> 43:53.240]  it can also be used to just put the body in yes you can put a smaller coffin in
[43:53.240 --> 43:54.120]  them
[43:54.120 --> 43:57.560]  or you can put a body in them or a body bag in them
[43:57.560 --> 44:00.400]  so technically it's meant to have a body bag stuck in it
[44:00.400 --> 44:04.280]  and yes i've seen people now debating no they're not coffins their coffin liners
[44:04.280 --> 44:07.560]  the point is they're massing a bunch of coffin liners
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.680]  and they're coffin liners we have the company we posted links to it
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.280]  uh... but we need a big article on this i keep explaining to my guys
[44:15.280 --> 44:16.640]  this is a big deal
[44:16.640 --> 44:19.240]  and i'd have limited that's why we're moving into a bigger office
[44:19.240 --> 44:22.280]  we're trying to get internet in there everything's slow as molasses
[44:22.280 --> 44:25.000]  we have such a small staff that it's hard to build up
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.600]  but uh... in the future we will we're gonna get we're getting more riders more
[44:28.600 --> 44:29.600]  web people
[44:29.600 --> 44:32.840]  and uh... we will get a big report out on this in the next day or two
[44:32.840 --> 44:36.840]  uh... get a phone number or a uh... fact number to your office
[44:36.840 --> 44:40.720]  yes or i look like let me just give you my fed extra number
[44:40.720 --> 44:42.320]  uh... let me offer
[44:42.320 --> 44:43.960]  give you the hotline number
[44:43.960 --> 44:46.600]  call it and we'll give you my fed extra number
[44:46.600 --> 44:50.840]  and uh... you can i mean that we've already got video of the coffins
[44:50.840 --> 44:52.280]  so i mean i mean
[44:52.280 --> 44:54.800]  and we've got the company that sells them and make some
[44:54.800 --> 44:58.760]  uh... so it's all open and shut but but i mean what are these photos
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.240]  um... their colored photos of uh... back of uh... these
[45:03.240 --> 45:06.040]  uh... blue black plastic cups on pallet
[45:06.040 --> 45:09.800]  uh... with a bunch of weeds growing uh... same place same same place but i
[45:09.800 --> 45:10.840]  mean if you want to
[45:10.840 --> 45:12.720]  i don't think there's any need for me to blow
[45:12.720 --> 45:15.640]  thirty forty bucks i just try to be sure so somewhat of a good story of our
[45:15.640 --> 45:16.440]  funds
[45:16.440 --> 45:17.880]  to give you the FedEx number
[45:17.880 --> 45:19.120]  i can't i can't pack
[45:19.120 --> 45:20.040]  uh...
[45:20.040 --> 45:22.880]  the uh... photos to you if you want me to have it to be a fax and then it's
[45:22.880 --> 45:24.200]  something dynamite
[45:24.200 --> 45:26.960]  i really didn't get to scan and put on the web
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.360]  plus Rick Wiles is a territorial person i really don't want anything he has
[45:30.360 --> 45:32.240]  i mean we we know about it
[45:32.240 --> 45:34.880]  i i would suggest you get to a
[45:34.880 --> 45:36.160]  internet site
[45:36.160 --> 45:40.440]  uh... and uh... yourself and flicker or something like that
[45:40.440 --> 45:42.200]  and put them up for the world because
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.440]  i mean we have the company advertising them
[45:45.440 --> 45:48.000]  that sells them and says they sell them to the government i mean we know what
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.040]  they are
[45:49.040 --> 45:52.000]  and see everybody's running around like chickens with their heads cut off
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.280]  that's why we have to put the definitive word out
[45:54.280 --> 45:57.520]  at prisonplanet dot com we're going to do that i'm gonna call Paul Watson and
[45:57.520 --> 45:59.440]  see that he put something together right now or

[47:34.560 --> 47:36.120]  you bring up the most
[47:36.120 --> 47:37.800]  incredible issues
[47:37.800 --> 47:38.840]  but the one
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.320]  we really need to focus on and create and a large infrastructure
[47:43.320 --> 47:45.560]  is this whole death of the internet thing
[47:45.560 --> 47:50.320]  this is key this is our platform they want to do i can't even get our own
[47:50.320 --> 47:53.800]  movement to admit it i mean it's like
[47:53.800 --> 47:57.600]  i've never lied to anybody i do the best job i can i've been i discovered
[47:57.600 --> 47:59.560]  internet to six seven years ago
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.560]  we've written scores of articles
[48:01.560 --> 48:04.680]  and i mean i have their own admissions saying
[48:04.680 --> 48:07.400]  we are going to kill the internet that's a quote
[48:07.400 --> 48:09.960]  governments are saying this
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.520]  and then the media will like pray some bloggers who go
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.560]  we had somebody tell us that a major media outfit that they might start
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.560]  shutting it down it's like what did you hit it's all rumor-mongering instead of
[48:21.560 --> 48:24.320]  we have the facts
[48:24.320 --> 48:25.640]  what i'm trying to say is we need
[48:25.640 --> 48:26.360]  ron paul
[48:26.360 --> 48:28.680]  i've made up groups to be doing this
[48:28.680 --> 48:30.520]  nationwide and creating a
[48:30.520 --> 48:34.720]  a physical infrastructure of people knowledgeable
[48:34.720 --> 48:37.960]  is the only way we're going to stop this this is what i mean we're at work
[48:37.960 --> 48:40.240]  you and i and the rest of us who are listening
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.240]  are in a think tank and we're not thinking we're not the choir we don't
[48:44.240 --> 48:47.400]  understand how to sing
[48:47.400 --> 48:51.080]  no no i agree with you well we try to give solutions i mean my solution is
[48:51.080 --> 48:53.040]  they are doing this
[48:53.040 --> 48:55.720]  uh... tell comcast tell time warner
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.280]  who have already started one of the multi-pronged attacks one of the
[48:59.280 --> 49:00.640]  missiles
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.680]  one of the big ones you've got it in boycott them and cut their service off
[49:04.680 --> 49:08.200]  uh... and then you know call and let him know uh... but
[49:08.200 --> 49:09.640]  you've got to
[49:09.640 --> 49:12.760]  call congress i mean we've already they already tried to end that neutrality
[49:12.760 --> 49:14.240]  which would have shut down the web
[49:14.240 --> 49:15.480]  literally i mean
[49:15.480 --> 49:18.560]  one hub shuts down this would have been on the scores of them
[49:18.560 --> 49:20.600]  the web as you know it's gone
[49:20.600 --> 49:23.400]  and remember when cogent level three shut down a few years ago just for a
[49:23.400 --> 49:24.120]  weekend
[49:24.120 --> 49:25.760]  a third of the web was down
[49:25.760 --> 49:28.680]  uh... we barely beat that by a few votes
[49:28.680 --> 49:32.240]  and the senator trying to pass it was caught the corruption scandal we barely
[49:32.240 --> 49:33.280]  beat it
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.640]  and that was just one prong see
[49:35.640 --> 49:38.640]  they're launching like ten torpedoes that is knowing
[49:38.640 --> 49:41.120]  one or two of them will do a sin
[49:41.120 --> 49:43.400]  and so the big torpedo this this
[49:43.400 --> 49:45.080]  this is the one we have this
[49:45.080 --> 49:48.600]  engage the whole now i'm saying they've watched about ten torpedoes
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.120]  one of which will kill the web
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.680]  i'm not that pessimistic
[49:55.680 --> 49:58.800]  if we can i mean it's heard there's nothing nothing pessimistic about what i
[49:58.800 --> 49:59.680]  just said
[49:59.680 --> 50:02.360]  if they're able to implement anyone
[50:02.360 --> 50:04.080]  uh... there are now
[50:04.080 --> 50:05.800]  plans
[50:05.800 --> 50:09.000]  one of them net neutrality uh...
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.280]  subscription base to taxes it's over
[50:14.280 --> 50:16.560]  i mean there's nothing pessimistic about that i'm saying that the enemy
[50:16.560 --> 50:18.360]  breaches the wall
[50:18.360 --> 50:20.480]  they are going to take the city
[50:20.480 --> 50:22.520]  we've got a hold the wall alone
[50:22.520 --> 50:24.200]  well how was that pessimistic
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.160]  well i'm not saying you're totally pessimistic but i think we have to build
[50:28.160 --> 50:30.520]  the infrastructure along with people like
[50:30.520 --> 50:34.560]  electronic frontier found that i can barely keep my web sites up
[50:34.560 --> 50:37.600]  you know i i run around paying bills for the power to get turned off i
[50:37.600 --> 50:38.320]  understand
[50:38.320 --> 50:39.800]  but see and appreciate your call

[53:09.400 --> 53:11.800]  beginning of a much larger crisis

[53:13.680 --> 53:17.280]  abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule of men
[53:17.280 --> 53:21.520]  the majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power
[53:21.520 --> 53:25.360]  and illusion of authority that only lawless men and women seek
[53:25.360 --> 53:28.040]  they no longer strive to protect american ideals
[53:28.040 --> 53:31.280]  but rather they have abandoned the very rulebook that they have sworn an oath to

[53:32.880 --> 53:35.840]  will the american people let these crimes go unpunished

[55:30.840 --> 55:35.280]  and if you don't return somebody's email you're automatically uh... zero but
[55:35.280 --> 55:37.480]  anyway you're still a hero mine
[55:37.480 --> 55:40.760]  and uh... for the last seven years when i've spoken to people about what
[55:40.760 --> 55:42.960]  happened on september eleventh and
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.160]  talk to him about the inside of trading in the buildings were filled with
[55:46.160 --> 55:48.680]  asbestos should have been condemned
[55:48.680 --> 55:51.080]  they said i didn't hear that part
[55:51.080 --> 55:54.680]  and i said we'll turn in the info wars dot com you will see that
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.720]  you will see plants that were infected and grown by our government with hiv
[55:58.720 --> 55:59.960]  virus
[55:59.960 --> 56:04.080]  people didn't hear that story but what i want to talk to you today about alex
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.720]  with that with george bush finishing uh... his administration
[56:07.720 --> 56:10.080]  what do you predict on some of the pardons
[56:10.080 --> 56:13.520]  uh... that he's going to uh... do this year do you think he's going to part in
[56:13.520 --> 56:14.880]  scooter liby
[56:14.880 --> 56:16.520]  uh... and and
[56:16.520 --> 56:19.600]  you see anybody else on that
[56:19.600 --> 56:22.480]  absolutely but those are all just low-level
[56:22.480 --> 56:26.720]  worker and since i'm the larger new world order pyramid colony
[56:26.720 --> 56:29.920]  and so i'm not to particularly really concerned with it we know their lawless
[56:29.920 --> 56:31.480]  we know their criminal
[56:31.480 --> 56:34.720]  we know they commit whatever crimes they want
[56:34.720 --> 56:36.440]  or they pass laws
[56:36.440 --> 56:39.400]  excusing themselves you know there are hundreds of laws
[56:39.400 --> 56:41.200]  that congress has passed
[56:41.200 --> 56:44.280]  uh... special exemptions for themselves
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.400]  and here's an example the new york stock exchange is allowed
[56:48.400 --> 56:49.280]  to
[56:49.280 --> 56:52.280]  launder drug money and to solicit
[56:52.280 --> 56:53.960]  narcotics funds
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.120]  as long as it is done directly outside the u.s. and wired in
[56:58.120 --> 57:01.680]  i mean they'll swat team your house
[57:01.680 --> 57:03.960]  you know one or for
[57:03.960 --> 57:05.360]  from texas folks
[57:05.360 --> 57:08.560]  they will swat team your house for
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.000]  you know well i guess one gram of cocaine
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.480]  but did they publicly will launder the money into the federal reserve banks
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.160]  so and that's just one example of hundreds
[57:19.160 --> 57:22.560]  and don't roll your eyes police you go look that law
[57:22.560 --> 57:26.820]  the roiders is reported on it in his connection to richard grasshop
[57:26.820 --> 57:28.720]  former head of the
[57:28.720 --> 57:31.960]  new york stock exchange just in fact you know what you're rolling your eyes

[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:45.200]  or
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:48.120]  it was some type of psychological warfare test
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:51.440]  uh... that well i mean what was there real why did they serve
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:54.840]  when was this
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:59.040]  couple months ago
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:02:59.800]  i
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:02.240]  this is why it's not my time
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:09.240]  it's a friend of my son
[1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:11.840]  okay go ahead and finish on your story
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:15.600]  well uh... a friend of my son was telling him that
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:16.960]  not my son
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:19.680]  okay i had somebody coming in talking to me but
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:22.160]  while you were talking asking me about a guest so i
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:25.440]  missed about five seconds what you said start over
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:28.800]  so i was uh... a friend of my son
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:31.520]  was telling my son this story
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:35.680]  that happened to him
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:36.840]  and i
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:41.880]  just you know i'm sitting there going i i can't believe why
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.360]  uh... this would occur
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:45.840]  was this person in special operations
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:48.360]  i don't know what he does
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:49.640]  i am not sure
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:51.920]  but see that's just total rumor it's kinda
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:54.280]  i don't know what this guy does and
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:55.560]  and and
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:59.360]  my son talked to him and he told me this but but he said he was in the army
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:00.760]  yeah and that they
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:02.600]  called in how many of them
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:04.280]  a group
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:06.080]  that's all he said a group
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:08.480]  and then said we blew the towers up
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:13.640]  showed him
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.480]  well i would imagine if i had to guess what this is that that that it was a
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:21.040]  person uh...
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:23.840]  in intelligence who's actually nine eleven truth or
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:27.400]  and showed a group of people because our films are all over the bases
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:29.480]  we know we've got people in every level of government
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:32.600]  and then they misconstrued it and thought they were being shown some
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.880]  secret but it is we do have up close
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:38.040]  but it's and we do clearly have the blast webs going off and
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:40.280]  we can clearly pause the video
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:43.000]  of the quote playing coming in and doesn't look like a plane
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.200]  and it's a missile
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:47.400]  i would imagine that that is what happened and then
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:50.320]  you ever seen the game where you get around a table and tell one person that
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:51.960]  one thing and the next person
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.440]  the next thing but but stay there

[1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:58.560]  and i don't think you're lying i don't think your son's lying i just think

[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:05.320]  more than seven hundred chemicals have been found in our drinking water and
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.240]  did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while

[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:57.280]  to sixty one years they've been around since nineteen forty seven he and his father set
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:03.760]  up calvin pure soap when he got out of the chemical core in the military over in japan
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:08.080]  and he came back and set up a company that his father and he started and now his son
[1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:16.080]  and a family are running out of oakland california i want to be clear when you buy organic soap
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:22.160]  at the store you normally pay about twice what you would pay for the chemical detergent
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:29.240]  byproducts of petrochemical you see in the refining of oil in the gasoline they they
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:34.680]  want to use everything that's left and so including the fluoride and so they say oh
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.680]  fluoride nutritious for your teeth you know it's a toxic sedative and they put it in your
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:43.480]  water or they would have to store it and get rid of it and i would cut into profits and
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:48.840]  they've got all these other chemicals and sulfurs and things and they they they end up turning
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:55.600]  that into the products that go into your soaps i know this because my great uncle just retired
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:01.880]  a few years ago ran all the way from rough neck up uh... was the head of a plant that
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:06.360]  made everything one of the biggest plants in houston but but side issue of every little
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:11.640]  kid and get the tour of it being told all about it but but but side issue the point
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:17.800]  is is that you end up paying about twice as much for something based out of orange or
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:26.800]  cherry or other fruits other citrus is excellent as cleaners other vegetable uh... products
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.360]  well that doesn't happen with calvin to herself because you cut out all the middlemen it isn't
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:36.560]  some johnny cum lately organic soap company and it's not in whole foods or something else
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:42.560]  that then has a huge yuppie you know trendy markup no you don't pay twice for clean healthy
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:51.840]  real soap chemical and tear free you pay eighty five percent off what you would pay
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:57.280]  not for organic so if you pay double that but chemical soaps that aren't really soaps
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:03.880]  soap in name only unlike republican in name only rhinos so this is just great stuff and
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:10.640]  i've told you i was sent a box of this because the sales manager was a conservative but also
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:16.040]  an environmentalist he was in a great values he also had allergies and didn't like regular
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:21.760]  soaps and said hey man you ought to hear about this this marty and calvin to herself he wants
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:25.440]  to send you some and i said okay this is about six seven years ago now i forget sends me
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:30.680]  a box it runs out a year later little it was not a little box not a huge box last all year
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:35.320]  because i want more of that so i said why not get him as a sponsor so we did and that's
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:41.320]  the rest of the story but i bring you great deals you know i tell you by gold and it goes
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:45.640]  from two hundred and sixty four dollars an ounce to a thousand uh...
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:50.760]  i tell you to get silver one six bucks an ounce and it's nineteen i tell you buy firearms
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:54.720]  they're gonna go up in value get ammo five years ago to go up in value and was quadrupled
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:12:00.360]  in cost i mean i just i track things i interviewed the experts i know what i'm talking about
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:04.600]  and you hurt the new world order and the oil companies you're not going to be able to save
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:09.720]  on your gas but at least you don't have to then go by their petrochemical detergents
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:14.520]  that they call soap and cleaners they give you asthma and fry you and attack your mucus
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:24.000]  membranes no you can save money support marty support this show and not give the oil company
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.100]  some money when they're already taken so much from you so uh... marty good to have you

[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:19.080]  soap still sticking to that old fashioned formula which doesn't burn the clothes that
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:25.240]  deteriorate the clothing burn the skin uh... calode everything it comes in contact with
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:28.000]  and cost of fortune

[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:34.520]  of our pure soap product
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:39.440]  it's been really gratifying well well marty run down
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:42.240]  how you started the company the same
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:46.640]  formula as you had sixty almost sixty one years ago
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:51.240]  run down what is in it why it's so good and how you're able to give it to people for eighty
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:52.560]  five percent off
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:54.360]  well in nineteen forty seven
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:57.160]  my father retired from civil service
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:13:59.640]  i just got out of the chemical warfare
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:00.360]  core
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:03.280]  uh... after serving a couple years in the army
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:08.160]  and we were sort of looking at what was going on in the country being together again
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:09.280]  as you know
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:11.960]  i see something happening in the supermarket
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:13.400]  there's no more so
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.640]  and my dad says oh yeah it's always so and now
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:18.280]  it's detergent
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:21.160]  soap is a history hurt hope is an antique
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.280]  it's all detergent now
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:26.720]  coming from formulas of captured germany
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:28.760]  this is what's going on and we decided
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:30.960]  well why don't we start a very small
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:31.880]  family
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:33.480]  soap company
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:37.120]  and and my father says yeah we can do that and i said well i don't know how we
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:38.080]  could do that
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:41.320]  to compete against proctor lever and colgate
[1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:45.320]  billion dollar corporations and here we are just two individuals
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:46.480]  without why
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:49.040]  it's not a little soap company
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:54.040]  and he gave me the four magic words which i live by all these years
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:15:00.200]  and those who are the four words
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.560]  did we just lose marty
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:03.720]  no no i'm looking for my four words
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:05.000]  well i'll go
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.080]  be twice as good
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:10.080]  and you can make it
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:11.680]  that's what our philosophy
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:12.760]  that our product that
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:14.800]  literally twice as good
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.920]  is what's available on the shelves
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:18.320]  at the marketplace
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:20.680]  and we stand by it we guarantee it
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:23.680]  that nothing like our pure soap bars
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:26.000]  our shampoo our dish soap
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.240]  our laundry soap that's all the product
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:30.120]  and they'll do a hundred jobs
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:31.840]  and we're staying with you we've got
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:32.760]  savings
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:34.520]  unbelievable savings
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:36.480]  i've got a formula here
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:37.760]  that if you bought
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:39.560]  a one-year supply
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:42.160]  and invested including the freight and everything
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:43.720]  a hundred and eighty dollars
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:45.600]  that's your investment for a year
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:47.600]  that comes out to three dollars
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:50.760]  and fifty cents a week
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:55.720]  an average family right now is spending over twenty dollars a week
[1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:59.720]  for cleaning products that is for every dollar they spend in the supermarket
[1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:01.360]  twenty cents a dollar
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:03.280]  goes for cleaning chemicals
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:06.320]  well it don't take much and this is a ten-year-old figure
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:08.120]  to spend a hundred dollars
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:10.120]  a week at the marketplace
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:13.000]  for your states and vegetables and canned goods
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.600]  and and bakery goods
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:16.000]  and cleaning products
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.520]  a hundred dollars a week
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:19.200]  that's pretty low-ball figure
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:20.840]  that's poverty level
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:22.640]  now under a hundred
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:27.680]  twenty dollars of that goes for tide and all and dash and cheer and and and
[1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:29.160]  dial and and
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:29.960]  dash it
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:34.880]  at an endless array of chemicals for the floor for the windows for the body
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:37.680]  for the hair for the laundry
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:39.520]  at twenty dollars a week
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:40.760]  versus three
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:41.960]  fifty a week
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:43.120]  for alcohol
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:46.000]  that sixteen and a half dollars
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  every week
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.160]  now we're not bashing some of the other or organic companies that have come along
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:53.720]  uh... but then we want to that's real harsh
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:56.760]  you know they're having to pay for advertising in the market for the store
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:59.280]  that's another reason you're getting this at eighty five percent off what the
[1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:01.280]  detergent garbage is
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:04.360]  is because it's directly from the man who makes it

[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:18.600]  you've got the floor with as much detail as you can you say you know this young man
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:23.080]  friends with your son you know he's in the army you know he's been in iraq he comes
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:27.160]  back freaking out calling his family telling your son about all this
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:30.120]  specifically start at the beginning again
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:38.680]  all right this is you know the only thing that i know is that at his base
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:50.360]  a group soldiers were brought in a room i guess by the cia and shown films
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:25:08.920]  of the world trade center bombing and the the pentagon and and it was i you know just what
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:18.520]  i told you it they showed films of of bombs going off is what they said and then they
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:25.880]  they told a film of a plane coming in to the pentagon and they said plane plane plane and
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:34.600]  then they go they put it on still and and then they said missile and and uh can we go back for
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:41.000]  a minute because we talked off air and you told me some things uh specifically here sir
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:48.040]  let's talk about you talked about it flashing secret across the video let's go back and talk
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:54.600]  about uh whatever else was said concerning bombs in the buildings and uh was was this
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:59.320]  friend of your sons from the military the army saying to be clear on record that the cia was
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:09.720]  saying we did this they i don't know if they ever said uh that they did it they just said
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:16.920]  you know here's well i i'm not really sure i guess the uh but the whole point is he's
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:21.960]  freaked out and came home and and i mean let's be clear here about what you're saying sir make it
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:28.280]  make it simple for us to understand okay yeah i mean in a nutshell you were implying and then
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.480]  off air you were saying that he came back freaked out thinking the government did it i mean that's
[1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:39.240]  what he brought away from this yes yes okay i mean i'm not trying to interrogate you i'm trying to
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:48.280]  find out i know i know it just uh you know it just yeah he he was freaked out he he he he
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:54.440]  he called his parents from the base uh afterwards and and he was he didn't know what to do and he
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:27:05.560]  was freaking out then okay and uh and he came back home a while ago for a brief time and uh
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:13.800]  yeah and you told me this happened off air two months ago approximately okay um well i appreciate
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:19.000]  you calling with this it may have been of some psych warfare test because that coming this is why
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:26.920]  i wanted to run it by you uh just to get your opinion on it i i don't know exactly what it is
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:36.760]  and i i've been like you know why i'm just trying to understand why uh even if it were true why they
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:42.360]  would be doing this but off air you were saying you know this young man you trust him you know him
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:47.480]  well your son you're saying he's you know the guy's a father a new father he's totally freaked out
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:54.200]  about this yes sounds like some kind of nasty test you see that coincides around the time
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:59.720]  that they know we're flooding the trips with uh terror storm and loose change final cut
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:06.920]  with um mark dice's operation and they may have been psych testing psych warfare testing
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:12.040]  what the response would be you know if the troops were told by authority figures
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:16.520]  that the government did it and i'm not trying to say oh my god we've got the smoking gun and
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:21.960]  poo poo that the government would admit they did it uh it's just that it's so highly compartmentalized
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:26.600]  we know the government did do it at criminal elements uh but but but but to have those compartments
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:33.720]  then telling the troops uh that they did it it's just extremely bizarre so i'm i'm just
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:41.880]  but that's what that's what i was having you know i i really couldn't you know what this guy was
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:49.400]  saying uh although i do believe every word he said but i i i'm trying to understand the rationale
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:55.720]  well specifically anything else they said i mean after i mean so they said that's a missile you
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:28:58.760]  know you think it's a plane but it's really a missile what else did they say to him
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:07.160]  well that's about all he would disclose well you say about all i mean think go back there's more
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:09.640]  believe me there's always more what else did he say
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:18.200]  take your time we're gonna break i want you to think about it during the break you can hold over
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:26.520]  right yeah okay i want it because you sound like you believe and i have no doubt that that this is
[1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:31.240]  probably what happened it's just take chris jones who snuck into behemian grove and got the footage
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:36.440]  he showed it to teenage kids in the neighborhood and they arrested him saying that he showed a
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:42.120]  video of a baby being killed and then he went to court and then he went to prison for it so see
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:48.920]  america's so dumbed down that uh they might watch star wars and think luke skywalkers real
[1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:55.960]  they might have been watching one of our films we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[1:29:55.960 --> 1:30:05.000]  jones and the gcn radio network did you know that ph balance is one of the most important factors

[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:17.560]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind this is why we need to take
[1:33:17.560 --> 1:33:23.080]  more calls on this show because so many times we get amazing leads from listeners and they're able
[1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:30.040]  to figure it out what's really happening and we break major stories this could have really happened
[1:33:30.040 --> 1:33:39.080]  the way our listener is interpreting it i find it likely i don't know how likely but but likely
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:47.560]  that someone in intelligence showed them somebody who's on our side and we know we've got a lot of
[1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:55.720]  them showed them footage except for the part about secret being across the tape i i would have to
[1:33:56.920 --> 1:34:02.440]  talk to this young man to try to figure it out exactly what he's saying is he back in iraq or
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:11.240]  is he here in the united states um he's he's in the united states for a while well i can give you
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:18.600]  my phone number i've got your phone number about the only other thing that that i remember you asked
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:30.280]  me to remember and the other thing from um that i remember is that um he was saying that in the
[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:37.880]  film they showed him um the explosions at the world trade center started at the bottom and that's
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:47.400]  what he was saying that that uh that uh and this is why i think there was a a different camera set
[1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:58.600]  up because they were uh this camera was like evidently in a position that others weren't
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:06.440]  and that that's the one thing that kind of really surprised me from what well now that
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:12.280]  actually fits they had explosives up top and on the bottom from the different eyewitnesses police
[1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:19.160]  fireman william rodriguez and others uh it's on record hundreds of witnesses of bombs going off
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:25.320]  explosions in the basement in the first levels and there's even on video on the news you hear big
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:34.440]  booms booms before they start blowing the top of the building as well oh this is what he said i mean
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:39.560]  did he say why the quote cia was showing him did he say the number of people that were taken
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:53.080]  aside to show this no no it could be a handful it could be 50 100 i don't know and so you know
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:57.160]  this young man you were telling me and and and then you say you you believe your son did this
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:01.960]  young man tell you this or did your son tell you this about the young man you know my son told me

[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:16.040]  around us they're killing most of them it's just going to go on and on on because the people are
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:20.520]  too afraid to admit it to themselves and we could change this tomorrow but it didn't go to stop
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:27.000]  it's just going to get wilder and crazier and more evil and i just can't believe it because life's
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:32.920]  so good i don't want to be fighting this i'm about to get upset i want to be fishing and i want to
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:37.720]  be boating and i want to be hiking and i want to be camping and a garden and i want to be oil
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:42.200]  painting and fiddling around and visiting family and going to the beach and building sand castles

[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:54.120]  much for your courage and calling in greg and i believe that you you are putting this out as
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:59.160]  you interpret it i only hope it's something else and we already know it's an inside job but
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:03.880]  they're arrogantly telling the select groups they did it it's god knows the method of these
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:09.960]  people's madness but i i appreciate you calling in really appreciate it i'll give him the number

[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:25.560]  it's the put up or shut up make a decision point for all the police out there listening
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:30.600]  the military government people social engineers social workers the good the bad the ugly i know
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:36.200]  some of your good some of your bad most of your like all of us dumbed down compartmentalized
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:42.120]  not fully cognizant the world's complex i don't blame you for trying to you know tune out a reality
[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:48.600]  i mean i understand how that's a learning and a lot of you just muddle through life not thinking
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:54.120]  about the ramifications of what you're involved in but i have medical doctors and scientists
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:40:00.280]  on all the time i read to you where you can get the documents how you can go to library congress
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:08.120]  where you can get them on government websites how they have created hundreds of cancer viruses i
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:13.880]  play dr sock in a cbc outtake they just released last year the guy that invented who was a eugenicist
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:18.120]  by the way the polio vaccine the evidence shows it was a bio weapon he invented that as well
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:25.240]  weaponized it bragging and laughing about how they use monkeys from bio weapons test to create
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:30.280]  the vaccines and now hundreds of millions of americans got cancer from it now we already knew that and
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:36.280]  told you that 10 years ago on this show but to have that son of a bitch sitting there laughing
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:44.200]  in his white lab coat it isn't funny all right i said i wasn't gonna get mad see i can't it freaks
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:51.000]  me out but it freaks me out worse that a lot of you out there just laugh about me and laugh about
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:57.640]  the stuff that's going on so many people think they're part of the system and part of the elite and
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:04.920]  so many of you think that it's all funny and you just laugh at everything that people that care
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:10.360]  enough to warn you are telling you people that have the courage to go up against this evil system
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:16.120]  you see imagine the establishment people out there that want to be establishment folks that
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:20.680]  think they're part of the system and who just boot lick it and lie to themselves and engage in
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:26.680]  double think and crime stop in their minds in this Orwellian world they think we're crazy
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:38.040]  they think we're nuts and there are a lot of dis info people and people that are unstable
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:47.160]  in this movement but they're like that in life itself and and and the alternative and and the
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:52.840]  the dark side of the world is going to attract unstable people so the establishment can always
[1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:58.600]  point at the dis info that's put out and say oh see you're all full of bull no we're not full of
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:03.880]  bull here on this show i mean we tell you they created the hiv virus we give you the documents
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:07.720]  we have the guest on we tell you where to get them from the government
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:13.720]  we tell you the u.s government funded israel to irradiate 110 000 their children killing more
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.400]  than half of them i mean we're talking killing more than 50 000 children
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:26.520]  and that's even on israeli television and haraq and the jerusalem post and you still laugh and
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:34.920]  deny it's going on and the atomic testing on children and gis and their wives and the spraying
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:43.320]  of bases and the military and cities and a bunch of power mad mad scientist now there's
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:48.440]  a reason that's an archetype in literature because that's real just having their way with
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:43:00.600]  us getting away with all of this darkness and i know it's hard to believe as i've said i mean
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:10.520]  that that some family man would dress up like a clown with a big red face and go out and pick up
[1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:13.720]  teenagers and take them back and torture them and rape them and then kill them and then
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:18.600]  the wife would smell the stench and didn't know what it was and then
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:21.960]  when the police finally pulled up the boards of the floor she couldn't believe it i don't know
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:29.960]  what was it 15 20 kids in there i forget we can look it up john wangacy or ted bundy or the hillside
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:43.480]  strangler son of sam the zodiac never caught probably a cop man that guy up in missouri who was
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:48.360]  the government official killing all those women and he said he did it because he was bored they
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:56.920]  they was fun brought excitement to life whereas i want to pull over and go into a mexican food
[1:43:56.920 --> 1:44:03.000]  restaurant and drink big goblets of beer and eat enchiladas but i don't because it's unhealthy
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:11.880]  you know normal people have those type of desires no no they don't want to pull over and eat
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:19.160]  enchiladas and drink beer they want to pull over and pick a hitchhiker off the road and take them
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:24.680]  back to a cabin somewhere in torturum for two weeks i mean you think about the cases they've
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:28.920]  caught with these pedophile rings in europe and the us where they'll find whole basements full
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:33.560]  of dead toddlers and after they're done selling the toddlers out to the european union chiefs
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:38.840]  that came out in the news they just lock the door and the three-year-olds all starved to death in
[1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:44.280]  the dark do you imagine closing three-year-olds up and letting them starve to death
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:53.560]  but see to them that's fun to hear them and in fact it was reported in some of these cases
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:57.800]  they would just sit there for hours listening to the begging and crying loving it whereas
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:05.560]  that would tear my guts out and tear my very soul out they love it they feed on it and you can't
[1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:11.320]  tell me that doesn't exist but see i tell you that that exists in the power elite and that's too
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:18.360]  scary and so you say no it's not true well it is true and you look at history it's been proven over
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:25.880]  and over and over again and every night when i go to sleep i think oh my gosh i have picked a
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:33.480]  fight with these people i go i have gone head up against them and we've woken a lot of people up
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:37.720]  thanks to the courage of the listeners of this show and all the tireless wonderful work you've
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:47.560]  done and the brave valiant nightly uh commitments that so many of you have made to fighting tyranny
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:52.360]  and and to get a chance to meet you and know you and know what great people you are and to know
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:58.280]  that i don't even live up to the lofty view you have of me and to realize that we have millions
[1:45:58.280 --> 1:46:02.360]  of listeners and the responsibility of that realizing that every day millions of people tune
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:07.800]  in and to realize there's a giant throng a sea of people out there listening right now and
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:15.240]  i don't know what to say or what to do i i don't have all the answers all the solutions we are in
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:25.240]  a world of hurt folks it's bad our government would radiate 110 000 children in israel tens of
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:32.360]  thousands in the u.s four thousand three hundred one test to death they would march our troops into
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:39.400]  chambers and nerve gas them murder them our own government and then there's people who are in denial
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:44.280]  about it or most the people attacking me say on youtube as a case point example and i don't spend
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:49.480]  much time on it i only look at it a few minutes about five minutes this morning to try to monitor
[1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:55.800]  enemy activity and a lot of them are so boastful they admit they're in psyops i mean this is the
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:47:03.640]  quality of the agents they have giggling burbling people that chant and brag about killing iraqis
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:08.760]  and that go on my message boards on the youtube and the dig and say yes we're going to kill you
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:12.680]  yes we're going to take you to camps and then you get their handle name and you go to their
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:19.800]  myspace or their flicker page and they are in the military and they do have psyop patches and
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:27.160]  they're so unprofessional i mean even if they're going to be evil it's the unprofessionalism adds
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:32.840]  another layer of just horrifying to it because you can tell they're just young dumb kids and they
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:39.080]  have no idea the type of deep black water they're swimming in they think they're immune from what
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:43.720]  they've joined they think they are immune from the system that they've gotten involved with
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:52.760]  and then everybody else is sorrow and pain and horror is cute and funny and they laugh on these
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:58.040]  things about dead kids and dead puppies when we post the videos and they they they talk about
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:02.680]  how they're going to put us in camps and they talk about how they're going to kill us i know the
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:07.800]  listeners of the show go you many of you've seen it and you find out it's not a joke i mean so many
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:14.120]  times i think this is some patriot posing uh as a new allure person to make him look bad some weird
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:19.560]  reverse propaganda and it's not you go and they're in scent com they're in black ops they're in
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:25.880]  special operations they're in the marines they're in iraq with other videos next to them really
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:34.040]  believing this in fact john i sent you a video do you have the one that's a clip of me screaming
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:41.640]  death death death death to america okay now now i had it printed out but i can't find it here in my
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:47.160]  stack i forget the title of the video but it's one of the new ones in the last two days i saw it
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:53.000]  this morning and i did i couldn't spend all day on this so i'm asking listeners to
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:00.200]  i'm asking listeners to go and find it because it was about six eight months ago i did
[1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:06.200]  it i was doing a rant about soldiers killing children in iraq shooting them for fun in the video
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:11.480]  of them shooting families and i said this is their attitude this is their chant as they kill america
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:18.120]  death death death death death to america and it's clear that i'm saying this is the new world order
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.520]  people killing america and killing the soul of america and in five minutes i didn't have time
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:27.880]  to find the clip i know you the listeners can find it i want you to take it and then edit what i
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.680]  really said into what this guy said because when you look at the propaganda he puts out
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:40.440]  and i'm seeing this everywhere and the sick part is some people are actually taking the bait
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:47.880]  with these edits that people are doing of me i mean they'll do edits where it sounds like i'm
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:52.280]  attacking jews and they'll do edits where it sounds like i'm saying i work for the vatican or
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:58.360]  they'll do edits where it's i'm saying i use drugs or they'll do edits all sorts of things
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:03.960]  and and again it isn't about me being attacked it's that i don't even hate this person i just
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:13.960]  feel sorry for them go ahead and play the clip death to america death to freedom death to america
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:29.080]  yes yes yes death to america death to freedom death to america yes yes yes death to america
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:37.720]  all right now and in there he has text of saying see alex jones says he hates america
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:45.480]  wants to kill america i mean imagine not just that it's a lie but that these guys are so delusional
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:50.760]  they don't even understand that people are going to take that and show how that's a lie and further
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:57.400]  discredit them i mean that's what's scary they're not even good they're just hamfisted

[1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:34.440]  and then they post on their websites pictures of ronald reagan
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:41.160]  you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:47.160]  for is being put to the sword by george bush but i won't even have that debate with you george
[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:54.040]  bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:59.800]  we've been deindustrialized we've been stripped mind politically economically and spiritually
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:06.360]  all we had left was our fiat dollar and it's hundreds of billions of dollar deficits per month
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:12.280]  with china alone now all those dollars are coming back buying up our entire country
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:21.880]  free and i burn with passion for this nation warts and all i know we're not perfect i burn
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:30.200]  with passion for this nation and i am so upset i am so saddened by how far we've fallen
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:36.760]  by what we've turned into and then to know that every word i say everything i do it's
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:41.320]  all over the web it has to be concerted now i'm not saying they're all government agents but
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:45.720]  most of them admit they're in the military and a lot of them say they're in psyops and that
[1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:53.800]  they're countering us and then other copycats and weak-minded people pick up on it and uh go out
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:56:01.000]  and start doing it and it's just i'm amazed that they are serving evil and that they really think
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:06.680]  we're the bad guys and i guess that's the thing about evil people a lot of them are delusional
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:10.200]  i guess reading about psychopaths that would pick up women and torture them and kill them
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:13.960]  you know when once they get caught they'd say that ugly bitch she was looking at me wrong
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:21.640]  she deserved to die she was bad she was dressed dirty you know i i guess they they even evil
[1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:28.280]  people rationalize what they're doing it's like those iraqis deserve to die it's you know we need
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:33.640]  to kill more of we need to nuke the whole place and but then i have to hear the news the troops
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:38.120]  are there to love the iraqis and give them freedom and democracy meanwhile you go read what the
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:42.920]  troops that like it are saying it's let's murder all of them and just kill them and slaughter
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:53.160]  everything and oh my god i love it it's so dark and they think it's not going to blow back on them
[1:56:53.160 --> 1:56:58.040]  you think you've got a global elite that has created monsters like you and that you are
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:04.120]  pet puppies and that you're going to be taken care of and then i get amazed that i'm the radical
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:14.840]  i'm the wild man i had alex jones he's so extreme my goodness you know he will read about plans to
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:25.880]  shut down the internet declaratives declarations of war against free speech everywhere and then
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:29.880]  i'm not supposed to be concerned about it i said i would get daughter nick baggachan let's call him
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:35.400]  and get him on about 15 after he's always flexible because i want to come back and get into the attack
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:40.280]  on the internet it is very very important i'm late getting into that i know we have uh

[1:57:55.080 --> 1:57:59.560]  the only way to counter a lie is to deal with that lie and expose that lie but the problem is
[1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:06.120]  when there just becomes a background shatter of noise there's no point in even countering and
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:10.840]  you just have to judge a tree by its fruits you will know them by their fruits our fruits
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:16.840]  are good and decent and honorable are we perfect no let's fade that music down for a moment and
[1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:24.120]  let's leave them with this hour with me edited to sound like uh with disinfo by the military

[2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:22.040]  radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:33.480]  there is a excellent story out of reality check posted up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:39.640]  death of the free internet is imminent candidate will be the test case i'm going to cover part
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:45.720]  of this article in one moment but first let me in most basic of terms give you the declared
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:54.200]  publicly stated plan by a consortium of universities corporations and governments
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:04.200]  this is very very important six years ago i learned of an organization called internet
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:12.040]  tube they've met in london austin texas tokyo chicago this consortium puts out a declaration
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:18.760]  each year the internet is dead and we killed it they report that they have built and we're
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:24.120]  building over the last 10 years but i learned of it six years ago seven years ago i guess it was
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:32.360]  about in 2001 so i guess it's almost seven years that they are building a new high speed internet
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:36.920]  grid the phone companies and the government and universities are working together to do it and
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:43.320]  that they are going to force the old internet traffic over onto that system and not upgrade
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:50.280]  the uh original switching hubs and systems within uh what we knew is the organic internet
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:57.080]  now when cogent level three just a couple years ago we're in a fight for a week and a half about
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:00.600]  a third of the internet was down remember that that was just two backbone providers who were
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:06.600]  smaller by the way their scores of them not letting traffic go over each other's systems
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:11.960]  because they were in a fight with each other and it crippled the internet well if they would have
[2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:18.680]  just passed a law ending that neutrality a year ago you would have seen the internet descend
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:23.880]  into that overnight so there's a lot of different facets that internet too is using but they don't
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:29.080]  want to do that till internet too is fully in place now they have built internet too and they're
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:33.400]  going to say well you come over here and get on this internet but you've got to be tracked your
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:37.880]  isp's got to be tracked you're going to be taxed you've got to pay to be on this internet there's
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:43.800]  only going to be a few thousand websites and choices uh on this internet some people will
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:49.400]  be allowed to have subsites on those like myspace but you'll sign a contract where they can restrict
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:54.440]  you or control you or automatically block certain keywords or videos this is all being announced
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:03:01.480]  and so the internet as you know it is is is being ended as being dismantled then time warner
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:09.240]  and comcast in texas in new york and other places as well as england two big internet providers
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:14.840]  have announced they will control and and give preferential treatment to go to certain classes
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:22.040]  of websites big corporate sites but slow down or block altogether other individual sites that
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:29.240]  aren't on these master lists so it's a filter they make you go through save you're on time
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:33.480]  warner cable in austin you'll notice we've type in a wrong url it's on a computer error on your
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:39.240]  screen now you're on the time warner screen they're now directing everything through their system do
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:51.240]  you understand just amazing and so they've got a multifaceted attack that they are carrying out
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:55.880]  they're forcing everybody over to internet too they can regulate control tax trace everything
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:04:03.480]  you're doing make you pay to get on while they don't repair the old hubs while the companies
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:08.200]  start ending agreements with each other saying well we're allowed to let internet one die and
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:14.120]  then forcing you over to internet too but that isn't killing things fast enough for them
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:21.000]  france england canada china and scores of other nations are building firewalls with tens of thousands
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:27.960]  of names websites and systems from info wars dot com to the bbc that are being blocked out
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:36.280]  there's other censorship companies university schools libraries city free wi-fi systems that
[2:04:36.280 --> 2:04:41.880]  aren't free pay for with tax money they're now getting master list and blocking things so see
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:49.080]  it's a whole which is blue of systems to bring it down but now there's been new developments
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:53.480]  we will cover these huge developments on the other side of this break this is how
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:58.360]  they are killing the internet right now it's happening now you're not going to have to wait to see it

[2:08:42.440 --> 2:08:48.120]  saying well companies have a right to not service and feed these old systems into other companies
[2:08:48.120 --> 2:08:53.960]  we're just moving on to a more advanced but more limited and more elite network and yes this is a
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:59.880]  private slash governmental network and so you don't have free speech on this system and they also
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:05.080]  have censorship of speech and prosecution of speech and calls the tax the internet
[2:09:06.280 --> 2:09:12.680]  and and and to control how much you can download or how much you can serve but now the big the two
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:21.160]  big telecoms in canada france is also calling for this have now come out and said we're going to
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:27.800]  limit the number of sites you can go to period see there you go just to end that wild surfing
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:35.480]  because it's killing the mainstream media that's one of the big reasons it is discrediting the
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:42.760]  establishment darpa dubbed it in the 80s the worldwide web after they'd fully developed it and
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:48.680]  launched it because they wanted to use it as a worldwide wiretap and they've done that but people
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:52.920]  aren't intimidated and aren't scared by all that we're spying on you you're we're watching you
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:58.440]  we're tracking you people said so what tyrants okay follow me track me go to hell is basically what
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:03.320]  they've said so now they're like oh yeah we'll just get rid of it death of the free internet is
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:09.800]  imminent candidate will be the test case the last 15 years or so as a society we have access to more
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:14.280]  information than ever before in modern history because of the internet there are approximately
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:19.640]  one billion internet users in the world and any one of these users can theoretically communicate
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:26.360]  in real time with anyone else in the planet the internet has been the greatest technological
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:32.360]  achievement of the 20th century by far yeah it's bigger than the a bomb and has been recognized
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:38.840]  as such by the global community the free transfer of information uncensored unlimited and untainted
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:44.360]  still seems to be a dream when you think about it whatever field that is mentioned education
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:49.720]  commerce government news entertainment politics countless other areas have been radically affected
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:54.520]  by the introduction of the internet it lowered the playing field and the elite are losing the
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:59.880]  ballgame now so they're going to turn over the checkerboard i added that part and mostly it's
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:05.400]  good news except with poor judgments are made and people are taken advantage of but that happens
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:09.640]  with freedom folks it's much better than tyranny security and oversight are needed especially
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:14.680]  when children are involved however when there are potential profits open to corporations
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:20.040]  the needs of society don't count see they're hijacking the web we paid for and we built that's
[2:11:20.040 --> 2:11:26.760]  the key here take the recent case in canada with the behemoths tell us in rogers rolling out a
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:31.800]  charge for text messaging without any warning to the public it was an arrogant and risky move the
[2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:36.600]  telecommunications giant because it backfired and that's the key you've got to leave them when they
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:42.120]  do this because once they all do it you can't escape because actually use internet technology
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:47.400]  to deliver a loud and clear message to these companies and that was to scrap the extra charge
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:52.520]  the people use the power of the internet against the big boys and the little guys one however
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:57.320]  the issue of text messaging is just the tip and a tiny blip on the radar screens of tell
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:02.680]  us in another company bell canada the two largest internet service providers or isps in canada
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:07.800]  our country is being used as a test case for dramatically change the delivery of internet
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:13.560]  service forever so is texas the charge will be so radical and the change will be so radical
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:19.640]  that it has the potential to send us back to the horse and buggy days of information sharing and access
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:27.640]  in the upcoming weeks not months watch for a report in time magazine that will attempt to smooth over
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:34.440]  the rough edges of a diabolical plot by bell canada and tell us now listen to me carefully
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:42.280]  folks this is huge to begin charging per site fees on most internet sites see they're going to
[2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.760]  charge you to go to info wars in prison planet but you won't be charged to go to time Warner
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:51.960]  they admit that thousands of the big boys are going to pay fees to be listed and if it isn't on
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:57.240]  the loud list on the firewall then you don't go there we'll see then next it'll be you're not
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:03.000]  allowed to go there canada's already called the block my website and others the plan is to convert
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:07.640]  the internet into a cable like system where consumers sign up for specific websites and then
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:14.040]  pay to visit sites beyond a cutoff point now they have links to the announcement it's happening
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:20.840]  ladies and gentlemen and if they're able to get this over on the well-meaning jolly head in the
[2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:27.480]  clouds canadiens i mean americans are completely ignorant and brainwashed but canadiens tend to
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:31.880]  be more informed on international politics but have no idea how tyrannical their government
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:39.720]  is it's a velvet fisted tyranny the corporate marauders will iron out the wrinkles in canada
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:44.440]  and then spring the new castrated version of the internet on the rest of the world probably
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:49.960]  a little fanfare except for some dire warnings about the evil of the internet and the free internet
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:54.360]  and the ceo spouting about safety and security these buzzwords usually work pretty well
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:01.000]  and then they go into what will the internet look like in 2010
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.320]  and i want to get nick budges just take on this do we have him
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:10.040]  we now go to dr nick baggage under nick baggage serves as executive director of the lay

[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:35.800]  bio weapons chemical weapons uh surveillance that is admitted but not known not generally known so
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:39.880]  for all intents and purposes secret and because people are not aware of it so i want to talk to
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:45.960]  him on about a host of issues the next hour and 35 40 minutes that we have him uh for really honored
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:52.920]  to to be talking to him but i did find the story today uh it's up on info wars dot com from reality
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:58.760]  check and did go and confirm that the big isps in canada are going to go ahead and go to internet
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:03.800]  two in the next few months they're going to try it and i wanted to get because i know you've been
[2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:10.200]  on top of this to talk about the multi-pronged attack on the internet that is now now happening
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:15.080]  uh there uh time warner's doing this in some towns in texas and i wanted to get your expert
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:19.640]  take on that as a technologist on uh what we're facing a and how you think we should counter it
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:25.720]  dr baggots well you know the internet itself has been um you at when it first started you know
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:31.880]  everybody was uh sort of non-commercial you know it's all all about geeks and uh high technology
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:37.560]  and eventually it became you know big commercial uh enterprise i mean when you really think about it
[2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:44.520]  from a globalist perspective it's it's always been about markets and building patterns and uh
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:49.720]  incomes and when you start to look at look at what they've um amassed the biggest issue with the
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:55.080]  internet is personal privacy which is still not adequately uh guarded in in my view you know when
[2:16:55.080 --> 2:17:00.760]  you think about all of the data banks surrounding uh our lives today you know used to be that that
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:05.800]  the doorway to your home was the threshold to your privacy and today it's really a digital
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:11.400]  doorway and so when you talk about the internet it's it's more than just the commercial aspects
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:18.760]  and certainly um making money uh on the internet has been uh in the way of tracking data has been
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:23.640]  one thing but the data itself is valuable when you can look at a person's profile when you start to
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:30.520]  look at millions and millions of people's activity and then their political uh persuasions uh sort
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:37.960]  of their background make you can really refine uh profiling becomes an art form of unbelievable
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:42.520]  predictability and so then you start to look at manipulation of that data and this is where
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:48.840]  targeted advertising comes into play on an unprecedented scale virtually being able to
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:56.120]  identify candidates political issues uh products that you're going to say yes to most likely and
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:18:00.600]  then that you become the target of that advertising and it's tying the entire world population into
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:06.280]  an NSA snooping grid so they can build detailed psychological algorithms and truly know your
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:11.320]  heart of hearts uh it's much worse than physically surveilling you it surveils your your your most
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:17.080]  innermost secrets and it's also done in the comfort of your own home uh with our evolutionary
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:21.640]  development for feeling like we have privacy in our cave uh truly scanning and i'm not getting
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:27.480]  into an evolution debate i mean you know our development as humans uh just just just absolutely
[2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:31.480]  amazing but but i first were about to break want to get your take on their attempts to come in
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:37.880]  and regulate it and shut it down now yeah yeah absolutely you know when you when you look at
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:42.520]  when you look at the military side of it it's already been moved aside you know you got to go
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:46.600]  they have their own sort of search networks kind of excluded from the
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:53.960]  what most people deal with the research sites are getting pressed down as well where there's
[2:18:53.960 --> 2:19:02.120]  less and less access and and that whole constraining of data is really working against modern democracy
[2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:08.440]  in this century okay doc i want to skip the break for prison planet dot tv viewers and
[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:12.440]  people listening on the internet for everybody else you're listening on another stream uh you'll
[2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:16.280]  miss the next four minutes if not go to info wars dot com and click on the listen live button
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:19.960]  you'll be able to hear us talk i'm going to skip some of these breaks so that we don't waste time
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:23.400]  without your nick baggage we'll continue discussing everything with him right now
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:30.840]  okay doc uh we're going to come back in four minutes the full audience but let's not waste
[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:36.520]  time keep going with uh how you're chronicling what's happening to the web well when you start
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:40.760]  to look at all of it together and this is what we've tried to say in all of our writing and all
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:46.520]  of our work the last 15 years is when you start to you look at any one of these little snapshots
[2:19:46.520 --> 2:19:53.080]  within the sort of public bubble of information in the way the military and and planners nsa
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:58.840]  homeland insecurity whoever it is look at this is is incremental it's like one slice of the
[2:19:58.840 --> 2:20:04.200]  time something hits the news stays in the news for about 30 seconds and it's gone and when you
[2:20:04.200 --> 2:20:09.640]  start to connect it when you start to look at the aspects of the internet that truly created an
[2:20:09.640 --> 2:20:15.400]  environment where people could communicate at an unprecedented level exchange ideas without the
[2:20:15.400 --> 2:20:21.400]  filtering of a controlled media and and that is a dangerous thing from a globalist perspective
[2:20:21.400 --> 2:20:26.600]  ultimately when you start to look at then what was being gained by it i mean think about google
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:31.400]  recently i mean the chinese get to pick their brains to find out who to go beat up in the
[2:20:31.400 --> 2:20:37.160]  street or whatever thug approach to government they want to operate over there cooperation of
[2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:43.000]  telecommunications companies for surveillance of american populations then retroactively
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:47.320]  you know sort of saying oh we're we're sorry but no one's going to prosecute you
[2:20:47.320 --> 2:20:51.240]  even though you violate the civil liberties of everyone in the country
[2:20:51.240 --> 2:20:55.400]  when you look at the shutdown of the freedom of information act under this administration
[2:20:55.400 --> 2:21:00.200]  at a level that has been the slowest amount of information coming forward to the public that
[2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:06.040]  deserves to be public much of it 40 50 years old for goodness sake and you know that's been
[2:21:06.040 --> 2:21:10.440]  constrained the classifying of information at unprecedented level you know you made me think
[2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:15.400]  there before i forget let me ask you about this to elaborate there uh people always ask me well
[2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:19.560]  why did they declassify things 50 60 years ago that was incriminating or 20 years ago
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:23.640]  well back then we were more of a free society we we hadn't been fully taken over
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:30.920]  under the national security act of 47 there was a process of of usurp usurpation going on
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:37.720]  but now they do have to ban basically declassifying anything because now it can actually be used
[2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:44.040]  uh 20 30 years ago the corporate press was so narrowly controlled and regulated uh and and had
[2:21:44.040 --> 2:21:48.600]  so many spooks in it that so what have you got a declassified document that gulf of tonkin was
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:54.280]  staged you might labor and get a self-published book made that maybe a thousand people will read
[2:21:54.280 --> 2:22:01.800]  but then the so so now this this this knowledge can damage them oh yeah because people people
[2:22:01.800 --> 2:22:06.200]  like you people like me a lot of others all over the country and a lot of individual committees
[2:22:06.200 --> 2:22:12.120]  are one listening to this broadcast pick up information and pass it on and that you know the
[2:22:12.120 --> 2:22:17.480]  the true democracy in the 21st century is about information uh it's about being able to make sure
[2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:22.600]  that the integrity of information is good number one because if we if we digitize everything we
[2:22:22.600 --> 2:22:28.120]  put it all on the net you know history kind of becomes flexible um i like paper you know i'm a
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:33.400]  i'm a paper fiend when it comes to saving data because in the early days of the internet it was
[2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:38.440]  very unreliable you know you have to go pull the documents and stuff was quoted out of context and
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:44.120]  so on and you'd really have to look the paper up when we published our first book uh the book
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:49.640]  angels don't play this harp it was about um library work more than the internet you know our last
[2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:55.640]  book oh and i mean my first films back when i was first doing radio in 95 96 well tv 95
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:01.880]  ready 96 i remember going to the library every week right that's where we got our good information
[2:23:01.880 --> 2:23:06.200]  internet might have gave us a leader a tip but you couldn't trust it well then it changed and
[2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:11.960]  became you know more mainstream and more trustworthy but at the same time recognize uh data goes up
[2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:15.720]  data goes down a lot of things all of a sudden they're gone you know things you were referencing
[2:23:15.720 --> 2:23:20.840]  to people they're gone and this is why we've always printed out the paper and when you when you do
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:26.280]  that and you retain it then you start to string it together in a reasonable coherent form stay there
[2:23:26.280 --> 2:23:31.960]  we're going to come back to the full audience right now continue on the gcn radio network
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:39.800]  dr baggots is giving us a general lecture on some of the history of the internet
[2:23:41.400 --> 2:23:46.200]  how it gave rise to a huge research in community how now the government doesn't want to declassify
[2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:50.520]  anything because that information can now be shared and actually damage them whether they
[2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:56.280]  could be classified 20 years ago evidence about staging gulf of tonkin nobody could share it
[2:23:56.920 --> 2:24:01.080]  you had a few little research communities that knew about it and they could never get on television
[2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:06.200]  of the radio now that's all been shattered they have to shut down the web dr baggots i don't see
[2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:10.680]  any any choice they've tried to put out a bunch of background shatter the pentagons admitted for
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:16.520]  the last five years they're engaging in propaganda in the u.s and worldwide quote countering disinfo
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:25.000]  on the web uh now wikipedia engages in all sorts of lies and disinfo uh and and is now very
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:29.400]  disreputable i mean a few years ago they were a little bit better but still questionable uh so
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:34.040]  we're just seeing a lot of dirty tricks but now they're saying look we're just going to not let
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:38.120]  you have free access to the web and we're going to block out millions of websites and only lets
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:42.760]  you go to a few thousand corporate sites which sounds like a lot of choices but really isn't
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:48.920]  dr baggots this is exactly uh the wrong direction and you know when you look at telecommunications
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:53.960]  law and sort of how it's evolved it's really you know once again you can't look at any of
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:59.000]  these things in a vacuum and i know you and your audience don't do that you look at the whole picture
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:05.160]  and you start to see a very finely woven carpet that works against the average person works against
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:10.600]  individual sovereignty and the internet represents individual sovereignty in the 21st century our
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:17.720]  technologies of this century have the potential to enslave us or absolutely free us just to some
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:22.840]  incredible possibilities the kind of possibilities that i think we're envisioned a couple hundred
[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:27.560]  years ago i'm glad you always make that point i'm glad you always make that point under baggage
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:33.720]  because it isn't just that we don't want tyranny no we want all the incredible unimaginable dividends
[2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:39.000]  of true liberty go back to your founding father comment well you know and when you look back
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:43.800]  on that you know it was about being creative being an individual being able to take to your
[2:25:43.800 --> 2:25:49.560]  highest potentials with a government that didn't interfere with that in fact supported that supported
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:54.600]  that possibility and the government we've got today works against us it comes at us in a way
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:26:02.040]  that never before in the history of this country have we lived through a period such as this where
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:06.040]  people are really asleep at the switch in a lot of ways mostly because we're all fatigued you know
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.840]  they're where everybody's working a couple of jobs trying to stay ahead and the reality is
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:16.520]  that is the first step in what is reshaped so much of what's around us and when you look at
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:20.440]  the technologies that are available to us the internet where we're starting this conversation
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:25.480]  today you know what have we gotten from that well a community that actually can communicate in the
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:31.000]  scientific world not through the controls of that world you know science is controlled as well a
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:35.320]  lot of people don't realize it but it's the academic institutions that become the switching
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:41.400]  center for what gets validated and what gets set on the shelf till 50 years later everybody dies
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:46.680]  with their distortations and so with new ideas can come and that's predominantly done with funding
[2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:51.880]  and 90 plus percent of research funding is funded by the federal government and DARPA
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:26:57.320]  right and and the military you know then what happens is they fund all these projects
[2:26:57.320 --> 2:27:01.400]  and then if someone gets a little bit too out there in terms of talking to the public
[2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:07.160]  they sideline them and deny they ever participated you know it's what happened with Ben Eastland
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:13.800]  with with his work on the heart project initially you know they disavow him after the fact and he
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:19.480]  passed away just a few months ago and in fact i'm doing an interview with Wired magazine on
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:26.760]  harp in the next couple of days and his family sent me up the letterhead documents from apti and
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:32.600]  from arco supporting the fact that he actually set this program up something the military
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:37.400]  denies you know to this day which is remarkable you know when you start to think about it because
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:43.160]  that is the approach they've taken is they initiate all this activity then deny it until
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:49.480]  you extract it from a good friend of mine's dad was a us supreme court justice and he was trained
[2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:54.920]  as an attorney and what the what the guy told me one time is he said you never concede a point
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:28:00.360]  you make them extracted from you and that's how the government operates today instead of giving
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:05.560]  you information it's about withholding information from the public so the public doesn't get a chance
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:10.920]  to weigh in on the very important decisions that are affecting us right now and will affect us far
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:16.680]  into the future and it's you know i think when you start to look at that whole panorama of technology
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:21.000]  you can go oh we don't need any of this but the fact is we have it it's going to be here
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:25.880]  we need to make sure it serves our interest and that's what is not happening that's why i you
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:30.840]  know when you start to look at the ineffectiveness of our congress today and why it's in the toilet
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:36.200]  i mean it's ratings are lower than the presidents right now and it's because of their ineffectiveness
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:42.920]  at safeguarding an economy working in the interest of the common person they're so detached so
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:47.720]  distant and then the technologies we have are being turned against us when they ought to be
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:53.480]  turned into a situation where we're solving our problems i mean think about the energy nonsense
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:59.160]  crisis so-called crisis we're in totally unavoidable on the backdrop of american technology
[2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:05.400]  we're going to come back with dr nick baggage after this quick three minute break and get into

[2:33:17.880 --> 2:33:25.480]  issue or topic with him he is uh scientists who has a lot of basic general knowledge across many
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:31.880]  different disciplines uh dr baggage continuing with what we were talking about i don't think the
[2:33:31.880 --> 2:33:38.200]  average person realizes how managed our society is or how managed major technological movements or
[2:33:38.200 --> 2:33:46.840]  rollouts truly are uh and the fact that there is giant oil reserves in the gulf and alaska and all
[2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:51.720]  over the world the oil companies have decided not to remove it but they're artificially keeping
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:57.080]  prices up uh and they love to blame it on the arabs well yeah they're part of it but it's part
[2:33:57.080 --> 2:34:02.840]  of the same elite just like the oil companies are part of it buying up refineries enclosing them but
[2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:08.840]  that's only one small area as you know then there's all these other incredibly advanced technologies
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:14.600]  that are decades and decades old that they could have put into place and government then only offers
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:20.520]  incentives for a few of these late in the game so they can control those developments and now
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:26.680]  they've got their global greenhouse tax fraud uh which is uh meant to bring in a new dark age of
[2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:31.960]  control i want to get your response to that but but please continue walking through uh what you
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:38.840]  were what you were beginning to get into about just how technologically hamstrung and held back
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:45.000]  we are uh by these vested interest right you know let me talk about oil and gas as a as a starting
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:51.800]  point because that's in everybody's mind right now and alaska is the arctic actually holds 25% of all
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:58.360]  of the um undiscovered oil and gas is what they estimate and alaska actually has in proven and
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:05.400]  probable reserves tens of thousands of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas let me let me say
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:11.320]  that again tens of thousands of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas pruto bay which everybody
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:17.880]  talks about is just one small uh daughter sand on the beach of oil and gas and alaska and the
[2:35:17.880 --> 2:35:24.120]  arctic and the reality is it's been held hostage they've had the rights to develop it since 1969
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:29.400]  and have failed to bring it into production the existing oil pipeline is running at 40% of its
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:35.080]  capacity of its design capacity not for a shortage of oil but a shortage of a willingness to put our
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:40.440]  oil domestic oil through our pipeline yeah let's be clear we're not even talking about new pipelines
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:46.760]  to add 60% right more to the west coast it's paying on average five dollars a gallon now
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:54.040]  national average about a 420 uh and and this is a scientific undebatable fact and there's a lot of
[2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:59.400]  evidence that your father was killed for trying to bring this oil in as well that's right and the
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:04.120]  other part of it is is that because of that empty capacity in the existing pipeline you could put
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:09.720]  in within two years or even less if it was a important enough issue a liquefaction plant on
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:14.600]  the north slope and you could liquefy natural gas and have it go all the way through that pipeline
[2:36:14.600 --> 2:36:19.400]  along with that oil have it separated at val d's and be putting on tankers within two years rather
[2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:25.240]  than 10 or 15 in the way it's being pushed forward today the fact no one's asking these questions
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:29.960]  you know when dad was in the congress in the early 70s he was um that was a time where the
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:36.840]  oil embargo was about to take shape in 73 uh the pipeline was on the drawing boards in terms of
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:40.840]  building the oil pipeline in alaska and they couldn't build it until they had a settlement
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:44.920]  of the indigenous issues here so they made an attempt at that with the native land claim settlement
[2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:50.520]  act the biggest in the history of of the united states and you've been one of the elected leaders
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:55.080]  of the tribes as well so you're involved in that well i've been on a tribal administrator which is
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:37:00.600]  not an unelected but i did work directly for the chief on your brother is a uh is a mayor of a major
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:05.880]  city that's right and he's also a candidate against um senator ted stevens in this year's
[2:37:05.880 --> 2:37:12.040]  um elections up who by the way is the architect of trying with one fell swoop to kill the internet
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:16.760]  with ending net neutrality right and he was on the technology and science committee and referred
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:22.600]  to the internet as a tubes and pipes i mean this is a guy making the decisions that doesn't even
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:28.680]  understand the technology brother mark actually is leading him in the polls right now and has
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:32.680]  raised about a million and a quarter for his election in the first four months of his campaign
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:37.320]  you know i don't say this i don't say this jokingly and i know it's serious to you because it's
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:42.920]  it's your brother he better be real careful and not fly on any private planes well you know it's
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:48.360]  mark is uh you know he is careful and hopefully things will go smoothly and uh he'll win this
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:53.800]  election get into washington and you know and on technology issues well you know stevens is like
[2:37:53.800 --> 2:38:00.040]  a mob boss so oh yeah we've got you know the irs and the fbi rated his home here not too many
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:06.040]  months ago his son is uh been named in a couple of criminal investigations several legislators are
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:12.360]  now in federal prison in california in orgin effect the guy ran against in 2004 and had asserted he
[2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:18.360]  was corrupted by oil is actually in jail for oil corruption today and serving five years for that
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:24.280]  in another year for um why into the judge for perjury you know and this this thing what's
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:29.880]  happening here that people are not seeing in the mainstream media is this is our opportunity
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:35.880]  we're talking about the national treasury they are they are leasing the offshore resources right now
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:40.600]  like it's a fire sale i mean if her pennies on the dollar and there's enough money in these
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:45.960]  natural resources that we you and i all own in common in this country though the public's resources
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:51.720]  that we lease to multinational companies to retire the national debt now dr begich i want
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:54.760]  you to go over all that evidence because your family is all involved in politics there and
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:58.200]  you've studied it in your dad was a congressman i've studied the situation and what you're
[2:38:58.200 --> 2:39:02.920]  saying is accurate i want listeners to know that but for those that don't understand they
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:08.520]  have the image that five guys with beards and sandals have stopped drilling uh off the shore
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:14.280]  of alaska off the shore of california that five guys and sandals stopped drilling in the gulf that
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:21.400]  is their front the big banks the big oil companies use environmentalists as their front meanwhile the
[2:39:21.400 --> 2:39:27.240]  big corporations engage in cross species chimeras seriously dangerous to the planet all sorts of
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:31.640]  toxic waste dumping you know you're a progressive we're talking about there's real environmentalism
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:36.360]  and then they're fake environmentalism i'll tell you the story on that alex you'll appreciate this
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:41.000]  back in after the after the native land claims at a section of because dad got him to override
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:47.320]  the chairman uh mo you doll on this bill and got it passed and then subsequently the pipeline
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:52.280]  passed in fact it was a tie vote in the senate 5050 an agnew broke the tie to get us an oil
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:59.320]  pipeline in the first place and what they did is afterwards d2 was a section of alaska law that
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:04.200]  said they're going to set up parks and preserves so carter comes in he does this major survey in
[2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:10.920]  the 70s and they decide that we have 32 of the 33 strategic minerals that the country needs absolutely
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:16.840]  for our economy and our military in minable quantities in fact world-class quantities a lot
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:20.760]  of people don't know this but we have the largest malibu deposit in the world it's not even being
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:28.360]  worked at sitting at tide water we have 600-foot coal seams on the coastline now all that are low
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:36.600]  sulfur tremendous resources gold all through the state gold silver platinum tin um everything
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:42.520]  so veritable south africa it is unbelievable it dwarfs south africa as a matter of fact because
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:48.200]  landmass wise take a look at what alaska represents in terms of fisheries were the largest fishery
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:54.520]  left on the planet and most of it being taken by foreign fleets the fact is alaska is a treasure
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:41:01.640]  house that is that is the potential of turning this country's economic situation around because
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:06.840]  these are natural resources held in common of an application of technology we can do today
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:12.840]  earth penetrating tomography we can look several miles deep into the earth crust and determine
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:19.480]  all of the mineral deposits and all of the oil and gas deposits with 99.9 percent accuracy well
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:24.520]  here's an example uh here in texas they found a giant oil and gas field from dallas to houston
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:31.080]  right and uh the you know the really big majors have been trying to use environmental groups
[2:41:31.080 --> 2:41:35.640]  other people to shut down drilling which has no environmental impact i mean they literally create
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:40.760]  maybe an acre pad and drill it and bring it out completely cleanly uh and and and the and the oil
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:45.640]  companies have been caught buying up all the oil refineries so that they just can't take it to market
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:51.320]  and then that's even even in the associated press so they're busy blaming five hippies wearing sandals
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:56.120]  and the five hippies think they're king kong and go man we got power no you don't have power
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:42:01.800]  you're being used and scammed and laughed at and and and and so imagine what's going on in texas
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:06.840]  which is a fraction of what alaska has right i mean the oil price could be cut in half tomorrow
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:10.840]  right and you know the other thing is what happened in d2 all the environmental groups
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:15.480]  got all enamored because the rockerfeller foundation and all these foundations these
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:19.480]  industrialist foundations were given a money and they couldn't figure it out well when
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:23.800]  they locked all this land what they did is once they surveyed all this they locked a big portion
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:29.480]  of it up in parks and preserves so you couldn't mine it except under one condition it was open
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:34.680]  to you and me as american citizens we could go out and make a discovery and stake that claim and
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:38.520]  have the ownership of those mineral rights we could go to patent if it was federal and if it was
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:43.880]  state you could go to lease but you had that right when they locked up this federal land
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:48.440]  in this way the only time it will ever be available is in a national crisis and then the
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:52.200]  multinationals will be invited in because they're the only ones that can mobilize
[2:42:52.200 --> 2:42:55.800]  and then the real environmentalists the ones who are concerned about a legitimate way of
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:00.360]  approaching development all of a sudden all that goes out the window because it's an emergency
[2:43:00.360 --> 2:43:06.440]  yeah let's be clear let's be clear five guys and sandals earth first you run nothing you're a joke
[2:43:06.440 --> 2:43:10.600]  you're funded by the globalists i know you won't admit that losing is too important for you being
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:15.880]  scammed is always the object of you know being being a chump but but but i'm giving you the facts
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:19.800]  here and dr baggage is giving you the facts and they pretty clearly killed his dad over all this
[2:43:19.800 --> 2:43:26.200]  trying to bring out the facts understand this belong to the american people and it was stolen
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:31.640]  just like they find giant clean burning coal deposits and after on the whole us for 200 years
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:37.960]  in utah and bill clinton says off limits and then they mine dirty coal in texas lignite and then
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:43.800]  dump it in in in the in the plants and spew mercury and take the environmental rules off
[2:43:43.800 --> 2:43:47.960]  so they can burn mercury filled coal and the environmentalists dance around loving that too
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:53.080]  i mean it's incredible yeah we have anthracite here which is very clean burning in fact we
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:57.800]  used to fuel during war one alaskan coal fueled pacific fleet a lot of people don't know this
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:44:03.480]  they shut them all down after the war was over copper alaska has and there'll be a story to
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:09.720]  tell on this someday but alaska has huge deposits of copper the guggenheim family when they owned
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:16.360]  all the copper in the country back during the the 1870s and on they owned all of it in colorado
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:20.440]  then they owned everything in alaska then they owned everything in chili they had a worldwide
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:27.080]  monopoly with jp morgan up here and what they left behind because they left alaska after
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:31.720]  not mining out the copper it's just that labor was so much cheaper in latin america they're
[2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:37.560]  only 30 000 people living in alaska 100 years ago when they discovered copper and yet the
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:46.120]  copper deposit that was being mined at kennecott was with with five on a ratio of 15 times what
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:52.520]  they would mine per person in montana in other words the copper ore was so rich at kennecott
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:45:00.040]  that 15 times as much money was produced per person they had a uh an unbelievable
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:04.680]  discovery well they left it they just i mean they left the buildings them everything the
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:09.800]  machinery uh pulled up the railroad and went to chili because chili had a million people that had
[2:45:09.800 --> 2:45:15.080]  their own agricultural base and they could pay him peanuts in alaska and labor was expensive in
[2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:19.800]  those days and you know i mean an egg cost 100 years ago a buck you know people you know you
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:24.840]  talk about an egg costing money today it was a dollar during the gold rush era uh but you know
[2:45:24.840 --> 2:45:29.960]  the thing about all of this is when you start to look at the national resources and you look at
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:35.880]  i'll give you another example it's all been locked away through phony conservation and uh it's all
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:41.000]  you know what it's like a safety deposit box for the multinational they get to break it out later
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:45.640]  when the price is high enough you know why oil is so high is because the alternatives are about to
[2:45:45.640 --> 2:45:51.080]  come in and the oil industry is getting as much money together in the big pile as they can because
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:54.840]  they're going to own that industry whatever those alternatives are they're going to be in such a
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:46:00.120]  heavy cash position you know buy out whoever's in the game and that's but that is that is the
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:04.600]  reason i believe they're capitalizing right now they want to own the energy industry whatever
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:10.040]  that looks like in the 21st century and make sure you're stuck on a meter when the 21st century
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:14.600]  should offer us the opposite and it does where we shouldn't have any meters and we ought to be
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:18.760]  totally independent and our households with energy and our businesses with energy with the
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.880]  well i want to hear about some of those advanced technologies that they're suppressing and that
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:26.280]  they plan to own and you're absolutely right with your research and i know you can elaborate
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:33.240]  and teach us a lot uh but but this is economic warfare they have built a society especially
[2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:40.760]  in the united states and western europe completely dependent on fossil fuels uh with the sprawling
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:48.280]  cities and and and rural areas where you have to have the car they have strategically blocked the
[2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:55.320]  development of other fuels and and and other energy platforms and then now as you said they're
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:47:02.120]  not just getting a pile of money for investment they state that they are now literally waging war
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:09.240]  on the population and are squeezing the middle class uh into extinction and transferring
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:17.480]  masses of the wealth to themselves in a predatory fashion to preposition themselves in the 21st
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:23.880]  century to fully build a corporate control grid uh police state system that they call their new
[2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:28.120]  world order yeah i agree with that and i think when you look at the interlocking boards of
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:33.400]  directors in these corporations when you start to analyze the relationships politically on a
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:38.760]  national and a state level and you watch how that whole machine operates you know if if people
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:43.320]  fully had disclosure and we work with unclassified materials and put together the picture pretty
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:48.520]  clearly but if people had full disclosure of things that are truly not national secrets but
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:54.760]  are national embarrassments uh we would be changing uh this government uh out in a dramatic way
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:48:00.600]  and i and not to say that it should be a violent or anything like that but the fact of the matter
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:06.040]  is the truth uh the truth of what has happened and this is why the technology is so threatened
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:12.040]  uh to to this establishment because they recognize that you know when people hear
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:17.640]  and they feel the pain of the results of this truth which is fear of your loss your pension
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:22.680]  your social security uh worry about your money in the bank and your money markets that could
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:28.600]  collapse and you find out it was all done predatorily by design you're going to get mad
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:33.880]  so they preemptively have a police state surveillance grid in place uh we've got a break but but
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:37.960]  before we break uh finish up the point we're making but i want to get into the fraud of the
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:42.360]  global carbon tax but go ahead yeah and you know that's another you know that whole issue the
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:47.480]  technology on on the sciences i mean the simple things on on the models taught in business
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:51.560]  school or make sure you get the customer coming back so they don't want you independent energy
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:56.040]  when you buy something in the last 20 years and provides all your power they want something
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:49:02.600]  that you have to go get a meter and plug into this is why tesla never got his free power grid
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:07.720]  on the planet because jp morgan the same guy that financed the monopolies of almost every
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:13.320]  monopolist at the last part of the last century you know that all of that was about control well
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:18.760]  the new solar systems that the uh that the cities are paying for that the feds are paying you're
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:24.680]  subsidizing uh a discount for you to get hook into the grid and then i'll give you an example my
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:29.480]  brother mark is mayor of anchorage they have a municipal light and power they bought gas rights
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:33.480]  from shell oil they bought them out of the cook inlet gas fuel they own so the city bought the
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:41.080]  gas rights for a dollar 40 per thousand uh cubic feet and what is it today you know 13 dollars
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:46.040]  and so the rate payers are paying this incredibly good rate in the municipality of anchorage for
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:52.360]  power seven cents i think the kilowatt hour on natural gas you're paying 113 thought to buy it
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:57.160]  you're paying 113 with what everybody else pays and the media calls that subsidized
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:02.040]  no that's what it really costs yeah that's actually what it costs and the city was smart
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:05.800]  enough to buy those rights in a commercial market you know but he wanted to look into
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:10.040]  selling them right you want to sell them to into the marketplace because then he could retire all
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:15.320]  the debt for the city you know because it's gone up in values so much and have a debt-free city
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:18.600]  and their utilities commission will let them do it because the rate payers will pay too much which
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:23.640]  i can understand too but you know it's on balance it's uh it's an interesting mix but here we go
[2:50:23.640 --> 2:50:29.480]  we're gonna skip the break here we go may i have everybody's attempt doc we're gonna come back and
[2:50:29.480 --> 2:50:34.360]  take everybody's phone calls for folks that are uh patiently uh uh holding and i got so many calls
[2:50:34.360 --> 2:50:40.120]  here on screen uh we ought to do this more often alex oh you bet we got so many calls here on
[2:50:40.120 --> 2:50:45.320]  screen john just just re-impload them so i know who's who or who's hung up okay just close your
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:51.560]  window okay uh i'll uh do that thank you sir uh doc we are continuing there's still a lot of people
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:55.000]  listening in this behind the scenes discussion i just skipped some of the breaks now that we're
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:51:00.680]  screaming this live via prisonplanet.tv for the members and then also people listening
[2:51:00.680 --> 2:51:05.640]  for free on the internet info wars.com uh let's start getting into the global warming fraud right
[2:51:05.640 --> 2:51:10.520]  now in about three minutes and then let's because obviously there's climate change going on they're
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:15.160]  manipulating the weather uh you know obviously there's real environmental crises but even if you
[2:51:15.160 --> 2:51:21.240]  believe that carbon dioxide is causing warming which the evidence shows it's not their solution
[2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:25.960]  would ship all production to the third world with no controls and would actually boost i've seen the
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:31.960]  studies boost greenhouse gases so even if you don't debate it and say it's real their solutions
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:37.480]  are fraud and they admit now you will buy the carbon tax credit from the private central banks
[2:51:37.480 --> 2:51:42.680]  making them the world government right you know this is um it's really nature and and and you
[2:51:42.680 --> 2:51:48.760]  can look at there's a great bbc special on this that was very well done uh laying the case and
[2:51:48.760 --> 2:51:53.320]  we've said it it's the it's solar energy that contributes to the changes on the planet and
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:59.080]  other conditions undersea volcanics they also contributes we publish that back in the mid 90s
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:05.880]  and eventually you'll see that it is really uh not man uh making this happen it's nature we did
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:11.000]  a video on this i think you guys carry that the earth uh changes the ripple effect and
[2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:16.360]  and the subtitle is alaska sounds the alarm because in my lifetime i'll be 50 this year and
[2:52:16.360 --> 2:52:22.760]  in my lifetime i've watched our glaciers recede uh disappear up here because it is getting warmer
[2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:27.240]  but not for the reasons uh that are that are posed in the mainstream media and the other issue is
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:32.680]  is when you talk about no regulation outside of the country you're absolutely dead on right in fact
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:39.800]  if if u s stopped everything just shut down the whole thing today it wouldn't matter one iota
[2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:45.560]  because china and india will surpass whatever we're saving within a year or two uh of stopping
[2:52:45.560 --> 2:52:50.440]  everything and that's not realistic the other issue is you know what you're which what we're
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:54.440]  really more concerned about is the toxins that are being put into the environment those are
[2:52:54.440 --> 2:53:00.680]  legitimate concerns but the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomena a largely the excuse of
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:06.680]  taxing everyone and and basically the globalists are looking at it from this perspective they had
[2:53:06.680 --> 2:53:14.280]  300 million people to test out how to create into marketing uh uh consumers and taxpayers and forget
[2:53:14.280 --> 2:53:18.840]  that we're human beings and now they want to experiment with that on 6.3 billion people they
[2:53:18.840 --> 2:53:25.080]  would like to catch up and the money and the resources and the government they would stay there
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:28.360]  we're coming back to the full audience recap that thought and continue here we go
[2:53:31.800 --> 2:53:36.920]  dr nick baggage is our guest the website's info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[2:53:36.920 --> 2:53:41.640]  we have links up on info wars dot com to his websites you go to earth pulse dot com that's
[2:53:41.640 --> 2:53:46.280]  earth pulse dot com and he has some others as well we carry quite a few of his books
[2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:52.120]  and videos at info wars dot com so be sure and check those out on the online video and bookstore
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:56.840]  your calls when we start the next hour we're going directly to all of you that are holding
[2:53:56.840 --> 2:54:01.640]  patiently mason rusty james page jd thank you for holding we're going to get to you
[2:54:02.280 --> 2:54:06.760]  during the behind the scenes for folks listening on the info wars dot com screams i brought up
[2:54:06.760 --> 2:54:13.400]  global warming obviously it's been every angle of science the hoax is hundreds of thousands of
[2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:17.800]  scientists say it's not man made that it's natural and then they've got a few hundred
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:22.200]  the un hired who are quacks that say it is man made and we were just going over that
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:28.760]  now are there real environmental things absolutely uh are we in a lot of trouble absolutely
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:33.880]  but the globalists are just offering you a tax that will actually increase greenhouse emissions
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:39.240]  even if you capitulate and believe the fraud that it's a man driven when the un's own report says
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:45.720]  six percent of the greenhouse uh you know gas um greenhouse gas emissions are six percent of the
[2:54:45.720 --> 2:54:50.520]  increase in temperature uh but doctor you were talking about why they're doing this coming in
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:55.320]  trying to block a renaissance an excuse to bring us into a new technological dark age
[2:54:56.200 --> 2:54:59.960]  yeah i think i think that's really what it what it is about you know the fact that they
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:05.800]  want to keep us dependent until the last drop is is is drug out but more than that it's the wealth
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:11.480]  transfer it's the markets that the uh that that are that are seen as six point three billion people
[2:55:11.480 --> 2:55:17.560]  try and catch up with what america has built and for that to happen america has to lose we have to
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:23.080]  be decapitalized the money has to go out of this country to somewhere else so they won't catch up
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:27.880]  we're going to be lowered down to their level and they even say that on npr like it's wonderful
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:32.200]  and the fact that you know that what we saw here you know people don't realize like the
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:37.320]  coming banking crisis which we haven't seen the beginnings of yet and here in alaska when oil
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:42.520]  went the other way when it was like eight dollars nine dollars a barrel uh in the mid eighties
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:47.560]  people don't remember it it took a big drop well here in alaska one in three banks failed
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:53.800]  one in three went out of business one in ten homes went into foreclosures uh the bankruptcies
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:59.560]  were off the charts and when we saw that happen here and and what it did and then the roll up
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:05.640]  because businesses have been here 50 60 years were caught in that trap as housing developers
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:10.120]  defaulted and contractors defaulted and their subcontractors defaulted and then their employees
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:16.360]  defaulted and people fell all around us and that has not yet happened to the country for the
[2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:23.160]  opposite reason because oil now is you know 130 140 dollars a barrel uh if that impacts we are
[2:56:23.160 --> 2:56:29.560]  counter cyclic alaska is an oil state so when oil's high our state thrives when oil's low we suffer
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:36.120]  greatly because 85 percent of our revenue stream is oil oil driven and when you start to look at
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:41.880]  the national resources that are being auctioned off today in the case of uh one of the big ones
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:49.480]  that just went off uh in in in northwest alaska off the coast that auction brought 2.5 billion
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:56.600]  dollars today at oil at 140 bucks a barrel pruto bay with one tenth of the projected reserves
[2:56:56.600 --> 2:57:02.520]  brought in a billion dollars when oil was three bucks back in 1969 okay doc stay there stay there
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:05.640]  i want to finish up with that when we come back we're about to start the fourth hour we're going
[2:57:05.640 --> 2:57:09.960]  to go to your calls but stay there before we end this hour i want to encourage everybody to go
[2:57:09.960 --> 2:57:16.680]  to info wars dot com link through on the bookstore and video store shopping cart get the dvd angels

[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:32.200]  energy video uh books we've got all his best stuff at info wars dot com this is important
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:38.760]  material that needs to be seen by everybody so please go to info wars dot com and get angels
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:44.200]  still don't play this art harp you've read the book a lot of you will get the video it's powerful
[2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:49.720]  stuff get the mind control video as well where he goes over all the admissions of what they've

[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:28.360]  hope the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is essential that
[2:58:28.360 --> 2:58:33.240]  patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan
[2:58:33.240 --> 2:58:37.800]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat in the
[2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:42.680]  info war prison planet dot tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom

[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:33.480]  i'm sorry this section is classified by dollars to prepare for a national leprechaun war on corruption from alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:59:45.480 --> 2:59:49.640]  we've got otter dick megas for most of the hour we're going to be taking your phone calls
[2:59:49.640 --> 2:59:54.680]  right now but you were gonna when we hit the break you were interrupted by that tell us
[2:59:55.320 --> 3:00:00.760]  specifically you were getting into the value of the prudhoe bay proven reserves a tiny
[3:00:01.560 --> 3:00:08.200]  area in alaska right it was it was uh they projected 900 million barrels of oil there and
[3:00:08.200 --> 3:00:14.920]  the auction was a billion dollars basically just under a billion dollars in 1969 when oil was three
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:20.280]  dollars a barrel now here in alaska under this federal administration a lease just took place
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:25.560]  that they raised two and a half billion on an oil reserve that's projected to have 10 billion
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:33.720]  barrels in it in other words 10 times as much at a price that is like 40 times higher uh than it
[3:00:33.720 --> 3:00:40.520]  was in 1969 and we only get two and a half times the money now this is uh this is the fuzzy math
[3:00:40.520 --> 3:00:44.680]  of the biggest ripoff since the railroad baron and people don't remember that you know they
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:49.160]  controlled all the corridors so the farmer beats his brains out now they convinced the public
[3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:53.160]  they convinced the public there's no elites no corruption and then and then of course they just
[3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:58.440]  totally took over yeah and what they're doing now is this acceleration of the offshore leasing
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:04.520]  because it's the biggest giveaway in the history of the country if we did uh look at these resources
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:09.480]  differently in terms of how do we maximize their potential so that the public benefits
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:14.120]  right here in alaska a lot of people don't know this but because our oil revenue and what it does
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:18.520]  we don't have a state income tax we don't have a state sale in fact the government pays you to
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:23.960]  live in alaska that's right in fact um right now we're our legislatures in special session and
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:29.240]  residents who've been here a year at the end of this session are likely going to see a $1,200
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:34.680]  check show up for every resident and folks that's how rich this whole country is and mexico has
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:39.800]  tripled the resources of the lower 48 but they're one of the poorest in the world because the elites
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:46.120]  want you poor as a mode to control you it's in their own handbooks you know that the public
[3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:52.120]  resources are enough to supply the national treasury retire the debt eliminate income tax for
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:58.760]  individuals uh and and tax corporations when they use public resources but instead we have a federal
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:03.560]  reserve that has set up a system where it's impossible to get out of debt for money to be
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:09.080]  created debt is created it is a total fraud let's go to the calls mason in florida rusty
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:15.880]  james and others go ahead mason hello can you hear me yes i can okay um hey i've um been wanting
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:22.520]  to call in for a while but i'm only um 17 i live in florida when i first found out about this i thought
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:27.640]  like not to be rude or anything but i thought you were crazy and my friend was crazy once i saw
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:32.840]  end game and looked up everything up i found out but ever since then i've been trying to wake people
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:38.280]  up but it's basically been like uh you're some crazy conspirator you're in some fantasy world
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:43.960]  hey listen i got neocons uh who on their own websites because they send me their links
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:49.080]  are in the military and they say the dollar is not devalued everything's fine
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:54.520]  dr baggage what is uh i mean it's like people are in a spell at least some of them
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:59.560]  where they cannot face reality it seems to be more than denial i mean is it that they're so
[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:05.560]  invested in lies they can't admit they were wrong yeah i think that's um that's a lot of it and
[3:03:05.560 --> 3:03:11.080]  that idea of never concede a point you know and most people never analyze a point you know and
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:14.680]  that and they bank on that well when people are suffering and this is what they're not banking
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:19.880]  on and people are suffering in this country and the inflation hasn't even started i mean the worst
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:25.560]  is yet to come and that in and of itself although we hate to see it happen is what it takes sometimes
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:31.560]  to wake up the american and you can say it i can say it you can say it i can say it we told you so
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:37.960]  yeah absolutely and and and you know it and and yet the hope is still there because it's not over
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:42.680]  until it's over and we still have a chance to take this uh republic back and that's and that's
[3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:46.280]  the thing and i think people are feeling this all over the world you know when i travel i travel
[3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:51.960]  quite a bit i run into this in europe i run into it every place you know and when you start to think
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:58.760]  about it it's just a different spin on the same formula which is to enslave the public to be dependent
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:03.800]  when we used to be independent and in this century we should be independent our technologies offer us
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:09.720]  the potentials that are just incredible i mean the solutions are already here we just need a
[3:04:09.720 --> 3:04:14.040]  different political will to bring them into reality all right on the info war streams we're
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:19.720]  going to skip this break to stay there mason calls everybody we're going to continue right now
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:32.680]  okay anything else mason um one more thing um i was thinking about buying a rifle
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:38.760]  cool i think i should yes okay i was thinking about getting like a semi-automatic ak well i
[3:04:38.760 --> 3:04:44.040]  wouldn't call it an ak because your weak-minded neighbors will say he's got an ak and an ak
[3:04:44.040 --> 3:04:49.720]  is a fully automatic and without your federal firearms stamp you'll be swat team rated and
[3:04:49.720 --> 3:04:54.680]  they'll call you a terrorist plus you don't want fully auto self-defense you want you want what
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:05:01.800]  will they call a mac 90 or whatever the variant term is uh you chinese is more inexpensive but
[3:05:01.800 --> 3:05:09.000]  bulgarian russian hungarian that is a good 7.62 39 30 round i would go with eastern european
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:13.080]  and then try to get a few thousand rounds of ammo and then try to get proficient be able to shoot
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:19.000]  bullseye at 100 yards and if you haven't owned guns in your life and weren't trained with a rifle uh
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:23.160]  like a lot of people from texas and other areas where you need to go out and take some classes
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:29.160]  at the local shooting range and and uh you know uh treat that gun as an important tool
[3:05:29.160 --> 3:05:35.720]  before you start using it on your own okay and one last thing um once the internet basically gets
[3:05:35.720 --> 3:05:41.240]  like re um reordered i think it's pretty much over well we're not going to let that happen
[3:05:41.240 --> 3:05:44.840]  that they've already tried a bunch of these internet attacks and we've hammered them i
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:48.920]  appreciate your call in fact your take on that dr baggots we have a lot of power we've been
[3:05:48.920 --> 3:05:53.400]  affecting change uh you know i think that's true and you know when you go back to other things
[3:05:53.400 --> 3:05:57.960]  that have happened where the where the internet served served us and talk radio served us you
[3:05:57.960 --> 3:06:02.360]  go back to when the fga wanted to regulate everything out of existence back in the nineties
[3:06:02.360 --> 3:06:09.000]  again and people you know the biggest response ever 30 000 letters to the fga uh they'd never
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:13.640]  seen like it and you know the fact is as long as information does remain free we have a fighting
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:19.080]  chance but it's not over uh i think until it's uh until it's really truly over and i think we're
[3:06:19.080 --> 3:06:23.320]  far from it well you know the american public is always two minutes to midnight but boy that two
[3:06:23.320 --> 3:06:28.520]  minutes a lot out exactly the sleeping giant always two minutes to midnight there and sudden
[3:06:28.520 --> 3:06:33.960]  death over time we don't have a choice and it's the fighting spirit it's knowing that we can affect
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:40.120]  change and then we're not going to give up no matter how bad it gets that's what allows us to win
[3:06:40.120 --> 3:06:46.040]  and then of course trusting god our creator i mean looking looking at history just modern
[3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:50.920]  time i mean haven't you and your personal life i mean i've seen this but i'm guessing you've seen
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:57.160]  it sheen uh just people go from calling us kooks to almost everybody agreeing with us oh yeah and
[3:06:57.160 --> 3:07:01.000]  it's you know the thing about it is is you and you're careful with this as well you know you
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:05.640]  always have the sources you always have the citations and eventually the mainstream does
[3:07:05.640 --> 3:07:09.640]  catch up people start they hear it and they go oh wait now the mainstream is reporting a little
[3:07:09.640 --> 3:07:14.200]  bit of this and then it starts to make sense in the context of the experience that we're all
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:17.880]  living together and when the predictions start coming through in terms of how technology gets
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:23.800]  used and you made them 10 12 years ago uh you know the record's clear and and it's not so much i told
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:29.720]  you so is it's hey it isn't over yet you know let's still get in the game recognize that things
[3:07:29.720 --> 3:07:33.960]  that are in front in front of each of us we all have a sphere of influence so we can impact
[3:07:33.960 --> 3:07:38.040]  we just need to step into what we can do we'll be talking to our neighbors it might be more sure
[3:07:38.040 --> 3:07:39.480]  here we go back to the main transmission
[3:07:39.480 --> 3:07:50.440]  all right dr nick baggage earth pulse dot com is our guest get his books and videos at info wars
[3:07:50.440 --> 3:07:55.480]  dot com discounted out of the gates hope you'll order them there today support both of our works
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:08:00.680]  we can continue onward we're talking to rusty uh hearing just a moment but i want to go back
[3:08:00.680 --> 3:08:05.320]  to what the last caller was saying about people laugh at me they don't want to listen well that
[3:08:05.320 --> 3:08:10.280]  may be your circle of friends but i have found the general public most people are finally paying
[3:08:10.280 --> 3:08:14.840]  attention and dr baggage and myself and others aren't saying nanny nanny boo boo you were wrong
[3:08:14.840 --> 3:08:20.520]  we were right it's like hey it's okay it's not too late now join us we got to fix things quick
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:27.960]  we have a very wicked very ruthless elite in control extremely psychopathic very unstable
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:33.880]  very intelligent and inbred but very dangerous and like you know like hybrid dogs uh or hybrid
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:39.160]  horses you know they can run real fast but they're they'll bite you and they're nuts uh this is what
[3:08:39.160 --> 3:08:44.120]  we're facing and before we go back to the calls well well let's go to calls but don't let me forget
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:49.000]  under baggage i want to get your view on the elites in game from their documents from their
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:53.720]  source research you are a big stickler on this what you believe they want to build what type of
[3:08:53.720 --> 3:09:00.040]  world they want to construct when they talk about a matrix like grid uh before you leave us but right
[3:09:00.040 --> 3:09:05.720]  now let's go to rusty and arkansas you're on the air rusty hey alex i just want to first come out
[3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:11.720]  and say i apologize away my call went last friday when i called in and uh just want to tell you i'm
[3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:15.960]  sorry about that i didn't mean for you to get on the rant and go the way that it went well don't
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:21.400]  apologize for calling in sir go ahead but uh i'm an info warrior as long as uh as well as the rest
[3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:26.520]  of the callers and we're out there pumping out cd's and trying to get out there and and inform
[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:31.640]  the public the best way we can and i just want to call on all of you to uh remember alex and your
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:36.280]  prayers if you're a spiritual person and all of the guests remember them in prayers as well
[3:09:37.160 --> 3:09:43.640]  for your guest today i just wanted to ask where he thought that uh the uh antivirus software
[3:09:43.640 --> 3:09:49.480]  companies might end up going uh due to the fact that they won't be needed with uh internet too
[3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:54.760]  and with all the internet security uh software providers and everything they're out there now
[3:09:54.760 --> 3:10:00.040]  basically when they go to this net neutrality system there won't be a need for it well let me
[3:10:00.040 --> 3:10:06.440]  just say even on their grids uh you're still going to have viruses and things so the fact they're
[3:10:06.440 --> 3:10:11.160]  going to have more of that and virus software companies have been caught before making the
[3:10:11.160 --> 3:10:17.000]  viruses so oh don't worry the viruses won't be going away dr baggots yeah that's true in fact
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:21.480]  um most people don't know this but i think it's going to be used in the propaganda is going to be
[3:10:21.480 --> 3:10:28.680]  uh because terrorists and china in particular uh have basically gone in and analyzed every
[3:10:28.680 --> 3:10:33.560]  commercial and every governmental site as far into it as is even the joint chiefs of staff
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:39.080]  have been hacked and what a lot of people realize is that residing in a lot of people's software
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:44.920]  are um programs that can be activated uh we we develop our own software so we were our
[3:10:44.920 --> 3:10:50.840]  engineers went through ours periodically and we find periodically right in the middle of it a
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:57.080]  code that's been coded in uh chinese it's a table and a matrix that has not been activated
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:11:01.320]  but is sleeping in our website that we have to clean out every once in a while and we built
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:07.240]  safeguards now to keep them out but the fact is most people have already been hacked most of the
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:12.760]  utilities in the country most of the um things that we rely on have been hacked through well
[3:11:12.760 --> 3:11:18.200]  here's an example there will be a crisis well well there's economic hacking uh microsoft this
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:22.680]  is all happened because they built things for their own backdoors and they built it so their
[3:11:22.680 --> 3:11:27.800]  nsa snoop systems could plug right in and now that's open them up to all the other hackers
[3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:33.560]  right plus at the same time it's a it's a case of building that commercial information i mean
[3:11:33.560 --> 3:11:39.320]  knowing wherever you go uh is a very useful thing for commercial purposes and extremely
[3:11:39.320 --> 3:11:45.240]  valuable data valence something we reported on as far back as 2000 in the book earth rising the
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:50.600]  revolution you know we we got into this whole concept before it was even in them in people's
[3:11:50.600 --> 3:11:55.240]  mind no no you did i remember having you on well both the british news yesterday and it was in my
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:00.120]  stack i didn't get to it but it was on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com so much there
[3:12:00.120 --> 3:12:05.720]  that didn't on the show folks be sure and visit those sites uh and right there it said oh the government
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:12.360]  tracks your bluetooth and tracks your phone and tracks your and and and uses it as a beacon to
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:19.160]  follow you well that was built in to all the cell phones by international law uh by 2001 but see
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:25.560]  they're just now announcing that yes they built it in and they're tracking you yeah and it was in
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:32.120]  those days and it was actually laid out even further back in 1989 um there was a document uh
[3:12:32.120 --> 3:12:36.840]  that was put together by the us army war college and we talk about it all the time and it was laying
[3:12:36.840 --> 3:12:43.400]  out this sort of plan for uh using gps to track business travelers in case there were some conflict
[3:12:43.400 --> 3:12:48.680]  they'd be able to extract them and it morphed into well what later became cell phone technology
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:55.000]  and personal pagers and then on star on your automobile and you know now most people uh i'm
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:00.120]  probably one of the few that don't carry a cell phone you know and and and it's not so much because
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:05.320]  of you know the the idea of sticking a microwave wave next to my head and the health consequences
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:10.760]  alone it's basically the whole package you know not only do i get unhealthy um but i'm enslaved
[3:13:10.760 --> 3:13:16.520]  to this device that i'm on 24 hour call and then thirdly it's the invasiveness of the invasion
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:21.400]  in your personal privacy and i resent that and i think it should have been safeguarded and the
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:25.080]  thing about a lot of the laws is they don't know that normally do they not provide safeguards but
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:29.480]  they're civil these things need to be criminal laws that nail people and put them in jail you
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:33.480]  know when a few CEOs go to jail for illegal wiretapping instead of making it legal and
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:39.480]  giving people basically clemency for whatever evil they've done we need to put some people in
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:44.040]  jail over this and then the then the game changes and the american public is sick and tired of
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:49.800]  having our digital doors kicked in by the not fees of the 21st century i agree uh anything
[3:13:49.800 --> 3:13:54.600]  else rusty we got to move quicker go that's it thanks alex thank you rusty page in michigan
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:14:00.680]  you're on the air worldwide welcome hi thanks for taking my call um i wanted to ask dr baggage
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:08.360]  because i know he works a lot with um electromagnetic technologies if he had ever heard about this
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:15.560]  thing called the clark zapper yes uh hill the clark's uh device and there's um she wrote a
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:19.960]  really excellent book on the subject and you know it's one of many technologies the idea of using
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:25.720]  electromagnetic fields to affect health and being able to quantify and qualify that you know there's
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:32.680]  a lot of material out there on light therapies laser therapies in fact i know some of the best
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:38.040]  practitioners in europe serve on the board for medical lasers those that oversee applications
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:44.920]  of medical lasers for healing applications um also they use an electro magnetic probe
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:49.640]  that's used for um acupuncture treatments has been very effective in treating a number of
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:54.600]  disorders but these are again these are technologies that sort of give you back your power because
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:15:00.520]  they're curative whereas most of the pharmaceutical industry is based on this idea of coming back
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:05.480]  for more in fact there's an excellent book it's called dirty medicine uh maybe out of print it
[3:15:05.480 --> 3:15:11.480]  was published in great britain back in the 90s 900 page expose on the pharmaceutical industry
[3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:16.760]  with over i think it was like a thousand reference sources or more but i want to say this as well
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:22.200]  we have to police ourselves because obviously there is frequency and light treatments the
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:27.320]  japanese are doing at the germans the dutch as you know there's a lot of things that are confirmed
[3:15:27.320 --> 3:15:32.360]  thousands of different types of treatments that have been blocked the problem is then you get
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:36.680]  quacks and cooks just because the government and some corporations are corrupt well that's human
[3:15:36.680 --> 3:15:41.240]  nature doesn't mean then every group on the internet's good selling five thousand dollar
[3:15:41.240 --> 3:15:46.840]  machines that are some flashing lights that then is used to discredit all the real research
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:52.120]  that that is exactly right and this is where people need to be careful don't look at testimonials
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:56.840]  look at real scientific evidence and there's plenty of it around and and that's the point is
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:01.080]  and in today we ought to be it's easy we ought to be able to find it we can and there's a lot of
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:06.920]  medical practice a simple thing artificial discs for your back just came in the united states two
[3:16:06.920 --> 3:16:12.760]  years ago they've been done in germany since 1983 and successfully where a guy working a jackhammer
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:18.840]  getting his l1 and l2 replaced his back work in a jackhammer in 10 weeks but they would rather go
[3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:24.120]  in and cut a piece of your hip out because it costs three times as much right and not only that but
[3:16:24.120 --> 3:16:29.560]  the germans have to post their medical procedures or total cost post them they're online you can
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:34.680]  actually look them up in german technology is not a slouch technology and their public health
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:40.120]  departments are very much more active than ours in fact that the german public health department
[3:16:40.120 --> 3:16:49.160]  warned schools that wi-fi was a risk to adolescents and small and the germans are also years ago said
[3:16:49.160 --> 3:16:54.120]  vaccines are bad for small children they have mercury in them showing that not all not all the
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:17:00.200]  mid-level elites are bad it's it's it's that the higher-up elites know exactly what they're doing
[3:17:00.200 --> 3:17:06.760]  and it's just so cold-blooded and then we tell people sorry go ahead i was gonna say the science
[3:17:06.760 --> 3:17:10.280]  knowledge in germany see the average person has a little bit higher science knowledge they can't
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:15.480]  lie so readily you know and what people know at high school in chemistry is sufficient for them to
[3:17:15.480 --> 3:17:21.240]  look at a report and understand hey wait a minute this doesn't make sense and we've dumbed our
[3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:27.000]  population down that's right the germans are real sharp and it's hard to get stuff past them
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:31.640]  compared to us of course in the past we were known as the smartest and most cunning people and now
[3:17:31.640 --> 3:17:35.720]  absolutely i guess we've had it good so long we've been under the microscope of the new world order
[3:17:35.720 --> 3:17:41.720]  being brainwashed and we've just i mean it's this built-in denial by people denying things that i mean
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:46.520]  i remember 10 years ago people saying there's no mercury in shots and i'd go here is the handout
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:50.760]  that comes with the shot yes it's in there and they'd say all right and then the government said
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:55.000]  okay it's in there but it's good for you then they said oh we took it out now they say no we never
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:18:00.360]  took it out but it is good for you well now they say it's in there but it's bad for you i mean how
[3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:05.880]  many lies dr. baggage do we have to get from the people running our government before we realize
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:13.320]  they are intellectually bankrupt and aren't shouldn't be trusted uh with uh a toilet attendance job
[3:18:13.960 --> 3:18:20.120]  well and you know it is it's unfortunately the the truth and it's time uh to recognize
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:23.560]  things that have corrupted and when you start to look at all these issues combined i mean
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:28.040]  i still think americans do generate some pretty creative people and some of the most outstanding
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:34.600]  it's interesting or homeschooled which is you know as a past president of a teacher's organization
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:38.600]  i'm one of i am the only one that i know of that was president of a statewide teacher's
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:42.600]  organization that supports homeschooling nationally and the reason i do is because
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:49.000]  it works and it works very very effectively and the things that um that the way we used to teach
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:54.600]  and educate it was about reading about studying and about mentoring um now it's about uh script
[3:18:54.600 --> 3:18:58.920]  reading and propaganda and and this is where homeschooling and public schooling differs
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:03.960]  okay all these things do link together it's one big package we're going to skip this break to
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:08.280]  continue getting through the calls then i'm going to ask the big question to dr. baggage what is the
[3:19:08.280 --> 3:19:14.760]  end game if the globalists win if this unified technocratic elite funded by the private central
[3:19:14.760 --> 3:19:21.080]  banks has their way what will it look like what are we facing in the short medium and long term
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:28.440]  earth pulse dot coms his website stay with us okay doc let me ask you in front of all the
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:33.320]  internet listeners i know we had you until the bottom of the hour but i want to this is so
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:37.800]  interesting we've got to do this more often we're just both so busy i want to go ahead and keep you
[3:19:37.800 --> 3:19:43.640]  to the end of the show which is in about 35 minutes if you can't do it that's okay just um if we can
[3:19:43.640 --> 3:19:48.120]  just give me about five to twelve because i've got a change and run to a meeting at 12 30 but that
[3:19:48.120 --> 3:19:52.040]  would be fine okay so i've told the hour we can go till then that's fine in fact i'll let you get
[3:19:52.040 --> 3:19:57.000]  out of here at 51 after all right that's perfect that must be one of the breaks that we keep missing
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:02.440]  yeah so you're saying i mean as long as you're gone by the last five minutes you're fine i'm good
[3:20:02.440 --> 3:20:08.760]  yeah so so you're good till 51 after this hour that's good good good okay let's continue so we
[3:20:08.760 --> 3:20:14.440]  don't waste sure the time we've got go ahead you know when you start to look at all of this as it
[3:20:14.440 --> 3:20:18.840]  connects together you know when you think about um education as an example some of the technologies
[3:20:18.840 --> 3:20:23.800]  are out there that could accelerate the educational process in some pretty dramatic ways in terms of
[3:20:23.800 --> 3:20:28.920]  being able to retain information being able to use that information more creatively and yet
[3:20:29.480 --> 3:20:34.120]  these technologies stay on the shelf for 20 30 years before public education ever gets a grip
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:39.480]  of them in the case of attention deficit disorders as an example there are technologies today that
[3:20:39.480 --> 3:20:45.400]  in 80 percent of the children that have used them within 30 to 45 days they can be taken off of all
[3:20:45.400 --> 3:20:50.760]  their psychoactive drugs their brain capacity in terms of being able to moderate their brain
[3:20:50.760 --> 3:20:56.040]  activity into the range where you're ideally suited for intellectual learning is self-controlled
[3:20:56.040 --> 3:21:00.520]  in other words they don't need the drugs anymore they can get into a focused state of learning
[3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:04.920]  like you and i can do when we read a book or we we normally function but that would put the drug
[3:21:04.920 --> 3:21:09.320]  companies out of business and they don't want that uh let's go ahead and go back to the calls page
[3:21:09.320 --> 3:21:17.560]  anything else okay she's gone jd in texas you're on the air with dr nick baggots go ahead yeah alex
[3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:27.320]  can you hear me okay yes i can okay i was uh i was uh looking on c span and i was going to
[3:21:27.320 --> 3:21:39.880]  tape this thing and it had the epa owner and uh had three of them two epa types and another independent
[3:21:40.840 --> 3:21:46.200]  and uh they swore men and then they gave their opening statements well the independent i call him
[3:21:46.200 --> 3:21:53.080]  the whistleblower he was about to he was about to spill the beans on the whole thing and c span
[3:21:53.080 --> 3:21:59.640]  cut him off right in the middle of his testimony and he went to another program yeah there's c
[3:21:59.640 --> 3:22:05.320]  c span in the past was a good organization now fox news has bought control over the few years ago
[3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:10.680]  it's really uh degrading quickly and and we have to come out and complain about it or
[3:22:10.680 --> 3:22:14.920]  they're going to go ahead and just set the precedent to do it but you say spilling the beans on what
[3:22:14.920 --> 3:22:21.080]  what was the epa hearing because i know of them doing similar his own global warming
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:27.080]  it was a senate committee investigation they were going to have a testimony and then they
[3:22:27.080 --> 3:22:34.760]  were going to uh uh tell the uh senate what they needed to do to uh to uh fix well let me let me
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:44.760]  bring this up the guy's name is roi spencer and he's a former senior climate scientist uh former
[3:22:44.760 --> 3:22:55.080]  in in a n a s a uh marshall space flight center and his name is roi spencer sound like a good guy
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:59.480]  you need to get in touch with and get him on the program and did it say where he was from
[3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:07.960]  or who he's with now because uh former senior climate scientist scientist at the marshall
[3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:16.920]  space center well uh in a s a marshall space flight center well that's a don't understand all that
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:23.560]  sure let me bring this up to dr baggage uh one of the top climatologist uh who studies carbon
[3:23:23.560 --> 3:23:30.040]  load in australia has come out and said he was wrong and bullied into saying it was manmade
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:35.960]  that it's not manmade that they have a huge exodus of top scientists saying that it's not
[3:23:35.960 --> 3:23:39.960]  manmade and then it's natural dr baggage that's going to be a problem well we're coming back
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:49.720]  to the live program here we go my only friend we were just talking to jd in texas about c span
[3:23:49.720 --> 3:23:57.480]  cutting off a climatologist formerly with nasa uh dr baggage they have top rocket scientists top
[3:23:58.040 --> 3:24:03.880]  climatologist i mean every day they're going public saying it's all fraud it's lies uh people
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:09.000]  who they claim it signed on to un agreements are saying it's all lies they're in trouble i mean
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:14.760]  their little hoax is in trouble well you know that the biggest contributors are are not man man
[3:24:14.760 --> 3:24:19.880]  contributes less than one percent uh it's nature you know right now we have two volcanoes going off
[3:24:19.880 --> 3:24:24.920]  in Alaska that are producing more than man's producing at any given moment i can assure you
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:30.920]  uh on this planet when you start to look at the the real uh release is you know methane gas which
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:38.120]  is a big contributor 20 times more than co2 and methane is being released because of natural climate
[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:44.680]  change here in the arctic we have a permafrost across the arctic regions of alaska russia canada
[3:24:44.680 --> 3:24:51.320]  and the permafrost is is like um um a hundred thousand years of soil that hasn't had a chance
[3:24:51.320 --> 3:24:56.760]  to fully degrade of organic matter that is now degrading and releasing methane 20 times more
[3:24:56.760 --> 3:25:02.680]  potent and that is actually accelerating the cycle but it's a natural cycle it happens from
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:08.200]  time to time and people don't recognize it as such there are other contributing factors for
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:14.200]  climate change pole shift which happens fairly regularly geologically the last time it happened
[3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:21.320]  was 15 000 years ago which correlates to the last ice age um starting to end and when you start to
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:26.360]  look at all these things together and we do in in our videos and books we analyze a lot of this
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:32.520]  and the reality is nature is doing it well that's why i had uh one of the rothschilds on the guy
[3:25:32.520 --> 3:25:39.160]  pushing all this stuff and i brought up well why is the why are the ice caps melting on mars
[3:25:40.040 --> 3:25:45.720]  and right he just said because mars is closer to the sun than earth and i said no it's not and
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:50.520]  he just laughed knowing that the average american is so dumb down they're just gonna believe him
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:55.160]  and then i was debating another one of these guys on air and he just said there are no ice
[3:25:55.160 --> 3:26:01.000]  caps on mars and i was like you know there's ice caps they just don't care they they are
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:06.360]  counting on people being dumbed down and that's a great insult to people again you know and it is
[3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:10.360]  and it's the system that you know and scientists are very elite you know you think there's a lot of
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:16.120]  competition in business you've not seen anything that you've met scientists and these guys are
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:22.280]  ruthless and and in terms of how they behave towards one another and it's amazing and yet
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:28.760]  they claim uh almost like it's um if you challenge them outside of their discipline they're supposed
[3:26:28.760 --> 3:26:34.040]  to be an expert in everything and nobody none of us are and and the fact is uh even benny's we first
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:38.440]  we're dealing with ben you know he he and i we we had a good rapport and we've always we're always
[3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:43.720]  friends up until his death but he started to he listened you know he looked at what we raised
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:49.160]  and he analyzed that and then he actually started talking about activists not being ignored but
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:54.760]  actually being listened to because people can get educated uh outside of their discipline and this is
[3:26:54.760 --> 3:26:59.960]  where the arrogance of so much science and the expectation that the average person won't ask
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:04.360]  the questions and science feels like somehow they're above the challenge and they should be
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:10.120]  challenged just as vigorously uh as anyone else whether you're in politics business uh or the
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:15.800]  art well i agree but but bottom line the message is the ice caps and the ice moons of jupiter and
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:23.160]  saturn are not melting because of suv's that's right and it is reality and they know it and
[3:27:23.160 --> 3:27:28.040]  they've monitored it and and all of that tells us again it's the solar cycle and there's a sun
[3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:33.160]  many many scientists saying this today yeah and now they want to tax on carbon dioxide
[3:27:33.720 --> 3:27:40.120]  that is one of the four ingredients of light of of life light water carbon dioxide and oxygen
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:45.320]  gotta have those four things or you don't have life on this planet but by by but by being able to tax
[3:27:45.320 --> 3:27:51.880]  one of the key you know basic uh factors of life that gives the private banks total control and
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:27:58.280]  think of the boldness the arrogance of brainwashing for decades about the environment it hijacks any
[3:27:58.280 --> 3:28:03.720]  real environmental concerns of the cross species engineering and the toxic waste dumping and
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:10.600]  rainforest chopping all accelerates but we all feel good and tax our evil carbon that the rainforest
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:18.200]  breathes it is just so diabolical to see it and then they as i told people they would do is i read
[3:28:18.200 --> 3:28:23.240]  it in think tank documents then they announced six months ago you're going to buy your carbon credit
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:28.600]  from the private central banks making them the government let's go to another call and we'll
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:37.240]  go into break with jd in texas jd you're on the air with dr nick baggage yeah alex um i i uh i told
[3:28:37.240 --> 3:28:43.560]  you about the roe spencer yes you were just telling me about that you want to finish up i got some
[3:28:43.560 --> 3:28:53.000]  more information he's a university of alabama principal research scientist you know i think we
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:57.160]  may have interviewed him okay thank you so much we're going to go to break talk behind the scenes
[3:28:57.160 --> 3:29:01.640]  with dr nick baggage take more of your calls again behind the scenes means prison planet

[3:29:52.280 --> 3:29:58.760]  because this is the information i was looking and investigating for years i wanted this information
[3:29:58.760 --> 3:30:07.400]  now i have the true well as an evangelist my job is to save souls and to uh do the same work as you
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:13.560]  do to awaken you know those are sleeping because you know the uh the the churches here are sleeping

[3:30:17.960 --> 3:30:22.600]  what do you think about yes sir you're on air what do you think about the issues that we've
[3:30:22.600 --> 3:30:27.000]  been discussing do you have any comments for dr nick baggage i'm going to come back when we finish
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:34.040]  a few calls and we are going to uh for uh you know the rest of the audience talk about what he
[3:30:34.040 --> 3:30:39.640]  believes their in game is what drives the new world order what their master plan is what this great
[3:30:39.640 --> 3:30:43.640]  work is they're building how they want to build a world government to reduce our population i mean
[3:30:43.640 --> 3:30:48.120]  that's their stated goal but i want to get his expertise on it but but but if you would like to
[3:30:48.120 --> 3:30:52.120]  speak about in game that's fine or if you have any questions for dr baggage that's fine as well
[3:30:55.480 --> 3:31:02.680]  uh jones anything else yeah i have another question okay go ahead and come back i want
[3:31:02.680 --> 3:31:09.720]  you to explain to me okay hello yes sir you're on air sir yeah i'm here okay okay there's a new
[3:31:09.720 --> 3:31:18.040]  driver's license in december is coming here okay uh it says all Quebecers will have to choose between
[3:31:18.040 --> 3:31:25.560]  a traditional driver's license and another one with a microchip called rfid can you explain yeah
[3:31:25.560 --> 3:31:31.320]  yeah that's what they're doing what is rfid radio frequency identification devices they can track
[3:31:31.320 --> 3:31:35.240]  everywhere you're going and what you're doing and this is how they're doing it they're phasing it in
[3:31:35.240 --> 3:31:40.680]  you have to have it with the us passport now the new passports have it uh it is going into all the
[3:31:40.680 --> 3:31:44.920]  driver's license here and you don't have a choice in some areas of the world they are saying you
[3:31:44.920 --> 3:31:50.920]  have a choice for a few years but then no one has a choice it destroys any privacy allows thieves to
[3:31:50.920 --> 3:31:56.440]  steal it but that's designed to cause greater identity theft and then they come in with more
[3:31:56.440 --> 3:32:02.040]  regulation and more control let me get dr baggage's comment on that thanks for the call absolutely in
[3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:07.560]  fact rfid they first they said you couldn't read them except um right up close and the fact is from
[3:32:07.560 --> 3:32:13.240]  two kilometers away you can read them and that was announced a couple years ago and the idea of
[3:32:13.240 --> 3:32:17.400]  density the amount of information stored on one of these and the miniaturization of them
[3:32:18.120 --> 3:32:23.400]  on a nano scale is happening at such a tremendous rate as things get smaller and information
[3:32:23.400 --> 3:32:28.200]  then gets bigger the amount of information on that little micro circuit about you becomes
[3:32:28.200 --> 3:32:33.720]  uh significant and the fact that because it's technology-based readers will be decoded like
[3:32:33.720 --> 3:32:37.880]  every cell phone secret is and every internet they've already caught them doing it here we go to the
[3:32:37.880 --> 3:32:41.880]  main audience here we go
[3:32:41.880 --> 3:32:55.720]  i remember about six years ago i was in the san francisco chronicle that the
[3:32:56.760 --> 3:33:04.920]  instant paid toll road rfid stickers that were putting on their cars the feds had paid for a
[3:33:04.920 --> 3:33:10.120]  grant all over the city to track you by your name and by your vehicle everywhere you went
[3:33:10.120 --> 3:33:15.720]  that was going on database and now with texas tag and k tag and secure tag and all these companies
[3:33:15.720 --> 3:33:20.360]  they're tracking everywhere you go your cell phone that the the caller was asking about rfid
[3:33:20.360 --> 3:33:27.000]  dr baggots breakdown rfid for us yeah this is again um you know instead of a barcode which was
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:34.120]  unique say of an item or a product rfid is unique information about that specific item in other words
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:38.680]  one of the things that's visualized with rfid is that eventually every product will have this
[3:33:38.680 --> 3:33:45.640]  this so that the irs as an example could walk into your home wave a reader and tabulate the value of
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:50.840]  all of your contents and figure out if it lines up with your income as an example an insurance
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:55.880]  company could use it uh in terms of tracking you coming they would also know the whole history of
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:01.560]  all those goods uh to know if you were engaging in what's going to be totally illegal and in fact
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:05.720]  they're about to pass the law it also will shut down shopping carts you have to report on yourself
[3:34:05.720 --> 3:34:11.800]  in real time to the feds through the merchant accounts and they're saying that barter and
[3:34:11.800 --> 3:34:18.520]  swap meets and that it will be a federal felony offense to have uh even garage sales go ahead
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:23.320]  you know this is a you know when you want to talk about the prediction this is about the most
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:29.800]  directed and controlled society uh envisioned ever envisioned or at least um and ever envisioned
[3:34:29.800 --> 3:34:35.560]  since uh the the book of revelations and the and the revelation of john on the island of pat most
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:43.000]  you know the fact is it's about total absolute control over what you do where you go whether
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:48.440]  you buy whether you sell whether you're part of the system or excluded from it and you know that
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:54.920]  that is a significant transfer and by the way of power you wrote 10 12 years ago about all this
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:58.600]  and said it would be used in a predatory fashion everything you said has come through in fact
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:02.760]  marine your stuff a decade ago it's worse than what you said because i know you you knew it was
[3:35:02.760 --> 3:35:07.320]  worse but you held back just to be credible uh and you know you had an institute up that just
[3:35:07.320 --> 3:35:12.520]  studies all of this uh was some folks involved with the lay fortune so a lot of serious people
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:17.880]  are are are really concerned about all this but when you go to RFID conferences or you read their
[3:35:17.880 --> 3:35:23.240]  minutes that are on the web they say this is predatory this is to control this is a defense
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:28.040]  department directive this whole grid going in you want to explain to people that that that it
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:34.120]  isn't just us saying this has bad uses we're told it has some everyday commercial use but
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:39.640]  that's only to fund it they're very smart they fund it to the free market they have us pay for
[3:35:39.640 --> 3:35:45.560]  our own enslavement they admit it's it's it's diabolical you know and it's and it's the tagging
[3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:49.800]  of the individual you already have a number your social security number tags you to everything you
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:55.880]  do and is supposed to be safeguarded you have other identifiers and when you look at uh the
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:36:01.080]  data banks uh the groups that have lost data and got nailed for it or grew free reported on before
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:07.160]  anybody even knew their names because they had do d department of defense contracts to develop that
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:11.880]  data and and and they were looking at ways to create sort of from cradle to grave the whole
[3:36:11.880 --> 3:36:17.720]  profile of the individual and a couple of these programs got shut down in the 90s and then read
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:23.400]  us renamed and relabeled and read you know re regurgitated right back at us and this is the
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:28.920]  problem is he's long-standing bureaucracies that hide behind um privacy as national security and
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:34.440]  in fact are working against every one of our security by using this system of government to
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:40.760]  corrupt uh the various systems that should be protecting us the idea of a totally controlled
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:47.080]  financial uh institution as people are looked at as consumers and taxpayers as just contributors
[3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:52.920]  in that way and it is an elite attitude because the best in science the best in religion the best
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:57.640]  in everything that we do came from the mavericks that stood out that weren't part of some elite
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:02.360]  uh whether you look at the airplane uh micro computers the best things that affect us in
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:07.400]  the most profound way happened by you and me average people who saw things just a little
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:13.000]  bit differently well that's it the elites always when they get full control create stagnant dark
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:20.040]  ages and persecute free thinkers and after they get rid of the most free thinkers now the next
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:26.040]  group is seen as radical and radical and radical and the persecution just continues until society's
[3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:30.760]  finally collapsed and the elites even admit that they've done this so they say well we're gonna
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:36.360]  have a scientific dictatorship so so that no one can ever rebel and so that we don't collapse
[3:37:36.360 --> 3:37:41.800]  and that brings me down dr baggage to their endgame studying i know you get into core documents
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:48.120]  who the elite are what they planned on building this high tech police state the plans to reduce
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:54.040]  our numbers forcibly control bio weapon releases uh i mean break down what from the evidence you
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:59.640]  have what their endgame goals are and what we're facing if we don't fight back well i think it's
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:03.800]  two things um you know when you really look at it sort of what works against us and what works
[3:38:03.800 --> 3:38:08.360]  in their favor and there's only a certain level they want want the populations to be driven down
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:13.640]  too because they lose too if it all collapses so you need to control it you need to actually
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:19.000]  manipulate it and both whether liberal or conservative doesn't really matter it's a different rationale
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:24.600]  you know for control but the rationale is still there and it's exploited by the same organizations
[3:38:24.600 --> 3:38:29.400]  that are behind the scenes and that's a it's a global corporation uh predominantly you know
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:35.400]  corporations uh once the founders die are soulless creatures that live forever you know that exist
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:41.400]  on the on a foundation of greed um you need to reshape sort of that uh and build into it the
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:46.440]  kind of safeguards that hold people accountable not just in government but within corporations
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:51.160]  when they can have such a huge impact on human populations as they do when you look at reduced
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:56.760]  populations as a big issue you see it but you know the real official population is so understated
[3:38:56.760 --> 3:39:01.000]  because in the third world the cost of a birth certificate is more than a week's wages and most
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:06.440]  people don't even have them they're born in their homes so the unofficial population is probably 50
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:12.520]  percent more than what we hear officially reported and when you look at disease uh disorder and the
[3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:18.200]  price of food alone and how many people will die in the next decade just because food although the
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:23.560]  third world is emerging uh they'll be starving and you're already seeing it food riots that aren't
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:28.360]  reported on the mainstream media imagine that in this country and here's what someone said to me
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:32.520]  and they're talking about how horrible it's going to be in the u.s and you know they're giving this
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:37.800]  Armageddon picture for somebody living in the suburbs of Bombay Armageddon already happened
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:42.920]  and they're living the experience and we need to recognize that on this planet we are going to be
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:49.080]  subjected to that same Armageddon or we're going to avoid it based upon how we use our judgment
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:54.280]  the responsibility of having this economy rests with every one of us the responsibility of doing
[3:39:54.280 --> 3:39:57.800]  the right things with our economy and our government rests with every one of us not with
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.080]  elites from somewhere else with no national identity we need to take back our government
[3:40:03.080 --> 3:40:07.640]  our natural resources and make sure they're working in the interest of the populations
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:13.320]  that live in this country in this sovereign country uh and at the same time be a light to the rest
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:17.880]  of the world as was originally intended not a dictator to the rest of the world well i agree
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:22.200]  with the doctor um baggage want to take a few final calls here before you have to leave us but
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:30.040]  but there is a debate within the elite and i mentioned this every few days because it's such
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:34.760]  a big deal that local texas papers reported what i've witnessed and what i know you've witnessed
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:40.920]  being all over the world this anti-humanism this teaching us to be guilty about our own life that
[3:40:40.920 --> 3:40:47.320]  is only the elite training us to take away our life force uh instinct our survival instinct
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:56.520]  to to create some type of uh psychological uh love affair with death that is only the elite
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:41:03.320]  wanting to basically remove our propulsion system uh from society what propels humanity
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:11.160]  forward they're trying to destroy and uh teach us to you know basically hate ourselves right and
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:16.840]  and so you have a debate between the elite a minority only believes that half of us should
[3:41:16.840 --> 3:41:23.800]  be killed uh and you know they say phase that in one-shot policies euthanasia the majority
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:29.080]  say 80 percent need to be killed uh and that bio weapons need to be released and they have to
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:32.920]  have a global police state to do that in orderly fashion they need to have smaller bio weapon
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:37.800]  releases to test covering it up and test how it spreads and to prepare larger releases
[3:41:38.600 --> 3:41:45.000]  but then now it's radicalizing where uh the largest minority of elitists in their minions
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:51.160]  say 90 percent need to die with a with another subset minority that's growing saying all humans
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:55.720]  need to be killed and then these people you will notice who are even talking like this on their
[3:41:55.720 --> 3:42:01.960]  own websites graduate students doctorates are working in bio weapon labs and bio weapon lab
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:07.480]  related systems and then the government is recruiting them to work in the facilities
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:15.480]  uh we are i mean this is a mega threat and i put out calls for this and basically my listeners
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:20.520]  demanded it and the fbi did go visit some of the ut professors and others that were calling for
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:25.960]  the death of 90 percent of us who were connected to bio weapons production uh but still they
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:32.120]  should be removed from their positions near bio weapons and weaponized uh agents can you comment
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:36.680]  on that you know i i would agree with you anyone who makes those kind of statements obviously
[3:42:36.680 --> 3:42:41.480]  shouldn't be developing those uh you know those kinds of systems you know the thing about global
[3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:46.440]  population and this is it's another fallacy in in in my mind you know when you look at
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:51.720]  global populations and the true resources of the world there are sufficient resources and this is
[3:42:51.720 --> 3:42:56.840]  the the biggest secret not i'm not talking about everybody going back we need to build ocean cities
[3:42:56.840 --> 3:43:02.600]  ocean cities very cheaply inexpensively off the coastlines that will become huge natural reefs
[3:43:02.600 --> 3:43:08.200]  and then mine the re exactly big and we have the opportunity to solve all of these problems
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:14.840]  but again it's about denying really what we are you know we're we're created in the image of the
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:21.560]  creator many of us believe that and that means we have an access point that scares the hell
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:26.120]  out of the elite because if we were fully actualized as human beings if we were fully
[3:43:26.120 --> 3:43:30.360]  manifesting the gifts of the spirit which been documented in science in many many ways
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:35.240]  then you know and that is really where the fear is on their side you know when we talk about all
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:41.880]  these issues the best way to keep people from reaching those high latitudes by fear fear raises
[3:43:41.880 --> 3:43:48.200]  your uh your your brain activity into the high beta ranges where you cannot reach these higher
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:53.320]  states of created consciousness where we are in our most creative states our most intellectual
[3:43:53.320 --> 3:43:58.040]  places where artists thrive where the painter thrives where the politician thrives when they're
[3:43:58.040 --> 3:44:03.320]  doing the right work where the where the person has that sense of who they are it happens at a
[3:44:03.320 --> 3:44:08.920]  different brain frequency that cannot be realized let me say it again if you're in a state of fear
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:14.520]  they are knocking out government perpetuate they are knocking out our sense of purpose
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:20.120]  and our sense of building the species because let's face it our lives are twinkling of an eye but
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:25.400]  the species goes on forever you understand and so that's why you have this eternal feeling
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:31.400]  that's why you love nostalgia and love thinking about your ancestors because we all realize that
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:36.760]  we live on even if you don't believe in the spirit we live on through the species my ancestors live
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:42.920]  on through me my progeny i will live on through them and through and i i really think about my great
[3:44:42.920 --> 3:44:47.320]  great grandchildren when we've terraformed mars if we beat the new world order you know when
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:53.720]  we're going out to alphas and turries i i actually get excited thinking about them and all the
[3:44:53.720 --> 3:44:57.800]  wonders they're going to see and i want to beat the new world order even if i get killed because
[3:44:57.800 --> 3:45:03.560]  i literally have a passion for my progeny and that doesn't just doesn't mean my flesh and blood
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:10.280]  but all of us the same genetic code we are magical powerful dynamic creatures and the globalist
[3:45:10.280 --> 3:45:17.240]  are jealous envious hoarding greedy little bastards who are you're right who are trying to hoard this
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:22.280]  for themselves and they say it they say we're going into the future you're not and folks need to
[3:45:22.280 --> 3:45:27.560]  know that they're trying to dam us off from the future and and and this is the fight we're facing
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:33.000]  you know when you look at all of it when you look at it in the backdrop again of what's possible
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:37.400]  and that's what all of the research and technology you know tells me all the horrible things and in
[3:45:37.400 --> 3:45:42.120]  the mind control area the thing that the government discovered that scared the heck out of them was
[3:45:42.120 --> 3:45:47.400]  when they started unraveling the fact that human beings have all these latent potentials i mean
[3:45:47.400 --> 3:45:52.360]  can you imagine the average person being able to look through government and see what is hidden in
[3:45:52.360 --> 3:45:58.040]  those dark places there'd be a lot of people uh gnashing their teeth uh in that scenario and
[3:45:58.040 --> 3:46:03.000]  the fact of the matter is we do have those capabilities they documented them the fact is
[3:46:03.000 --> 3:46:07.720]  artificially within the lab it's been created whether you can actually see that play out it's
[3:46:07.720 --> 3:46:13.640]  just as uh bizarre as 500 years ago the average person being able to read a book uh you know
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:18.600]  the fact is science is doubling from the invention of the wheel to where we are at the moment
[3:46:18.600 --> 3:46:25.080]  every nine to ten months the possibilities are also doubling and and and it's a case of re looking
[3:46:25.080 --> 3:46:29.480]  at it you know keep the internet free which is where we started this today because that is an
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:35.400]  opportunity to exchange ideas where the the guy in the bicycle shop invents the next airplane
[3:46:35.400 --> 3:46:40.360]  you know the guy in the garage invents the next micro computer as an example you know these are
[3:46:40.360 --> 3:46:45.560]  things that are possible today like no other time in history and they're being taken from us
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:50.600]  i agree fear of the elite because they fear the average man the average woman on this planet
[3:46:50.600 --> 3:46:55.800]  they want to hoard their controls and and they're and they're blocking developments and systems that
[3:46:55.800 --> 3:46:59.960]  could give them life extension they could give them so much their greed is only hurting them
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:05.560]  let's take a few final calls uh and for tv viewers this is a salacious crumb i was joking about how
[3:47:05.560 --> 3:47:09.880]  he looked like david rockefeller so bermus ordered me one off ebay and he just came in and gave it to
[3:47:09.880 --> 3:47:16.600]  me that's that's david rocke you're laughing you know who salacious crumb is no you know that creature
[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:23.480]  that job of the huts little pet okay david rockefeller he's david rockefeller's in studio today
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:29.800]  uh a little bit of fun here let's go ahead and talk to arc arc angel from pitchburg p a go ahead
[3:47:32.840 --> 3:47:38.600]  come in arc angel alex dr baggots how you doing good thanks hey i just wanted to bring up some
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:44.040]  quick things about the the energy they're keeping uh four quick points what about the free energy out
[3:47:44.040 --> 3:47:50.040]  of the air that was originally designed by nicola tesla the water car stan mire produced and they
[3:47:50.040 --> 3:47:55.480]  murdered him for it and the government came and took it the anti-gravity drive or the hydrogen
[3:47:55.480 --> 3:48:02.280]  drive that they have that they use on the astra trb3 that's a black project uh next ops like aurora
[3:48:02.280 --> 3:48:08.840]  and uh they have cold fusion developed already and gravity warping what about those things there you
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:13.080]  know all of those there's there's quite a bit uh out there on beach you know the ones that are the
[3:48:13.080 --> 3:48:18.600]  most um uh potential are these exotic technologies they tend to be suppressed those one in particular
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:25.240]  i saw which was using um microwave energy and what they did is they oscillated the microwave
[3:48:25.240 --> 3:48:30.440]  at a point where it oscillates same frequency as water and what it caused through resonance
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:36.440]  a very little amount of energy in caused the two uh elements to split the hydrogen and the oxygen
[3:48:36.440 --> 3:48:42.520]  very efficiently and it would burn instantly um we had it for a while a posting of that video
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:49.800]  on our website but the fact is there are many methods to get us energy energy just by recognizing
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:55.000]  how to sort of crack the elements another one is sodium borohydrate which is an element that
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:49:01.640]  can be electrolyzed with water that'll cause it to split very vigorously uh you know a lot of science
[3:49:01.640 --> 3:49:08.280]  has been developed mit even in the mainstream with g e showed a um fuel cell two years ago that was
[3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:13.160]  producing uh energy at the equivalent of three dollars a gallon uh gasoline and you haven't
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:18.840]  heard a word about well flange and and uh the other guy actually made something that was giving
[3:49:18.840 --> 3:49:23.240]  off power now hundreds of universities have done it but because the media tried to discredit that
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:27.560]  then people just say oh that's fake god that doesn't matter right doesn't matter how many
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:32.760]  journals it's published in absolute fact and it was and it was replicated i think six thousand
[3:49:32.760 --> 3:49:37.800]  times was the last number i read and you know it still doesn't explain you know explain it fully
[3:49:37.800 --> 3:49:44.200]  but that's okay you know these are this is where again science is ruthless and the mainstream
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:52.760]  and the academic institutions it's a very uh jealous environment of experts that are afraid
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:56.680]  of their own shadow and you've got a lot of them who have developed theories that have been proven
[3:49:56.680 --> 3:50:01.320]  false and they're not about to be made laughing stocks of and so they're going to continue to put
[3:50:01.320 --> 3:50:05.560]  their disinfo out dr baggage that we're going to let you go after this break you're going to be gone
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:09.640]  in three minutes we're going to talk to brian brian and jeff they'll each get about a minute
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:13.640]  and then i'm going to let you go so you've got to go to that meeting final segment after this break
[3:50:13.640 --> 3:50:17.880]  for everybody listening on the am and fm dialing global short way for info wars dot com stream
[3:50:17.880 --> 3:50:28.440]  listeners the show will continue with baggage right now they're right back attention gc n listeners
[3:50:28.440 --> 3:50:33.240]  okay i'm gonna go ahead and talk to baggage here uh doc let's go to brian in texas real fast brian
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:42.600]  you're on the air some reason i can't hear brian uh there john hello brian yeah brian go ahead bro
[3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:48.680]  uh i'm on there he's just going to keep saying that okay thanks brian that was brian in texas
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:55.320]  let's go to brian in new york brian in new york you're on the air go ahead hey go ahead my question
[3:50:55.320 --> 3:51:04.520]  was about um harp and would all these cell phone towers that are everywhere would they possibly be
[3:51:04.520 --> 3:51:11.960]  used for the same purpose that harp is intended for for some purposes you know the any electromagnetic
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:16.840]  carrier cell phones in particular can be used for transmitting signals that will affect for
[3:51:16.840 --> 3:51:21.160]  instance emotional states of people and you can do it in sort of the background of your normal
[3:51:21.160 --> 3:51:26.840]  phone communications as an example um any electromagnetic carrier there was an article
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:32.440]  and i know alex has reported on this from before it's the mind has no firewalls at the u s army
[3:51:32.440 --> 3:51:39.480]  war college quarterly perimeters and any carrier whether it be power power lines radio tv broadcast
[3:51:39.480 --> 3:51:46.120]  the internet um cell phones uh etc can be used to influence behaviors of people over uh either
[3:51:46.120 --> 3:51:50.680]  narrow bandwidth like cell phones you could even the new intended designs allow you to sort of
[3:51:50.680 --> 3:51:55.800]  focus on a specific individual within one meter so you could target an individual or you could use
[3:51:55.800 --> 3:52:00.600]  it for a larger population segment and of course dotter beggars i should have gotten you on today
[3:52:00.600 --> 3:52:04.920]  and gotten you to talk about all the chemical biological radiological testing on the people in
[3:52:04.920 --> 3:52:09.560]  fact let me set you up in a couple of weeks have to have try call you uh in the next few days uh
[3:52:09.560 --> 3:52:15.720]  just to come on get all your files out and get into testing perfect that sounds great because
[3:52:15.720 --> 3:52:20.040]  that's you know this is again uh an important area because when you start to talk about all of this
[3:52:20.760 --> 3:52:24.920]  the people that have paid the price or the american you know we we've been the victim oh yeah we've
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:30.600]  already admit because we've been the superpower we've had the big aggressive elite that wants
[3:52:30.600 --> 3:52:36.440]  more more more and so they've used us basically as their tool shed uh mercilessly brian anything
[3:52:36.440 --> 3:52:41.880]  else yeah uh real quickly if if they were to spray say aluminum and barium into the atmosphere
[3:52:41.880 --> 3:52:47.640]  could that enhance our capabilities um it's a possibility and i've heard this before and
[3:52:47.640 --> 3:52:52.840]  actually there's we'd have to talk more about it than we got time today but the barium and aluminum
[3:52:52.840 --> 3:52:58.600]  also appear as pollutants coming in from asia naturally within our environments and in many
[3:52:58.600 --> 3:53:04.040]  areas in the area box site um and aluminum production they have a they they have a lot of
[3:53:04.040 --> 3:53:08.520]  aluminum particularly material you don't need that uh you don't need any of that in order to
[3:53:08.520 --> 3:53:13.480]  enhance the signal the chinese burn a lot of their trash and it blows right into the jet stream
[3:53:13.480 --> 3:53:19.400]  right across the us that's correct in fact um it said there's a dissertation that became a book
[3:53:19.400 --> 3:53:23.720]  called the secret lives of dust which i would recommend to that to this uh list doc we're out
[3:53:23.720 --> 3:53:28.920]  of time and thank you brian doc we're out of time i'm going to have tre call you i want to set you
[3:53:28.920 --> 3:53:33.960]  up for two hours talk about chemical biological testing soon okay sounds good thanks for having
[3:53:33.960 --> 3:53:57.080]  me on and god bless your audience you bet earth pulse dot com take care doc
[3:54:22.520 --> 3:54:24.200]  back live worldwide transmission
[3:54:26.120 --> 3:54:29.640]  salacious crumb is our guest in studio
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:36.200]  you know couldn't david Rockefeller just repent of all was evil and just be happy and
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:42.920]  help people and not be so wicked but in their own sick way they think what they're doing
[3:54:42.920 --> 3:54:48.120]  is good to the world uh it's it's actually horrible uh but uh we're basically out of
[3:54:48.120 --> 3:54:53.560]  time i want to cram jeff in maryland in and i do want to tell everybody we carry his new video on

[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:05.240]  angels still don't play this heart we have his mind control video several other documentaries
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:10.760]  and presentations he has made available at info wars dot com or by calling toll free
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:16.040]  one eight eight eight two five three three one three nine and a lot of people are calling in
[3:55:16.040 --> 3:55:20.200]  running and raving about in game that film is really getting big my film's always kind of have
[3:55:20.200 --> 3:55:26.920]  a delayed response uh i we don't have time for that with truth rising if you have the dvd please
[3:55:26.920 --> 3:55:31.880]  make copies if you have a prison planet dot tv membership downloaded in super high quality
[3:55:31.880 --> 3:55:35.000]  please burn it on desk or cd give it to people now
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:42.120]  because it it's just such a powerful film i don't have time to get into it just check it out get
[3:55:42.120 --> 3:55:48.200]  the film today again i want to go to jeff before we do that the sponsor of the day is a cola blue
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:55.960]  they are just an amazing company we have one here in the office it grabs gallons and gallons
[3:55:55.960 --> 3:56:01.000]  up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours 7.5 gallons that's in high humidity but the
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:07.720]  desert it produces two gallons a day atmospheric water generator it's got five filters in it easy
[3:56:07.720 --> 3:56:13.400]  maintenance uh just an amazing system and i'd seen these years ago in companies and places and
[3:56:13.400 --> 3:56:17.400]  then i saw them online i said get that as a sponsor that is really neat you can hook it up to solar
[3:56:17.400 --> 3:56:23.080]  panels you can get water anywhere even if you're off the grid anywhere this sucker gets water ladies
[3:56:23.080 --> 3:56:34.840]  and gentlemen uh it's totally clean and pure 866 585 4044 a cola blue 866 585 4044 or a cola blue
[3:56:34.840 --> 3:56:41.880]  dot com big banner on info wars dot com ec olo blue dot com okay you're our tail gunner jeff in
[3:56:41.880 --> 3:56:47.800]  maryland you're on the air worldwide welcome hey alex yeah i just wanted to throw in a little
[3:56:47.800 --> 3:56:53.640]  something and say that um you know with your guests and everything for some four decades uh a period
[3:56:53.640 --> 3:56:58.680]  roughly spanning seven administrations the government's intelligence agencies and police
[3:56:58.680 --> 3:57:03.720]  agencies have have broken the law and violated the constitution and i think it's it's unnerving
[3:57:03.720 --> 3:57:08.760]  to think that the kind of to tell us or the taller areas that's taking place in america
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:15.000]  and i think that it's it's it's just mind-boggling that the american people are not recognizing it
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:21.320]  and you know people talked about the nsa spine program alex but you know for more than two decades
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:27.400]  with the collusion of the communications companies the nsa and operation shamrod received copies of
[3:57:27.400 --> 3:57:32.280]  millions of cables and other things sent through the united states from but i think it was around
[3:57:32.280 --> 3:57:39.320]  55 to 75 the you know the fbi investigated uh almost a billion subversives targets and the
[3:57:39.320 --> 3:57:44.280]  cia index hundreds of thousands and you listen you're an awesome caller call call me back tomorrow
[3:57:44.280 --> 3:57:48.680]  i'm gonna have a lot of open phones this week uh you're great jeff i wish i would have gotten to
[3:57:48.680 --> 3:57:53.800]  you earlier but absolutely thank you so much exactly they're violating the fourth amendment
[3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:58.760]  we have a criminal government a criminal lead we got to get america back retransmission starts in
[3:57:58.760 --> 3:58:04.840]  10 seconds at info wars dot com on the audio screams go there now for everybody else see
[3:58:04.840 --> 3:58:30.440]  you back live tomorrow info wars dot com
