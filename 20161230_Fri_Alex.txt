[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Move it!
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.000]  Get out of the way!
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  Info wars help to fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  I will not let you down.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  We are in the twilight of 2016.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  It is Friday, December 30th, 2016.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I intend to do a two-hour Facebook mention
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  slash YouTube transmission tomorrow night.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  From the officer from my home, I have not decided yet,
[01:18.000 --> 01:26.000]  but I intend tomorrow night, starting at about, I think, nine o'clock central or so,
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  to go right through until midnight, at least in the east.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  Bring in the new year and say farewell to one of the most incredible years in human history
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  as humanity awakened to the globalist technocracy.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  What an amazing time to be alive, but also to understand the battle has just now begun.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  Where to begin? Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  Nearing exit, Obama seeks to tie Trump's hands.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  I have a stack of news articles where Obama is sabotaging the United States every way he can.
[02:02.000 --> 02:15.000]  I have a stack of news articles where he is unleashing 3,853 regs, 18 for every law,
[02:15.000 --> 02:24.000]  a record 97,000-plus pages of red tape, ugly snub of voters.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  It's incredible.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  Meanwhile, Putin laughs off Obama, Russian's mock political corpse, close quote,
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  angry and shallow brain, and Putin is not expelling any diplomats that had been falsely announced
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  by our news, as usual, yesterday, and I was even watching CNN this morning
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  at about 6 a.m. and they were announcing that Putin was kicking everybody out of Russia.
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  And then I went and punched up infowars.com about 30 minutes later after I got out of the shower.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  I take a shower before I work out, just how I wake up.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  Don't you love modern conveniences?
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  Anyway, side issue, and saw the kids off to their camps, their exercise camps,
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.000]  and then went back in and started researching, and noticed that Paul Watson had posted an article,
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  CNN runs fake news story about Russia closing Anglo-American school in Moscow.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  Just no proof.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  Russia never said it, just completely pulled it out of there.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  George Soros fed it rear-end.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  Horrible images in it continuing.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  There's also a new article by Glenn Greenwald from The Intercept,
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  The Guardian's summary of Julian Assange's interview went viral and was completely false.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  They just put fake quotes out.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  Even The Guardian now is stooping to lower levels, and see what's happening is,
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  they're going into total bizarro upside-down inversion world.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  And I know I used the term inversion in the last decade or so, probably every segment,
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  because if you understand inversion or upside-down world, you understand the enemy.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  Just reverse what they're saying.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  So when they say we're the fake news, and that we're lying, that means they're going total fake news.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  They are the fake news.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  And folks are saying, okay, tell us something we don't know.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  I understand you know that, but a lot of the public knows they're being lied to.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  They just don't know that it's organized criminal lying.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  They've had federal courts rule that mainstream media can lie about you,
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  and this year they ruled, and that you can't get unjust enrichment in a lawsuit,
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  even though it's proven that they were unjustly enriched on purpose.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  So they've basically legalized propaganda, legalized lying for them,
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  but they want to selectively come in with government and shut everybody else down.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  Speaking of that, you know we got hit with the biggest denial of service attack in our 20-year history last week.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  It's still ongoing.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  Drudge just got hit, and he says probably the U.S. government.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000]  The Air Fulfillment Center will stay in the air, being refueled and resupplied by shuttles from the surface.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  The patent was won in April, but recently made its circles around the Internet
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  after a CB insider tweeted the plans for the quote, e-commerce death star.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  Amazon already runs warehouses with the Kiva Robot.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  They have successfully tested their delivery drones.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Just imagine, you look up, and there is this monster Amazon warehouse,
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  flashing advertisements with thousands of drones flying around it.
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  Bit of a dystopic image. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com, and we're not in Kansas anymore.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  This is the start of 2017.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  Storewide free shipping at Infowarsstore.com, and some of the biggest specials of 2016.

[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[07:09.000 --> 07:16.000]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at Infowarsstore.com.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship,
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years, because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  Just go to Infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  Click on auto-ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  And with the new auto-ship feature at Infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  10% off on auto-ship.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  Win, win, win at Infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  And all auto-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say,
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[08:14.000 --> 08:35.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  Hard to believe.
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  It's already December 30th, 2016.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  And the mission we thought was impossible is possible.
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  We are now only 20 days out from Donald John Trump being inaugurated,
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  45th President of the United States.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  And he's announcing it's going to be about the people bringing in the general public,
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  but his little pomp and circumstance is possible to get it over and done
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  and move forward with the business of making America great again.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  And so far, Trump's public promise to me and his private promises
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  to not let me down and not let you down and restore the Republic
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  is being delivered in spades, the ace of spades, the diamond of spades,
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  the club of spades, the heart of spades.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  It's amazing.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  All right, we have a huge flotilla of guests joining us today.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  We have the lawyer, the deputy head of the FCC at the time,
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  Chief Counsel, who got rid of the fairness doctrine in the mid-80s
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  so we could have talk radio and free speech in America again.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  Bruce Fine's going to join us.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  In fact, guys, you print me that zero-hedge article that had the excerpts of the legislation,
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  the Countering Information Warfare Act,
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  because it was that particular headline about the Ministry of Truth being signed last Friday,
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  now seven days ago, because I want to specifically read those subsections to him.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  We had articles about it, too. I just forget the headlines.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  That one had excerpts as well, where it says,
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  the Board of Governors of the FCC will now be under the U.S. intelligence agencies
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  and will, quote, counter-propaganda domestically.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  I mean, this is just unprecedented.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  He's going to be joining us.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  Dr. Nick Begich was going to be popping in to give us his view
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  on just all of the amazing weather modification going on,
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  the social modification going on.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  In fact, Lee-Ann was covering mainstream news articles just two days ago
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  in studio with us. I think I forgot to talk to her.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  This kind of happens brainstorming on air.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  She had the articles printed up mainstream news admitting that the AI computers
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  that were taken into our houses, like Alexa and the rest of them from Amazon,
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  are meant to spy on us and also social engineer us and brainwash us,
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  actually say control our behavior.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  So this is a giant control grid.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  We'll be talking about that with Dr. Nick Begich coming up.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  You probably know the name.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  Many of you know he's a selling author, scientist, researcher.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  His dad was a famous congressman who was murdered.
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  We also, of course, have his brother who was in the U.S. Senate.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  He's a very informed individual.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  Now, continuing here, let me just give you some of the headlines we've got
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  or the general information.
[11:26.000 --> 11:35.000]  Major diplomatic escalation by Obama expelling giant groups of diplomats
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  and their staffs out of two different Russian leased and owned buildings out of the U.S.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  Everyone expected Russia to counter with this,
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  but Putin has taken the high road saying you are a lame duck.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  You don't represent the people or the U.S. government or the military.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  And so we're going to wait and see what Trump does when he gets in.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  We also have CNN caught running fake news stories about it.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  We're going to get into that.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  We have Breaking.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  It's up on infowars.com from last night.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  Drudge report under biggest DDoS attack since Sight's Inception.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Media icon questions whether U.S. government to blame.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  Well, we know that the attack we've been under for two weeks is governmental in nature
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  and is the type that the Communist Chinese bragged
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  that they've been launching.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  The problem is Obama is allied with the Communist Chinese,
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  so you can't tell because the two groups are basically like Simon's twins joined at the hip.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  But that is a big deal, obviously.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  We're also going to get into Sean Spicer, the new press secretary,
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  who has these weak defenses for Trump.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  And I'm trying to get Spicer's attention.
[12:48.000 --> 12:58.000]  Because Spicer, your buddy there at the RNC where you came from, Paul Ryan,
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  has come out and welcomed all this made up crap by Obama
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  about ferreting out Russians who were quote,
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  involved in our election and has endorsed the Democratic attack on Trump 45.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  And I know you think Trump, while you're not looking,
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  you can do stuff like this, I came out the day before Trump repudiated
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  and I said, that's bull that he's not going to drain the swamp.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  That's bull that he said that to that little Kissinger minion.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  And this is all a big setup.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  And the day after Trump came out and said exactly that,
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  and Gennrich had to come out and apologize.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  So I'm not here just attacking Spicer because I want to attack Spicer.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  These are very weak defenses we're hearing of the president like.
[13:48.000 --> 13:55.000]  Why doesn't the DNC take some blame for the hackings too?
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  Did you take basic measures to protect the data that was on there?
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  That is the weakest defense.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  How about why'd you have the stuff on there illegally?
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  How about why'd you get $35 million from Russia for our uranium, Hillary?
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  How about why'd you get money from the communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians publicly?
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  You should be indicted.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  How about stuff like that?
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  You totally change the subject onto the fact that they've criminally done this
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  and have been caught red handed.
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  They're the ones that are doing the things that they're claiming Trump has been caught doing.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see these weak, limp-rested responses
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  and to see Spicer and to see Gennrich and to see Paul Ryan,
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  who is the biggest weasel I've ever seen in my life.
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.000]  So fake, so disingenuous, totally creepy, totally lying every time he talks.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  Up there saying he supports Trump and our agenda when he's a globalist,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  operative through and through, and the Democrats and CNN love him.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  He is a monster.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  He is an enemy of this country.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  He is a George Soros baby piglet hanging off of George Soros' fetid tent.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  And I am personally completely sick of him.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  Looks like a frickin' vampire.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  Not just his pasty white skin with the widow's beak and his little psycho eyes.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  I don't know which one I can't stand to look at more.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  Him or Obama, they're both disgraceful trash.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  Un-American filth.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  We need to politically purge these people.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  Not physically, not in a fascistic way, but they tried to purge America.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  They tried to get our guns.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  They butchered our borders.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  They demoralized us.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  They signed us on to tens of trillions of debt.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  That isn't ours, the derivatives.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  I'm sick of them and I'm calling them out.
[15:55.000 --> 16:04.000]  Spicer comes out of the loins of the RNC and Priebus and Ryan and all these disreputable people.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  Yeah, Generic shall say some stuff that sounds really good.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  But have you read his books?
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  Have you read the forwards that he wrote for Two Different?
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  Alvin and Heidi Toffler books?
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  I have.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  I physically have the books here in this office.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  I've showed them on television.
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  He calls for a world government where everyone is microchipped to buy and sell.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  That is word for word in 1989.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  The Rockefellers love him.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  That's all you need to know.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  He worked for Nelson Rockefeller.
[16:37.000 --> 16:45.000]  That's where this creature, this futurist, this transhumanist, this eugenicist came from.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  Newt Generic is an enemy of the Republic.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  So is these other camp followers.
[16:54.000 --> 17:03.000]  I don't know if Spicer is just stupid, but he just comes up with the weakest defenses that play into their entire game.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  You don't play in their sandbox.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  You circumnavigate the whole thing.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  You destroy them with the facts from outside their false paradigm.
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  You don't debate them on their BS.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  You put out the talking points. You create the subject matter.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  You control the paradigm.
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  Dumbo.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  And learn how to tie a neck tie before you wear one.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  Spicer, excuse me.
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.000]  You're going to wear one.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Learn how to tie one.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Just look at how conceited he is.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  He looks like he hadn't taken a crap in about five years.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  I'm sorry.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  Okay, I apologize.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  God, I'm sorry.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.000]  It's a family show.
[17:40.000 --> 17:41.000]  I'm getting so mad.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  They're trying to start World War III.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  He's been nasty and I apologize to Spicer.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  He might be a nice person.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  I haven't watched him long enough.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  I just, he may just not know what he's doing.
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  So we've got some of those clips coming up.
[17:57.000 --> 17:58.000]  Look at this.
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  Let me just read you headlines.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  Child jihadist hunt down, execute bound prisoners in new ISIS video.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  Young boys is young as seven.
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  Oh, the religion of peace.
[18:07.000 --> 18:13.000]  Report Islamic State General flees to Europe with 400 soldiers disguised as refugees.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  And of course they let him in.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.000]  They know full well who he is.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  The globalist launched the attack on Syria.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  So their defeated soldiers are coming back.
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  They're being defeated.
[18:21.000 --> 18:28.000]  They're being routed by US military, the Russians and the Syrian military.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Despite what Obama tried to do.
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  Obama is a political corpse, as the Russians say.
[18:34.000 --> 18:42.000]  Obama drops 502 refugees on Nebraska in final weeks before President Trump.
[18:42.000 --> 18:50.000]  Saudi Arabia jails man for a year after he publicly called for an end to male control over women.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  That's just some of the news we've got there.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  I've got, I don't know, 15 stacks here probably.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  Let's look at this little, little, little pile of news.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  I already mentioned this.
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  Spicer, why doesn't the DNC take some blame for the hackings?
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  I mean, what a mealy mouth, limp-risted response when you have them taking money from the communist Chinese.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  I'm skipping this break.
[19:12.000 --> 19:22.000]  When you have them taking it from the Saudi Arabians, the Saudi princess bragged in their own papers that they controlled Hillary and gave her 20% of her money.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  I mean, it's game over.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  You got foreign money.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  It's all illegal.
[19:26.000 --> 19:37.000]  You're a foundation and you point your finger at Trump and claim, oh, you might have evidence the Russians accessed her server that she had in her bathroom in a closet illegally.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Full of all her illegal activity.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  The server's illegal.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  She lies to Congress.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  It's full of criminal activity.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  And then the Russians, you say, hack that out?
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  They probably did.
[19:46.000 --> 19:54.000]  But that's not where the WikiLeaks came from or the DCLeaks.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  Paul Ryan welcomes Obama's overdue Russia retaliation.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Oh my gosh.
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.000]  Eddie Munster goes to Washington, backs up the entire BS narrative of the Democrats.
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  Paul Ryan, man.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  Nearing exit, Obama seeks to tie Trump's hands to the Hill.
[20:11.000 --> 20:22.000]  And it just goes into tens of thousands of regulations and total nightmares and shutting down jobs and just blocking building projects everywhere and just sabotaging everything.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  But our wave of exuberance and free market will crush their attempts on the rocks.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  Bring into that.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  Activists urge Trump to stop Obama's anti-business midnight litigation.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  Absolutely.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  Obama's ugly bid to snub voters and tie Trump's hands.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  New York Post goes into all of it.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  Total nastiness.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  Russians attack political corpse.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  Here's the article out of the Observer.
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  They say that most of the government's against him, the intelligence agencies are against him, the military's against him.
[20:53.000 --> 20:59.000]  And that the Russians understand that this is a multinational attempt by oligarchs to sabotage the United States further.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  They've already experienced what the oligarchs did with them.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Russia tried to pick them out.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  And so Russia says in Solidaria, we understand and we're behind you removing your criminal cabal.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  That's what the Russians actually say.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  Go read it.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's incredible.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  And Italy's pulling out.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  And England's pulling out.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  And Iceland's pulling out.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  And Greece is trying.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  And Spain's trying.
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  And Brazil is trying.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  And everyone's trying, trying, trying to get out from under the globalist.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  And they're bull.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  A bunch of arrogant George Soros and David Rockefeller's waddling around.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  So disconnected.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  Trump's Hitler.
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  I'm so afraid.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  Meanwhile, we have him on 60 Minutes.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  The greatest time of my life was working for Hitler.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  We played the clip yesterday.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  George Soros.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  It's like, what planet do you come from, bro?
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  We understand your constituents are the type of people that Mark Dice goes out and talks
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  to that can't find their rear ends with both hands.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  But listen, those, those people don't count.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  They're just welfare heads that suck their thumbs.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  You understand the majority of people work in this country and are beginning to understand
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  what's happening.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  And a large minority knows where the bodies are buried, does the hanging, runs the whole
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  show and understands your cancer.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  So here comes the scalpel.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  Russian think tanks and academics agree.
[22:11.000 --> 22:17.000]  The goal of the 44th US president is to complete and complicate things for the 45th one that
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  goes on.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  So we're watching sabotage.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  What do you think they're doing with Israel?
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  Doesn't do it in eight years.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  20 something days out.
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  We're not 20 days out.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  He says, oh my gosh, you've got to merge.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  You've got to let all the Palestinians into Jerusalem.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  Oh, they'll just kill and overthrow immediately.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  You, and then now they're calling for an infada.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  They're calling for an uprising in the Middle East.
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.000]  A war against Israel.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  Gee, who would have thought that would have happened?
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  I see a lot of idiots commenting on the website and other websites going Alex.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  I'm sorry, your buddies Israel are about to get blown up.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  Nobody wants to stand up for Israel anymore.
[22:57.000 --> 23:03.000]  Hey dummies, even if I hated Russia, which I don't, I wouldn't be for a nuclear war with
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  them because see it's called mutually assured destruction in your mother's basement.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  You may not have heard of it.
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  Israel has between 400 to 600 high tech nukes and delivery systems.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  It has the Samson option to start a nuclear war if they're being overrun.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  Do you understand that?
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  Do you understand that?
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  Do you want?
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  Do you do you do you do you understand they have over 50 submarines in the
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  Mediterranean and in the Persian Gulf to pop up and launch their cruise missiles that are
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  hypersonic, supersonic many times.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  Mach 3, Mach 4, Mach 5, Mach 6.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  Some are reportedly can go up to Mach 7.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  The Russians have missiles that go Mach 7.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Imagine what the United States has.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  They've got cruise missiles that aren't even nuclear.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  They're kinetic with DU that go Mach 10.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  That's classified information right there you just got.
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.000]  But it's been out.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  Idiots have leaked it.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  They've got decapitation weapons in orbit with DU Shabos that come in like gravity
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  guns is what it is.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  It's a gravity gun that will kill people up to two miles under a mountain.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  Go right through and kill you.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  Well, don't think the United States is the only country that has these.
[24:20.000 --> 24:28.000]  These were up in orbit in the late 1970s.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  What do they classified missions are up to space?
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  80 plus percent of NASA's missions are military.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  It's called mutually assured destruction dumboes.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  And I'm not talking to our audience.
[24:44.000 --> 24:51.000]  I'm talking to the people that I see on info wars and on YouTube going, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  oh, the drudge is down.
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  So what?
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  We're going to shut down your right wing media and all this crap.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  We're not right wing media.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  I can speak for myself.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  We're Americana prosperity media that just want to live in a free country and not start
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  wars because we have nuclear weapons.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  We can't have wars on a mass scale.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  Continuing.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  Behind the scenes of the presidential inaugural committee, Trump inauguration to have less
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  pomp circumstance so he can get right to work.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  That's Breitbart exclusive.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  They've got like a huge 20-something page article breaking it down.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  As you know, the head of Breitbart is the head of the White House under Trump.
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  But you watch the media will claim its pomp and circumstance, even though they're cutting
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  in half.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  Britain edging towards Trump scolds Kerry over Israel.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  They asked the United States, what are you doing?
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Ask Obama, are you trying to start a war?
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  What are you doing?
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  Israel's not going anywhere.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  That's what the British said because that's the truth.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  What are you doing?
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  Trying to start a big war?
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  What are you doing?
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Saying, okay, maybe we need a one state policy.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  That's the new thing on the headlines.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  If Israel will not merge with the Arabs, then Israel will be one state and we'll just open
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  the borders and let in tens of millions of people from all over the Middle East.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  And if you think they had a fun jihad taken over Syria and killed 300,000 people, just
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  wait till they drive the Jews into the sea.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  Of course, long before that happens, it'll be the end of the world.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  But you don't care because you've got funyons and hot pockets in mommy's basement and have
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  learned the word Jew and can say it over and over again like a magic word.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  The extreme right wing's magic word is Jew or Zionist and the left's magic word is racist.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  But because none of that works anymore, it's now Russian agent or Zionist agent.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  Got to pick which.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  How about I'm an agent of not dying?
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  How about I'm an agent of wanting to see my grandkids and space travel and us getting
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  off the planet?
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  How about life extension technology?
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  How about I want to get the technology they've already got for myself and my family?
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  How about that?
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  How about I want to live in peace?
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  How about I'm the real liberal?
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  How about the fact you can't deal with that?
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  See, I'm tribal, but I'm tribal about ideas and free market and a culture of open society.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  George Soros calls his group the open society.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  George Soros, I looked it up this morning.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  I was going from memory and I went, hasn't he had a hand in overthrowing more than 20 countries?
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  And I looked it up.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  He's physically financed the overthrow of more than 15 countries violently.
[27:30.000 --> 27:38.000]  And he has had a hand in more than 30 countries plunging their currencies to European countries,
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  to Latin American countries, to African countries, to Asian countries.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  Right wing, left wing, he doesn't care what your country is.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  He'll overthrow it and make money off of it.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  And then some countries never come back from their currency being devalued.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  It ruins people's lives.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  And George Soros likes it.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  Everything nasty.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  He's so evil.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  He's so bad.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  You can't believe how bad he is.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  Backing radical jihadist worldwide to take over non-radical Muslim countries and kill everyone, basically.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  Brags about it on CNN with Fareed Zarkaria.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  Yeah, that's on screen.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  George Soros brags, takes responsibility for coup and mass murder in Ukraine,
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  overthrowing an elected government.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  And then I'm against that.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  People tell me I'm a Russian agent.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  What?
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  Oh, and they gave Joe Biden's son the $4 billion concession a year for the gas
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  that comes through Russia, through Ukraine, into Eastern and Western Europe.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  And now the Bidens sit over it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  They're given to them and are reportedly sucking hundreds of millions a year out.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  This is the level of criminality.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  And guess what?
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  Trump gets in.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  That's not going to happen, Biden.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  And they know.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  They know.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  See, they know that we're not going to do business that way anymore.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  We're not going to rob people of their oil and gas.
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  We're going to buy it at low prices.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  And we're going to put Americans to work drilling in the United States and Russia.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  And we're going to cut the Muslims out, and they're not going to run the show anymore.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  Saudi Arabia is going to be pivoted into the toilet bowl.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  Bye-bye.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  Bye-bye, Saudi Arabia.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  Bye-bye, China.
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  Bye-bye.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  Bye-bye.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  You want to feed on your people and be tyrants?
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  You want to sit here and dominate us and control us?
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  Good luck.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  It's all being snatched away from you, isn't it?
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  You thought you'd beat America again.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  Get ready to be stomped into the dirt.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Oh, that's right.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  You come from losers.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  We're winners.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  Stay with us.
[29:46.000 --> 30:13.000]  We'll be right back.
[30:16.000 --> 30:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  And in the same month, the exact same thing happens to Drudge Report.
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  Who is responsible for these unprecedented DDoS attacks?
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  Why are they targeting the biggest names in real media?
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  Will the government tell us, or are they too worried about Russian hacking?
[30:56.000 --> 31:25.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  It's in powder form.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  I take this.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  This is the product that I take.
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  Infowarslife.com.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  In the profit we make, we fight the globalists.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  We fight the New World Order.
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  Secure your DNA force today.
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  At Infowarslife.com.
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.000]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[32:00.000 --> 32:05.000]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  It's the first amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch, Hillary Clinton.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us,
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  don't say Merry Christmas.
[32:13.000 --> 32:14.000]  In fact, don't even say holidays.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  Well, I got news for them.
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.000]  Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  Right through into 2017, we're talking store-wide free shipping
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  and 50 to 25% off on the nutraceuticals and so much more.
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  So whether it's a Hillary for President 2017 shirt,
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality,
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017 while supplies last.
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  and we've extended it, so please take advantage of this.
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  Thank you for fighting for the Info War and supporting our operation
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.000]  and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[32:55.000 --> 33:21.000]  That's infowarstore.com or go right to the supplements at infowarslife.com.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  We're getting one of the big unsung heroes of the fight for liberty on the line right now, Bruce Fine.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  As soon as we get him, we'll go to him.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act last Friday.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  We'll be talking about that with Bruce Fine here in a moment.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  Boots taking the high road.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  Russia President says he won't expel U.S. diplomats in revenge for hacking sanctions,
[33:49.000 --> 33:56.000]  but his AIDS blast Obama administration is angry and shallow who are losers.
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  Again, shallow-brained losers.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  And they also call him a political corpse.
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  That's what Obama is and with an admitted scorched earth policy trying to sabotage the nation as fast as he can.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  What he was always doing, that's what globalism is,
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.000]  is making the nation's states weak, the people weak, independent on the central government.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  And the fact that Trump wants a boom economy and a prosperity system,
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  that's what the Americana system is,
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  is why it's antithetical to what they are establishing and what they are setting up.
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  Now, again, I want to just let everybody know that I want to thank you as we go into the new year
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  for all that you've done.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  I want to thank you for your support, your prayers.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  We have come so far.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  I don't want to save every race, color, and creak as we are really all the human race.
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  We all have the same genes, we have the same red blood, different color, skin,
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  just like you have a black dog or a white dog.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  They're all dogs at the end of the day.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  We're human beings, made the image the creator.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  And we've really come together and record numbers of people have broken through the social control,
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  broken through the matrix, and really said no to the power structure.
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  So I want to encourage all of you in the new year to understand that we've turned the tide,
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  but the battle is now just really heating up.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  But we're learning that we can win.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  We're learning that we're promoting things that are popular and wholesome and good.
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  And that all the evil men in tyranny to flourish is that good men and women do nothing to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  And we're rediscovering that a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  And we've got to be sheepdogs that are going to resist that tyranny.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  I've been talking about folks being sheepdogs for 20-plus years on air.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  My grandfathers all told me to be a sheepdog, not a sheep, not a wolf.
[35:39.000 --> 35:46.000]  It's not just, you know, ripping off the popularized film produced and directed, of course, by Clint Eastwood,
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  that goes over the life and death of what happened to the famous Navy Seal.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  But we are faced with the fact that if we don't take our country and our world back,
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  it will be run and hijacked by very, very nasty people who have a desire for control
[36:02.000 --> 36:08.000]  because they wish to dominate their fellow humans.
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.000]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we're unable to get fine on.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  I guarantee it's a time zone issue.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  There was some time zone stuff back and forth. Just send him an email. We'll get him on later.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  That's fine. I've got plenty of news to cover.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  But I wanted to get him on because he's the guy that got rid of the fairness doctrine.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  This is a lawyer at the FCC and pointed out it was un-American. It was unconstitutional.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  They brought it forward to Congress.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  And Congress struck down a law saying you couldn't say you were for the Republicans or the Democrats on radio.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  But that's your First Amendment. You own a station. It's your printing press.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  It's your electronic printing press. You should be able to say whatever you want.
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  And of course, the Democrats selectively enforced that. They could be political all the time.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  They could do whatever they wanted. It was that one-sided brainwashing
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.000]  that basically allowed them to get into law and get into the cultural fabric of our lives,
[36:59.000 --> 37:06.000]  things that is incontrovertibly un-American and fascistic slash communistic.
[37:06.000 --> 37:17.000]  And so this long battle we're now part of is something that if we look back into the continuum of time,
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  we're really having giant victories.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  Now, before I go any further, I want to play some clips here. There's quite a few of these
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  that deal with the fact that the globalists are trying to dumb us down as fast as they can.
[37:33.000 --> 37:42.000]  They are moving on every front to attempt the breaking of our will.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  And that's why it's our attitude that's so important.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  The United States of America, geographically, is not that big.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  We do not have that many resources compared to many other geographic areas.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  If you took the United States and put it into Africa, Africa is close to three times bigger,
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  the continent of Africa is much, much larger and has a lot more resources than we do.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  But why can't the people ever develop their society and culture?
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Because they never had a renaissance.
[38:11.000 --> 38:19.000]  They never got out of the system of barbarism that kept Europe locked in the dark ages during the Middle Ages.
[38:19.000 --> 38:31.000]  It is the ideas that humans have and our dreams of building a true civilization based on innovation, not conquest,
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  that made this country so great.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  And that's why the globalists, again, have been trying to demoralize us and trying to dumb us down
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  and trying to turn us into these pop culture-driven morons that know all about what movie stars eat for dinner
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  or where they vacation, but don't go visit their own mother or father in the nursing home.
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  And it's this dehumanization and dumbing down that is our greatest enemy.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  So I want to air this piece.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  It came out last week and I forgot to, but I was watching it again this morning by Mark Dice,
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  who contributes to M4Wars.com.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  Mark Dice of MarkDice.com, who is a political and media commentator.
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  When he goes out and talks to the public, he isn't cherry-picking these idiots.
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  He's actually randomly talking to folks and showing you the response he really got.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  Nine times out of ten, liberals want to put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  Nine times out of ten, liberals want to execute conservatives.
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.000]  Nine times out of ten, they want to be able to abort children that are already born.
[39:30.000 --> 39:38.000]  Seven out of ten in one of his videos, they want to basically kill all whites.
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  Which is the crazy fascistic cult-like mental illness over-the-top brainwashing that they've gone through.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  And they're also incredibly stupid.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  I don't care if they're black, Hispanic, white, it doesn't matter.
[39:50.000 --> 39:57.000]  They are these soft, bumbling spectators who aren't even alive and are basically in a trance state.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  And so for folks that don't know about the film Idiocracy that my good friend and incredible artist,
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Mike Judge, creator of King of the Hill, you name it, made,
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  Fox didn't like it when he made it.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  And so they shelved it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  It showed in one theater in Austin and one theater in LA by law because there was a corporate agreement.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  They didn't even list the name of the film.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  It's become an underground mega hit, one of the top films on cable, one of the most rented and downloaded films,
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  and now it's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  Even though it had a budget, I think of like seven million, it was shot right here in Austin.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  And when you see it, this is basically where we already are.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  It's just that it's not evenly distributed.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  Some people are really already this dumb.
[40:43.000 --> 40:51.000]  Other folks who aren't compartmentalized are more intelligent, more informed than they've ever been.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  So coming up the start of the next hour, I'm going to air that piece.
[40:55.000 --> 41:08.000]  But right now we do have Bruce Fine joining us here on Friday, December 30th, 2016 in the waning hours of this historic year.
[41:08.000 --> 41:16.000]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he was appointed general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission.
[41:16.000 --> 41:24.000]  He is the person that spearheaded getting rid of the fairness doctrine that annihilated the free speech.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  And he's also been the assistant to Congressman Bob Barr and many others.
[41:27.000 --> 41:35.000]  And was the chief advisor on foreign affairs and geopolitical activities for Ron Paul in his presidential runs.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  And of course, he's an accomplished constitutional lawyer.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  I'm not going to go over all the bestselling books he's had, but we'll tell you about constitutional peril,
[41:41.000 --> 41:48.000]  the life and death struggle for constitution and democracy of the American Empire before the fall.
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.000]  And I want to just get his approximation as a historian, as a lawyer, as somebody that's worked in major corporations,
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  but also in Congress and traveled the world where we are currently with Obama's scorched earth policy,
[42:00.000 --> 42:08.000]  20 days out from the Trump presidency and this draconian countering information warfare act,
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  where they admit they're going to target domestic media claiming we're all Russian agents from drugs report to info wars.
[42:14.000 --> 42:21.000]  We've been named in the congressional testimony and that the Board of Governors of the FCC will now be under the State Department
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  and 16 U.S. intelligence agencies.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  That is in the New Defense Authorization Act.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  I mean, three years ago they legalized domestic propaganda by the CIA.
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  This funds it.
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.000]  So I want to get the expert's view on this and someone who overturned something similar to this in the past,
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  but before it wasn't spies over controlling the media, this is a whole other level.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  Before it was just the FCC and fines.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  And of course, they're calling for fines of what they say is fake news,
[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  even though CNN constantly gets caught publishing fake reports that Putin had expelled all these diplomats, which wasn't even true.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  Obama has done that.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  So Mr. Fine is joining us.
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  Thanks for coming on.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Well, thanks for inviting me, Alex.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  Well, we've only got about 15 minutes with you. I appreciate you coming on. I mean, where are we?
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  Well, I think we're at a potential inflection point, Alex.
[43:15.000 --> 43:25.000]  I think Donald Trump has terrified all the incumbent vested interests of the military industrial counterterrorism complex, the fear complex.
[43:25.000 --> 43:33.000]  And he certainly has the philosophy right that he was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the world.
[43:33.000 --> 43:44.000]  No, we don't wish harm on anybody, but after all, we cannot solve all the misery created by the defects in the DNA and in the process of trying to do so.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  We end up with things like Libya and South Sudan and Afghanistan.
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.000]  We create a wilderness and do nothing but waste trillions of dollars that should be used on infrastructure at home.
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  We migrate our genius from production to killing and we destroy ourselves.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  That's been the fate of all empires.
[44:01.000 --> 44:10.000]  Donald Trump is the only one in the line of succession in our empire who has challenged that fundamental premise.
[44:10.000 --> 44:23.000]  As far back, Alex, when our empire really went into high gear in 1948 with the arrogance that you can't believe we are the locomotive of all mankind and everybody else is the caboose.
[44:23.000 --> 44:39.000]  It's not calculated to get a lot of friends and it's calculated to get you wars everywhere in the world on some messianic mission which marginalizes the American people to being like extras in a Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza and puts in the front.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  All other people who don't pay our taxes are not loyal to us.
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  Meanwhile, we're there at the Ben Hurd chariot race where real people died with the chariots running over us.
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  Yeah, and that's the president's daily brief. Why is the president, why is this daily brief?
[44:55.000 --> 45:05.000]  It's about the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi and Nepal and what's going to happen with regard to Burma's internal development or something like that.
[45:05.000 --> 45:11.000]  The daily brief ought to be what's happening to Americans first. Our jobs, our health, our education.
[45:11.000 --> 45:21.000]  Exactly. So Trump says it's time to focus on the homeland, our country, and not the empire. They're in total panic mode. They're trying to destabilize, trying to get it into fada going.
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.000]  I mean, this really looks seditious what we see Obama and Soros doing as they prepare to leave.
[45:27.000 --> 45:40.000]  Yeah, it exactly is. I mean, take this UN resolution re-abstain. I mean, really, it says among other things, Alex, you know, that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible.
[45:40.000 --> 45:51.000]  Well, really, is it only inadmissible by Israel? Look at all, every country that voted on that resolution has acquired territory by force, whether it's right, including the United States, which abstains.
[45:51.000 --> 46:00.000]  So it's like having a law that's enforced only against one race or one religion, or here it's just Israel, but everybody else gets away scot-free.
[46:00.000 --> 46:12.000]  It's selectively enforced, and Israel's taking tiny pieces of land, exactly. Look at how the West just backed this five-year civil war in an attempt at Saudi Arabia to take over and colonize Syria.
[46:12.000 --> 46:23.000]  Yeah, no, they were Yemen or any other place. So it's trying to apply a standard just to one country in all the world that all the other countries get home free on.
[46:23.000 --> 46:32.000]  And it's a disgrace, and that's Obama's legacy. This is a high moral ground that he came to, you know, at the culmination of the civil rights movement. I mean, it really is quite disgusting.
[46:32.000 --> 46:41.000]  It's kind of a phenomenon that's been repeated throughout history. The oppressed become the oppressors, you know, and we stand up there with high moral courage.
[46:41.000 --> 46:56.000]  Oh, well, that shouldn't be you. Why did you acquire a territory by force? Well, yeah, there was a war in 1967 provoked by the Arabs, and we went into Kosovo and bombed the damn place for 100 years to have a territory acquired by force from Serbia.
[46:56.000 --> 47:05.000]  So we're giving lectures to them, but that's just one of the elements here. You know, Obama going out of his way, he could have won the election, and he's so petty.
[47:05.000 --> 47:15.000]  He really is diminishing the stature of the White House, the way he's trying to just throw stumbles in the Trump's way before he even begins office.
[47:15.000 --> 47:25.000]  You know, he's lame doc. He should just put everything on cruise control, you know, absent an actual attack on the United States and let the process work its way out.
[47:25.000 --> 47:35.000]  Sometimes you've got to come on for a full hour, really get into your whole background because it's so interesting. I know you've been a lawyer for heads of state and all sorts of stuff.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  But the point you bring up about a third basically of Serbia that they've had for a thousand years, given to the Muslims. I mean, this is outrageous.
[47:40.000 --> 47:48.000]  And we see Democrats really siding with the Muslims. It's just a fact all over to take over even areas of Europe and give it to them.
[47:48.000 --> 47:58.000]  Now, Merkel bringing in millions of mainly military aged men covering up the crimes they're committing. What do you think's behind this insanity?
[47:58.000 --> 48:09.000]  Well, you know, it's, again, it goes back to, you know, tribalism to the, it's a distraction from confronting, you know, their own issues in their own way.
[48:09.000 --> 48:20.000]  And part of it too, Alex, I think, we, we're, we're, we're almost like species narcissism and we refuse to recognize yet, you know, we're not going to live in paradise forever because the species has real faults in it.
[48:20.000 --> 48:29.000]  But we need to make the optimum of it by having, you know, within our own enclaves there to try to develop a standard that may influence others by example.
[48:29.000 --> 48:36.000]  But it goes back to, you know, America first. Now, people say, wow, that was America first committee, you know, it kept us out of World War II.
[48:36.000 --> 48:45.000]  Well, the fact is, the reason why we were able to win so successfully is because we didn't squander the damn resources we had, you know, before we were actually attacked.
[48:45.000 --> 48:55.000]  And let's go further, let's go further. World War I was clearly started, historians don't deny it, by the British Empire against the Germans because they couldn't compete militarily with the economic system.
[48:55.000 --> 49:02.000]  Germany and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire was acting like the Renaissance, like America was, and England couldn't compete with that.
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  The Empire couldn't compete, so they kicked that off and then that and the Versailles Treaty gave us Hitler.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  So the point is, no one's saying Hitler wasn't bad, it didn't have to be fought.
[49:12.000 --> 49:20.000]  The point was, is that the globalism or the Empire of England triggered the events that gave us Adolf Hitler.
[49:20.000 --> 49:29.000]  You're exactly right. Even though we don't exonerate Hitler, but we were the ones who said in play, because we joined the war stupidly in 1917,
[49:29.000 --> 49:37.000]  why the heck were we fighting Europe's wars, crazy. But putting that aside, it's surely the British Empire they've been running around for a century,
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  fighting wars, the Boer War, Burma War.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  Invading everybody.
[49:42.000 --> 49:49.000]  Everything that moved there, even fighting Ionian wars, you know, it didn't matter whether it was Israeli or Gladstone or everybody else.
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.000]  And they just worried that that was their thrill, that was their empire, that was their Rudyard Kipling was writing poetry and stories to celebrate empire,
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  because they were going to lord it over all the other people in the world.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  Yeah, yeah, white man's birthday, exactly right. This is at the time we're doing waterboarding in the Philippines, you know.
[50:05.000 --> 50:13.000]  Why the heck do you care about the Philippines? How about staying in the United States, you know, and making our country as perfect as it can be.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  We ought to have, Alex, this is our total misorientation.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  We need the American standard where everybody looks at us as the model again.
[50:20.000 --> 50:30.000]  Yeah, our influence is the model. You know, Alex, when we had virtually no military complex at all, a few frigates, right after our Declaration of Independence and Constitution,
[50:30.000 --> 50:37.000]  all of Europe trembled because they worried about our ideas, that we would set an example that would excite their own people.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  They said we cannot compete with the American experiment, it's going to spread.
[50:41.000 --> 50:50.000]  Yeah, and so, and we didn't need a single frigate to send that idea. That standard would sell itself.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  It doesn't need to sell.
[50:51.000 --> 50:57.000]  It's too sexy, it's too sexy. I mean, globalism is Madeleine Albright, Americanism is Marilyn Monroe in her prime.
[50:57.000 --> 51:10.000]  Yeah, well, that's right. But anyway, this is what I really think the lion's share of our problems all trace back to this crazy,
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.000]  military, industrial, counter-terrorism complex. It creates enemies that otherwise wouldn't be awakened against us.
[51:16.000 --> 51:22.000]  It squanders literally trillions of dollars. It takes all our genius into killing instead of production.
[51:22.000 --> 51:29.000]  It's all of it having Thomas Edison's creating electricity and new forms of gadgets to make people's lives pleasant.
[51:29.000 --> 51:37.000]  You couldn't have that in Europe because it was monopolies. Sir, sir, I know you like to talk about yourself, but I mean, you really are an unsung hero.
[51:37.000 --> 51:44.000]  You are with the impetus to Reagan. I mean, they admit it's your idea. You did it all. I mean, you started it all.
[51:44.000 --> 51:51.000]  The reason I exist, talk radio, the fact that talk radio became kind of the model of the Internet, the free-for-all, the return of free speech in America,
[51:51.000 --> 51:56.000]  this entire revolution against the globalist. I mean, and you've done so many other things behind the scenes.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  I talked to so many, you know, big cheeses and they say, thank God for Bruce Fine.
[51:59.000 --> 52:07.000]  What do you make, sir, of this new Ministry of Truth? I mean, directly out of the old Stalinist Soviet Union.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  And they say that they're openly going to start blocking info wars and drudge and others.
[52:11.000 --> 52:18.000]  And they have the left cheerleading on the news saying, it's wonderful. Let's shut Alex Jones down. This is insane.
[52:18.000 --> 52:24.000]  It is. It's one of the first statutes whose purpose is to violate the First Amendment and free speech.
[52:24.000 --> 52:34.000]  Now, these people really understand nothing. You know, Holmes got it right. You know, the test of truth is the ability of the idea to be accepted in the marketplace.
[52:34.000 --> 52:41.000]  So what are you worried about there? I mean, no one's required to listen to your show. No one's compelled under the guillotine threat, you know, to believe it.
[52:41.000 --> 52:50.000]  That's how you understand and get access to truth. All right, you compete and you decide what the listeners, what things more convincing than something else.
[52:50.000 --> 52:58.000]  And we're dominating. We're dominating. They're imploding and they want to just shut us up. They want us off the field. They say they can't beat us, Bruce.
[52:58.000 --> 53:07.000]  I know. It shows that they don't understand and believe in free speech except their own free speech, which, to say, is the opposite of what you described as censorship.
[53:07.000 --> 53:18.000]  And it really is frightening that these fundamental principles that we're in. This is John Milder was writing about this four centuries ago in Areopagitica, you know, no censorship.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  And we're four centuries. We're now we're regressing four centuries to before John Milder.
[53:22.000 --> 53:30.000]  Well, you're the guy with Ronald Reagan who torpedoed all of this so Trump could even exist today and our whole nationalist movement that's spreading worldwide.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  Our example is now spreading. Brexit's now spreading. So it's not just America leading the way. It's England leading the way this time.
[53:36.000 --> 53:43.000]  I mean, it shows how the roles are reversed. Russia leading the way for nationalism saying no to the corporate empire.
[53:43.000 --> 53:49.000]  How did you torpedo the fairness doctrine that was in, as you know, for 30 years?
[53:49.000 --> 53:57.000]  And then how would you go after this board of governors, the FCC and others under Homeland Security and intelligence agencies?
[53:57.000 --> 54:05.000]  Yeah. Well, I mean, the way I did is the first this statute that purported to require the fairness doctrine, I reexamined and said no, it doesn't.
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  It's voluntary. And so we set in place a rulemaking to repeal it and was sustained in the courts.
[54:11.000 --> 54:19.000]  And then we had someone in the South Carolina, Ernest Hollings, he championed the bill to force us to re-adopt it.
[54:19.000 --> 54:26.000]  But we got President Reagan to veto the bill. It's a 1987 and it wasn't overwritten and it stayed dead ever since.
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  Because it actually advances free speech. It doesn't detract from it.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  Let me ask this next question, sir, because I'm obviously appreciate your time.
[54:35.000 --> 54:41.000]  I'm not a constitutional lawyer like you or communications lawyer, but I'm looking at this. I've read the bill. I've read large parts of it on air.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  The subsections, the deal of this is obviously thousands of pages being the defense authorization act.
[54:45.000 --> 54:51.000]  But the 20 pages or so that deal with this, they say we're ending bureaucratic obstacles. It says we'll do whatever we want.
[54:51.000 --> 54:58.000]  I mean, it's written as just a broad total power grab over all communications, having the FCC being at the heart of it.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  It seems like this counterman's countless other laws, but they declare it's a war power.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  So they're saying it circumvents and trumps everything. I mean, is that accurate what I'm saying?
[55:10.000 --> 55:17.000]  Well, that's what it, but Congress can't just make up war by summoning it into being. There has to be something out there.
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  And so they realized how fragile their constitutional argument is.
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.000]  So they have to make it up as being an extension of the war power, which supposed to be invulnerable from judicial review.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  After all, we can't defeat the enemies unless we're suppressing speech at home.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  So they're invoking the war power. How do we counter this then?
[55:36.000 --> 55:46.000]  No, but it doesn't always win. I mean, the most analogous case, Alex, you go back to World War II when many schools were districts and state laws were saying,
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.000]  you know, you can't even go to public school unless you salute the flag. And the Supreme Court said, you know, you can't compel that.
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  You can't compel people, you know, to believe something or assert something and don't believe it.
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  And they said the First Amendment protects that. And so we would go in and we immediately taken injunctions.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  Amen. You know, this is, you can't use the war power to suppress free speech.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  We're fighting in order to defend free speech, not to suppress it.
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  Does this illustrate a reckless flailing and panic by the establishment?
[56:15.000 --> 56:22.000]  Absolutely it does. Why would you ever fear free speech if you thought your argument was convincing?
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  The only reason you're going to be against free speech is because you think you'll lose out in the marketplace of idea,
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  just like any other business in a marketplace that feels are going to lose,
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  then they want to resort to chronic capitalism, right? Because they can't win on the merits.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  That's the only reason why they're doing this, because they know their arguments are flawed and unpersuasive.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  So they need to use the big club of government to give them an advantage.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  Sure. Well, next time I talk to Trump, and I'm going to reach out and send him a letter as well,
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  I'm going to, obviously, he knows who you are. I'm going to ask that he get in contact with you.
[56:52.000 --> 56:58.000]  And as soon as he gets in, use you as a top advisor to serve the expert on how to excise this or how to block this.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.000]  Because obviously, as president, I guess he could bully pulpit Congress into what, repealing this?
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  Or how would that work?
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  Oh, yeah, he surely could. I mean, they're absolutely, they're Republicans control both how is it Congress.
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.000]  He just proposes a bill to repeal the entire statute. Absolutely, he could do that.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  And there's no reason why it shouldn't be done.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  All right. Well, please come back in the next few months and cover this in detail.
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.000]  I know you've got a lot of bestselling books out there. Which one do you want to have the folks know about Front and Center?
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  Well, I mean, the most recent is American Empire before the fall,
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  if you really want to know what the source of our current most egregious ailments are.
[57:35.000 --> 57:41.000]  And I just encourage them that doesn't matter how big and strong something looks,
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.000]  it is paper tiger as a matter of moral ethics and wisdom.
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.000]  And if we stand up to the military industrial counterterrorism complex, we can defeat it.
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.000]  And going back to being great as America and influencing other countries abroad,
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  by example, not by bayonets and drones.
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.000]  And it's a chicken to the egg.
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  The whole military is a complex is built on sand if America isn't strong, we're not against America being strong.
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  We're just not going to kill the golden goose so they get extra eggs.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  Absolutely. Alex, I say we want invincible self-defense.
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.000]  We want to give our military men pay raises out of the skies of Lockheed Martin and Boeing
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  and these other people building multiple billion-dollar weapons that have no use.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  And they need to be defending us. That's how they make it.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  Exactly.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  How about defending our sea lanes, our borders, our airspace, our cyberspace?
[58:29.000 --> 58:36.000]  Why the heck are these six or seven thousand miles away getting shot at in some god-awful barren area with nothing but rocks?
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  Bruce Fine is more Trump than Trump.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  Wow, thank you so much.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.000]  All righty.
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  Thank you, sir. Have a great new year. We'll be back, folks.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  Wow.
[58:44.000 --> 59:13.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:14.000 --> 59:24.000]  Welcome back to GCNLive.com.
[59:44.000 --> 59:59.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Welcome back to GCNLive.com.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Welcome back to GCNLive.com.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  Welcome back to GCNLive.com.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Welcome back to GCNLive.com.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  What do you think we should do to help get more Brondo on the crops in Africa to help people?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  We need more supporters.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  More supporters?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  We need way more supporters.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  You think maybe Taylor Swift and Beyonce should get on board?
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  That would help a lot, though.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  There are a lot of celebrities that are on the Brondo initiative.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  What would you do to help get more Brondo put on the crops?
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  What would I do?
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  I would just go out and just like what you're doing right now.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Just raise more Brondo awareness to help.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  You know, I want to take this piece for the nightly news and actually cut some clips into idiocracy so people understand that that's now part of the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  It's now in the dictionary as well and that's what we're becoming and they want us to be idiots.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  They want us to be a bunch of hopeless morons.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  We don't show these videos out of enjoyment.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  This is what liberal schooling, fake liberal schooling and modern culture has done.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  A bunch of soft, just dangerously ignorant morons.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  Remember, these people vote and they think the government is their mommy.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  It's not about hovering these things over football games to carry popular items to those tailgating outside who may need something last minute.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  The Air Fulfillment Center will stay in the air being refueled and resupplied by shuttles from the surface.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  The patent was won in April but recently made its circles around the internet after a CB insider tweeted the plans for the quote, e-commerce death star.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Amazon already runs warehouses with the Kiva Robot.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  They have successfully tested their delivery drones.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Just imagine, you look up.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  And there is this monster Amazon warehouse flashing advertisements with thousands of drones flying around it.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  Bit of a dystopic image.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  I'm Owen Shroyer for infowars.com and we're not in Kansas anymore.

[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have Dr. Nick Begach on with us in this hour.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  We're going to open the phones up specifically on all this AI technology that's rolling into the home.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  In fact, Amazon has its little spy gadget that's like your cell phone, but it listens to you, attracts you, and hackers get into it.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  It takes control of other devices in your house.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  And somebody gave my daughter one and I heard her talking to something and a computer talking to her.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  You know, she doesn't get a cell phone unless when she goes out, you know, stay at a friend's house overnight or a field trip.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Then we give her like a flip phone. Oh, but sure enough, I heard her talking to a robot.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  I'm living in a science fiction movie. I go in there. There's the robot.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  I've been talking about for six months that Amazon, Google, Facebook, they're all rolling out where, oh, you don't give your kid a cell phone.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  You know, it's the internet. They can be tracked. Predators can come after them. Hackers, the government.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Now there's all these little cheap things that are 20, 30, 40 bucks and they're in your house and they're not telling you they're getting a giant goldmine of data on you.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  And then even Alex Jones's house.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  I'm getting my daughter's ready for school this morning or it's like camp school and they're off this week.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Exercise camp, bouldering camp.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  And sure enough, I hear a robot talking to my daughter.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  We're not in Kansas anymore. We're going into 2017.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  I want to review some of these technological developments, what's unfolding, what's happening.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I'm not against technology.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  It's that the globalists admit they're piggybacking everything into it.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And Dr. Baggage has always said, Alex, you're worried about fluoride and yes, they admit it's been to lower IQ and lower fertility.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  You're worried about forced inoculation and that's bad enough.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  It's the real threat is digital. It's electronic. It's everywhere.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  The patents, the carrier waves, what's admittedly going on data over power lines through light bulbs,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  which they admit can quote, calm you or make you angry.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  This is going on. This is happening. Government buildings for a decade have been testing light bulbs to calm their staff.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  They don't even tell their staff that they're being put in a conditioning program.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  Coming up, I'm going to go over some of the news articles they've come out with admitting that the goal of the internet
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  and the goal of these little AI computers that are watching you in your house is social control.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  I covered that in a special report that aired on the nightly news on Wednesday night.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  So what's crazy is everything Dr. Nick Baggage has talked about 25 years ago,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  everything I talked about 20 years ago is now just passé.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  They go, of course, we're watching you. You go get a Samsung TV or another one.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  It tells you, third parties will be watching and listening to you.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  It actually says, but even two years ago, people were like, that's incredible.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  The COGOS paid $20 something million to put up hundreds and hundreds of light poles with cameras and microphones listening to you.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  People couldn't believe that was real just five years ago.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Just six, seven years ago, they couldn't believe when we broke the stingray systems all over the country,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  grabbing your cell phone data illegally. Now they just admit it.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  So we've hit a point where world governments admit it.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Total big brothers admit it.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  I mean, it's amazing. Our credibility is going up. They're calling for now censoring us.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  So I didn't do any pre-interview with Dr. Nick Baggage. I know he can go all over the map.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  The election, the wars, what Obama's doing in his last 20 days, what he expects to happen and so much more.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And at the bottom of the hour, your questions for Dr. Nick Baggage on technology, on Big Brother, on anything,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  Briefly, because I didn't plug any last hour and I even skipped two breaks. I shouldn't do that.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  We've got free shipping through New Year's Day, Christmas extended.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  And we also have 50 to 25% off.

[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  That's the number to call and to ask questions or ask about specials or order.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  The number to call in is 800-259-9231, first time callers, 800-259-9231 on this Friday.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Last official broadcast that we're doing in 2016.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  I am planning tomorrow night to do a Facebook mention slash live YouTube feed on both our YouTube channels and on Facebook.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  I may even come in to the studio, but I don't want to make folks work.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  I mean, they deserve one day off a year, don't they?
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  I'm worse than Ebenezer Scrooge.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  Actually, it's trying to wake folks up.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  So, Dr. Nick Begich, best-selling author, researcher, joins us, earthpulse.com, not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  He goes off the patents, off the facts, and let me tell you, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  One of his best-selling books is Controlling the Mind.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Angels Don't Play This Harp, ESP Introduction, and so much more.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  Dr. Begich, thanks for coming on.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  It's been way too long, and it's always great to be with you.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  How are you doing?
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Are you still up in Alaska?
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  I am, and right now it's about quarter after nine, and it's still dark outside.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  We don't get to sun.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  15, 20 minutes start to rise here.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Where should we start?
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  I mean, I threw a lot of stuff out there.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  You pioneered exposing this whole plan.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  I mean, here we are.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  What are they not telling us about?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Well, you know, the idea of convenience is really the sales pitch that we've been sold on virtually all of these technologies over the years.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  And the fact of the matter is, the convenience, you give off an awful lot.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  You know, we used to think about privacy as the doorway to our homes.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Today, it's our digital doorway, which means we really have to look at what is being collected.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  All of these devices, all of this convenience is about cataloging information on people.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  We wrote about this 16 years ago in the book, Earth Rising the Revolution,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  talking about what was coming in terms of surveillance and technologies.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  In the past time, many don't remember, but in Great Britain and London, you had no presumption of privacy, no matter where you went.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  They had cameras on every corner, microphones on every corner.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  New York was headed that way back then.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  And now we have an entire country believing that is the way to go.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  And the excuses are violence, terrorism, international drug trafficking.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  These were things that the military actually built into the programming, if you will, back in the 80s in a publication by the U.S. Army War College
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  that dealt with modern technology and sort of what it was going to do in shaping the future.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  And at that time in the 80s, they said these new technologies would violate American values, would violate the Constitution.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  But the military training colleges didn't stop there.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Instead, they said we need strategies to bring this about, and they used the strategy of fear.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Fear of terrorism, fear of drug trafficking in order to screw down liberty and freedom in America.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  And they have effectively done it.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  If you look at the amount of column inches in newspapers covering those stories over the last 20 years, you can see the continual build.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  And notice they're the ones actually bringing in the unvetted refugees, 80% of military age men, to create the even bigger crisis.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  Right. And when you think about this, the idea, you know, I mean, even look at our southern border.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Our southern border, 10% of the adult population has been running away to the United States for years.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  What are we doing?
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  You know, I mean, we're supporting the closest thing to a dictatorship in Mexico.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Yeah, they have elections if you want to call them elections.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  But the fact of the matter is, it's one of the most corrupt countries right on our border.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  We support them.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  Every time there are people trying to have a revolution, we suppress it.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  We get involved in it.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  You know, we had a revolution a little over 200 years ago, served us real well.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  And personally, I believe that every country has a right to self-determination without interference.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  And if their population is running away from a corrupt government, what are we doing supporting them?
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  And this happens all around the world.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  We do this continually, support corruption.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  From your studies, and of course, your father, famous congressman, your airplane went down, probably killed, as you've said, your brother, former U.S. senator, looking at this.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  Who runs it and what's the end game of the technocracy?
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  It is about corporations.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  It has always been about corporations.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  It is about control and influence.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  It's about the banking industry.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  The idea of controlling the economic means for individual people is really the route to a real dictatorship.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  In the sense that we have the sense of an open government, but when you really look at what fuels the government, its special interest politics, it has always been that way.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  This election was the explosion I think America needed to go off.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  A political change that was so profound and so unexpected by the mainstream, because even with all the surveillance, they still can't register the depth of the American character, which is when we get burned a certain amount, the revolution begins.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  I agree. Let me ask you that question, because you've been talking about this forever, and I don't want to kiss your butt, but you've been an incredible visionary back when I would listen to you in the late 90s on Coast to Coast AM and call up and have you on my own show and, you know, reading your books.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  Now I feel passe, I guess you feel passe because literally almost everything you talked about has now come true or worse, because you were just going off the documentation.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  But at the same time, so many people in the system now admit that what's been built isn't good.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  And what's crazy is it seems like so much of the opposition now is actually within the military and within this whole complex.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  I think that's going to be the saving grace, the fifth column of American freedom. People who understand what their commitments are, what the Constitution actually means and are willing to stand by it and to blow the whistle on corruption.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  You know, that's what we need more of, not less of. You know, people are complaining about a Russian hack. Maybe it happened, maybe it didn't. But what did they hack? They hacked the corruption of the Democratic Party for God's sake.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Yeah, they changed the subject.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  Right. I mean, the point of the matter is we've done this as a United States. In every country, in every election in the world, we have so-called national interests or what are really, in my view, corporate interests.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  And when we've interfered with elections around the world, people have complained and we just kind of look the other way and go on with our routine.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  You know, when you think about American politics, my family's been in for three generations.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  And when you look at American politics, American government, it's, do something over here, but the real game is on the other side.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  Let's talk about the real game with Dr. Nick Baggich, the trailblazer, exposing the technocracy for what? 25, 26 years? How long is it?
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  That's right. It's been about 25 years.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  We'll be right back, sir. Stay there.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  We'll be right back.

[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  Remember the market drops of 02, the financial crisis of 08, the flash crash of 2010. It's not if, but when.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  What do you have in place to protect your profits?

[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Is it fair to say we're trying to exercise the demon? We're trying to exercise the rogue element?
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  I think so. I think that's exactly it. I think there is an element within government that is really solid and good,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  and there is an element within government that are just the drones for a class of people the elites.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  And I've met them. I mean, I know a lot of people in the world.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And these folks all have deep philosophical leanings. Once you discover them, you find out where they really are.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  And unfortunately, the white knights in political life are rare and few between.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  Do you think Trump's a return of that, or at least archetypally?
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  I think he is as an archetype. Now, let's see what happens, is my view, because there are huge forces arraying against him.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  You know, when I look back on what happened eight years ago in the Obama administration, when he went in,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  irrespective of what everybody thought he was going to do, he surrounded himself with the same institutional hacks,
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  the bureaucratic hacks that actually run the government.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  Trump isn't doing that. It's the first time I think I can remember, certainly in my lifetime, where presidents come in
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  and have not leaned into the standard political establishment.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  I think that's a good sign. There's also some risk, of course.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  But you know what? This is a country of risks. This is the nature of freedom and capitalism as we take risks.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  How big are those risks? Three French and the government make sure they're not ever too big.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Dr. Baggots, you just said something that is so amazing, and you come from a famous Democratic Party family.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  But your dad was an activist. He really did care about people. He did a lot of great stuff.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  I'm not going to demonize your brother, but I think it was kind of on both sides.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  But the point is, is that, but I think it was a genuine good person when he was in the Senate.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  He certainly wasn't one of the bad actors.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  But if you pull back from all this, you've certainly been, I mean, purely a good actor, just understanding we're all interconnected.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  But exactly, I've studied his appointments. They're all renegades.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  Even when they're from Goldman Sachs, or even when they're edX on mobile, they buck the system.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  And that's what he's surrounding himself with. People are spinning it like National Review saying he's already betrayed his base.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  He's bringing insiders in. No, he's bringing in technicians that have actually been rebels from my research.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Right. I agree with that in terms of what their profiles are. And these are the mavericks.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  These are people that have an entrepreneurial bet within government that see ways to fix things.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  And this is what's important in government is creative, innovative, new approaches to changing things.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  It's not just the corruption in government. We give it nice names. We call them foundations and contributions and all this stuff.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  But it's no different than a brown paper bag with a bunch of money.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  It influences way too much of government against the average person's interest.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  And it used to be Democrats talking about the average person's interest.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  And that was Donald Trump's Republicanism, which is different, way different than what the Republican Party was.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  Sure. Just to finish my point, because it's so important, the reason I brought up your pedigree is you're an honest, real, true progressive,
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  not the cancerous type that they've hijacked what you are, the good liberal.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  And I mean, you are a guy with a lot of credibility and you're saying as a political expert, I'm a real insider just from research,
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  you're saying it looks pretty good what Trump's doing. That's what I'm seeing too.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  Other people, I don't think are nuanced enough about being arrogant to understand that.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  I want to come back and get your take on that.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  And then other subjects that you think are front and center.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  And then some phone calls with Dr. Nick Beggis. We'll also talk about what's hidden right now.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  What are they diverting us from?
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  And what is Dr. Nick Beggis' biggest concern politically on how they might try to bring Trump and this nationalist, populist movement down?
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  We'll be right back as WebsitesEarthPulse.com.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  Is the U.S. government attacking Drudge Report? Biggest DDoS since Sites Inception. Very suspicious routing and timing.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  He also tweeted, attacking coming from thousands of sources. Of course, none of them traceable to Fort Mead.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  Last year, Matt Drudge made a rare public live appearance when he came on the Alex Jones show and warned Alex that the government was coming for him.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  The establishment was going to shut him down.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  Then this month, Infowars came under an unprecedented DDoS attack, worst we have ever seen. Then, in the same month, the exact same thing happens to Drudge Report.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  Who is responsible for these unprecedented DDoS attacks? Why are they targeting the biggest names in real media?
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  Will the government tell us? Or are they too worried about Russian hacking? This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  We have the new product at InfowarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:38.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now. Every day, this is so key. BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price. Exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on your mind.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  All right. We can have Dr. Beggartson for like two hours. We probably should do that and actually roll through his books and mind control and the admitted patents and all the rest of it.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  I know we got a loaded phone. People want to talk about AI. It was an article out of the Intercept just a few days ago.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  And it's got basically whistleblowers from inside Zuckerberg's operation that talks about his famously sequestered Palo Alto home where nobody surveils him.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  You know, he doesn't have these AI devices in his house. And they talk about how we're all going to be these avatars that'll be scored on the Internet and by government.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  China already has this. And if you're not a good little globalist, they start lowering your score until you're not even allowed to have a job.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  So it's a digital ghetto beyond Jews having to wear yellow stars.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  And they talk about the fact in here that it's meant to control our emotions and our physical behavior and that the goal with the VR products is to social engineer.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  Once they're in place, researchers say the psychological aspects of digital embodiment combined with the troves of data that the consumer VR products can freely mine from our bodies,
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  like the head movements and facial expressions, we give corporations and governments unprecedented insight and power over our emotions and physical behavior.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  And then they cannot just have mass programming to predict the future. They can control the future.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  And of course, they released this last year that when Google was founded 18 years ago by NASA and the CIA and using NSA search technology, keyword technology that the government was in the meetings.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  In fact, it came out. Google publishes wired publishers and said the generals were sitting around the table and they said, we already have search engines.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  Well, what's the point? They said, this isn't a search engine. This is artificial intelligence hooked into billions of users where the AI controls people.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  This is mind control general. And then they publish this like we're idiots and don't get it.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  So we see this arrogance because no matter how powerful these machines are, Dr. Baggage, isn't the ghost of the machine, the fact that a bunch of control freaks came up with this coopted technology and believe it's going to be our downfall when in reality it's blowing back on them.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Have they really created something that the humans that you talk about are more advanced than the elite one admit. They're actually scared of it are about to actually take over and that AI will just be our tool to go to the next level.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  Dr. Baggage. That is certainly possible. You know, the one factor they can't predict in is human emotion and for the universal human factor that that links us to the creation itself and you can't calculate that.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  You can't put that into a formulation. The idea of screwing down the population, not just the American population, the global population, think about finance controls, controls of money, digital money, which is now starting to take off every year.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  Everywhere. I mean, you've got some countries where currency isn't even utilized very much, you know, and you've got other countries have been totally disrupted like India where currency support has been taken out of circulation in order to corrupt or not corrupt the system.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  So what they're doing essentially is taking the things that facilitate free trade and getting those under the umbrella where all of your transactions, all of your trade, all of your activities become tracked and from that amount of data, well, that's a huge amount of data.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  We can't really do much with it. This is the fallacy because storing the data is the first element. The second element is sorting it and the ability to sort data increases exponentially every few years.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  And we're about to hit the quantum computing side where all this data will be utilized and they will be able to profile people so specifically and send advertising and promotion.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  So specifically, it will manipulate and control not just emotional behavior, but take that and use it as a momentum for tearing off social change.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  We already see it. I mean, we don't even need a digital world to do this in. The media has had that tool forever. You know, I avoid the mainstream media because it is the fake news.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  It is so contrary to what they're promoting. But the last few weeks, I've listened to a couple of things. I listened to CNN for a little bit and I listened to public radio.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  And public radio is the panic party for the liberal agenda because these people are scattered all over the map right now.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  And what they're attacking are all illusion, from my perspective, and unimportant issues. And when you look at the other side, the CNN side, it's a bunch of talking heads arguing with each other doing the same thing they were doing during the Trump campaign,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  still missing the mainstream media, still missing what the average people are looking for. And in the course of this, the alternative media is becoming more of the truth in this country.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  So now they're announcing they want to censor us, proving our point that they're total tyrants. Every time in history, they try to suppress thought unless you kill everybody that's educated or wearing glasses like the Khmer Rouge.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  It never works. In an internet age, they're going to try to censor info wars and drudge. That is only going to make us superstars. The problem is, we now see massive denial of service attacks.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  His server folks telling him looks like U.S. government attack on drugs last night. This is their cyber response to they claim a Russian agents.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  The bizarre beyond McCarthy on PCP, LSD, mescaline claiming I'm a Russian agent. This is ridiculous. I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  This is the kind of thing they're going to do because in politics, if you can't attack the issues, you can't attack the logic and the rationale, you start attacking the people.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  And you start attacking their system. And this is where our government is doing. And they used to call us, you know, one time they tried to villainize people like me and they gave us the name accumulators because we could go into the into the mix of the matrix and pull out all the data and prove exactly what they're
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  doing without ever touching classified materials. And they wanted to restrict that. Well, that's called investigative reporting.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  That's right. They don't like us reverse engineering because no matter how classified something, even with this info out there, we see the manifestation of what they're really doing.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  Oh, you can't miss it. And the fact of the matter is you look at how people behave, you know, and how people act and they say, oh, none of this really matters. It all matters.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  The programming that is happening right now through the mainstream media and has been happening has conditioned a population to increase violence and young people to a lack of morals.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Well, that's really what you have to know about this elite, right? Is they're pushing, dumbing us down to make us more manageable. That's not a real elite. And, you know, it's funny you mentioned accumulators or people that are accumulating data.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  I remember like 18 years ago when I had NSA folks leaking me stuff, and then I got threatened and then I had military people come around and then CIA folks come around trying to recruit me.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  They said, listen, you could be a great accumulator with us and we're really good guys and all this crap. And I'm sure there might be some good guys in there, but the overall directive is very, very bad.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And when I'm trying to teach folks to do, and what you do is to be able to accumulate data and be a private independent analyst for humanity, real human intelligence against the globalists, they can't stop that.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  No, they can't. And, you know, the thing about it is, is we've always done it the same way you have. You know, it's people who listen to us and support us over the years that have kept us doing what we do.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  And it's amazing how much information is actually out there to take the time to do it. And so, you know, we're, you and I both, and a lot of us out there, we're distillers.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  We take a lot of information in, we package it, we deliver it, but we also keep those sources intact so people can validate, you know, what we're saying.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  And we have been right. I mean, 99 percent.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  You have been so dead on. It's unbelievable. I mean, do you ever shake your head and wish you were wrong?
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  You know, here's my view of it is, I think it's important to educate people on the issues.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  But more importantly, is we need to recognize our inner strength as human souls to change the game.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Every single one of us, everybody listening to this broadcast today is a force of one that is as potent as you need to be.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  You're connected to everyone else, everything else. There doesn't need to be a group. It's called...
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  That's right. It's our actions of how we vote, how we buy, where we go, what we say. All of it has power.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  They want us to just be programmed to repeat what they say, their centralized message, their control of language.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  If we just become independent, create art, create literature, create poetry, go outside, love our families, be good people,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  we will be shining lights in their system and they can't compete with it.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  That is exactly right. And we are created in the image of a creator. We have incredible potential.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  We need to recognize our birthright and period forward and be the force of liberty in the 21st century
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  to recapture the spirit of what happened 225, 30 years ago and grab that spirit and hold it again.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  Not in the course of violence, but in the course of clear, logical thinking and don't let the elite take us down.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  The opportunity to create change and to find alliances between people.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Look for the common ground that changes the world because of the elites.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  Their common ground is to crush us, to take away the human spirit and to make us the drones of the 21st century.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  That is not what we are. We are those lights that Alex was just talking about.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  We are the light for the change that happens in the world by stepping into what we know to be right and true and acting.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  Acting in a good way, a responsible way, a caring way and the way that we were created to act as human beings.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  Wow. Don't pause or I'll jump in. The reason I jump in so much is you do too.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  This is exciting and we are not like pre-programmed. We didn't do a pre-interview.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  We probably haven't talked about it a year and we are on the same page because we are looking at the same reality.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  It doesn't mean we are perfect, but what we are seeing is a lot closer to common sense and reality
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  than what the false purveyors of disinformation are putting out.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  I have to tell you, I am very optimistic. There is a lot of negative stuff happening, a lot of bad things happening,
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  but that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger if we are aware of what is happening.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  What are some of the biggest things on your radar?
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  I would be watching the elections in France and the Netherlands in the spring.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  The French population is pretty anti-European Union right now.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  The same is true with the Dutch. The immigration issues are crushing them right now.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  I think those elections coming up in the spring could turn the tables on the EU and make the Brexit the beginning of the end in a real formal way.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  I think those are European elections we should watch. They are also...
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  I travel and people are saying the same things.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  It is the same globalist screwing up the same countries, whether it is Germany, the Netherlands, France...
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  There are only a couple hundred of them. There are only five or six big organizations.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  There are a couple hundred guys running around screwing everybody, creating race war,
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  creating division and consolidating control and then exempting themselves at the international level from the taxes, the regulations and what we live under.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  The European Union, as an example, who elected any of these people? United Nations, who elected any of these people?
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  They don't represent me. They don't represent the European working man and woman.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  They represent the elites that put them in power, that gave them power over us.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  Nobody should have power over us unless we select them.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  These are self-determining countries. Everyone is entitled to their own form of government where they want a theocracy, a democracy, a republic.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  People have a right to self-determination within their boundaries and we should respect that as a country.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  We should be an example, not an intruder in everybody's back door, but an example for what works.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  And for us, it does work. For others, it may not work for another 50 or 100 years.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  The idea of a globalist world today, we are just too diverse.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Well, I mean, we can have global nations working together and treaties and agreements, but not centralized secret groups that create global secret treaties that are all one-sided, that are totalitarian.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  We can't have a global government that's totalitarian. Certainly down the road, if people want to have shared values and shared communal agreements, that's natural, but not forced.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Right. And that's not going to happen for a few more hundred years, the way I gave it.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  To say about what's coming, the big things, I think the Middle East, we've got to pay real close attention.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  The Obama administration and Hillary have been in, they're doing everything they can to get us in a major conflict and to keep us there.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  They're interested in reinvigorating the Cold War, which we do not need.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  We need to reassess our global relationship, certainly in the 21st century.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  But I don't believe most countries, maybe the exception of China, have an interest in crushing what's working.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  But the political philosophy of China is such that, I mean, I won't do business there, not at this point in time, but the Russians are changing.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  I do a lot of work in Russia.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  I spent a couple of weeks there in Moscow and St. Petersburg this summer.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  And what I see, we have all these sanctions, they're a joke from my perspective. There's nothing in Moscow that you can't find from Western countries.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  Nothing. I don't care what it is. They're not working. It's counterproductive.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  Well, you've been over there. All I know is I go on some of the top Russian shows, people that advise Putin, and they're just Americana, Renaissance, anti-New World Order.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  They seem to get that there's a real revolution against the New World Order. They first pioneered it, kicking the oligarchs out.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  They understand the chain reaction. And I think Russia is really excited. That's why the globalists are panicking.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  That is exactly it. And I say the strongest economies, one of the biggest surprises in the world is going to be the Russian economy.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  Their ruble took a beating a few years ago, but you watch.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Putin wants to be the global leader in organic food. We're going with Monsanto and all this evil. They're going the opposite.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  Yeah.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Amazing. Let's take a few phone calls for Dr. Nick Baggage, earthpulse.com. All his books are evergreen.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  You can read books he wrote 20 years ago, more important than ever. I want to get him back up in the new year.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  I've got to put, like, in the computer on, you know, in the calendar. Just remember, it's like a year goes by.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  Oh, we've got to get Dr. Baggage on. Every few months, they'll do it. I want to go on about ESP.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  I know a lot of studies have proven it's going on. Government studied it. I want to, yeah, we all know about 6 cents.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  Tell somebody's looking at us. I want to get into that. I want to break that down with you in a full interview as well.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  Let's take some phone calls. We've got Zach, Daniel, Ruth, Ben, Stefan, and others.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Nevada. You're on the gear with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  Hello, Alex. Yes, go ahead, sir.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  The man in the myth of legend, Alex Jones. I appreciate everything you do.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  Thank you.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  Veteran combat veteran in Iraq and Afghanistan. Do you think the AI that is in the house nowadays is actually mapping the inside of the house?
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  We had this technology in Iraq before we'd actually breach a door. We could see the inside and where the people were located.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Do you think they're using this technology to create a false representation of our home so when they introduced us into this virtual reality,
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  that we are more accustomed to it because it's something that we're familiar with already?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  What a smart point. They admit that these little AI systems we put in our houses are mapping our houses.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  They admit the police helicopters have this now. They're just not telling the cops about the systems being rolled out.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  They're 20, 30 years old, but Dr. Baggage, he has all the patents you name it.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  You know, we're standing naked before our government. I mean, literally. There is nothing about you.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  There is nothing about any individual that they cannot monitor.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Microsoft Connect can see through three walls on average in your house alone.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  And Microsoft admits they're data mining all of it. You haven't sex with your wife.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  What you're saying, your dreams, it's beyond 1984.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  Yeah. And again, this was always sort of the plan. I mean, it's the ultimate marketing plan when they can tailor everything
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  to not just push you in the direction, whether it's politics or shopping.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  I mean, from their perspective, it's about delivering a message, convincing people that they're correct,
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  and then making sure they get delivery. And they don't need to affect everybody.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  They just need to push the envelope just far enough.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  They call it nudging.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  Yeah, exactly right. And this is such easily accomplished.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  And let's be clear. A lot of folks say, so what if they know what I want and put a dog food ad up because they hear the dog barking?
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Folks, it's, that's only a small part. They admit it's controlling you and then by stimuli manipulating who you are.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  You wouldn't want your wife to know all the stuff they know about you or your husband. This is crazy.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  You know, and the thing about it is, it's subtle and some of it is really convenient.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And so you sign on. But when you really analyze, what are they really gathering?
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  And see, I think we have the opposite end of this five.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I don't think data should be retained on anyone for more than the time it takes to dispute.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  Absolutely. It should be destroyed each time, but they got laws saying you got to keep the data.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  We'll be back with Dr. Nick Beggus in your phone call straight ahead. Great points, Ben. Amazing points.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  How confident are you in your food storage? If it was all you had to rely on, would it sustain your family? Hard times, good times, or any time?

[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S. government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[01:54:49.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  Free shipping store-wide until the first, and on top of it, 50-25% off the already discounted nutraceuticals. Supermail Vitality is about to sell out. Biotru Selenium just sold out. Our colloidal silver sold out as you know on Monday.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  So, we try to sell everything out with some of the biggest savings of the year. At the end of the year, we don't have to pay the inventory. It's a business property tax is what it is at the end of the year.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  Just like car dealerships, you don't try to sell out of their cars. So, some of the best deals are not the best deals of the year.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, picks you right to the nutraceuticals, or you can call toll-free, triple-A, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine. I want to thank you all for your support. These specials go right through the weekend until Monday when they end.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  Again, Dr. Nick Meggich is our guest, taking your phone calls. Let's talk to Zach in Wisconsin. You're on the year with Dr. Nick Meggich.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  Hello. Hi.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  Welcome. Go ahead.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  Thank you. Yes.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  Yeah, I would just like to say that why do you specifically think that Russian hacking is not a real thing?
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  Because I think it is. Other major government agencies say it is. I believe that they hacked it to jump to win.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  I believe that Trump and Poland have some thing going on that shouldn't be going on.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  Okay, okay. I can barely understand you because of your phone, but what I'm getting from you is,
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  the Communist Chinese openly said they were financing Hillary's campaign. The Saudi princess said they funded 20% of it.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  She's got a foundation with billions, most of illegal money. That's all admitted. She's got an illegal server discussing all these criminal actions
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  and all these foreign states reportedly were getting on her illegal server. That's what they're supposed to do.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  But to say the Russians who have the GDP of Italy controlled us. No, we didn't want Hillary anymore.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  Now, first they said these agencies said this, then Clapper came out the head of all the agencies and said,
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  it's not true. We mean they influence, not hacked.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  So what I'm saying is any way you slice it, it's changing the subject from the crimes they're committing. Dr. Begich.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  I absolutely agree. You know, the fact of the matter is whether the Russians hacked the Democratic Party's database or not,
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  the reality is the Democratic Party was engaged in exactly what Bernie Sanders and Trump were saying.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  It's a rigged game and it has been rigged and all they did is prove it. Now it wasn't the Russians or some guy in a room sitting on a couch.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  I don't know, but I know this about our government. They've hacked every system they can get into in every country in the world
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  and have influenced every political leader on the planet if they could, because that's our foreign policy.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  Apple and Google admit they routinely hack millions of their own users. That's what all this stuff is.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  That's what this Amazon system you buy, Amazon Tap and Amazon Alexa do.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  Well, think about the Germans. How did they feel when they found out that we were hacking Merkel's phones?
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  You know, think about this. The NSA was tapping all of our allies' phones. What is that about?
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  And they're complaining about the Russians. We were tapping the phones of the heads of state, not some Democratic Party or some political party in some country.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  This is, I mean, it's called in the kettle black.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  It is preposterous to even claim this knowing the whole system is designed as a giant grid. People just want to say the election is illegitimate.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  Let me ask you a question, Zach. Do you really think folks wanted Hillary? Do you really think that was a good candidate to run?
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  Do you really think the Russians mind controlled America? Zach?
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  I wanted her. I mean, I voted for her. I wanted her. I originally wanted Bernie, but she lost, I think, fair and square. But I voted for Hillary Clinton, probably.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  And I get it. There's a lot of things wrong with her. I could go on all day. There's a lot of things wrong with her.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  Sure, sure, but I'm saying, everybody's hacking everybody, bro.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  Well, we'll be back. Stay with us.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize it's the first amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch, Hillary Clinton.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas. In fact, only would say holidays.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  Well, I got news for them. Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and 50 to 25% off on the nutraceuticals and so much more.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017, while supplies last.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it, so please take advantage of this.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  And thank you for fighting for the Info War and supporting our operation and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[01:59:45.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  That's infowarsstore.com or go right to the supplements at infowarslife.com.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  It's so frustrating talking to that nice caller.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  It's like, well, the mainstream media and all the agencies say it. No, they don't.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  The FBI and the head of all intelligence came out and said it wasn't true and Obama ordered them as the president to lie.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  That basically has come out. But it's ridiculous.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  Hillary had an illegal server. You're not supposed to have those because they will get hacked.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  And then it changes the subject from everything else that's happening.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  And now they're trying to delegitimize an election and trying to start wars.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  As Dr. Begut said, that to me is the big issue. But notice, as you said, they keep changing the subject, doctor.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  That's right. They want to talk about a server that shouldn't have been there in the first place and anybody who's had any exposure to classified materials.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Any number of these things would have gotten someone fired and in jail for some of these breaches of security.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  And she was Secretary of State. Come on.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  And when you think about all of this, I mean, I listened to the last call that I feel sorry for him because he actually bought the propaganda.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  He accepted this story. And anyone who knows anything about the cleanse are the most corrupt people you've ever seen.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  They came into office with nothing but a pile of lost food coming out of Arkansas and a chain of events that was as corrupt as it could get in a chain of dead bodies.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  In the time they've been in elective office, they have collected in campaigns and contributions to their foundations and campaigns somewhere on the order of four, a billion dollars.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  That's right.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  And you know, and I've talked about these foundations for over 20 years because this is how you hide the corruption.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  They're all monitoring operations and they call them philanthropists.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  Right. And the thing is they can take money from anybody and they do. They build huge wealth.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  And the deal is it's the bribe after you're in office.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  So this way everybody makes sure you deliver before they pay you and then they pay you.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  And it's play for pay. And I don't care what they call it or how they develop the regulations to mask bribery and corruption.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  It's the same thing. No matter what words you give it, it's the same effect.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  Absolutely. Let's take another call. Dr. Vegas, we got to get back on a regular basis.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  Let's talk to Ruth in Montana. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  Oh, okay. Am I live on the air?
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  Well, Alex, doctor, thank you for taking my call.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  I had a really good question at the beginning of my call, but now I've had to switch it.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  So now that you guys have, you know, pulled the veil back on the AI technocracy and biotechnology stuff,
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  I'm wondering what you guys think they're going to do now that it's been revealed how they've been getting people to buy in as, you know,
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  accepting these technologies and stuff, how they're going to promote them in the future.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  Well, what they do is, I mean, I'm sitting there and I hear my daughter talking to a robot
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  and I go in and sure enough, somebody's giving it to her and I didn't even know.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  And it's, again, the Microsoft Alexa to make it sound a non-threatening or the Alexa system put out by Bezos there at Amazon.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  And again, it looks non-threatening. It's a microphone. It admits it's spying on you.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  They admit it's their plan to take over your child's life and then direct them in certain directions.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  I mean, this is incredible. If you found a neighbor putting a microphone in your house, you'd probably zoom or kick their butt.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  Dr. Vegas.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  Yeah, you know, this is exactly it. We've invited all of this technology in without recognizing sort of the darker side of it,
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  which from a commercial perspective, I mean, it ought to be pretty transparent.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  I mean, there should be no surprises here. The thing about it is we've lost our compass in all of it.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  And I think the idea of being programmed at a higher level, I mean, look at the curriculums and schools, look at how it's played out in the media,
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  look at how it's played out all the way through your life.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  Absolutely. Unfortunately, Dr. Vegas tried a time. Folks can find his books at earthpulse.com.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  I've got a special report on the new Alien Covenant film, the new Prometheus, where the elite basically throw it in your face
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  what they're planning to do. It's very powerful. Then Leanne McAdoo's taking over.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  Dr. Vegas, thank you for all the time. Earthpulse.com, please come back in the next month.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  We're looking forward to it anytime you want to have it.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  All right. Thank you so much, sir. All right. This is a powerful report.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  It gets into the globalist religion, what they believe, not what I believe.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  This is the real inside mojo coming up and then Leanne.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  And so much more today. Thank you all for your support.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  And I'll be broadcasting with a special transmission sometime about nine o'clock tomorrow night as well.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  Follow info wars.com.

[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  Amazon already runs warehouses with the Kiva robot. They have successfully tested their delivery drones.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  Just imagine you look up and there is this monster Amazon warehouse flashing advertisements with thousands of drones flying around it.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  Bit of a dystopic image. This is Owen Shroyer for info wars.com and we're not in Kansas anymore.

[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  2012 award-winning director Ridley Scott released Prometheus that reportedly gives us the history of where the entire alien franchise came from.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  Now coming up in May of 2017 we're going to see alien covenant.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  It's important to understand that the globalists, the social engineers that rule this planet do not believe the theory of evolution postulated by Charles Darwin.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  They believe that advanced alien civilizations seeded life on this planet.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  Their religion is a belief in panspermium or that viable organisms were purposely or accidentally seeded to this globe.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  And that now they, the elite or the Illuminati, are continuing what the gods established and have taken control of human evolution.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  Sickeningly, the eugenicists believe that they are following the footsteps of these humanoid gods
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  and have turned the entire planet into a giant petri dish where they are testing on the populations
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  thousands and thousands of different mutagens every year to attempt to create these new super mutations
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  that they believe will bring the new superhuman to the earth.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  Alien Covenant's current release date is May 19, 2017.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  Spoiler alert, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break down not just what the film covers
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  but the dogma and the philosophy and the religion behind it.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  So get ready for the real secrets of Alien Covenant leap.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  The first great secret of Alien Covenant is that the planet that they're showing you,
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  this Garden of Eden that appears to be a heavenly world on the surface,
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  is really a giant cast tube merging plants and animals in bizarre new forms.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  A religious experiment of the advanced Anunnaki race that created earth.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  And that only if we embrace this merger with machine and animal as well as plant and insect
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  can we mutate into the beautiful new form that we will become.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  But of course there's going to be a lot of ugliness in the process of getting there.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  It's important for viewers to understand that this is not my view, this is not some fiction that I'm telling you.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  Yes, the film Alien Covenant is a fiction, but the ideas and beliefs that we see in this film
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  are the deepest secret beliefs and covenants of the globalists that are in control of this planet today.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  And they believe that they are receiving knowledge or channeling information across the space-time continuum
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  and building an advanced civilization for their ascension.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  But until they can ascend, the vast majority of us must die because we are not enlightened enough,
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  we are not godlike enough, our DNA is not pure enough to resonate with this great truth.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  Now you begin to learn in Alien Covenant that basically the genetic engineers are terraforming planets,
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  not just for their atmospheres, but also changing them genetically.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  And that the end form that is created out of this mutation is an advanced humanoid with basic human DNA.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  But first the planets have to be infected with the spores that take the atmosphere and the particulars of the makeup of the planet
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  and then feed it through the mutation through the subforms so that the new humanoid can particularly live on that planet.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  And so it's a biological space suit development system that then houses the overall human DNA system.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  In the late 1970s when the first Alien film came out it was something completely new, it blew everybody away.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  And Ridley Scott admitted that basically the ship was a weapon ship carrying biomechanical creatures that were used for war by advanced species.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  This is not just a biological takeover, it is a silicone slash biological merger.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  And to show you how advanced the futurists were that came up with the film Alien in the late 1970s, you have to understand,
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  this is what the globalists are now admittedly currently building.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  The entire Alien franchise is a revelation of the method because in the Illuminati religion,
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  they must tell you what they're doing to you so that metaphysically you have a chance to fight back against it.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  And they must also condition your subconscious mind, which is more advanced than your conscious hundreds of times,
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.000]  to become comfortable with the fact that this is all part of a process.
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  If your brain understands something it tends to evolve or adapt to go with it in a confucious way as grass bends to the wind.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  But if you're evolving to survive, that's one thing.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  This is evolution to destroy us and must be resisted because it is de-evolution.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  Now the New York Times and others will undoubtedly come out and say, Alex Jones believes in UFOs,
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  Alex Jones believes that space aliens created Earth.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  When it's the New York Times itself in the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s,
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  and even this year that is pushing the fact that this theory is the majority theory believed by genetic engineers and other scientists.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  Because the deeper they get in to the genome and into this planet and to this creation,
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  the more they are sure of the fact that we did not originate on this planet
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  and a bunch of amino acids in the ocean four billion years ago did not combine to then replicate and turn in to this complex system we see today.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  I am telling you that this is the governing belief of the ruling class on this planet
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  and they already see themselves as a transcendent species that has broken off from us who are guardians of the galaxy.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  And I bring up guardians of the galaxy that came out a few years ago.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  Very funny film, very entertaining.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  But again, there's a star child who's half human, half alien.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  They tell us this myth over and over again.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  Jesus Christ, born by immaculate conception, implanted by God, has superpowers
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  and all the major churches and all the major systems are there to basically give the general public a dumbed down version
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  while they themselves behind the scenes, the initiates, have all the information.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  And now for the biggest secret that's hidden in plain view.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  Just like the advanced humanoid in Prometheus that takes the genetic manipulation and physically dies
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  but recedes the planet with the new mutation, we are being sacrificed in this huge experiment.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  There are thousands of studies in the last 20 years admitting that GMO crops
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  and GMO vaccines and other systems are purposely changing our DNA and mutating us.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  And in that process, pediatric cancers are up more than 10,000% on average since the 1950s.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  Other forms of cancer are up more than 2,000% like breast cancer.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  We are openly being manipulated as the seedstock to cause this incredible race of mutations
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  so that the elite can pick and choose which new mutations are effective for them
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  to advance their life expectancy and their quality of life.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  All the rest of us are used like guinea pig animals in this sickening nightmare.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  They are releasing salmon that are three times bigger than natural salmon that have insect genes and other systems in them.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  They're aggressive, they kill the other salmon and within just a few decades they will extinct the salmon population.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  The honey bees are dying, humans are mutating, the atmosphere is falling apart
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  and all of this is being done by design and the elite tells us none of that's a problem.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  Carbon dioxide that plants breathe is the issue.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  So they have a fake environmental movement distracting us from all the real issues
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  and telling us that humans are the problem and so the world is going to be much better after we're gone.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  They have all these big billionaires coming out and saying we've discovered wavelengths in space, holding the space-time continuum together.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  This is all a simulation. It's fake.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  There are some type of advanced species in control of us.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  Suddenly they're throwing it all in your face in hopes that you believe you don't have free will
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  and just give up and let them take control of human development.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  The truth is our species has always been able to take control of our environment
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  and that means taking control of this elite as well and not letting them dictate the future of humanity.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  Most of us are already walking dead.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  We've been hit with fluoride since birth, GMOs have infested our bodies, cancer is exploding all around us.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  We see the mutations we're going through. We see the death we're going through.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  We see the bacteria and viruses being tested on us through the GMO crops, through the pharmacological crops, through the vaccines and through the air.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  We all know about Tuskegee and injecting black people with syphilis.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  We all know about radiating homeless people and vets and children that have been given up for adoption.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  We all know about the secret testing worldwide. We all know about the programs that have been done.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  And I'm here to tell you it's a thousand times a thousand's worse today.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  And most of the major hospitals at the highest levels are in on it.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  They take your baby's blood at birth.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  They DNA type it. Big corporations then come in and buy it from the government.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  And people are going out to get gene therapy and learning 30 years ago at birth,
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  their blood was taken and it's now been patented and they're being charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to get gene therapy with their own genes.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  I could speak for thousands of hours on this, but understand, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  the fictional horror movie Alien Covenant is nothing on the reality of what's really happening in this world.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  Look at how they heat hospitals with baby parts.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  Look at how they keep the babies alive and sell their baby parts.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  Look at how they create flavor testing with baby parts.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  Look at how everything they do is to degrade the human body and to drag it through the mud because it's their religion to kill, steal and destroy.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  And they are not the God that created humanity on this earth.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  They are the fallen, twisted engineers who are at war with God and relish destroying God's creation.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  On All Shows, this is the Info War and you have been warned.

[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  My name is Robin. I'm 47 years of age. I absolutely love One World Way. It was about 5 years ago when a trainer told me it was the end all of protein powder. One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  I spent 8 months and could not find a replacement. I went through tons of brands, types and flavors and almost all of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way. I buy the cost-effective 5-pound container and my family craves their One World Way too.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Way and feel great after I drink it. Thank you, synergistic nutrition for perfecting a protein powder in the product One World Way.

[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  If your local station doesn't carry the fourth hour, well please, you know, make sure that they get your request to carry the fourth hour.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  But you can also go to infowars.com forward slash show and tune into the fourth hour. We're going to have Paul Craig Roberts joining us.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  And I really want to get his take. What the heck is going on with Obama's last destructive moves?
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  Is this a scorched earth policy? Just going to set the whole thing on fire to muck it up as much as humanly possible before Trump gets in?
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  Or are we looking at World War III? Or will Trump even get in?
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  So we are going to be getting into all of that in the fourth hour. So make sure you tune in.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  I'm also going to have Owen Schreuer joining me as well as Margaret Howell getting to all of this news and more.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  So one of the stories obviously huge this week is the actress Carrie Fisher passing away as well as her mom.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  But something kind of interesting happened. A lot of people, as per usual, when a celebrity dies, take to Twitter to offer their condolences.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  Well now you are not allowed to offer your condolences in a way that is unacceptable to the social justice warrior feminazis out there.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  So we have a tweet coming from comedian Steve Martin and he sparked outrage after his tweet remembering the deceased actress Carrie Fisher who of course played Princess Leia.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  He says, when I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. She turned out to be witty and bright as well.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  So I think anyone who was a young man when Star Wars came out with Princess Leia, I think any that was like she was the object of every man's desire period point blank.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  But how dare you, how dare you think that a woman could be beautiful and how dare you say as much in a tweet after she dies.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  So of course this sparks the feminazi outrage and they say, I think she aspired to be something higher than just being pretty.
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  And another person says, you know, it's a picture of sexual objectification and enslavement. She was so much more.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  Of course she was so much more, but that was an iconic scene. And frankly, she wouldn't be remembered for all of her, you know, all of the other stance she took on feminism and mental health and, you know, her screenwriting
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  of wit and her charm and her intelligence. If she hadn't been cast in that movie where really she captured the heart of young men and women alike.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  So the criticism here is that because this rage army came after Steve Martin, he deleted his tweet.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  He was forced to delete his condolence tweet because this the Twitter army came after him.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  I mean, that is, is crazy. Do we want to live in a world like that where you're not even allowed to say a woman is beautiful, especially in an iconic movie?
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  It's not like this article in Life's That points out. It's not like she was Margaret Thatcher, you know, if she was in politics, sure, that's, you know, politics is not predicated on your looks.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  But if you're an actress or a singer or an entertainer, it is, you know, your looks are important in that business.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  So yeah, people are going to comment on your looks. It's not outrageous, but this is how far we've come.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  And John Nolte had an article in The Daily Wire where he was talking about not only this Steve Martin tweet being forced to be deleted,
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  but also the fact that Charlie Sheen has been facing some backlash because he tweeted out after these celebrities had been passing away in 2016.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  He said, Trump next, please God, Trump next. So everyone came after him. He didn't delete his tweet. In fact, he doubled down.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  So regardless of if you agree with what he says or not, that's the kind of country we need to live in where if you want to say, please God, take Trump next.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  And then you should be allowed to do that. People died, went to jail for the First Amendment or the right to be able to speak their mind and to live in a free country,
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  not in a country where you have these heartbeats, social justice warriors raging about a freaking 140 character limit tweet, calling a woman pretty.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  My goodness, she was a beautiful woman. And it's not like when she was in her little slave suit that she was just this, you know, pretty helpless girl.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  She she took out her captor. OK, so please, I think she's strong enough and I think she can even appreciate being remembered as a beautiful woman who captured the heart of many, many people.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  Now, moving along, I think that everyone is ready to move along with 2016 getting over it. Paul Joseph Watson actually had a pretty good take on how everyone is saying 2016 most horrible year ever.
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  Let's all move on. When for more than half of the country, we are filled with hope. And frankly, I think that is why Obama is taking these crazy tactics because he's saying, no way, you can't have hope.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  You can't have hope. We're going to start World War Three. We are going to flood your mind with fear for what this next administration is going to be up to.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  And Margaret Howell is going to be joining me in the next segment. We're going to get into these Russia sanctions. And what do you think about it?
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  We'll also be taking your calls. So stick around. We will be right back.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  He eventually was up and running again. Matt Drudge tweeted from his personal account. Is the U.S. government attacking Drudge Report?
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  Biggest DDoS since Sight's Inception. Very suspicious routing and timing. He also tweeted, attacking coming from thousands of sources. Of course, none of them traceable to Fort Mead.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:35.000]  Last year, Matt Drudge made a rare public live appearance when he came on the Alex Jones show and warned Alex that the government was coming for him. The establishment was going to shut him down.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  Then this month, Info Wars came under an unprecedented DDoS attack, worst we have ever seen. Then in the same month, the exact same thing happens to Drudge Report.
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  Who is responsible for these unprecedented DDoS attacks? Why are they targeting the biggest names in real media? Will the government tell us? Or are they too worried about Russian hacking?
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:06.000]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com.
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:37.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  Which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:59.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWars.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:14.000]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize it's the first amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch, Hillary Clinton. And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas, in fact, don't even say holidays.
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:29.000]  Well, I got news for them. Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017. We're talking store-wide free shipping and 50-25% off on the nutraceuticals and so much more.
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt, or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017, while supplies last. We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:55.000]  So please take advantage of this and again thank you for fighting for the InfoWars and supporting our operation and supporting not just the first amendment but free speech worldwide.

[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  I've got a puppy. Everybody in the office has been loving her baby. I had a chance to hold him.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  Occasionally we'll hear a rustle. We're like, there's a dog in that fur. Yes, so I highly recommend it to all the new parents out there,
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  and I do not know how the parents do it that actually have children. I can't diaper my baby though.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  He just stays up all night. So do I. Thank you, Brain Force Plus.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  So Margaret, let's get serious here. Let's take a little turn.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  So what do you think about the Obama administration basically lighting a match and then just flicking it on their outgoing administration?
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  Here you go, America.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  Well, do we expect anything else from Obama and his administration? Let's face it, frankly.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  The aspect, he is trying to start nuclear war. He's trying to start World War III in his last two and a half weeks of office.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  It is crazy right now. You know, this nuclear option, I was looking at the cover of the New York Times.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  Meanwhile, they're trolling Christians, and then if you click on another article, they're calling Obama the Punisher.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  He's punishing Russia for the election hacking. Of course, mind you, no proof at all.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  He's finally stepping up and showing strength. This article, it's worshiping him like a demagogue.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  It is embarrassing and silly. Meanwhile, Russia is laughing at us.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  We have literally laughing out loud saying our president is practicing something called kitchen diplomacy.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  I don't think that's a compliment. I haven't had time to Google the reference.
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  Yes, I actually was going to see if Daria has any kind of Russian insight into that. Is that something, kitchen diplomacy?
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  Yes, basically one man and wife are arguing in the kitchen basically like that.
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  Ah, thank you, see. Thank you. Yeah, so kitchen, and it is like that because they're kind of flinging things back and forth.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  But in this, you know, it's the war, the roses. It's World War III actually.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  We have Dmitry Medvedev, the Prime Minister of Russia in the Russian Embassy in the UK,
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  posting photographs of a little duck with the words hapless and lame written in English.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  So they're clearly, you know, at least they get it. They get that we don't respect them either.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  Well, and that's the thing that's so interesting. At first when I saw it, of course, I laughed out loud
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  because it was the Russian Embassy tweeting out the things, you know, Obama, the lame duck.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  And I was laughing because I'm just thinking, wow, the meme wars have taken over.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  Not only have memes helped get Donald Trump in office, but now the Russians are actually tweeting memes back to President Obama.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  Then I kind of hang my head like, oh, man, is this Trump's America? We're going to be getting meme to death.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  So I don't know how I feel about that. But, you know, one of the people that is being considered,
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  reportedly being considered for a spot in Donald Trump's administration is John Bolton,
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  who when we all heard this, we're thinking, man, no, major, major neocon here.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Right. So he, now, even though Donald Trump came out saying it's time, you know,
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  for everyone to kind of move on to bigger and better things, but of course he'll wait to see
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  if he's going to get any intelligence on this reported Russia hacking.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  He's waiting to find out what the intelligence community knows.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  But John Bolton is coming out saying the sanctions that Obama has announced against Russia.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  They're not enough. He wants even more.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  You know, that's really frightening. We know that John Bolton is a neocon.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  He was basically a shill for President Bush and the war in Iraq.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  He went to United Nations. He was the U.N. ambassador. We understand his politics are not in line
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  with the Liberty Movement. Let's just face it.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  And, you know, I understand Trump's need to try to seem like he's producing this legitimate administration
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  full of cronies, frankly. It's really disturbing.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  John Bolton would be the last person I would ever want as an advisor in terms of the intelligence community.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  He is respected inside the Beltway. I don't understand this.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  You know, we're seeing President Obama literally try to...
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  He's trying to put Trump into a box right now in terms of the regulations that he's...
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  83, 53, 3,853 regs, 18 for every law, and then 97,000 pages of red tape according to the Washington Examiner.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  So Obama is trying to tie Trump's hands in any way that he can.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  The last thing we need is some neocon that's pro-war sitting at the helm acting as an advisor.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  Right. Well, that's why Ryan Spribus came out saying we are...
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  I think everyone can understand that we, the Trump administration, are not interested in going to war all over the world.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  So, you know, that's at least a good sign.
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  You know, Donald Trump has made that clear as he's been campaigning. He's not interested in that.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  But even, I mean, if he finds out that Russia was involved somehow in swaying the elections,
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  or if they did indeed leak the emails to WikiLeaks,
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  and then they've already kind of set up the war for him,
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  and frankly, I don't think that that's what Donald Trump is going to want to do unless...
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  I mean, what do you think that they could tell him?
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  What sort of intelligence do you think that they could possibly give to Donald Trump
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  that would justify these, you know, kind of measures?
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  You know, that's a good question.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  And the understanding is that there's one or two agents, intel agents on the ground in Moscow
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  that are relaying this back and they're poisoning the entire community.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  We know that the DNC leaker was a DNC insider,
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  and that's pretty apparent because they were angry that Bernie...
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  the denomination was stolen away from Bernie.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  There was somebody inside the DNC that leaked that information
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  and ultimately got into the hands of WikiLeaks.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  And we've questioned here at InvaWars the death of Seth Rich.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  Did this play a part in it? You know, what was his involvement, if any?
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  And it makes no sense.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  Russia does not care about the DNC and their corrupt little system.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  It was a personal beef against Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  Nobody likes Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton supporters don't even like Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  She couldn't even get half of America to like her.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  Exactly. Two million more women voted for Barack Obama than they did Hillary Clinton.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  According to the official number, everybody hates her.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  This is not a personal vendetta.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  We all have a personal beef with you, Hillary Clinton.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  And that's the thing is, let's just say, let's just say,
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  because Obama has already said that, you know, Russia, there was no actual hacking of the voting machines.
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  That didn't happen. So the only thing they're really going with here
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  by telling America we really need to be really alarmed about Russia
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  is potentially that they leaked the DNC emails to WikiLeaks. That's it.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  So the issue there is they swayed or interfered with the election
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  by just allowing America a peek behind the curtain.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  There's a peek behind the curtain. They didn't alter the emails.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  They didn't put anything in there, fake news.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  It was just, hey, here's what's going on.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  And so, you know, the Obama administration wanted to be known
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  as the most transparent administration ever.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  So there you go.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  What a lie.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  You got your wish.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  You got your wish, buddy.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  You tried not to, of course.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  Well, you know, and you made that excellent point.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  So what did we learn from these emails?
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  We learned that the Podesta email specifically,
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  they're inherently corrupt people that are doing a lot of things
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  that are not in American interest, that they're very self-oriented people.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  You know, having an advisor like Huma Abedin that close to you
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  with ties to Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  probably isn't in the interest of the American people.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  Right.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  And we learned so much about her campaign, the way that it's run.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  And you're right. God bless the Russians.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  Hey, if they had any involvement in helping us see
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  what was really going on with Hillary Clinton,
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  God bless them, frankly.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  I mean, that, in my opinion,
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  deserves a Congressional Medal of Honor,
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  not putting tanks on the Polish border, frankly.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  Right. Well, and see, you know, that's a thing, as I said,
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  even if the way they interfered with the election was enough
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  to just make people stay at home and not go out and vote
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  because they just, they heard a little bit of too much information
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  that made them uncomfortable voting for the first female president
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  even though they didn't think Donald Trump was great either.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  You know, and that's it.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  It's like, okay, so you were given enough information
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  to know the truth about this candidate,
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  whereas the media absolutely did not do their job,
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  and they were, you know, as we found out in the WikiLeaks,
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  they were hacks for the Clinton campaign.
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:18.000]  That's right.
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  And they still lost.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  It still wasn't enough to win,
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  and that is why they've absolutely gone mad.
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  And now we are seeing truly sociopathic behaviors
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  with trying to light this place on fire
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  before the outgoing administration gets out.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  And that's the thing, you know, will Donald Trump even take office?
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  Will they muck this up so bad
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  that he's not even going to be able to take office?
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  And then at that point, is there going to be a civil war
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  in addition to a global war going on?
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  You would think that they're really up to something
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  sinister based on these actions.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  You know, this is what our president has done so far.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  He declared Israel to be illegitimate,
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  saying that they could not be Jewish and democratic
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  through his little mouthpiece, John Kerry.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  We were behind the UN resolution
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  that declared those settlements illegal.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:02.000]  We absolutely were.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  Israel knows that we were.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  So he's propping up imams in Iran and bashing Israel.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  And this goes against decades of policy.
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  The American people have always stood next to Israel.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  We've never propped up imams in Iran until now.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  And this is the same person that's indicting Russia
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  for the reason Donald Trump's in office.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  The reason Donald Trump's in office
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  is because of people like us who were so fed up
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  who went to the polls, who voted, who said enough is enough.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  And Russia has nothing to do with this.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  Well, and with regards to what's happening in Israel,
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  obviously, I agree they need to stop bulldozing people's homes.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  They need to stop saying, we're bulldozing your home.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  You got three weeks to get out of here.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  We're just going to encroach upon this land.
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  It would be like, to me, I liken this to if we here in Texas
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  were told that this land belongs to Mexico,
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  it's their promised land, Azatlan or whatever.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  It's their great prophecy.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  They're going to get this land back.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  So everyone in Texas now needs to move to the corner
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  and they're going to put us in an open air prison.
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  I guarantee you, Texas would not be...
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  We would not be okay with it.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  So, you know, I try to look at it from that kind of point of view,
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  but I think it's very interesting that now, all of a sudden,
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.000]  on that one last slap to Israel saying,
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  you need to choose be a Jewish state or be a Democratic state
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  if you're going to go with the one state solution.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000]  Meanwhile, we've seen how they have treated governments
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  in the Middle East who are somewhat Democratic,
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  who allow Christians and Jews and Muslims and Hindus
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  and whatever to live freely amongst each other.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, they're trying to take out Assad.
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  These are people who... Governments who have allowed that.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  Whereas in Saudi Arabia, they'll behead you.
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  That's perfectly fine.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  They're not going to tell Saudi Arabia to be more Democratic.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  Do you remember when our president got involved in the Arab Spring
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  and Egypt was torn down, the Muslim Brotherhood came to power,
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  the ultimate celebration of democracy, the average Egyptian,
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.000]  especially the average Egyptian Christian right now.
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  They're in hiding, frankly, because of their democracy.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  So the left's version of democracy, what it means is utter chaos.
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  Let's put, you know, a chaotic way of thinking and power
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  and everybody else is going to have to run for the hills.
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  It's a very backwards or cakeway of thinking.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  George Soros, every time he used the word democracy,
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  it makes me twitch.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  He cares about the will of the people.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  That's really kind of him, isn't it?
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  He cares about it so much over the world that he is going to
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  single-handedly bankroll unrest and destruction worldwide
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  and help foment a refugee crisis so he can take advantage of it.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  Right.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  Because he cares about what the people want.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  So much about democracy.
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  Forget it that the people actually voted for Donald Trump.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  Right.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  You guys were basically Russian spies, all of you.
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  Yes, they're coming to round up all the Russian agents.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  I guess, you know, one last story here when we're kind of talking
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  about Saudi Arabia and just, you know,
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  I double-dog dare John Kerry to tell Saudi Arabia to pick
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:00.000]  or choose if they want to be democratic or, you know,
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  run their country under Islam.
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  Saudi Arabia jails a man for a year after he publicly called
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.000]  for the end of male control over women.
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  So here we have an actual social justice warrior.
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  And I don't mean that in the derogatory way that we kind of
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  call them here.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  He's actually someone that is being a champion.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  He knows that he could go to jail if it was a woman doing this.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  She could be beheaded.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  But this is, you know, an ultra-conservative Islamic,
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  Yeah.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  And basically this, and in my opinion, and this is not bashing
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  people, you know, there's such a radical demonic spirit behind
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  the hatred, the subjugation of women and children.
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  It's very nasty and very dark.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  We covered a case yesterday.
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  This woman in Afghanistan goes to a market without being
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  accompanied by her husband.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  Because he was out of the country.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  He was out of the country.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  She was nameless in all those articles.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  She's listed as the 30-year-old.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  The woman doesn't even have a name, no identity.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  You talk about hatred, the ultimate hatred,
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  stealing someone's identity to the point where they can't even
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  move in a free, you know, does she have the right to breathe
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  air?
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  You know, do we really want to get there, folks, all in the name
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  of Islam?
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  She doesn't have the right to go shopping and go get some food
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  until her husband gets back in the country or she finds a close
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  male relative to accompany her to the market.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  So then here we have this man.
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  He was arrested because he was putting up posters and he was
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  calling for the government to abolish these strict rules of
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  guardianship of women and saying, you know, women shouldn't be
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  beheaded because they walk outside without their clothes.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  So now, and the reason why he was doing this is because he was
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  having some female relatives facing injustice at the hands of
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  their families.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  So here you even have family members who would say that you've
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  shamed the family by, you know, walking with a male who wasn't
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  a family member or you're not married to him.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  So we're going to do you the honor of killing you.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  Oh, that's so thoughtful.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  That's very polite of you to a lot of these cases involve a
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  family member, a male family member who wants to protect the
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  honor of the family, you know, countless cases like this,
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  where we see fathers, you know, if you want to go ahead and
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  murder a daughter, if you don't think she's behaving in a way
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  that honors your family, you just go right ahead.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  That's in accordance with the law that you practice.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  But thankfully here, we operate under a different law and we
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  operate under a free space and we love liberty here and for now
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  until, you know, that's how we do and we've got to stand up to
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  that.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  But then you see these stories of Obama dropping 502 refugees,
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  502 refugees on Nebraska in the final weeks before President
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  Trump, while you kind of got the back-to-back story, Islamic
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  State General flees to Europe with 400 soldiers disguised as
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  refugees.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  So these are simultaneous stories coming out that we know
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  that they are using the refugee crisis to flood in ISIS
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  soldiers.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  And do you think that they're not somehow sneakily getting
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  into the United States as well?
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  And then of course we see these communities just like in Europe
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  where they're taking over, you know, 800 refugees will be
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  sent to a teeny, tiny town and that town is no...
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  There's 1200 people in them.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  Exactly.
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  The town no longer retains its own sovereignty or its, you know,
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  quality of life the way it was.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  It becomes the identity of the refugees that are there who are
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  now the majority of the people living in it.
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  So imagine if they start saying, well, we practice Sharia law
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  here in this little Nebraska town.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  There are already same places in the U.S., specifically
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  Michigan, that allow Sharia law to take precedence over our
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  own current laws within our own country, actually.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  No.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  They're here.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  It's already happening.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  No.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  Well, I know Owen Shroy will be joining me soon and he actually
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  did a big report on this saying that Obama should be found
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  guilty of treason, frankly.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  So stick around.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  We will be right back.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  Owen Shroy will be in studio.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  Good day, America.
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  Are you tired of your butt cheek speed frozen?
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000]  I'm tired of the cold.
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  Well, there's a new kid on the block.
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  It's Fortress Clothing.

[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  So quit your complaining and go to FortressClothing.com.

[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  Hello again.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  My name is Gary Clark.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.000]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  Western TV series, The Virginian.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  Now those of you who suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:20.000]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved ones.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  I neglected to mention how one-world-way protein powder has affected my life.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:32.000]  Now I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  One-world-way solved my irregularity.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  I've been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  Three weeks on one-world-way set me on a new path.
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:46.000]  That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000]  Will it work the same way for you?
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  I don't know.
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  It worked for me.
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  That's oneworldwhey.com.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  Ho, ho, ho, this is Jet-Wattman from Run With O. L. V.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  I'm on a new CD that just came out.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  Maybe yesterday on video records.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  Ho, ho, ho again and Merry Christmas to you all.
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  Now we're building a big snowman.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000]  Attention citizens.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:45.000]  His name is Harry Dent and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  You can get a free copy of Harry Dent's bestseller, The Sale of a Lifetime, containing never before published information by simply visiting www.saleofalifetime.com forward slash free book.
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Again, that's saleofalifetime.com forward slash free book.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  You are listening to The Alex Jones Show. I am Leanne McAdoo here, joined by Margaret Howell.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  And right before the break, we were talking about this refugee crisis and how, of course, Obama has really ramped up the amount of refugees that he's accepting into the country.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  Of course, that was his plan along, but we're seeing even more than what the American people were told and trying to get in as many people as possible before Trump takes office.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  Again, just trying to rush through as many things that go against what the American voters actually want before he leaves office.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  That's right. So we were talking about sharia law and the implication of sharia law across the U.S.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  We've seen courts here actually uphold sharia law.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  They realize that a family is practicing it as opposed to upholding our constitution, which is a clear violation of our basic societal, the way that we function around here.
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  And that's what we don't want to see dumping these 500 people in Nebraska. You know, Leanne, it's very disheartening.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  But even going back to my, and we have a caller from Kentucky, and I'd love to get to him. I know he's a couple down.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  But we've seen this radical push for refugees, even in my own tiny little farming community in Kentucky.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  I went home. We have a mosque facing every corner of the city now.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  And I don't even really think that the official number is being reported in terms of the influx of people.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  But what we do know is he promised 110,000. He's taken close to 111,000.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  And they're going somewhere. They're going to small town. They're coming to a small town near you.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  Well, they're going nowhere near the White House or anywhere near where President Obama is going to be living.
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  Apparently, they're going to all these little tiny Republican towns where people voted against it.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  Well, speaking of the White House, there was an article in WND talking about the nine people that have been arrested in D.C. the past last year that have been ISIS supporters.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  What do we have? We have a Starbucks barista. We have two college kids. We have a police officer.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  The mom next door. The article should have been entitled, Can you spot the jihadi next door?
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  Because literally these people were upper middle class. They were normal. They were attending school.
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  They were at your local Starbucks. And oh, by the way, they were also sending money via PayPal to ISIS.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  And they were providing material support for ISIS on the ground and our nation's capital, which is just fantastic.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  Right. And then we also have the fact that we, our tax dollars, are paying to support these people as well,
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  that they are then sending that money to go support ISIS, which is one of the things that I'm looking for.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  My article here, the Berlin terrorist actually was collecting welfare under multiple identities.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  So this is under Angela Merkel's scheme there. The German taxpayers were actually financing the terrorism against themselves.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  Frankly, I don't want to see that here. But, you know, as you just pointed out, it's already happening.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  Rob, do you had a guest on Adam Curry recently was talking about Europe and the Islamification of Europe really briefly.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:16.000]  He was doing it in a very charming liberal way. And he mentioned this Thean Van Gogh character who was Van Gogh's nephew.
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  He's talking about Islam, speaking out and saying, you know what, we don't really want this here.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  And he was stabbed and gunned down in the streets on his motorbike as he was smoking a cigarette.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  And you look at stories like this. So there's such an aggression when it comes to, yes, we want these funds,
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:38.000]  but even coexisting in a society of people that don't agree with you and your religious practice,
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  there seems to be a, you know, kind of a vast intolerance for that, which is what we're saying.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  Right. Well, and see, that's the thing. You know, I'm a very much live and let live kind of person.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  I've always been that way. I really don't mind. I don't care. Do whatever you want to do.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  This does not harm me and myself or anyone else, whatever.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  But we're kind of being programmed to not judge, not trust our instincts, not to, you know, not to be overly accepting
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  rather than trusting our instincts, which we're saying, wait a minute, you know, I just,
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  I don't think this is a really a smart idea to flood the country with people that, you know, aren't even given birth certificates or something.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  We don't even know their identity. Meanwhile, this Berlin terrorist, the reason, you know, he was under multiple identities,
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  collecting many different welfare checks. So here he is just taking total advantage of the system that he then goes out to destroy.
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  Well, stick around because Owen Schreuer will be joining me in studio and then Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  Tell us about all the stuff you said. There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:35.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:52.000]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:52.000 --> 03:00:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  That's right. We are now moving on over into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  I am Leanne McAdoo being joined by Owen Schreuer. If your local station doesn't pick up the fourth hour, hopefully by now you have already tuned in and you are watching us via the infowars.com forward slash show link.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  So you can see myself and Owen Schreuer and all the loveliness that we are bringing to your screen.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  Now, Owen, I wanted to go ahead and kind of start this segment talking about the fact that the Drudge Report was under the biggest DDoS attack since the site's inception.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  We ourselves here at infowars have been being the victims of these DDoS attacks as well. This is, of course, when you have massive traffic overwhelming a website's servers.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  And so Matt Drudge tweets out, you know, is the US government attacking Drudge Report? And he points out that kind of tongue-in-cheek how, hmm, these certainly can't be tracked back to a Fort Mead.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  So, I mean, he's able to see where these thousands of alleged accounts are coming from that are flooding his site.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  What do you make of this? Now our government is telling us that we need to be very, very afraid of Russian hackers. Meanwhile, the government here is actually doing the hacking.
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  Well, I'm glad that you pointed that out. And as far as his mentioning Fort Mead, I don't know if he was being sarcastic in that tweet or if he actually traced those back to Fort Mead.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  I don't really know. Matt, if you want to come back to Infowars sometime soon to give us the inside scoop, we'd be glad to have you here.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  It is funny. I'm glad that you mentioned that point about the Russians because these are real DDoS attacks that have shut down Infowars.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  They shut down Drudge Report. And these are things that actually happened. But the public is more concerned about Russian hacking of the election with no proof.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  And in fact, I had this debate with people on Twitter yesterday. Let's, again, be perfectly clear, okay? They didn't hack the election.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  If Russia hacked anything, they hacked email servers, but Wikipedia says that these are leaked.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  Well, actually, they take John Podesta and his people fell for a phishing scam.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  Or got phished, which is even worse.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  And then you're really dumb and you want to be in control of the country.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  So, but that's a good point in where they will have the American public frightened or thinking that Russia is hacking everything or meddling, influencing our election.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  Meanwhile, Obama has come out and said we are going to take retaliatory measures, cyber measures here as well.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  Of course, after saying there's no such thing as a rigged election, let's not forget about that.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  Right. You know, and let's also not forget, let's take this back when President Obama was having a presidential debate versus a Mitt Romney.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  He actually laughed in Mitt Romney's face when Mitt Romney said that he thought the biggest threat to United States was Russia.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  Russia posed the greatest threat to the United States.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  And Obama laughed in his face and said, really, you know, the Cold War wants its foreign policy back.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  No, no, no. You know why Obama laughed at Mitt Romney's face?
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  Because Obama knows damn well that he's the biggest threat to this country.
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  At the time, yes. Okay. So it's not Russia, it's Obama.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  But back to the drudging, as you pointed out, it's interesting.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  Infowars gets hit with the huge DD, the DDoS attack.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  Drudge gets hit with the big DDoS attack, shuts down both sides, unprecedented level.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  RT does as well.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  So, you know, but this is ignored.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  I don't think we're going to get any investigation from the government.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  No statement from the government.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  It's just going to be Russia, Russia, Russia.
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  And it'll be interesting to see if these type of attacks continue, who is being attacked.
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  Right now, we can obviously see a pattern here.
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  You could say conservative or right wing quote unquote media.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  Anyone that the establishment deems to be fake news.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  But the reason why Drudge tweeted out that it was suspicious, considering the timing,
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  was because it was just after Obama made his announcements about expelling these Russian intelligence operatives.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  And the headline on Drudge was lame duck Obama.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  Ooh, he doesn't like that.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  He should have tweeted it out as a meme.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  All right, stick around.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:06:14.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:42.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:07:43.000 --> 03:08:12.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:42.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:09:12.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:13:03.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:56.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:16:19.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:48.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:16:48.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.

[03:18:45.000 --> 03:19:14.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.

[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:59.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:22.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.

[03:23:47.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:32.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:28.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:57.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:56.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:25.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:55.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:31:56.000 --> 03:32:25.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:54.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:32:55.000 --> 03:33:24.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:34:22.000]  I'm sure you're going to be staying with me for the rest of the hour.
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  Well, that's what I asked.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  They've announced these sanctions that really aren't sanctions.
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:40.000]  It's just the expulsion of diplomats because no other country is required to do the same.
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:58.000]  When they made this announcement, the Department of Homeland Security released a report in a way that you might think this report supports the case that Obama has made against Russia.
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:22.000]  But if you look at the report, you notice two things. One is it is merely a report about the kinds of tools and infrastructure that the Russian government has that could be used to bring a cyberattack to the United States,
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  either to private companies or to some public parts of the government. It provides no evidence whatsoever that these tools were actually used.
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:40.000]  It's just a description of what they may be.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  And then the other interesting thing about this is at the very top of the report, there is a disclaimer. Let's see if I can read you.
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  I have it here. You have it in this article. It says disclaimer. This report is provided as is for informational purposes only. The Department of Homeland Security does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:16.000]  But you should just go ahead and take it on the word and we're going to issue these sanctions and kick out the Russian diplomats.
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  When you say what the disclaimer does, it says that we really can't even verify that our description of their tools and infrastructure is correct.
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:56.000]  So we have no evidence that the alleged infrastructure is used for the purposes that Obama says. And then we have a disclaimer that the report on the nature of the infrastructure and tools cannot be warranted, that they don't really stand behind this.
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  Wow. And that is incredible because here we're thinking that we are going to be getting this bombshell information once they finally decide to brief the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  Even Donald Trump is saying, you know, I think it's time everyone wants to move on to bigger and better things, but I'll wait and find out what they know about the Russians.
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:30.000]  He's even, you know, trying to be patient. But here you're saying they still have not provided any actual hardcore evidence, you know, in the last minute addition to the NDA there with this countering foreign propaganda.
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  Is this how they're going to do it? Just making up fake news and just telling America they need to be very, very, very afraid of the Russians?
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  That's exactly all it amounts to. In my column, I have a link to the report so people can look at it themselves. I'm sure I have it correct.
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  So what really is going on? See, something is going on under the scene, behind the scenes, maybe something that's much more serious.
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:14.000]  On the surface, we can conclude that, well, what Obama is trying to do is to box Trump in so that he can't restore relations with Russia.
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  We can see that that's the obvious conclusion to come from all of this. But that itself doesn't seem all that believable because Trump can rescind the sanctions in 21 days when he's inaugurated.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:49.000]  And so we should perhaps consider that there is more going on than meets the eye because one of the main uses of propaganda, especially about this propaganda of a Russian cyber threat,
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  could be to prepare the American and European populations for an incident. It could be a real serious incident. It would have to be serious in order to succeed in making it impossible for Trump to restore normal relations between the United States and Russia.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  And so what could be the nature of this? Well, we don't know, but we do know that the CIA has morphed into being a deep state that uses disinformation, propaganda,
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  to align decisions of Congress, executive branch, foreign governments with their own secret behind the scenes agendas.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  Have you ever seen a disclaimer like this before? No, never seen. I've never seen a report issued by an intelligence agency that supposedly backs up hostile provocative acts of the government against another power.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  Have a disclaimer. Right. I mean, that's the thing. It's like, just take our word for it. We're going to World War Three.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:12.000]  Now, you know, speaking of, you know, just kind of what we're seeing with this outgoing administration, what was the transition like from Carter say?
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:17.000]  Was he trying to muck up the place as much as humanly possible for the incoming administration?
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  No, no, of course not. Carter was a gentleman. He was a very fine kind of person. No, we had trouble with him.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  Yeah, I mean, I just feel like this is kind of unprecedented from a petulant child kind of scorched earth policy, if you will.
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  So, you know, when we were in the midst of the Cold War, did anything like this ever happen? Are we seeing kind of Cold War deja vu?
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  Well, I couldn't say how many times we were giving false information about the Soviet threat because to have a threat is very valuable to the military security complex.
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  They get a lot of budget out of that. They get a lot of power out of it. So they need a threat. You know, Eisenhower warned us of that, what, 60 years ago.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:20.000]  So they need a threat. And of course, they need a Russian threat. The Muslim threat is not a big enough threat to justify the kinds of military security budgets we have.
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  But to get back to this question of what is really going on here, why doesn't it make any sense for Obama to make a fool of himself like this?
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  And so that's why I wonder, I mean, I can't say that this is the case, but I wonder if all of this is a propaganda to get us ready for some kind of incident that can be used to prevent Trump restoring relations.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:42:01.000]  It would have to be a serious thing. And if that's the case, it could catch the Russians off guard because you saw what Putin's response was. It was very low key.
[03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  In fact, he used it to embarrass Obama and say he wasn't going to expel anybody. And in fact, all the American kids were invited to the Russian Christmas parties.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:22.000]  So, you know, if I was the Russian government, I would be wondering about this because there may be much more than meets the eye.
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  And I wouldn't just sit there and say, well, this is silly because it's not natural for the CIA to provoke a situation like this unless it's a cover or something.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  Right. I think that's what a lot of us are sort of seeing is that this goes way beyond just being upset that your policies completely got thrown out the window, that your candidate wasn't voted in.
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  Just being upset about the fact that the Americans voted against your policies. This is like, wow, this is sort of irreversible.
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  It'll be interesting to see how Donald Trump and his administration handle this situation. What do you think about Trump's appointments?
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  I know I believe you're kind of along with us saying let's give him a chance. Let's see what he's going to do.
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  Yeah. Well, you know, if he's serious about restoring relations with Russia, then his appointment to sector state is a very good one because this is a person from the energy sector who has no interest in bad relations with Russia.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  He wants to, you know, Exxon wants to be part of the Russian energy business. And so it's a totally different kind of a oligarch than the typical representative of military security complex.
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  So I think that when Trump announced this appointment, I think he gave the Neoconservatives a message that he was serious about good relations.
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  I think, according to the two generals, well, one of the generals, his national security advisor, he's the one who went public and said that it was a willful decision of the Obama regime to send ISIS to Syria.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  And it was against his own recommendation as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  So this is a very brave act, and it shows he's willing to take a stand different from the Neoconservatives propaganda.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  And the other general is the one who convinced Trump that torture doesn't work and got him off of that kit to get him back toward a constitutional legal basis.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:45:06.000]  And I would say on the whole, these are those appointments are good. They are all men who are strong and determined, and that's what it takes if there's going to be any change.
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  You know, a weak person or a conciliatory person or a person who won't go against the conventional thinking can't bring change.
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  So I say, let's give him a chance, these appointments for the reasons I just gave, encourage him.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  Right, I agree wholeheartedly. And that's what even Ivanka Trump said, you know, her father is very good at selecting the right people to be on his team to be a success.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:38.000]  What do you make of John Bolton? Of course, he's reportedly being considered for a spot on Trump's administration.
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  He's coming out saying Russia must be made to feel the pain over the cyber attacks.
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  Well, I don't see how he could possibly be important because he's a complete contradiction to what Trump has said, and he would be at loggerheads with the Secretary of State.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:04.000]  Assuming Trump can get his appointment confirmed, you know, the Senate has to confirm them.
[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  I've never understood the notion that John Bolton could be in the running. I don't know what that could possibly be about.
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:19.000]  Often, people float names in order to get them into the right.
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  So I've been, my tendency is to look at Bolton like that. On the other hand, it could be a way for Trump to have an inside way of knowing what the neocons were saying and thinking.
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  Right, exactly. You kind of keep your enemies closer, right?
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:47.000]  It could be that, but if I was Trump, I wouldn't want anybody like that.
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:51.000]  Exactly, because you're always going to have to be, you know, have eyes in the back of your head.
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:47:01.000]  Well, now I know we're kind of running out of time here, so I want to, you know, just, what do you think Obama's legacy is really going to be?
[03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:07.000]  Obviously, what the American people are going to think is a little bit different than what his legacy is going to be, say, inside the Beltway.
[03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:28.000]  Well, I agree with the spokesperson for the Russian farm that Obama is, without doubt, the worst president ever, and that he was aligned with evil, and he did evil in the world, terrible evil.
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:39.000]  And, you know, all I can say is, when January 20th comes, it's good riddance. I hope we never see him again.
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  Me as well, please. And he just wants to be a sports commentator on ESPN, and please, no, not even that. Just go crawl under your rock.
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  So, you know, I've been kind of saying this as well, so it's interesting to hear you say it that, you know, you're kind of a little hesitant with just coming right out and saying it, but perhaps preparing the American people for something pretty big to happen with Russia before January 20th.
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  Is that kind of what you're saying? Is be on the lookout for them kind of getting us ready for something big?
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:25.000]  I think it's the only explanation that makes sense of what we've been witnessing, which is an all-out attack by the director of the CIA.
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  It's a public attack by the director of the CIA against the president-elect.
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  So, clearly, this is an effort to discredit Trump, or to prevent him from taking office, or to prevent him from being able to restore normal relations with Russia.
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  There has to be some explanation of this. Quite clearly, John Brennan will be fired the minute Trump enters the White House. There would have to be a cleansing in the CIA.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:12.000]  And so, to be so public in the opposition against Trump, it has to have some reason.
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  And I think the only thing that I can really come up with, and of course other people may come up with other reasons, is part of the propaganda they give the American people, so that if there is some orchestrated incident, the people will be prepared to believe that it's true.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  Right. And you also kind of say, could Trump's foreign policy be controlled by false allegations? Maybe they're even kind of setting this up so then he's going to make his decisions based on that.
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  But not pivot toward Russia and continue going with the Obama administration with Saudi Arabia, for instance.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  Yes, that could be, I mean, I'm sure that's part of it. You see, already, apparently, Trump has agreed to have the CIA briefing.
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  It doesn't make a lot of sense because the CIA doesn't have any real evidence. The briefing will just further convince Trump not to trust the agency. But as we've said, there may be more to this than just trying to box Trump in.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:30.000]  Again, this may be preparing the ground for some kind of incident. I don't know. But if I was the Russian government, I would be thinking about putting the armed services on some kind of alert.
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  I wouldn't just sit there and say, well, this is Obama being silly.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  Obama being absolutely dangerous, frankly. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you so much for all this information. We're going to have you back on the show soon. PaulCraigRoberts.org. But man, you're absolutely right.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  I mean, he's sending the troops in to surround Russia and saying, ah, don't worry, guys, we're just provoking World War III and have a happy Christmas and a great New Year.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  All right, we'll see you soon.

[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:23.000]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement. I went through tons of brands, types, and flavors, and almost all of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way. I buy the cost-effective five-pound container and my family craves their One World Way too.

[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:55.000]  You know, perhaps the shipping is going to be a little too much for you. Put you over the edge. Go to the InfoWars store right now. We have free shipping for a limited time. Alex Jones is always kind of extending these specials.
[03:54:55.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  But that one is going to end. Now is the time to take advantage of the free shipping store-wide. Go for the seeds, the survival foods.
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  Of course, we are also extending those Christmas specials over at infowarslife.com. We've got living defense, supermail vitality, brain force plus survival shield X2.

[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  I'm not going to scare of so many different kinds of infections, but again, store-wide free shipping for a limited time on absolutely everything that we've got going for us at InfoWars.

[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  So I know you said you had one more story that you wanted to get to here.
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  Well, no, this is actually kind of carrying over from the conversation that you and Paul Craig Roberts just had. And I'm sitting here and I never really thought of this in this light.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  Everybody's kind of seeing the liberal hypocrisies and the double standards and everything. But this is one that kind of really hit home to me listening to you two talk.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:40.000]  You've got liberal Obama up here, quote unquote, liberal Obama behaving like a quote unquote conservative, right? I mean, he's now the warmonger. He's now the one putting stress on foreign relations.
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  He's now the one trying to get in to a heightened state of war or a heightened state of physical activity here, which is what the liberals claim the conservatives do, right?
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:57.000]  I mean, that's the whole liberal thing. Conservatives are the warmongers. Conservatives are the ones always trying to push war.
[03:56:57.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  But now this is Obama, who's basically behaving like a quote unquote conservative, but yet the liberal minions are still buying it hook, line and sinker.
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:11.000]  Is that the chicken neck, Nellie Bill Gates?
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  Well, this is a different story I can mention.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  Okay, sorry.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  But chicken neck, Nellie's telling us what to do.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:22.000]  Let's talk about the chicken neck, Nellie here with his goblin flopper in a second. But I just I just find it amazing.
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  I just don't I can never wrap my mind around the liberal mind hockey that these people have to play just to just to found just to have a foundation in their beliefs again.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:41.000]  The quote unquote liberals are against quote unquote conservatives warmongering and all this stuff.
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:48.000]  Okay, look, I can see right now I can see the smoke coming out of your head and this is exactly my point I was trying to make earlier.
[03:57:48.000 --> 03:57:57.000]  You're driving yourself crazy because you are trying to make sense of crazy people. These are sociopaths doing crazy things.
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  None of you out there need to try and make sense of this craziness.
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:03.000]  All right, so every liberal then is a sociopath.
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:12.000]  How about this? Bill Gates will cover this more in the news tonight. Bill Gates says the world is not prepared to cope with a deadly flu epidemic.
[03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  And in this story, guess what he talks about? More vaccines.
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:15.000]  He's going to save the world.
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  More vaccines. I need another needle. There's mumps out breaking everywhere.
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  But give me another vaccine, Bill Gates.
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:23.000]  This is the same guy that said he wants to get the population down to zero.
[03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:24.000]  So let's go ahead and trust him.
[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:26.000]  Lou in Kentucky, David in California.
[03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:28.000]  We are going to be sending you some t-shirts.
[03:58:28.000 --> 03:58:31.000]  Thank you for holding so long to try and get your question in.
[03:58:31.000 --> 03:58:34.000]  Now, be sure to watch the Info Wars Nightly News tonight.
[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:37.000]  Myself and Margaret Howell will be co-hosting.
[03:58:37.000 --> 03:58:40.000]  I don't want your vaccine, your chicken neck freak.
[03:58:40.000 --> 03:58:44.000]  This is GCN.
[03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:45.000]  You need one.
[03:58:45.000 --> 03:58:47.000]  A call me down vaccine.
[03:58:47.000 --> 03:59:02.000]  That's the nation.
