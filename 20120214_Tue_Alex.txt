[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:38.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.160 --> 00:45.720]  well we've got another insanely important broadcast lined up for you today it is
[00:45.720 --> 00:53.640]  Valentine's Day February 14th 2012 and we are going to be here for the next
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.400]  three hours we're gonna have open phones as well Adam Kakesh is going to be
[00:58.400 --> 01:02.760]  joining us for about 20 minutes at the start of the hour he's organizing a big
[01:02.760 --> 01:10.520]  march of veterans to the Capitol in support of Ron Paul and there's some
[01:10.520 --> 01:15.800]  new TV ads running that point out that he is getting 70 plus percent they've
[01:15.800 --> 01:20.840]  got the graphs and the numbers of the support that the military is giving all
[01:20.840 --> 01:27.680]  the Republican candidates and Obama combined he gets 70 plus percent showing
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.400]  that our military is full of patriotic Americans who are awake more than
[01:32.400 --> 01:38.520]  anybody else now again they've they've gotten bad apples out of the military or
[01:38.520 --> 01:42.280]  those that are dumbed down and train them to carry out illegal operations
[01:42.280 --> 01:46.200]  domestically and that's what I'm being told by the military is the big thing
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.080]  waking folks up because it is really causing an issue because up until now
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.480]  they were taught the Constitution Bill of Rights they were taught you don't do
[01:55.480 --> 02:00.400]  these type of things secret arrest torture spying on Americans training to
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.640]  have war with American people they know this is what they were taught the
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.400]  Soviet Russians did and the Communist Chinese and the bad guys do everybody
[02:09.400 --> 02:13.800]  knows what the bad guys do and and what the bankers are doing that have taken
[02:13.800 --> 02:19.280]  over America it's very elementary it's very simple my dear Watson is
[02:19.280 --> 02:24.480]  establishing classical tyranny this is not freedom I mean it's really that
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.720]  simple that's why I tend to get so frustrated all the time because this
[02:28.720 --> 02:35.040]  stuff is so obvious so ridiculously crystal clear so we've got Adam
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.360]  Cokesh popping in via video Skype for radio and TV listeners and viewers and
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.400]  then hadn't been on about a month and a half or so always enjoy having the one
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.280]  the only fiery Max Kaiser on with us he'll be on to talk about the global
[02:48.280 --> 02:55.440]  economy and what's what's happening in our world today now there's a article
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.360]  that we put out yesterday afternoon that's now up on drudge report on the
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.840]  left-hand side drudge report calm and I it's good to go there because it's
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.520]  already scrolled off the front page of info wars calm that's a problem we've
[03:07.520 --> 03:11.720]  got we're trying to work on a way to have have a really key top story stay
[03:11.720 --> 03:17.520]  somewhere on the front page maybe we'll create a new subsection that is a
[03:17.520 --> 03:22.960]  little bit larger than the featured area at the bottom that's just our authors
[03:22.960 --> 03:29.000]  stories then we've got so many writers and authors now I don't know I mean how
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.800]  do you pick a story that you think is the most important I guess I could do
[03:32.800 --> 03:36.600]  that or I guess you can do like a lot of folks do whatever gets the most
[03:36.600 --> 03:42.160]  comments is voted up but sometimes it's silly stories that or a comedy story
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.360]  that ends up getting you know a thousand comments so it'd be the top story but I
[03:46.360 --> 03:49.080]  guess that's what the people thinks important so I guess go with that I
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.240]  don't know we're working on that the point is Obama to unleash truth teams
[03:53.240 --> 03:56.800]  to counter negative coverage and this article went up at the end of the show
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.840]  yesterday I didn't cover it much but I'm gonna try to dig up I know it's on
[04:00.840 --> 04:06.040]  YouTube last time I checked a few years ago the the newscast where they
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.680]  actually say we have the transcript in here they actually say if you criticize
[04:10.680 --> 04:16.240]  Obama we're gonna arrest you because criticizing him is is lying about him
[04:16.240 --> 04:24.280]  and this is worse than North Korea or something just absolutely absolutely
[04:24.280 --> 04:30.200]  bizarre but I have this type of stuff going on so we're gonna be going over
[04:30.200 --> 04:37.120]  that because they're back at it yet again today a little side note Oliver
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.440]  Stone's son converts to Islam in Iran and some people are asking if this is a
[04:41.440 --> 04:51.480]  publicity stunt I know Sean Stone and he was telling me he might commit convert
[04:51.480 --> 04:57.800]  to Islam and I guess he's done it so that's big news but look all the news
[04:57.800 --> 05:03.240]  is coming up stay with us I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of
[05:03.240 --> 05:07.560]  food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my
[05:07.560 --> 05:11.480]  body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key
[05:11.480 --> 05:16.440]  vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was
[05:16.440 --> 05:20.960]  eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at
[05:20.960 --> 05:24.960]  info wars team dot com but I want to point out the three that have helped me
[05:24.960 --> 05:32.480]  lose 37 pounds in just two months products like beyond Tangy Tangerine

[08:06.120 --> 08:09.080]  radio network
[08:12.800 --> 08:18.800]  well we've got a clip of it in the Obama deception news out of Missouri
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.880]  saying if you run a misleading ad and they're gonna decide the police are
[08:24.880 --> 08:29.280]  about Obama saying he's not a Christian or he's a socialist that you're gonna be
[08:29.280 --> 08:37.120]  arrested and that was announced in Illinois Missouri Florida Vermont of all
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.480]  places which is usually a pretty free state well they're back announcing it
[08:41.480 --> 08:46.240]  again having prosecutors and police and others say that if you say something
[08:46.240 --> 08:50.800]  about Obama that they say is not true not found by a court not found by a civil
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.920]  court but if they say you're lying about our great dear leader that I guess you
[08:56.920 --> 09:01.320]  can be you know disappeared and here's the headline Obama to unleash truth
[09:01.320 --> 09:06.240]  squads to counter negative coverage GOP describes squads of supporters as
[09:06.240 --> 09:11.520]  propaganda teams to deceive voters well they're saying Obama's deceiving not
[09:11.520 --> 09:18.320]  allowed to say that I guess arrest the GOP so there is that report here's another
[09:18.320 --> 09:21.240]  one of the Washington Times just a miscellaneous news out of the gates
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.080]  here fed shut down Amish farm for selling fresh milk to their neighbors and
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.160]  they say they're going to shut the farm down all together now and you know I
[09:31.160 --> 09:37.160]  actually have a raw milk from outside San Antonio here that I drink every
[09:37.160 --> 09:42.960]  morning as I go on air with whey protein which itself comes from raw milk
[09:42.960 --> 09:50.680]  the brand I use pure evil pure evil I'm having my breakfast I've been up since
[09:50.680 --> 09:56.360]  6 a.m. I have my breakfast as I go on air I'm a bad terrorist and by the way
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.080]  I'm not joking according to the government I'm evil they've said that
[10:01.080 --> 10:06.480]  it's a felony to even buy the stuff according to their new interpretations
[10:06.480 --> 10:09.600]  doesn't matter of the Queen of England will only drink it and the rich elite
[10:09.600 --> 10:13.480]  are obsessed with it and fine restaurants serve it they're all going to be left
[10:13.480 --> 10:21.440]  alone you are going to drink the boiled pasteurized homogenized sludge and why
[10:21.440 --> 10:29.160]  did you go back in the 50s on record big dairies lobby and people like craft
[10:29.160 --> 10:36.880]  lobby that produced cheese or so-called cheese to have raw milk banned for over
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.760]  the counter sale before you got it delivered every day a little truck came
[10:40.760 --> 10:45.760]  by put it right there at your door why it lasts longer it tastes better it's
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.800]  it's a probiotic good for your guts a good for your bacteria flora because
[10:50.800 --> 10:58.480]  big agra was basically bought up by big pharma and they don't like to have to
[10:58.480 --> 11:05.040]  feed you something fresh because if any blood or any pus or any cow manure gets
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.200]  into regular fresh milk the whole thing has to be thrown out you've got to keep
[11:09.200 --> 11:17.160]  it new radically clean and it's very hard for big industries to industrialize
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.960]  producing fresh milk it's a it's a small operations what it's designed for but
[11:22.960 --> 11:27.320]  if you boil it and cook it three or four times it can have feces in it no
[11:27.320 --> 11:31.360]  no regulations is allowed to it can have blood and pus they can overwork the
[11:31.360 --> 11:38.160]  cows and give them synthetic growth hormone and that's what they do so they
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.600]  want to feed you and by the way my family's farmers on my dad's side and
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.760]  you know been involved in the dairy the whole nine yards I've milk cows I've had
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.440]  dairy experts on I've had historians on this is a fact and it's the same way
[11:52.440 --> 11:55.920]  they put all these preservatives in garbage and food so they can feed you
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.680]  rotten food that's when MSG is World War one the Japanese learned on record how
[12:00.680 --> 12:06.400]  to add this toxic chemical MSG monosodium glutamate a variant of salt
[12:06.400 --> 12:12.400]  they've changed the molecules so that even rotten meat would taste good because
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.520]  the Japanese didn't like eating rotten horse meat and stuff that was canned but
[12:17.520 --> 12:23.000]  the Japanese basically developed what got turned into spam today and it's very
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.800]  toxic but makes you want to eat more and more and makes a rotten sirrat taste
[12:27.800 --> 12:33.360]  like mama's cherry pie so that's what's going on on that front and they
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.400]  proudly announced the FDA want its two-year fight to shut down an Amish
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.960]  farmer who was selling fresh raw milk to eager customers and so that is the that
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.360]  and they are announcing they're going to start coming after everybody I know
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.080]  until about two years ago I could go once a week to the farmers market in
[12:54.080 --> 13:00.480]  Austin and the they had that Mennonite folks selling she was driving down from
[13:00.480 --> 13:07.120]  near walks of hatchy selling cheese from raw milk and selling vegetables and
[13:07.120 --> 13:12.160]  stuff and if you walked around by the back of their van and said this is a
[13:12.160 --> 13:15.800]  private sale you know you're buying this privately for me that's how it gets
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.440]  around all the federal and state garbage you could buy a couple gallons of
[13:20.440 --> 13:26.920]  delicious milk that that farmer had been pumping out the night before or 3 a.m.
[13:26.920 --> 13:31.220]  in the morning some days putting in the containers and driving it down to
[13:31.220 --> 13:37.720]  Austin and sometimes you got it it was still warm not anymore because they
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.240]  sent inspectors and harassers out there to shut all that down outside of law and
[13:43.240 --> 13:46.400]  and they're shutting everything down you try to sell peaches side of the road
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.720]  ain't happening try to sell cactuses to tourists out of the road ain't happening
[13:50.720 --> 13:55.160]  try to have a lemonade stand ain't happening girl cows girl scout cookies
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.880]  ain't happening because they're here to crack down on the old-fashioned market
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.400]  and call it black market you're not gonna associate with your neighbors the
[14:04.400 --> 14:11.440]  food safety act pushed by big pharma and big agro doesn't allow you to can
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.680]  strawberries and give them to your neighbor or put carrots in a container and
[14:16.680 --> 14:23.760]  pickles you cannot even give it to your neighbor you cannot serve it to your
[14:23.760 --> 14:28.320]  neighbor when they come to your home it's just the end of basic humanity it's
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.600]  humans being inserted into the modern agenda 21 prison that is totally
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.520]  unsustainable but they call it sustainable they always create
[14:36.520 --> 14:42.040]  counterfeits and take over any movement for sustainability for the environment
[14:42.040 --> 14:48.680]  and say it's about carbon dioxide not about GMO and toxic waste it's about
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.840]  carbon dioxide and taxing you and shutting down your farm and ranch it's
[14:52.840 --> 14:56.560]  not about nine out of ten reactors worldwide publicly leaking radiation
[14:56.560 --> 15:02.760]  because they're 30 40 50 years old rotting it's not about the troops using
[15:02.760 --> 15:09.280]  DU a death sentence it's about carbon dioxide that you exhaled and that
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.880]  plants respirate from so there it is they're very very proud of that London
[15:14.880 --> 15:18.680]  Guardian article news core executives at risk of US prosecution for willful
[15:18.680 --> 15:25.920]  blindness American anti-corporation law holds company chiefs culpable for
[15:25.920 --> 15:30.960]  consciously avoiding knowledge of corrupt deeds at news core and they're
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.240]  gearing up I guess is just department to look at clapping old Ripper Murdoch and
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.960]  irons and boy you see Fox News now there's a lot of Obama worshiping going
[15:40.960 --> 15:46.920]  on a lot of hosts are saying he's a man of the Lord he's good he cares about us
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.040]  after all the truth squad say you might be arrested we're all learning about our
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.160]  new freedom of course it doesn't even matter Obama I mean if we don't get Ron
[15:55.160 --> 16:00.600]  Paul it's Mitt Romney I mean that's a guy who's Barack Obama from a different
[16:00.600 --> 16:08.040]  party I mean I mean he's a brother from another mother he he's these guys the
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.760]  only difference is one has a D before his name the other has an R before his
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.640]  name exact same policies but it's so much fun to hate Obama and to feel like
[16:16.640 --> 16:22.920]  you're a winner if your guy gets into office all right that's just some of the
[16:22.920 --> 16:25.600]  little in sundry news articles here's another one
[16:25.600 --> 16:30.320]  Vladimir Putin ridicule that for demanding Russians have more sex to halt
[16:30.320 --> 16:36.080]  declining population yeah their population is smaller than Pakistan and
[16:36.080 --> 16:41.560]  Bangladesh now it's gone down from 200 million to 142 million the last 30 years
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.520]  communism didn't do too good for him that was eugenics and they do pay people
[16:46.520 --> 16:49.600]  to get married they do encourage people to have children large families they got
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.320]  billboards up the government pays you to have children boy look at the difference
[16:54.320 --> 16:58.760]  again I'm no fan of Putin KGB guy all this but compared to the new world order
[16:58.760 --> 17:03.480]  he's just old-fashioned strong man trying to hold his crumbling country
[17:03.480 --> 17:08.060]  together the globalist running our country are poisoning our food and
[17:08.060 --> 17:12.200]  water our populations at 1.3 replacement rate for every two adults they
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.800]  have 1.3 children except for the giant immigrant influx Western culture is
[17:16.800 --> 17:19.520]  completely dying Pat Buchanan's written about it and death of the west
[17:19.520 --> 17:25.960]  Japan's dying they have 1.2 Italy's 1.2 I mean all these cultures are dying
[17:25.960 --> 17:32.960]  because we're under the eugenics system I mean and and and then Putin's bad for
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.160]  saying there should be Russians in the future I don't know I mean I don't want
[17:37.160 --> 17:42.160]  to see there being you know no no South Africans in the future or no you know
[17:42.160 --> 17:47.520]  Japanese in the future or no Mexicans in the future or no Germans in the future
[17:47.520 --> 17:51.160]  I mean this is incredible the eugenicists have taught us to all hate
[17:51.160 --> 17:56.840]  ourselves and all hate our cultures but only love the plastic fake msg
[17:56.840 --> 18:05.440]  aspartame Myla Miley Cyrus garbage culture Justin Bieber garbage we have
[18:05.440 --> 18:10.200]  been totally and completely force-fed this death and it's all by design we
[18:10.200 --> 18:13.480]  have all the documents how they destroy the family in the 20s and 30s how they
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.000]  break it up how they create welfare to make you dependent one sure dependent
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.680]  then they play the welfare class off against the middle class the real
[18:19.680 --> 18:24.800]  enemy and forced sterilization then of the poor in that next phase or entering
[18:24.800 --> 18:29.800]  that next phase and I read to you World Bank documents yesterday where they said
[18:29.800 --> 18:33.440]  have mobile sterilization vans if you want to get your welfare you'll have to
[18:33.440 --> 18:37.800]  be sterilized of course then it'll be moved on to everybody else as well and
[18:37.800 --> 18:40.680]  then of course the Detroit newspaper came out yesterday and said put
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.320]  steroids on the water for everybody I got news for you Jack I got the White
[18:45.320 --> 18:50.000]  House science are at the Rockefeller documents I got them all it's on record
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.320]  they're already jacking the water they're already jacking the food they're
[18:55.320 --> 19:02.720]  already doing it that's why you know people ask well why can the inner city
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.240]  people still have kids whether they're black white Hispanic but yuppies that
[19:08.240 --> 19:12.840]  are mainly white but also Hispanic and black why can't they have kids it's real
[19:12.840 --> 19:18.480]  simple when they're hitting you with soft kill stuff if you're 16 or 17 you
[19:18.480 --> 19:22.400]  could still have a child on average this stuff is cumulative to build up so it
[19:22.400 --> 19:28.080]  can't be directed and pointed at one causal instrument so you wait to be 30
[19:28.080 --> 19:34.040]  3540 to have a kid you're gonna have to go get Buck Rogers type technology to be
[19:34.040 --> 19:37.280]  able to have that child which is exactly what the globalists want they'll then
[19:37.280 --> 19:42.000]  sell you the treatments to have a child after they've made you infertile but by
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.400]  law they're now announcing as I said they what years ago saying but if you're
[19:46.400 --> 19:50.480]  gonna get these therapies we've got to be able to change genes that we say are
[19:50.480 --> 19:54.440]  bad because now there's government funding involved under the Socialist
[19:54.440 --> 19:57.960]  Healthcare so your child's gonna have three parents we're gonna put somebody
[19:57.960 --> 20:03.600]  else's genetics in there to fix it if you're having any problems with the IRS

[24:15.360 --> 24:17.360]  One two three four I love you
[24:17.360 --> 24:21.560]  We are back live yeah I'm playing this because I saw in the news today that
[24:21.560 --> 24:26.360]  they're gonna put more women in frontline combat in the Marine Corps and in the
[24:26.360 --> 24:34.160]  Army that's what that old piece of propaganda was about with Jessica Lynch
[24:34.160 --> 24:40.160]  when they said that she had engaged in all this incredible combat and killed
[24:40.160 --> 24:43.760]  all of these Iraqi troops while the men cowered and of course it turned out the
[24:43.760 --> 24:49.160]  whole thing was a big Pentagon PR lie so they can basically in the future have
[24:49.160 --> 24:52.240]  a national draft that the federal government's been promoting to then
[24:52.240 --> 24:58.640]  conscript our daughters and to basically be camp women for the military and of
[24:58.640 --> 25:04.160]  course rape is just epidemic when you put women in combat every culture in
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.880]  every war the soldiers get out of control and tend to rape the women of the
[25:09.880 --> 25:14.720]  countries they're occupying it's just what happens I have to say that the
[25:14.720 --> 25:19.280]  British marveled in the Revolutionary War almost all of George Washington
[25:19.280 --> 25:24.240]  soldiers never engaged in any types of disreputable activity and you know why
[25:24.240 --> 25:28.920]  because George Washington hung people see the minute a military lets their
[25:28.920 --> 25:32.120]  troops engage in any type of activity like this
[25:32.120 --> 25:37.360]  everything goes to the devil everything just goes completely wild once you give
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.680]  in to this type of activity society collapses that's why George Washington
[25:41.680 --> 25:47.880]  executed people and made examples out of it oh you did something disreputable
[25:47.880 --> 25:52.400]  you're dead because George Washington understood and wrote about the fact that
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.720]  a it was the moral thing to do but B that's how they're gonna win the hearts
[25:55.720 --> 26:00.200]  and minds is not behaving like the Redcoats who'd been burning and pillaging
[26:00.200 --> 26:03.400]  all over the world and came to the United States came to the colonies and
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.560]  were burning down churches raping women engaging in all sorts of war crimes
[26:08.560 --> 26:12.720]  that of course worked against them and began to turn the population who were
[26:12.720 --> 26:16.960]  British subjects towards the rebellion that was only three percent of the
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.080]  population that's why the globalists are gonna stage false flag attacks in the
[26:22.080 --> 26:29.440]  future to be blamed on the Liberty Movement or try to provocateur people in
[26:29.440 --> 26:35.560]  to doing things Patriots never target civilian targets Patriots never start a
[26:35.560 --> 26:45.200]  fight understand that Patriots give quarter Patriots don't lie and Patriots
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.360]  have courage that's what patriots do they're patriots to basic liberty and
[26:50.360 --> 26:56.080]  basic freedom now if you go to info wars.com we have the headline our top
[26:56.080 --> 27:03.640]  story award-winning filmmaker and of course TV star movie star former head of
[27:03.640 --> 27:13.440]  the screen actors Guild Ed Asnerm has come out and said that he has Navy seal
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.440]  sources and those sources are known to yours truly and I'm gonna try to talk to
[27:18.440 --> 27:22.120]  some of them today and that they've been told by active-duty seals that the
[27:22.120 --> 27:27.600]  staged terror attack event is on and that the events would be staged very
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.320]  very soon internationally and domestically but mainly in the
[27:31.320 --> 27:38.920]  Strait of Hormuz as a pretext to launch a wider war obviously against
[27:38.920 --> 27:44.400]  Iran now mr. Clapper the head of the National Security Council the head
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.600]  advisor has come out and said we should have provocations in the Brookings
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.360]  Institute papers like the general public doesn't read that Gary Hart's
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.960]  written letters about staging false flag terror attacks and warning Iran we
[27:58.960 --> 28:05.120]  have all this other news unfolding on this subject and it's perfect timing we
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.400]  also have Dick Cheney who pulled a surprise winning reporter Psy Hirsch
[28:09.400 --> 28:15.960]  exposed four years ago was planning to and was ordering the seals to paint up
[28:15.960 --> 28:21.000]  their own boats like Iranian blue patrol boats missile boats to attack a US
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.840]  destroyer and Admiral Fallon got word of this actually happened five years ago we
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.880]  learned of it three and a half years ago as soon as Cheney left office Hirsch was
[28:31.880 --> 28:35.160]  ready to talk about it for his safety and had White House sources and it was
[28:35.160 --> 28:39.960]  later confirmed he's a two-time Pulitzer prize winner but the issue here is is
[28:39.960 --> 28:45.400]  that this is in the cards and it's a very very credible real specific threat
[28:45.400 --> 28:48.560]  that criminal elements running our government the Israeli government
[28:48.560 --> 28:53.960]  NATO are set to stage these and Navy SEALs are warning people and of course
[28:53.960 --> 28:58.640]  it's the Navy SEALs doing it because they were the ones told to do this attack
[28:58.640 --> 29:03.800]  and prepare it and Fox Fallon the head of SENTCOM flipped out and said I'm not
[29:03.800 --> 29:07.360]  going to do this and went public and said we're not attacking Iran on my
[29:07.360 --> 29:10.720]  watch we're pulling the ships back we're not going to have a straight-o
[29:10.720 --> 29:16.800]  almost conflict like some people want and of course he got removed Admiral
[29:16.800 --> 29:22.040]  Mullen two years ago who was then Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff went to
[29:22.040 --> 29:27.080]  Israel and said do not stage a USS Liberty that was even in the Washington
[29:27.080 --> 29:33.040]  Post I mean this is serious this is real and so it's Fox Fallon it's Admiral
[29:33.040 --> 29:39.640]  Mullen now it's Navy SEALs I know one of their names got their number to contact
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.960]  him today got a yesterday from Ed Asner but that article and video is up at

[31:13.040 --> 31:16.440]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely

[33:58.760 --> 34:04.480]  also to Obama the troops because they're in on what's really going on more than
[34:04.480 --> 34:09.600]  general public no Ron Paul's the way to go I love how the corporate prostitute
[34:09.600 --> 34:14.840]  Decepticon media is always acting like the troops want us to stay in war you
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.920]  know for the troops let's stay in Iraq and Afghanistan for the troops let's
[34:18.920 --> 34:23.440]  keep bases in 160 plus countries and then you pull the troops the vast
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.680]  majority want to cut back the size of the military want to get out of the
[34:28.680 --> 34:32.680]  bunch of countries and want to come home now are there people who believe the
[34:32.680 --> 34:35.440]  propaganda that America is really under threat and who want to fight for this
[34:35.440 --> 34:43.800]  country yes are there guys just flat out addicted to combat oh certainly but the
[34:43.800 --> 34:47.800]  majority of them are amazing professionals who love this country and
[34:47.800 --> 34:53.760]  know that Ron Paul is a veteran himself is trying to uphold our republic and the
[34:53.760 --> 34:56.920]  Bill of Rights and Constitution in fact there's an ad with an Air Force
[34:56.920 --> 35:00.440]  commander that Ron Paul's been running that we played on the nightly news last
[35:00.440 --> 35:04.560]  night Darren McBrain's got it well you guys get that so that when co-cash a
[35:04.560 --> 35:09.280]  veteran of the Marine Corps in Iraq himself joins us we can we can play
[35:09.280 --> 35:13.320]  that because I really think it puts it in perspective and there's a graph that
[35:13.320 --> 35:20.280]  shows I think in that graph it's 73% I've seen the number 71 73 74 depending on
[35:20.280 --> 35:22.920]  what mainstream news article you look at from the federal elections
[35:22.920 --> 35:31.200]  commission it varies but over 70% of military support Ron Paul what does that
[35:31.200 --> 35:37.080]  tell you see they can't they can steal elections at the county state and federal
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.800]  level in many areas it's not total fraud but they're able to manipulate and
[35:41.800 --> 35:45.600]  twist things they've been caught over and over again Ron Paul's pointing out
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.240]  the obvious because he has to it's reality that with the heater he really
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.560]  didn't win main the anomalies are just like they were in other states he won
[35:52.560 --> 36:01.280]  it got cheated but you see they can't cheat the small individual donations
[36:01.280 --> 36:07.200]  because those get reported and so he gets three to one more small donations
[36:07.200 --> 36:13.640]  than any other candidate same thing four years ago he gets more than three to
[36:13.640 --> 36:19.360]  one all the other candidates from the military just like you can't cover up
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.320]  he has more signs he has more bumper stickers he wins all the online polls
[36:23.320 --> 36:30.520]  he wins all the major straw polls all the things they can't rig he wins and
[36:30.520 --> 36:40.160]  he's doubled or more than doubled all of his major vote tallies except for
[36:40.160 --> 36:46.360]  Nevada where he statistically got the exact number of votes and delegates in
[36:46.360 --> 36:50.040]  Nevada that he got four years ago now does anybody believe that in some states
[36:50.040 --> 36:55.600]  he got a hundred percent others 200 percent others 90 percent increase but
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.120]  then four years later he gets the exact same thing in Nevada the fix was in they
[37:01.120 --> 37:06.880]  didn't even bother to upgrade the computer fraud algorithm okay let me get a
[37:06.880 --> 37:14.400]  few more news articles and then what I'm going to do is go to some of your phone
[37:14.400 --> 37:18.000]  calls ahead of Kokesh on any of the issues I've raised I want to hear from
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.760]  you quick comments so we can get to some people and move on 800-259-9231
[37:24.760 --> 37:31.520]  800-259-9231 first-time callers let me add that caveat first-time callers right
[37:31.520 --> 37:38.760]  now 800-259-9231 now here's some of the other news I'm going to get two more
[37:38.760 --> 37:43.800]  after Adam Kokesh pops in for 20 minutes female passengers say they're
[37:43.800 --> 37:50.920]  targeted by TSA CBF DFW and of course Paul Watson did his more detailed
[37:50.920 --> 37:54.080]  article that's linked on drudgereport.com right now it's also the top
[37:54.080 --> 38:00.880]  story at info wars.com TSA forces woman to use a naked body scanner three times
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.560]  because of cute figure and told her that now remember a few years ago in another
[38:06.560 --> 38:13.440]  Texas airport well what was it Amarillo you can pull it up was Amarillo or
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.400]  Midland I'm going from memory they came over made her pull her shirt off and
[38:18.400 --> 38:26.400]  three men commented on how attractive her memory glands were I guess those
[38:26.400 --> 38:30.720]  haven't been outlawed like I'm a showing I'm on a side issue the point is is
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.000]  they'll try to outlaw that too just being a mother they're demonizing breast
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.560]  feeding I'm being serious that wasn't attempted humor the point is they all
[38:37.560 --> 38:42.800]  come over they get in her face tell her she's gorgeous she's crying and a
[38:42.800 --> 38:47.880]  supervisor comes over and tries to give her his number like baby you are looking
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.480]  good here's my number they're that detached I mean they're ripping
[38:51.480 --> 38:55.040]  colostomy bags off old people they're making 95 year old women that can't
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.080]  walk be picked up by people out of their wheelchairs it's it's total prisoner
[38:59.080 --> 39:04.560]  training zero tolerance mindlessness training you to submit to total
[39:04.560 --> 39:21.320]  training now continuing here TSA forces woman to use naked body scanner three
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.720]  times because of cute figure now remember they denied the whole breast thing in
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.400]  Texas until she filed suit and got the video and then they settled with her
[39:33.400 --> 39:40.640]  they denied miss USA until they got the video and had to admit they went in her
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.720]  underwear and into her body I mean I've been there at the airport and see when
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.160]  they check to see what it is I've got a ABC news headline that I can't even say
[39:50.160 --> 40:00.000]  on the air TSA twisting bleeps taking off clothes they actually squeeze to check
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.840]  I mean Ron Paul's pointed out on the show it's painful he's a medical doctor he
[40:04.840 --> 40:08.880]  calls it disgusting and painful I mean you got to be a medical doctor to know
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.040]  how to squeeze on men to know what to do with women I mean this is a medical
[40:15.040 --> 40:19.440]  exam that's why they have specialists when the police arrest you that you'll
[40:19.440 --> 40:25.080]  come in and do things like that you you you are in a custodial arrest and they're
[40:25.080 --> 40:29.680]  doing this to your family your children training them to be abused and my point
[40:29.680 --> 40:34.280]  here is they're going to end up trying to deny this like they always do they
[40:34.280 --> 40:41.320]  denied miss USA turned out it was true they deny they were stripping all those
[40:41.320 --> 40:46.200]  old ladies at JFK later had to apologize and admit they're doing it but
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.160]  they're gonna keep doing it they lied about taking the woman's shirt off and
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.760]  commenting on her breast and hitting on her they had to settle they're out of
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.760]  their minds crazy because the government can only hire lunatics to do
[40:59.760 --> 41:05.680]  something that nobody else would do so TSA forces woman to use naked body
[41:05.680 --> 41:10.880]  scanner three times because they said she had a cute figure remember in England
[41:10.880 --> 41:17.720]  they use a naked body scanners on different TV stars and tried to deny it
[41:17.720 --> 41:32.680]  TSA again forces woman to use naked body scanner three times because of cute
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.840]  figure again I just keep repeating this headline here new legislation will force
[41:37.840 --> 41:44.080]  TSA to install passenger advocates at every airport that's kind of like you
[41:44.080 --> 41:48.600]  can go to the warden if you don't like what's happening or you don't like
[41:48.600 --> 41:52.280]  getting your leg blown off you can go to an army counselor this is putting
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.920]  perfume on a pig and it's the CBS News report out of Dallas with these women
[41:56.920 --> 42:03.360]  talking about how when they see a hottie a good-looking woman and of course when
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.000]  they see little girls especially that all these guys are pedophiles they run
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.960]  them in there and they scan them over and over again and make a big joke out of
[42:11.960 --> 42:16.840]  it and then on top of it do the physical search is there nothing the American
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.160]  people won't take and I've had members of the state legislature on that
[42:21.160 --> 42:26.760]  introduced the bills remember in Texas to try to stop this and describing their
[42:26.760 --> 42:31.800]  children and wives being groped the family crying the TSA laughing and you
[42:31.800 --> 42:36.600]  know what Austin did they now have responded by groping everyone and body
[42:36.600 --> 42:41.720]  scanning everyone that flies out of Bergstrom and I've had members of the
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.800]  State House on who believe they're being singled out now when they go through
[42:45.800 --> 42:50.800]  look out they get out the walnut crushers I mean this is all about total
[42:50.800 --> 42:58.160]  and complete domination over the population again female passengers say
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.120]  they're targeted of course the TSA says that's not true that they randomly select
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.320]  people that's bull they decide when they want to check your car to put you
[43:07.320 --> 43:11.760]  through but I fly a lot not as much as I used to but I fly to cover media events
[43:11.760 --> 43:17.080]  and I see them pull out the good-looking women Eric Muller man Cal Muller talks
[43:17.080 --> 43:21.760]  about it his wife's good-looking every time the groping begins it is a sick
[43:21.760 --> 43:27.320]  joke TSA people been caught raping women in the parking lot molesting
[43:27.320 --> 43:32.520]  children hitting on women it's constant putting notes in their bags how they
[43:32.520 --> 43:37.040]  want to have sex with them on the list goes on and on this is a nightmare of
[43:37.040 --> 43:41.560]  federal brown shirts now expanding on the streets now I'm gonna play that clip
[43:41.560 --> 43:46.640]  coming up later and I'm also gonna play a clip of this coming up later after we
[43:46.640 --> 43:52.080]  take calls and talk to Adam co-cache Obama's CFR Economic Council director
[43:52.080 --> 43:59.680]  calls for global tax on C-span the head of his Economic Council the folks
[43:59.680 --> 44:04.200]  shutting down other power plants but letting GE operate they are saying on
[44:04.200 --> 44:09.160]  C-span we need a global tax now you've already got it through the IMF and
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.520]  World Bank but our governments pay them now they're announcing the global
[44:12.520 --> 44:18.080]  airline tax then the global automobile tax then the other carbon taxes all to be
[44:18.080 --> 44:24.640]  paid to private banks that's admitted they're skipping even paying the U.N.
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.160]  the money they're going right to pay in the big global mega banks and it's not
[44:29.160 --> 44:33.800]  just our article weekly standard picked it up as well White House Economic
[44:33.800 --> 44:39.960]  Advisor we need a global minimum tax and that's what the OECD calls for and the
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.000]  XM Bank and the International Bank of Settlements they all call for global
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.280]  tax standardization and a global tax what did Ban Ki-moon call for a week and
[44:49.280 --> 44:55.480]  a half ago world government and world tax simultaneously ADL Southern
[44:55.480 --> 45:01.800]  Poverty Law Center fired reports out to police and publicly that day saying it
[45:01.800 --> 45:07.160]  doesn't exist report anyone talking about it in the New York Times in the
[45:07.160 --> 45:15.760]  desert news in the Associated Press all happening boom police doesn't exist I
[45:15.760 --> 45:20.240]  mean that's the type of brainwashing we're dealing with so that's coming up
[45:20.240 --> 45:23.840]  I also want to go over 20 things we can learn about the future of the American
[45:23.840 --> 45:26.800]  dream from the death of Detroit I absolutely agree with this article it's
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.440]  up at info wars.com from the economic collapse blog we've also got Moody's
[45:31.440 --> 45:37.280]  investors service downgrading Europe big time that's all part of the plan we
[45:37.280 --> 45:41.280]  told you that was coming again these countries are bankrupt because they're
[45:41.280 --> 45:45.640]  under banker management then the bankers own rating agencies that triple a rate
[45:45.640 --> 45:49.280]  their derivatives crowd to sell the governments now the government have
[45:49.280 --> 45:53.820]  signed on to their their debt and then the bankers rating agency downgrades the
[45:53.820 --> 45:57.840]  countries to put them into hawk to the very banks that the countries are in
[45:57.840 --> 46:02.800]  hawk to because they bailed out the bankers it's so simple and over the
[46:02.800 --> 46:06.760]  top it's hard to even grasp isn't it we give the bankers our money then we're
[46:06.760 --> 46:11.160]  in debt to them they loan it back to us an interest and then downgrade our
[46:11.160 --> 46:17.080]  sovereignty to them to establish a world government we pay taxes to and they're
[46:17.080 --> 46:22.040]  publicly announcing it everywhere the Economist magazine Reuters Associated
[46:22.040 --> 46:26.880]  Press every day global government the answer global taxes the answer but
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.640]  simultaneously the White House run media matters on record is saying I'm deadly
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.600]  dangerous and they've got national news asking should I be arrested and the
[46:37.600 --> 46:41.560]  White House regulations are saying start arresting people like Alex Jones
[46:41.560 --> 46:46.280]  because I will sit here with clear understanding that two plus two equals
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.160]  four I'm like the three-year-old the emperors new clothes the emperors butt
[46:50.160 --> 46:54.800]  naked in the street at a parade nobody wants to tell him he's been conned by
[46:54.800 --> 46:59.680]  the guys will you guys print me the parable of the emperors new clothes a
[46:59.680 --> 47:04.160]  synopsis of it because I'm you know I need to tell that story today I want to
[47:04.160 --> 47:11.280]  go to calls but I need to tell that story today because con artists come to town
[47:11.280 --> 47:14.720]  briefly I'll read the whole thing later if I have time con artists come to town
[47:14.720 --> 47:19.760]  and they say this is such a beautiful weaving of gold we're gonna do that only
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.640]  royalty can see its pure beauty their profane cannot see it so they say
[47:24.640 --> 47:27.920]  here's your cloak well he can't see it he doesn't want to say he's not high
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.080]  class he's not trendy this is what trending this is all about okay that's
[47:32.080 --> 47:35.760]  why I make jokes about trending this you know and so he starts wearing it and he
[47:35.760 --> 47:39.240]  marches in front of everyone everybody knows he's naked but nobody wants to
[47:39.240 --> 47:44.080]  say he's naked because they'll be arrested or laughed at and finally they
[47:44.080 --> 47:47.720]  selling more and more expensive cloaks you know for hundreds of thousands of
[47:47.720 --> 47:52.080]  talons of gold and stuff and finally a three-year-old steps forward says the
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.120]  emperors naked everybody else starts laughing okay I mean I'm not smart I'm

[48:18.320 --> 48:23.760]  senior at Ohio University in Athens Ohio I'm also a candidate for my local
[48:23.760 --> 48:27.520]  government here in Athens County I'm running for Athens County treasure but I
[48:27.520 --> 48:30.120]  had three things I want to talk to you about Alex I'll make them quick I know
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.480]  you're in a rush the first thing is about my local county sheriff here in
[48:34.480 --> 48:40.200]  Athens he's a former Blackwater agent that he went out and trained him
[48:40.200 --> 48:45.280]  between reelections some Blackwater troops in Iraq and he's not now trying
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.200]  to move our order our local auditors raising some heck about it how he wants
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.640]  to move $200,000 him and the prosecutor outside of her scope of
[48:56.640 --> 49:00.240]  oversight into a private bank account which I think it's just complete fraud
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.880]  and who knows what could happen with that and it really worries me well sir
[49:04.880 --> 49:08.680]  that standard was with with the county and city governments they always have
[49:08.680 --> 49:13.480]  their little secret budgets but I mean particularly where are you located what's
[49:13.480 --> 49:17.880]  happening now well happens I happen to come in the house out eastern Ohio right
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.880]  close to West Virginia border but it's happening he's a department of
[49:22.880 --> 49:28.920]  Homeland Security Grant for a mobile command center it is a massive looks
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.840]  like box truck that can have surveillance audio equipment on it that can
[49:33.840 --> 49:37.320]  e-drop and they have actually a write-up in the local paper about how it's not
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.600]  really being used as more of a parade thing but I keep telling people wait
[49:40.600 --> 49:43.880]  for it to get real effort to be rolled out well listen you know what the feds
[49:43.880 --> 49:47.800]  say on record if you get involved in your government and criticize them being
[49:47.800 --> 49:52.360]  taken over by the feds you're the terrorist I mean it's incredible and
[49:52.360 --> 49:56.560]  so it just gives license to all these I mean they're there they're police
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.520]  forces of five cops where they're buying machine guns getting armored vehicles
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.400]  from the army going under federal training spying on old Billy Bob at the
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.360]  coffee shop I mean I was watching this morning a TSA airport video where a
[50:12.360 --> 50:16.240]  woman didn't want to be patted down and they call like eight cops and the cops
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.040]  are hyperventilating and all have their arms behind their backs and like you
[50:20.040 --> 50:24.520]  know running around like they've caught al-qaeda with a woman and her kids I
[50:24.520 --> 50:29.480]  mean it's just it's like a bunch of paranoid crazy government people telling

[56:27.640 --> 56:31.920]  ahead and make your point about the poison fluoride in the water yeah well
[56:31.920 --> 56:35.080]  I've been going to our local city California meeting here in Athens city
[56:35.080 --> 56:39.400]  Ohio and we've been going I've been going off and on for about four years
[56:39.400 --> 56:44.320]  since I was in senior in high school now a senior at OU here in Athens and we've
[56:44.320 --> 56:47.880]  gained there's some people in the movement and since the beginning of the
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.440]  year well we had a new council so me and my friends and mother just concerned
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.760]  citizens went to meetings every meeting since the beginning of the year and I'm
[56:56.760 --> 57:00.960]  just me let them have a 35 to 40 minutes every meeting at the end of the
[57:00.960 --> 57:04.600]  meeting for citizen out to speak and we've been getting it to them well at
[57:04.600 --> 57:09.840]  the last meeting the role director take a feel the need to give us a 15 minute
[57:09.840 --> 57:13.960]  lecture at the beginning of the meeting saying that there's an EPA mandate and
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.720]  how city hall or the city council cannot do anything because of the state EPA
[57:18.720 --> 57:23.400]  mandate that we have to walk Florida over 5,000 people yeah again a mandate
[57:23.400 --> 57:27.600]  means the feds say you need to do it and then what you bring up is 90 plus
[57:27.600 --> 57:31.880]  percent of the EPA's own scientists have gone public saying it's deadly they're
[57:31.880 --> 57:35.800]  pulling it out all over the world so he basically sits up there and lies to
[57:35.800 --> 57:40.520]  people and just implies it's a federal or state law totally agree and the
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.480]  problem that happens the city voted it down twice in the 60s and then through
[57:44.480 --> 57:48.120]  referendum after the state legislative pass this mandate had a chance to opt
[57:48.120 --> 57:53.720]  out of it in 1970 through a loophole and they did but in 1989 on a lame duck
[57:53.720 --> 57:57.680]  council on a four to three vote it got voted into the water and I even talked
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.800]  to the head water director at the city water plant and she's opposed to it but
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.360]  I mean she says she can't do it so I'm so I'm there assaulting you as soon as it
[58:07.360 --> 58:11.680]  gets into court that there's hundreds of chemicals in the so-called fluoride
[58:11.680 --> 58:14.480]  because they'll argue fluoride's good for even though it kills you dead or no
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.720]  hammer over time just just point out that that you start doing the
[58:19.720 --> 58:23.560]  interrogatives the request for the exact mix they've got it's all got a bunch of
[58:23.560 --> 58:26.920]  poison in it they're gonna pull it out real quick and move on to others they
[58:26.920 --> 58:32.200]  want to brain damage and see what they do is they make your town pay for the
[58:32.200 --> 58:36.440]  toxic waste they you're paying them to have them brain damage you and your

[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.720]  Hillary is calling for peace troops to invade Syria like they invaded and dropped
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.640]  love bombs over Libya so al-Qaida could take control.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.440]  That's all coming up but right now let's go to Jacob at Indiana
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.080]  and he's watching us on prisonplanet.tv. Jacob welcome.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.640]  Hey how you doing Alex? Good sir. I just wanted to bring up a few things on
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.320]  Big Ron Paul supporter and uh next week we're starting a rally in northwest Indiana and
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:17.360]  Chicago area on the 25th I think and uh I just wanted to bring up a point about
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.560]  that milk that you were talking about the raw milk. Yes sir. And how how bad regular milk is.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:30.640]  Yes. I went on this diet where I didn't drink any milk for like a month and then I went off of it and I started
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.720]  drinking regular milk again and I couldn't believe how sick it was making me feel.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.680]  Well I've had I've had medical doctors on. I've had scientists on. I've had old-time farmers
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:53.120]  and dairy people on. So-called homogenized milk milk that has been cooked is nothing but
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.000]  a trans fat cheese that clogs your arteries. It is not milk. See they ban real milk and
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.560]  then bring in their counterfeit and then call everybody extremists who want real milk while
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.160]  the elite are obsessed with real milk. That's the only reason they haven't shut down the few
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:14.000]  pockets of it is because the elite all drink it. Uh and they know the Queen of England all of them
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.520]  and because it's milk it's not raw milk it's milk and then the stuff you're given is not milk. It is
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:28.640]  it is a pasteurized homogenized boiled garbage because they're feeding you feces and blood and
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.320]  pus but you can't do that with with real milk. If there's anything in it you you can't get away
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.920]  with it. I'm sorry go ahead sir. Yeah and then I just wanted to point that out and you know you
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.320]  know tell you that I've experienced it firsthand like it's not you know something that all you
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:50.080]  drink milk and you just feel fine but uh and then I wanted to bring up all this all this crap about
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.600]  uh you know Ron Paul always you know coming in force and all these polls and everything.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.280]  Whatever I talk to anybody you know anybody at all they they you know love Ron Paul unless they're
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.920]  just you know one of these sheeple that no no there's no doubt Ron Paul is the winner they're
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.560]  stealing it from him and and I didn't say this four years ago I said there's some there's some
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.360]  cheating going on in New Hampshire and other areas you know so he's in fourth place instead of second
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:20.800]  like it should be but he's not the front runner. Ron Paul is now the front runner we've done an
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.920]  analysis and they're stealing it from him. It's what the criminals do. They're known criminals
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.880]  that lie continually and have been caught in an election fraud perpetually. We'd be idiots not to
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.360]  know they're doing it and then all the evidence is there. Look at how they gained the debates and
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.720]  gained the coverage and told you he couldn't win and now they can't be proven wrong because you're
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:48.480]  not listening to them. Go ahead. Yeah it's just all ridiculous I just wanted to know uh if there's
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:54.160]  any like films or anything that you have that you know would show a good you know thing about Ron Paul
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.360]  that have you put together any films that would be like a quick you could show people that maybe
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.320]  necessarily don't know all about Ron Paul. So what would you suggest? Yeah there's a video we're
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.160]  about to play coming out of break and the audio there's a whole series of these ads in fact I'll
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.000]  get the titles of these ads if you guys can get that off the Ron Paul website for me that'd be
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.480]  awesome and we'll give you the name of the ad. We've posted it at infowars.com as well last week
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.560]  when it first came out but there's a whole bunch of great ads. I would just go to the Ron Paul
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.040]  official website or YouTube page and get you know the ads that you think are most effective and
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:34.800]  send them to people and they're refreshing because you've never seen political ads like this because
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.000]  it's about the Constitution. It's about America and what made the country great. It's about just
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.680]  being decent people again but no we can't have that we've got to be an empire run by a bunch of
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.640]  psycho eugenicist globalist. All right speaking of Ron Paul one of his big supporters talk show host
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.920]  Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam Adam Kokesh coming up he's got a veteran's march planned.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.840]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now here are my top 10 reasons to stock up
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.280]  on food from eFoods Direct. Number 10 the food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great. Number nine

[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.440]  Number two I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store and the number one
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:45.280]  reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners. Folks don't

[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.920]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.640]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.160]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.600]  the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:29.440]  cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:21.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:46.320]  All right, we're going to Adam Kokesh here in just a moment. I agree with Adam's point and
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:52.800]  the point that many others have made. The fact that Ron Paul consistently has gotten 70 plus percent
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:59.040]  of all presidential donations for Republicans and Obama combined, and we're going to show you a
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:07.120]  videograph of that in a moment, really illustrates that the militaries awake and are good patriots
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.240]  compared to the average American. They're more informed about what's going on. I have to say
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.760]  that's what it conclusively shows. A, and B, it just fits into all the other evidence we've got.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:24.720]  The most bumper stickers. The number one Twitters, the Google search terms, winning the straw polls,
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.480]  winning the scientific polls, winning the internet polls, having the biggest crowds,
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.920]  everyone I know, everywhere I go, Ron Paul, Ron Paul, Ron Paul, but the establishment saying he
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:43.680]  can't win, he can't win, he can't win and engage in all sorts of chicanery. And when one state's
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:50.400]  got 2% reporting, 98% of the votes not in, they say Mitt Romney wins. And now Ron Paul's come out
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.880]  and said there are anomalies. It looks like fraud. We're contesting Maine. Yeah. And there was total
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.960]  fraud confirmed three weeks after Paul didn't contest it in Iowa. And there was fraud, of course,
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.600]  in Nevada because they can't have him winning because then he'd get the nomination, he'd win.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:13.600]  But no, he is the nominee. He is our president. He is. He would beat Obama. Hands down. They've
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.840]  got Gallup polls on that. The polls always show he'd be winning, but magically something happens.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.280]  Remember that Republican Fox News correspondent on the radio in Ames saying, don't worry,
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.440]  I've talked to the insiders, he's not going to be allowed to win. And on record, they just
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.840]  didn't allow the calls to be called in. And then Carl Rove and others met and bragged that they
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.760]  decided Santorum would be above Paul and that it would go to Mitt Romney. And they're so arrogant,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.040]  they tell you that. Now, here is an ad that I think is one of the best ones I've seen,
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.320]  adherence to the oath. And we've got it posted up at info wars.com, but that's the name of this new
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.000]  ad running. Then we'll go to Adam Cokesh, who's organizing a big rally of veterans there in DC
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.840]  to point out they support Ron Paul and hopefully break this hoax that Ron Paul doesn't have military
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.960]  support. You noticed during the debates and in the media, they keep saying,
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.440]  military doesn't like you because you're against all these wars when it's the exact opposite.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:15.360]  And they know it. It's all part of their hatred of the American people and their disdain and their
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:22.800]  hubris, uh, hoodspug, arrogant, over the top deception. Like Hitler said, the bigger the
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.120]  lie, the better, because the more people will believe it. And once you buy into something so big,
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:34.080]  you don't want to admit you've been conned later. Here is that, uh, video. We were brought up loving
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:41.280]  our country and our constitution at any United States of America. We were free. And that's
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:47.200]  an attitude that we've tried to instill in our children. I met my wife while, uh, in the air
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:54.080]  force. I was a combat pilot in Vietnam. I served in desert storm as a commander. When I graduated
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:01.280]  from the academy, I took the oath of office. Uh, and as a commander, I administered that oath to many
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  people. Now I wonder about the understanding people have of our constitution and I think about
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:17.120]  our candidates for president of the United States. Uh, it's interesting to see the support Ron Paul
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:24.240]  gets from the military. And if we think back to the code of conduct, uh, and people raising their
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.160]  right hand that they were going to support and defend the constitution of the United States,
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:37.360]  why would those same people support and great numbers on Paul? I think it's because they know
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.320]  that he supports the constitution of the United States. It doesn't mean you have to go to war to
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:49.120]  do it. Uh, it means you have to understand what the constitution is and be a supporter inside of
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.040]  your own country, whether you're in the military or not of that constitution and make the United
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:02.240]  States strong and on Paul does that. That's his feeling. That's his trust. And that's why if you
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:11.360]  look at the percentages that support him and the military, it's huge. Why is that? Because they
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.800]  raise their right hands and they're putting their lives on the line for us here in the United States
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:27.120]  and they know that Ron Paul does the same. Okay, so get that video out to everybody. Now going to
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:34.000]  Adam Kokesh, radio talk show host, TV host, investigative reporter, a United States Marine
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.120]  Corps veteran of the Iraq war where he was a corporal. Uh, and he joins us now. He's organizing
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:48.720]  a march for veterans, uh, supporting Ron Paul. The headline is Ron Paul is the choice of the troops
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.760]  march on the White House. And then I guess to the Capitol, very, very exciting. Get this out to
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.240]  everybody, ladies and gentlemen. In fact, I know we've already posted it, but I want to repost.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.320]  Ask one of the web guys to repost this bulletin to the front page of info wars.com. Adam, I think
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.920]  that's a pretty powerful ad that the revolution pack put out. They're doing a great job for Ron Paul.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.520]  Tell us why you're organizing this event and when it is and how folks can get involved.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.760]  Absolutely. And thank you so much for having me on Alex and giving me the opportunity to promote
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.520]  this to your audience because I know it's something that you care so much about. I know it's something
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.360]  that they care about. And I know that there are a lot of veterans and active duty troops who listen
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.320]  to your show who are also inspired by the message of liberty that Ron Paul shares. And that's why
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.640]  we're doing this because Ron Paul is the choice of the troops. That's the name of the event. That's
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.400]  the message we're trying to get across because if this were true about any other candidate,
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.880]  this inconvenient little fact that he's got more campaign contributions from active duty troops
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.520]  than all others put together, as far as the media is concerned, the race would be over and whoever
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.320]  they could say that about would have the nomination clinched. But if it's Ron Paul and they don't
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.600]  understand why they're going to sweep that fact under the rug instead. And it's not despite his
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:07.760]  foreign policy. It's not, well, the Constitution, but at least Ron Paul is a veteran. No, it's because
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.920]  of the foreign policy that the troops overwhelmingly support Ron Paul. It's because of a constitutional
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:20.160]  non-interventionist foreign policy. But it's really for the same reasons that any other American
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.880]  votes a particular way or really does anything. We're not such a distinct subculture that we're
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.240]  not also creatures of pragmatism. And when you're the ones with your lives on the line, when you're
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.440]  the ones who have to face the combat and have to face that reality and want a commander-in-chief
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.600]  who's going to be decisive, who's going to put America's security interests first,
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.920]  who is only going to send you into harm's way with a clear moral imperative or as Ron Paul
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:50.160]  would call it, a constitutional declaration of war, you're kind of motivated to do the research,
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.520]  to do the homework, to look behind the illusions of the mainstream media, to see why is it that
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.000]  all of these other candidates are supporting this globalist foreign policy? Why are they
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.800]  supporting a policy that would make me a tool of the globalist? And that really inspires the troops
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.000]  to support Ron Paul. And while we have this beautiful statistic as to how much the active
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.560]  duty support him, because they list their employers when they donate to the presidential campaign,
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.720]  we're having this event in part to show that there's a similar parallel of support within the
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.040]  veterans community. But also we're inviting active duty to join us. And we have a lot of guys from
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.120]  active duty that are joining us for this event, which is very exciting, because we're creating an
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.840]  opportunity for active duty troops and veterans within their communities to reach out to each
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.800]  other and talk to each other about the message of Ron Paul and talk to each other about why we
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.160]  need to have a moral imperative and some real principle behind our foreign policy. So at noon,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.200]  next Monday on President's Day, we are going to be rallying at the Sylvan Theater at the base of
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.000]  the Washington Monument. We're going to have a series of speakers based on who has done the best
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.920]  job promoting this event through our YouTube video contest. So the message of this event,
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.040]  beyond Ron Paul is the choice of the troops, is really going to be defined by the participants.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.200]  We're very excited to see that we've had over 20 video entries already, and people are really
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.840]  jumping on board with us to support it, because it's an event that people are waiting to happen.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.680]  So at 2 o'clock, 1,400 hours, we're going to be forming up in a full military formation
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.960]  on 15th Street facing towards Constitution Avenue and stepping off towards the White House.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.360]  Everyone in formation will be required to present proof of service, but we also invite
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:34.320]  family members and of service members to march behind us and for supporters to line the route
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.760]  and to be with us at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when we form up again in front of the White House
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.600]  to do an about face and turn our backs on the president in a repudiation of his foreign policy,
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:51.120]  the foreign policy of imperialism, of globalism, of using the troops as cannon fodder or as
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.200]  Henry Kissinger so famously referred to us as dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.480]  policy. And after turning our backs on the White House, we are going to hold a flag folding ceremony
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:08.720]  and hold a hand salute for as many seconds as troops have died both abroad and by suicide
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.120]  since Obama took office. And it's going to be over half an hour. It's going to be a long salute.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.400]  And it's going to be a pretty dramatic visual that we hope the mainstream media
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.800]  can't ignore. And if they do, they do so at their own peril because to ignore the troops is to
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.160]  ignore a voice that the American people hold so dear. And as all military regulations regarding
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.880]  free speech have been designed to keep the troops quiet, to keep voices of dissent silent,
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.280]  to keep the troops serving only as pretty backdrops for presidential speeches or when Ben
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:41.440]  Bernanke wants to go down to Fort Hood and use the troops as political pawns, as backdrops for
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.560]  his economic schemes. Well, we're saying no more, not anymore. The voice of the troops will be heard,
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.480]  the voice of the veterans will be heard, and it will be made clear to the American people
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.600]  that Ron Paul is the choice of the troops on Monday, February 20th, President's Day. We really
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.120]  encourage people to get involved. And like I said, I'm so grateful for the opportunity.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  Are you kidding? We're grateful for the work you're doing and all the veterans and currently
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:07.360]  serving active duty that are going to be out there. And again, it won't matter if the dinosaur,
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.320]  corporate, whore media, trader media, globalist, sellout media isn't there at them. The real media
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.960]  that's exploding is going to be there. That's why the system's rushing in, trying to start censoring
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.520]  us. We've just had some new behind the scenes attempts at censoring. I'll be announcing that
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.160]  later in the week or next week. But we're all under attack because we're over the target.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:32.400]  And as that ad I played earlier said, we need to defend the Constitution here, all of us veterans,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:40.160]  Americans, anybody who loves liberty. But your idea is genius to force out the fact that 70 plus
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:46.720]  percent of the troops support Ron Paul and that there's a hoax covering that up. Because if that
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.720]  fact gets out there to the general public, they'll even see the media cover up to a greater extent.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.160]  And I want to get your take after the break too. Do you agree that clearly he's the front
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.920]  runner? If you look at all the polls and stuff, they're just cheating Ron Paul. We'll be right

[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:15.200]  Well I'm not the kind to kiss and tell but I've been seen with fairer I've never been with anything
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.960]  less than a nine so fine. All right what we're going to do is this is important I've linked to it
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.600]  in the last few days but I got Kurt Nemo doing a big article about this too with all the links
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:33.680]  to Adam Kokesh's website to the Facebook where it's being promoted and also to the video adherence
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.520]  to the oath that I think is the best Ron Paul had out there bar none put out by revolution pack.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.320]  You got to give Gary Franchi credit. I mean he's another example of people that take action don't
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.400]  in-fight and cover real issues can do. Most other people just get tied up in knots by
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:56.000]  Cass Sunstein cognitive dissonance type stuff look at him now producing better TV ads than the
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.040]  Ron Paul campaign is. You know really getting the truth out and having a big effect and that's
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:06.080]  why MSNBC and other trader groups other foreign groups not really traders they represent foreign
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.840]  banks I guess they're not traders they're just occupiers are freaking out about and demonizing
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:19.520]  him for. Adam overall what do you think about obviously the point I'm making that this is the
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.280]  Achilles heel here this hoax that the troops don't support Ron Paul when it's the opposite.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.040]  It's so important to put it in their face that Ron Paul is the choice of the troops and come out
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.760]  with the numbers that make it undeniable to show that. I mean I would challenge any other
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.680]  candidates to have a veterans organization to show this kind of support for them to host
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.520]  an event like this and turn out the numbers that we're going to turn out but that's why it's so
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:49.040]  critical Alex exactly because of what you just stated that this is the most inconvenient fact about
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.600]  Ron Paul to the establishment let's put that in their faces let's take the most difficult thing for
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.320]  them to accept and force them to acknowledge that this is what the troops are seeing and that this
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.920]  is what the troops want. Now when I first had this idea this vision I want to thank Nathan Cox
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:09.840]  the co-founder of Veterans for Ron Paul for helping me out with this event but when we put
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.480]  this idea together we thought if we just had a platoon sized element we just had 40 guys and
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.120]  gals in this march it would create the right visual it would work and we floated the idea around
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.280]  online a few different places and saw that the reaction in the Ron Paul community and the movement
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:29.360]  was just overwhelming. Now it's got to be huge. Yeah no we're good like my goal is you know it's
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.440]  the last week we've got well if you have a good formation up front that goes there a whole bunch
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.720]  of formations it'll be it'll really look good. Oh no well I'm like I said we got less than a week
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.440]  to go so it's really this critical crunch time right now and any help that people can give us
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.040]  getting the word out or donating to support the cause to help get some veterans that can't afford
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:53.440]  to travel we really appreciate it and the the place to do that is adamversesdemand.com slash
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:59.920]  vfrp veterans for Ron Paul but I'm pretty confident we're gonna have about 500 veterans there at least
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.280]  at this point we've got 1500 rcp on facebook we're getting a lot of emails from active duty guys
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.000]  saying well you know I can't quite put my name on this thing but I'll be there with my whole squad
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.920]  I mean it's really incredible yeah there should be a lot more than 500 you need to get all the
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.200]  motorcycle veterans groups that you know are usually worshiping whatever republicans around
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.120]  they need to get out there and support Ron Paul there needs to be a hundred thousand people but
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.400]  regardless it certainly illustrates the type of support Ron Paul has now shifting gears
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:34.400]  clearly now looking at all the evidence Ron Paul's the front runner they're stealing the election
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.440]  from him he doesn't want to look like a sore loser or a bad sport but finally he's coming out and
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.160]  saying they're going to contest main Adam what's your view you've been involved in congressional
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.920]  races and things what's your view of what's going on well it's you know I'm not surprised at all
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.320]  that this is happening and that they're cheating around the edges and doing what it takes I don't
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:01.680]  think it's the kind of widespread fraud because I saw this in you know I mean I don't mean to say
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.720]  that it's not having the full impact of what widespread fraud might be but just that it's
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:14.000]  it's not so necessary when you have a system that so favors the establishment in the very process
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.760]  of determining who's going to be the nominee and I saw this firsthand
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:24.400]  in Iowa watching polls there when I mean I actually made sure that one more vote was
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.240]  counter for Michelle Bachman when when when she was under tally at that event and that was that
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.920]  was the mistake and it was it was it was just amazing to see how easy it is to get these these
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.880]  mistakes and I mean I don't know if it's that republican establishment you know party hack
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.920]  volunteers don't know how to count I don't think that's always the case but that it's it's such a
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:53.760]  muddled process it's such an untransparent process it's a process where the really the whims
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.880]  of local party officials are a whole way more sway than they're supposed to or that we would hope
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:08.320]  they would and it's not just necessarily the fraud but even the the way that the system is set up
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.040]  to favor those in the establishment to be able to tilt the contest in there yeah the system itself
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.680]  has become twisted and gamed and and and tilted I want to do a few more minutes with you then
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.920]  I'm going to your calls folks and getting to that world government news that Obama's calling for but

[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:00.960]  well that's why it's so important to have an event like this the ron paul is the choice of
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.960]  the troops march to be able to create a way to reach out to guys on active duty because when it
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:10.080]  comes to that we have to ensure that they know that they're still human beings uh this is why
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.920]  the work of oath keepers is so important ensuring that they honor their oath rather than their
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.920]  illegal orders but alex if i may for just a minute i have one more important announcement
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.040]  about this event coming up because we have an incredible lineup for the after party of musicians

[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.800]  now but you're not going to have danzik there from the misfits no no no well what he's you know
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.520]  if you look at his politics it's a little scarier i'm much more excited to have someone who's woken
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.120]  up on our side it's it's it's awesome it's incredible what's happening and i wasn't making
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:21.760]  fun of that lead singer i was just acting trendy that i know who the original lead singer was
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:26.800]  see i'm trendy adam extremely trendy well well you know one of the things that i've
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.800]  realized is that a lot of these celebrities who are coming out and saying well i support ron paul
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.040]  here or there you know and and they're kind of anxious about it a lot of it's you know we can
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.720]  say things like well that you know they don't want to compromise their sales they're afraid of being
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:44.560]  political and and polarizing and alienating people but you know we saw kelly clarkson do a tweet for
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.000]  ron paul that spiked her sales through the roof and you know that's really incredible to see that
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.880]  we have a movement that is such an economic forces i'm sure you know with your your massive
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:00.880]  listening base but uh you know that that that that they're lacking the confidence a lot of them
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.840]  you know you and i take it for granted as people that are steeped with backgrounds and politics
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.400]  and current events that well yeah of course they should be coming out and advocating for ron paul
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.360]  and get you leveraging their celebrity and getting out and and talking to everybody they can and yada
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.600]  yada yada and everything we would we would hope and dream for them to do but a lot of them don't
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.400]  have the the confidence in the background to be able to say stand behind their beliefs and articulate
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.640]  them them clearly and one of the things i've learned is that as activists we can do a lot to
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:33.200]  help them out and and uh you know as as you as you know with with your your personal friendship
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.680]  with charlie sheen and that effort there you know i hope that's ongoing and that that he's able to do
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.080]  more for the cause but at least we've we've got these five incredible headliners coming out for
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.600]  this event on well i agree with you but people say well charlie sheen's got all this wall stuff in
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.320]  his background that isn't the point it brings massive attention to something and in the media
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.600]  that is key now now adam i want to get your perspective though on the iran situation sir i
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:00.400]  talked to ed asner speaking of celebrities yesterday and he was saying that he's talked to navy seals
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.480]  gave me their names and numbers and info that they're saying they're talking to current seals
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.840]  that there is a false flag staged air attack in the works to be blamed on iran i've done surprise
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.240]  me at all alex but you know i i have an offer for you if you're interested i'll let you respond
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:21.440]  off the air but i i'm trying to organize a trip to iran and i'd like to have an opportunity as
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:27.200]  as a journalist if you want to call me that to show the american people all of the shared humanity
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.280]  that we have with the people of iran and let them see what we stand to lose by not stopping this war
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.920]  from happening by not letting the globalists have their way and and convinces that to have another
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.000]  another war that's obviously not in the in the best interest of anybody involved except those
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.720]  that fund it from both sides so if that's of interest to you and you'd like to have a correspondent
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.840]  iran i'd love to uh i'd love to work with you but i do think it's very scary to see
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:59.280]  that this is just kind of plotting along that we've seen this since the bush years that all
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.400]  of these forces have been pushing us in this direction you know the cia pulled the rug out
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:10.320]  from underneath george bush uh the second when he was trying to get people riled up about iran
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.640]  and it's amazing to see that no matter how much truth you show it show people that they still
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.360]  fall for this war propaganda i mean why do they do war propaganda because it works and that's
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.560]  what's so sad about the human condition today but it's because of journalists like yourself
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.720]  that that we're able to fight back we're able to change that and i'm really i'm really hopeful
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.440]  you know i take the long view of human history and i see the power of the internet coming into play
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.800]  like never before i see the ability for people to tune into your show online to get info wars
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.640]  dot com and and everything that's so key there and to see the counterpoints to that propaganda so
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.000]  i'm like i'm very anxious and i want to be on the side of of the counter propaganda and i you
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.280]  know i'd really appreciate your help if you're interested in getting involved but being able
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:59.600]  to show that counter narrative being able to show that there's a there's a common humanity between
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.360]  the people of the united states and iran is is it's hard to deny it's hard to deny it's easy if
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:10.080]  you watch the mainstream media it's easy if you just you know like thomas jeverson said if you are
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.160]  a man who reads the newspapers and are less educated than someone who reads nothing at all
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:20.320]  if you just get that mainstream message it's really easy to forget that and and i agree and as you
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.640]  were saying though organization exactly but but as you were saying i mean the wages of this are
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.920]  enslavement they're going to use these new wars to clamp down on our freedoms even more i mean here
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:38.880]  is uh the foreign policy review clinton gave a speech yesterday saying we need a sod's consent
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:46.000]  to put troops in syria the un is now saying they may listen to the arab league and basically invade
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.840]  uh there's already special forces reportedly advising wahhabist al qaeda i mean what do you
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:57.920]  make of the admission that al qaeda real al qaeda has been given libya they're now being given areas
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:03.840]  of syria they've thrown their old dictator out a sod and put another military dictatorship in
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:12.000]  egypt i mean this is crazy to see al qaeda openly working for nato crazy i you're the last person i
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.680]  would expect to call that crazy considering your familiarity with the history of al qaeda alex that
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:22.480]  that you would be surprised that our government is making enemies deliberately setting them up
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:29.360]  and then saying whoops sorry about that our meddling led to more american enemies that we now
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.080]  have to create more wars to go in vanquish i mean come on you know i you know alex you know that
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:39.360]  this is this is all part of the setup and and uh i mean sure but i'm saying what's crazy to be clear
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:47.120]  is that and i'm glad you brought that out what is crazy adam is that they're openly using al qaeda
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.920]  working for the globalist yes i know they created them and they work for them while still saying
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:57.360]  tsa's got to grope your wife and daughter because of al qaeda and then now al qaeda who we knew worked
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:04.080]  for them openly works for them it's crazy how dumb they think we are yes that is what's crazy and
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:10.240]  that is that if that doesn't get you fired up if that doesn't make you want to repost this video if
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:14.640]  that doesn't make you want to bring another listener to alex jones if that doesn't make you want to
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:19.360]  wake somebody else up and pull them out of the mainstream media hypnosis i don't know what does
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:26.320]  when you see that that that you when you listen to that the result is dead when you tune out we
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:32.960]  can save lives simply in the act of tuning out simply in the act of accepting a different take on
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.480]  reality a more honest take on reality a direct take on reality that's not trying to deceive you into
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:44.640]  doing anything that supports this this globalism that we're seeing and so i i just like this this
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.480]  what what you're saying my only my only conclusion that i would throw back at you is
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.720]  you know you got you gotta listen to people like yourself you gotta listen to the alex jones so
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:58.080]  you gotta check out adam versus the man although i'm not doing the same thing exactly as alex
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.640]  you gotta make sure that you're unplugged from from that means all of us are helping to accelerate
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.160]  the awakening including our own awakenings adam we're going to be talking to you again on the

[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:28.560]  advisor calling for the global minimum tax the uh supports corporate tax reform that would
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:35.920]  reduce expenditures and loopholes lower rates for people investing and creating jobs in the us
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.440]  do so further for manufacturing and that we need to as we have the buffet rule in the individual
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:48.800]  tax reform we need a global minimum tax so that people have the assurance that that nobody is
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:55.920]  escaping doing their fair share as part of a race to the bottom or uh or having our tax code
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:03.680]  actually subsidize and facilitate people moving uh their funds to uh tax havens marlon stop right
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.280]  there we will we will say it goes on and on the full clips and info wars dot com get it out to
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:16.240]  everybody the globalist set up the system where the mega rich are exempt they set up the system
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:23.280]  for tax incentives to move jobs overseas they set up on record the entire system they're discussing
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.960]  and globalism which is the race to the bottom doesn't even build up china who is the bottom
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.320]  doesn't build up mexico who's close to the bottom it drives those wages down in the aggregate as well
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:41.120]  it's about a consolidation of power transferring out of the free market through crony inside deals
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:47.600]  into a corporate fascist managed agenda 21 sustainable global grid in their own words
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:54.160]  a post industrial world a post family world then they sick the social workers on you when
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:00.000]  you're out of work and take your kids this is the stated plan in their documents so they're
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.040]  now going to save you from the globalism they've created with a global authority to set global
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:11.680]  minimum taxes and raise taxes on the rich the problem is the ultra rich will still be exempt they
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.800]  means sick them on business owners millionaires people making a couple hundred thousand dollars a
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:21.760]  year that actually keep the economy going it's always the ultra rich sickening the government
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.160]  on their competition and that's what the buffet rule does that's what this global minimum tax
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.520]  they say in the oecd that's the model of this that was the group that the corporation that was set up

[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.960]  but you know last week the fda came out and said they want to start regulating sugar as if it's a
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.480]  poison but then they're going to let you have aspartame and misfine allay and melamine and
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:29.200]  fluoride all the real poisons now i'm not saying raw sugar is good for you a lot of it's obviously
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.720]  bad like i'm not going to drink this mexican coke that's absolutely delicious and i'm lusting after
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:42.400]  it right now the guys went to a local mexican barbecue chicken joint that's just awesome
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:47.920]  a million times better than some big chain that soaks their meat and msg and they always get
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:53.040]  these mexican cokes that taste like coke did when i was a kid but that's another example of people
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.440]  demanding quality and it displacing the corn syrup crud high fructose corn syrup many areas of
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:05.520]  austin now you can't even go in a convenience store and find the modern crud coke the mexican
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:13.040]  coke has displaced everything just like we voted with our dollars and demanded organic food the
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:21.760]  thing is about this mexican uh place we go to is it's barbecued char charcoal barbecued awesome
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:28.800]  no preservatives on it healthy taste a million times better than kentucky fried chicken soaked
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:34.720]  in msg that gives you a headache for a week or pop eyes or churches or whatever the case is
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:40.880]  and cost less for quality fresh food made now america used to have stuff like this
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:46.560]  just mexico's still old-fashioned in some respects so we have to go and get everything from mexico
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:52.320]  because they haven't gotten around to poisoning that culture completely yet when it comes to those
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:59.680]  areas we need to go back to americana back to what was good their hamburgers are good too but

[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:32.160]  and um i have more disrespect for those people that have been informed to the information but
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.320]  are afraid to speak out and people in the zombies have never even been exposed to it because they
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:41.440]  just don't know the information well i mean newsweek admitted that the hijackers were trained at
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:45.920]  us basis and i've interviewed the embassy heads that say they were ordered to protect them the
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.240]  underwear bomber was protected it's all hiding in plain view i'm not saying there aren't some muslim
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:58.480]  terrorists my point is is that they work for nato absolutely uh well personally done to try to
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:03.680]  awaken people which i call awakening pamphlets i have uh went online bought some refill monopoly
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:08.560]  money um pretty cheap and just put a little fly on the back of it asking people to please watch
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.680]  certain youtube movies such as uh loose change file cut 9 11 uh truth hollywood speaks out
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:19.040]  obama deception and uh just hand them out to people that i feel need to be awakened um i do
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:22.640]  frequently hand them out to police officers you know and i have a little conversation i'm like
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.200]  have you heard of uh this obama deception uh supposedly the guy that fired uh at the white
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.200]  house watched this so this kind of gets the spark in their head so maybe they're more likely to watch
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.920]  it and uh i think other people need to get active in such little things like this yeah when you
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:41.040]  approach military and police just say this is a really hot underground video uh with some
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:46.320]  really interesting stuff you know watch it and you know maybe if i see it this coffee shop again

[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:26.000]  what is front and center on your radar screen right now what what what's got you fired up what
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.440]  makes you leap out of bed at five a.m. in the morning turbo charging towards the coffee maker
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:38.560]  like i know you do to fight for liberty what's got you going wild uh first of all what is a
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:44.640]  psychotronic weapon that's what i want to know uh it's just electronic ultra low frequency high
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:50.720]  frequency different combinations uh that can make you sick make you happy make you aroused uh
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:56.560]  they've they've had it for more than 60 years uh different wavelengths that affect the brain chemistry
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:03.360]  yeah because i know they have those laser sound now or they can pinpoint an individual with a
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:09.040]  sound from a hundred yards away a half mile away from the middle ear yes uh yeah yeah that's that's
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:14.080]  a patent in the 40s yes they have that but now they're moving just to frequencies that are broadcast
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:19.280]  through the cell towers on record darpe admits this that can affect mood but details remain
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.920]  classified max kind of like the white house science arguments they're spraying stuff in the air but
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:30.720]  but the tails are classified max you don't need to know about that oh did you see that in the united
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:37.840]  kingdom that um somebody there was a case with the rough child's where um somebody called the rough
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:44.640]  child's a puppet master and the courts in the uk said this is not libelous that in fact the rough
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:49.600]  child's he can call them puppet master this was just broken in the uk press like two days ago you
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.960]  probably already covered it uh you know i didn't mention it but it was daily mail got sued by him
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.480]  and um the head roth child said i don't meet with oligarchs i don't control russian oligarchs
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:04.400]  even though as you know it'd come out that whenever they would bust an oligarch putinwood
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:09.600]  they would learn that the billions of dollars were really belong to the roth child and the guy was
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:15.680]  a front i mean i remember that in a bunch of news articles and so i know that the paper won the suit
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:23.440]  and has now found photos of him actually over in russia with them yeah so um stacey of course uh my
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:31.920]  my companion girlfriend and valentine day lover uh immediately said oh they're alex jones is right
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:40.000]  again i wish i wasn't right i wish you weren't right the ndaa all of it max well what do you make of
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:47.360]  that of him going i don't run anything i don't have any power look over there um well i tell you
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:52.960]  ask me what's what's on my mind these days i mean i think the mf global story is an important
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:15:02.240]  change a sea change it's it's the end of one era in the beginning of a new era the nobody nobody
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:10.400]  questions nobody doubts now that what happened was that a bank a bank in this case um jp morgan
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:17.520]  simply went into customers accounts and took over a billion dollars and this is i think that we have
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:24.000]  to understand now that the the the hope of reforming the banking system in some in some way is over
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.800]  you know that battle is now lost we lost that battle because uh there's no investigation there's no
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:38.480]  anything going on mf global is is the beginning of a new era these bankers can just reach in
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:44.640]  and take money without even anyone questioning it so i'm focusing now actually on copyright
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:50.720]  as in hollywood and the sopa and acta i'm going to focus less on banks and bank bank criminals
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:56.720]  because i i just think that's over now that we we lost there the mf global signifies the end
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:02.080]  of any hope of any reform it it signals divine right of international bankers instead of kings
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.400]  if they want to take your money and and and then get caught lying to congress they're going to do it
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:13.200]  here's the headline of the london telegraph nithaniel rothschild loses high court libel battle
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:19.360]  and it says uh nithaniel rothschild the billionaire financier has lost a high court libel action
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:25.040]  over a claim that he was the puppet master behind the deal involving lord mandelson
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:29.120]  and a russian oligarch and of course it all went to pot when he said he'd never met with
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:33.840]  these people and the photos and videos got released of them all in meetings in russia
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:43.600]  so uh so there you go so so that that now is can be the so-called conspiracy theory relating
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:50.640]  to that family is now a conspiracy fact uh and again uh you know the alex jones is always six
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.320]  months ahead of everybody else uh or two years ahead of everyone else but the uh so i think that
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:04.240]  the cop the sopa and acta battles uh can be won because with people like the anonymous on the
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:09.520]  web and others uh they're they're really winning battles you know with the sopa battle what would
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:14.240]  you do if you got a letter threatening to sue you from a major publisher saying you can no longer
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:20.960]  use the word dummies well you know facebook is trying to trademark the word face uh to give you
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:26.480]  an idea of how crazy this is getting yeah in fact news court didn't they sue skype because it has the
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:32.080]  word sky in it i mean now it's like pick a word out of another word i mean it's just reached
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:38.480]  cartoon level well they wanted to trademark fair and balanced and of course murdoch not only was he
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:45.040]  uh caught spying on people uh which is now a huge scandal but now there's another huge scandal and
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:52.080]  the murdoch press about police bribing so you know rupert murdoch who's the mainstream media not only
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:59.600]  is he a horrible uh lawbreaker but he's a horrible businessman you know he sold uh myspace he bought
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:06.160]  myspace for five hundred million dollars sold it for 34 million to a group of investors including
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:12.400]  some uh young musicians now it's signing up uh 40 000 people a day it's becoming a hit big hit
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:17.440]  again rupert murdoch is a horrible businessman but that's the kind of people who have incredible
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:21.920]  power because they use the power of the press the mainstream media to influence political outcomes
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:29.120]  you know tony blair was beholden to murdoch uh bill clinton and the bushes and obama's beholden
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:34.000]  to the mainstream media and they use copyright as leverage they use copyright as a weapon they use
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.400]  it as a way to control people and i think this is a battle that can be won uh because the hackers
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:46.480]  and the and the and the pirates and the anonymous group have always proven to be one step ahead
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:53.520]  and when they won the battle is one of course wicked idiot went dark for a day and suddenly
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:19:00.400]  people understood that there was an opposing force against this copyright legislation and they
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:05.280]  immediately backed out yeah but even the trademark rule doesn't mean that a journalist or someone
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.000]  can't i mean if you trademark the word titanic i could still write about the titanic they're even
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.360]  claiming you can't even say the word that's like when mcdonald's 15 years ago sued the mcdonald's
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:22.640]  family of scotland who's royal who owns a castle because they had a castle farm and a castle pub
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:29.600]  that for a thousand years plus had sold beer and cheese and they said you can't call it mcdonald's pub
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:37.600]  yeah or i just read that warner brothers is suing disney over the wizard of os because the book
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:43.120]  mentions red slippers and them does not and the movie does and they can't make a remake because
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:48.640]  it's and the book is on copyright and the movie is off and it just goes back and forth and they're
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:54.880]  using copyright as as you point out to control language in an insidious manner that's creeping
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:20:00.800]  into uh our our civil liberties in a in a way that's completely unconscionable we'll be back

[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:25.200]  where they say oh we're going to comply with this government or that if people are saying
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:32.880]  where speed traps are on twitter we're going to block them uh if people are criticizing the
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:37.120]  indonesian government we're going to ban them yeah we're going to google's going to take down
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:42.400]  our block videos that the u.s government says are critical of the government and now documents
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:46.800]  have come out that big sis to spy on the drudge report and others and uh you know to track people
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:51.520]  that are criticizing the government because that hurts their capability to protect us
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:54.960]  we've got to enslave you to protect you i want to get back into that max but
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:25:01.120]  in this short segment what does it signify because this was my concern if they can now
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:07.360]  say an mf global we're going to go ahead and keep your money yes it's illegal and yes we did lie
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:13.680]  and the head of the cf the chicago mercantile exchange cme comes out and says
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:21.520]  corezine lied uh he did order the money transferred obviously and the mainstream media acts like they
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.400]  don't know where it went even though forbes reported where it went month ago or months ago
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:31.600]  currently talked there's so many points i want to make and now they just get away with it what
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:40.960]  does that signify max it signifies the complete abrogation of the rule of law there there's
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:48.960]  simply no law at all and look anyone with a series seven brokers license what i had for
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:54.160]  many years when i was working on wall street is literally a license to steal now when i was
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:26:01.120]  working on wall street the manager would come around and say break any law you want we got lawyers
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:06.560]  as a matter of fact unless you had at least one client suing you you weren't considered to be
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:13.600]  showing enough initiative because the entire industry was set up that any complaints went to
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:19.840]  binding arbitration before a panel of brokers and bankers you do not go to a jury but that
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:27.440]  mentality has gone global and it's gone into a multi hundred billion dollar financial services
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:33.760]  industry that is now literally going into countries like Greece stealing hundreds of
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:40.400]  billions of dollars and walking away scott free and then getting the local government of course
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:49.280]  works for the banks to impose austerity measures as a way to pay off this multi decade of debt
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:56.080]  that they themselves had nothing to do to incur the greek people did not create 500 billion dollars
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:00.880]  of debt that debt was passed to them through their governments from foreign banks the same
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:05.520]  thing's happening in the u.s as you know the same thing happening all over the world but there's no
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:14.720]  absolutely no recourse there's no rule there's no uh no no body no jurisdiction that is making
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:22.720]  any case against any of these people who are engaged in outright theft i mean you have to i
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:29.600]  mean i i don't want to pull a nazi card because it's overly done but you have to really go back
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:36.400]  to the 1930s and and see what was done in germany to folks and it was all legal of course this is
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:41.600]  what you hear all the time alex from the mainstream media they come and obama says the same thing he
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:48.560]  says it's all legal what they did was all legal yes what hitler did was all legal to alex it was
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:56.160]  he passed the laws to make it legal to confiscate wealth and to put people into ghetto and to cremate
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:01.040]  them what's happening in greece right now is we're heading toward a financial holocaust and
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:07.040]  those people are going to end up with the same final solution and the bankers at davos will say
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:12.480]  well this is great because this is the deflation we need to offset the inflation of all our money
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:18.480]  money printing will offset our inflation by by incinerating a few thousand people or a million
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:26.720]  people it's the exact same mentality the exact same playbook it's happening again and there's
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.240]  nobody standing up to it and of course if in the case of let's say and you make this point all the
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:38.000]  time in the united states of course if it's not the super bowl one weekend or the academy awards
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:46.320]  the next weekend or you know mass sobbing over the death of whitney houston on on any given day
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:52.640]  there's no there's no space in the nightly news other than your news where their people are talking
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:59.840]  about the fact that there is a holocaust a financial holocaust happening in greece right now
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.880]  that's not discussed so that means that the people in the united states who don't talk about this i
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:13.200]  are by extension participating in it but they are ameliorated with the entertainment value and the
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:18.800]  ultra cheap food and the ultra cheap energy that's still available in the u.s and so then
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:23.280]  it's just not talked about but it's a as i said i i think we're in a new era now because there's
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:31.280]  absolutely no um no no no pushback at all against and that's my next question when we come back and
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:36.400]  then get into other news and go to calls max keiser what's coming next i mean if they can get away
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:42.880]  with anything sticking their hands down our pants stealing our bank accounts lying to congress

[02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:08.880]  how you like me now how you like
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:25.680]  all i know is that i've done some basic studying of history
[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:30.680]  And I've studied the
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:36.680]  corptocracy of kleptocrats that we have running things,
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:42.680]  and they are definitely clinically ill
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:45.680]  from a case of megalomaniacal hoodspot,
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:52.680]  megalomaniacal bravada, megalomaniacal craziness.
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:56.680]  I mean, look at Corzine, 40 to one bet, other people's money,
[02:33:56.680 --> 02:34:00.680]  lies before Congress, gets caught lying,
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:06.680]  and now the entire corporate media structure,
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:10.680]  the whole system is coming out and saying,
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:12.680]  we don't know where the money went,
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:19.680]  and as I pointed out three months ago, and this all started,
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:21.680]  it was in Forbes, it was in the Associated Press,
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:24.680]  that most of the money had been wired to London to J.P. Morgan.
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.680]  But then I guess J.P. Morgan said, hey, don't say it came to us,
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:30.680]  just say it's a mystery where it went,
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:33.680]  and so now everybody says we don't know where it went,
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:36.680]  and federal regulators are in the news, the financial news,
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:42.680]  every week saying, gee, we don't know where it is.
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:45.680]  Now, if you wire $1,000, there's a record of it.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:48.680]  You wire $10,000, there is a criminal investigation open
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:50.680]  called a Suspicious Transactions Report.
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.680]  It's a global rules, Homeland Security runs the whole thing
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:56.680]  worldwide, it's standardized, because the globalists want to know
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:00.680]  where money is going so they can steal it.
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:02.680]  They only shut down the drug dealers, they want to shut down,
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:05.680]  they only shut down the money launderers, they want to shut down.
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:08.680]  Goldman Sachs, all these people that are involved,
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:12.680]  taking over countries, they're conquerors, they're crooks,
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:14.680]  and that's what Max is talking about,
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.680]  and now they're playing along like they don't know where the money
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:20.680]  went when it's public where it went,
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:24.680]  and the so-called media is playing along.
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:27.680]  I mean, Max, that's what's really frightening here.
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:29.680]  It's not just that the globalists are thieves,
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:33.680]  it's that just like Caligula or Hitler or anybody,
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:37.680]  they get so arrogant they start going wild
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:39.680]  and always bring themselves down,
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:43.680]  but generally they bring tens of millions down with them.
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:46.680]  You know, Democide in the 20th century, Max,
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:49.680]  killed more people than anything else,
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.680]  and it's an academic term, well-known in academia,
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:54.680]  but not ever on the news.
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:56.680]  Of course, that's death by government.
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:36:00.680]  They killed 264 million people last century, conservatively, Max,
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.680]  not counting warfare, not counting troop casualties.
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:10.680]  With this type of insanity at this level, what's coming next?
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.680]  Just to be clear, again, the significance of the MF Global story,
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:18.680]  and my experience as a stockbroker on Wall Street for many years,
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:22.680]  there was a barrier called segregated accounts
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:27.680]  that no lunatic who even was bent all the rules
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:32.680]  or broke all the rules, you would never go into a segregated customer account.
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:38.680]  It's heavily coded as such within the system and steal money.
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:42.680]  I mean, of all the crimes that we did, we did forgery all the time,
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:46.680]  we did all kinds of criminal behavior.
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:48.680]  I mean, every single stop, by definition,
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:52.680]  if you have your Series 7 license, you are a criminal.
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:55.680]  That's pretty much the business model of Wall Street,
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:58.680]  and I've told you some of the tricks that we used to use,
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:01.680]  look-back trades and other things we used to use
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:03.680]  to just print money all day long.
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:05.680]  But when you go into the segregated account
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:08.680]  and just steal from a customer like that,
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:14.680]  that's a whole nother dimension to this history of bank collapse
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:18.680]  and criminality that we've seen when the Lehman Brothers collapsed
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:21.680]  and the big tarp bailout that Hank Paulson engineered
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:24.680]  by threatening Congress with martial law.
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:26.680]  I mean, this is a new chapter,
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:28.680]  and it literally means that people's bank accounts
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:31.680]  and their brokerage accounts are not safe
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:35.680]  from the meddling fingers of somebody
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:38.680]  who simply can reach in there and steal their money.
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:42.680]  And this is something that is just a new chapter.
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:46.680]  So anybody who had an escape plan,
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:49.680]  and I noticed I just saw a story on Reuters and I sent you the link,
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:53.680]  the number of people who are renouncing their US citizenship
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:56.680]  in the last 12 months has skyrocketed.
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:59.680]  People are getting out of the US,
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:02.680]  and they are renouncing their citizenship,
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:04.680]  and they're getting out of the United States.
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:06.680]  They don't trust the United States.
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:09.680]  Anyone with any means at all is leaving.
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:12.680]  The embassies are chock-a-block.
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:15.680]  They're stuffed with people trying to get to their exit interviews
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:17.680]  because in order to renounce your citizenship,
[02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:19.680]  you have to go into the embassy
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:23.680]  or an affiliated institutional branch,
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:25.680]  and you have to go through an exit interview
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:27.680]  and they then give you a certificate
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.680]  which formally you have renounced your citizenship,
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:32.680]  and from that moment forward,
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:35.680]  the US is no longer has claim to you.
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:38.680]  But the number of people at embassies around the world
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:39.680]  are waiting to do this.
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:41.680]  They can't handle the volume.
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:44.680]  Anyone who's really got anything to protect
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:48.680]  realizes that when, for example, they shut down Switzerland, why?
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:52.680]  Because those American banks wanted to get into the money laundering business.
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:55.680]  The American banks wanted to get into the secret bank account business.
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:58.680]  It's not that Switzerland was closed down
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:00.680]  as a place to launder money or hide money.
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:01.680]  No.
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:04.680]  The United States and Wall Street banks wanted that business for themselves.
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:07.680]  Well, more than that, Max, as you know, they admit,
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:10.680]  and I was just playing a clip earlier about this global government they want,
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:13.680]  to get all the little guys' money.
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:16.680]  Somebody who put 20 million in over 30 years,
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:18.680]  that sounds like a lot to most people.
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:21.680]  That's nothing to a globalist who's stolen tens of billions.
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:23.680]  They want to rob all the little guys,
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:26.680]  and you notice when they have gone after Swiss banks,
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:29.680]  it's always, you know, for two, three, five, ten million dollars.
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:31.680]  It's always just setting that precedent,
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:36.680]  but expanding on that, Max, and looking at this,
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:39.680]  I ran into some of the family,
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:42.680]  and after I met them and talked to them,
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:43.680]  I went and looked them up.
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:46.680]  It really was them, of John Wayne's kids,
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:49.680]  some of John Wayne's children, a famous actor.
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:53.680]  And they were leaving the United States
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:55.680]  and selling everything they had.
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:59.680]  They had a ranch outside Austin,
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:01.680]  and that was two years ago.
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:04.680]  They've now left the United States to Costa Rica,
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:06.680]  and I asked them why, and they said,
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:09.680]  because the government's going to raise taxes and rob everybody,
[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:12.680]  then it's changing the rules and all the money's leaving.
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:16.680]  And I've talked to a lady who is worth over three billion dollars,
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:19.680]  owned one of the biggest defense contractor companies,
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:20.680]  one of the richest women in the world.
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:21.680]  I'm going to just leave it at that.
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.680]  I probably already said who it is with that information.
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.680]  And she left the country four years ago
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:27.680]  and said the United States will not exist,
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:29.680]  and you're going to be huge
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:31.680]  because everything you're saying is going to come true,
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:35.680]  and if you live, you're going to be the biggest thing in media out there.
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.680]  And I said, why?
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:38.680]  And she said, because you're 100% on target.
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:40.680]  And then I went and looked her up, and it was her.
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:44.680]  So, but see, that's not like, oh, great, I've been right.
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.680]  It's horrible news, Max.
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:49.680]  The money is running like they're scared to death.
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.680]  What are they scared of?
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:55.680]  Well, you know, first of all, it's not about taxes or raising taxes.
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.680]  It's more about what you see at the TSA now.
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:05.680]  We get reports all the time about TSA agents just stealing money
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:08.680]  and shaking people down basically and stealing property.
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:11.680]  And this is now becoming endemic throughout the U.S.
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:14.680]  in every tier right up to the level of J.P. Morgan.
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:16.680]  You know, Jamie Dimon who runs J.P. Morgan
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:18.680]  stealing money from MF global clients.
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:22.680]  And by the way, that number I just saw a report was raised out to another,
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.680]  raised again to 1.6 billion that they say that they can't find.
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:31.680]  You know, it's an incredible economy where Walmart can tell you
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:35.680]  where a razor blade they sold three years ago is in a landfill somewhere
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:37.680]  with some RFID tag.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:42.680]  But the major bank on Wall Street has misplaced 1.6 billion dollars.
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:45.680]  I mean, that's an amazing admission in this day and age
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:49.680]  where everything is known by everyone on the corporation front
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:50.680]  and on Wall Street.
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:53.680]  But you've got right up from the top to Jamie Dimon's of the world
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:56.680]  right down to the TSA agent, they simply now steal.
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:58.680]  Stealing has become legitimate.
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:01.680]  You know, I've said since I've been coming on your show
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:05.680]  that the closest antecedent to what's happening in the U.S.
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:08.680]  has got to be Argentina 2000, 2001.
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:12.680]  And there's a brilliant 12-part series on YouTube, a documentary,
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:19.680]  where they show the rich loading up trucks, armored vehicles
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:22.680]  and driving the money out of Buenos Aires,
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:26.680]  leaving the people with nothing but pots and pans.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:28.680]  And if you look what's happening in Greece,
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:30.680]  this is exactly what just happened in Greece.
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:35.680]  Those people had 400 billion dollars of their GDP stolen.
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:38.680]  They're sitting there with pots and pans now.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:39.680]  They've got nothing.
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:41.680]  And it's not even their debt again,
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:43.680]  and they admit the megabanks that did it,
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:46.680]  that infiltrated their government,
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:48.680]  are now tanking over the country
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:50.680]  and they're not going to be able to vote anymore.
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:53.680]  Well, look, in Argentina, that was the template.
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:57.680]  The debt was from Citibank that the Argentinian government
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:59.680]  nationalized, and they passed the law.
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:00.680]  And, of course, it's all illegal.
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:01.680]  This is what you always hear.
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:03.680]  It's completely legal.
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:05.680]  They nationalized all this foreign debt,
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:07.680]  and then they forced it onto the people
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:08.680]  in the terms of austerity.
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:09.680]  Same thing in Greece.
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:11.680]  Same thing in all of these situations
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:15.680]  where you find the IMF and the other Troika members
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:19.680]  meddling around involved in these massive scams.
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:22.680]  And the U.S., of course, now what you see it happening
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:25.680]  with the TSA agent is a perfect metaphor
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:27.680]  for what's happening throughout the entire economy
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:30.680]  right up to the CEO's office of the biggest banks in America.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:33.680]  They simply steal your money.
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:39.680]  They're not doing some leveraged derivatives trade
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:43.680]  as a way to move risk from one balance sheet to another
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:45.680]  as keeping liquidity or making a market.
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:47.680]  No, none of that is happening.
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:48.680]  They're just stealing.
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:51.680]  And this has gone to the point where people now
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:55.680]  are renouncing their U.S. citizenship in record numbers.
[02:43:55.680 --> 02:43:57.680]  Since they started tracking this,
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:59.680]  the number has never been higher.
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:01.680]  It's up 200% or 300% from last year.
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:04.680]  And the lines and embassies around the world
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:08.680]  to renounce U.S. citizenship are growing every single day.
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:11.680]  How bad is it going to get?
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:14.680]  Well, I mean, in the U.S.,
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.680]  the U.S. is in a very interesting position
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:20.680]  because it has been the chief beneficiary
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:23.680]  of these banking scandals for decades.
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:26.680]  And what I mean by that is that in the U.S.,
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:29.680]  the price of energy and food is still,
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:31.680]  compared to other countries, very cheap.
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:35.680]  So somebody making $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:37.680]  can actually have a reasonable life
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:40.680]  because the lifestyle even,
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:43.680]  because the cost of energy and food,
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:45.680]  as compared with these other countries,
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:47.680]  is still relatively cheap
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:49.680]  because the U.S. has the reserve currency
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:52.680]  and because so much of the U.S. economy is subsidized.
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:54.680]  You know, when the Republicans say they hate big government,
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:56.680]  that is a big joke
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:59.680]  because the economy of the U.S. is nothing but
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:02.680]  underwritten and subsidized by big government.
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:05.680]  The agriculture industry, you talked about the Mexican Coca-Cola
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:07.680]  being sweeter than the American Coca-Cola
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:09.680]  and the high-fructose corn syrup.
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:13.680]  That's because corn is subsidized by big government
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:16.680]  to the point where the price of corn is so cheap
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:19.680]  that they injected into food into America
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.680]  and 60% of every calorie you take in in the United States
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:26.680]  is from high-frequency, high- and high-fructose corn syrup
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:29.680]  because of the underwriting that comes from the government.
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:32.680]  They just come in and lobby the corporations and the food makers
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:35.680]  to put it in there, basically giving it to them
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:37.680]  and it's the same thing with fluoride in the water, everything.
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:40.680]  Special interests come in and make you do this.
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:44.680]  The price of food ends up being extraordinarily cheap.
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:47.680]  It's horrible for you and you end up having to take supplements
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:50.680]  to survive, but the basic food at the fast food joint
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:52.680]  is incredibly cheap. Same thing for energy.
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:57.680]  Oil prices do not reflect the world market
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:00.680]  because America's, it got wars going on all over the world.
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:03.680]  The biggest buyer of gasoline is the Pentagon.
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:08.680]  They spend $230 million a day on gas.
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:11.680]  To gas up all those vehicles for the Pentagon,
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:14.680]  to go into all these countries and just kill-shoot people
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.680]  indiscriminately because, for fun, $230 million a day
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:21.680]  they spend on gas.
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:25.680]  Now to keep that flowing, they've got relationships with Saudi Arabia,
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:29.680]  which of course, then you open up that whole mid-East quandary
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:32.680]  and you see how the propaganda comes out
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:35.680]  and how we're targeting Iran and why Syria is bad,
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:40.680]  but Bayran is good and you end up in this incredible-
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.680]  Let me raise that for you and then go to Colesmax because
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:48.680]  that's the next issue I wanted to raise with you here today.
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:53.680]  Why is the establishment so arrogant
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:56.680]  that they're openly putting al-Qaeda in charge in the areas of Syria
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:00.680]  they've invaded, al-Qaeda in charge of Libya,
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:03.680]  al-Qaeda now being put in everywhere,
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:05.680]  and the media admitting that the U.S. and Israel
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:07.680]  are using al-Qaeda terror groups.
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:10.680]  That was in NBC News a few nights ago.
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:12.680]  Like, it's a good thing.
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:14.680]  Like, I've got to have a potbellied pervert
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.680]  grab my genitals and try to grope my children at the airport
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:22.680]  and go after my wife because terrorists are everywhere, al-Qaeda,
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:25.680]  but al-Qaeda openly works for the government.
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:29.680]  But then I'm bad to say 9-11's an inside job.
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:32.680]  Well, al-Qaeda worked for the government, you know,
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:34.680]  to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:37.680]  Bin Laden was on the, you know, working for the U.S.
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.680]  and then he wasn't working for the U.S.
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:41.680]  and now al-Qaeda is working for the U.S.
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:45.680]  and the history of the U.S. foreign policy is like this.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:46.680]  They flip and swap.
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:48.680]  There's no ideology behind it.
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:53.680]  It's simply an empire out there trying to get secure resources
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:55.680]  for the cheapest possible price.
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:58.680]  That's the whole methodology to it.
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:47:59.680]  There is no ideology.
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:02.680]  There is no democracy building.
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:04.680]  None of that happens.
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:06.680]  You know, they've got drones destroying schools.
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:08.680]  They're not out there building schools.
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:12.680]  They're just out there securing oil because the price of oil in the U.S.,
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:18.680]  even at $4 or $4.50 a gallon, is incredibly cheap compared to Europe.
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:23.680]  You know, it's $12, $13, $14 a gallon now to buy gas in Paris
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.680]  because France doesn't have the Pentagon going around the world
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:29.680]  blowing people up for their oil reserves.
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:33.680]  So I'm saying, America, this is what makes America very interesting,
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  is that even though they're getting screwed horribly,
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.680]  the average person still has cheap food, cheap gas.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:44.680]  They have a reasonably comfortable life,
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:47.680]  even at this late stage of the game.
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:49.680]  So the U.S. is not motivated,
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:52.680]  even though you can tell them how bad things are,
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:54.680]  the average person is still not feeling it.
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:58.680]  And this is what the guardians of this empire in Washington know.
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:02.680]  The guys, the neocons, the rumsfells, the chainies,
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:06.680]  they know that their job is to just get resources as cheaply as possible
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:10.680]  and to take the flak, to take all the jibes and the sarcasm
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:12.680]  and to be portrayed as bad guys.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:16.680]  But they believe that they're doing the job of keeping the masses
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:21.680]  in cheap oil and cheap food, and they've done a job doing that.
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:25.680]  Now, unfortunately, in what you're saying, what I'm saying,
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:29.680]  what Gerald Salente is saying and what other people are saying,
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.680]  is that there reaches a point where there is...
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:35.680]  it can't sustain, it's unsustainable.
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:42.680]  And that shift when suddenly the debt bomb that has blown up Greece
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:46.680]  and blown up other countries finally blows up the U.S. economy
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:49.680]  and prices double and triple overnight,
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:54.680]  the very top, those people who orchestrated this whole campaign,
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:55.680]  they're going to be gone.
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:56.680]  They're not going to be in the United States.
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:57.680]  They're going to be living elsewhere.
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:49:58.680]  And there's the answer.
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:49:59.680]  There's the answer.
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:01.680]  We're going to do a few more segments of calls after the break.
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:02.680]  But you're right.
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:06.680]  That's why the rich are leaving is because when they finally implode the U.S.,
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:08.680]  they're going to totally implode it.
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:11.680]  And you're just going to leave us behind with a bunch of militarized police
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:13.680]  and TSA running around.
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:16.680]  And boy, I wouldn't want their jobs because you're going to have
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:19.680]  400 million guns and a bunch of angry people.
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:22.680]  It's going to be a mess, Max.
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:24.680]  Well, yeah.
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:27.680]  I mean, I believe that the timing is, you know,
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:29.680]  that all the signs are there,
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:33.680]  but I can also can understand why people are not motivated
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:39.680]  to get up and do anything right now because they still have a reasonable lifestyle
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:44.680]  and they still feel that the risk of losing their reasonable comfort level
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:46.680]  is not worth risking.
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:49.680]  They just don't know that by letting the New World Order come in,
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:52.680]  they're ensuring their destruction, but they'll find out soon enough.
[02:50:52.680 --> 02:51:21.680]  Call straight ahead with Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com.

[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:24.680]  Folks, if you go to infowords.com, you can see our big article up there concerning Navy SEAL sources.
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:26.680]  They say the false flag is in the offing.
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:29.680]  That is big news, and they say warn people before it happens,
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:31.680]  because there's one thing these bankers love to pull.
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:33.680]  That's a war to grab even more power.
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:38.680]  Let's take a few calls in this short segment in the next with Max Kaiser, our guest.
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:43.680]  Val in Montana, you're on the air with both of us. Welcome.
[02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:49.680]  Thank you. Go ahead.
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:54.680]  Yeah, your phone doesn't sound too understandable, but go ahead.
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:59.680]  I have a pretty bad connection out here. I'm in a pretty remote area.
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:01.680]  Sorry about that. Can you hear me better now?
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:06.680]  Yeah, it sounds like it's not the connection. It's the telephone. You're on a hands-free.
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:13.680]  Okay, well, I just wanted to talk about the, well, the sewer main media.
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:16.680]  Oh, that's a good name for them. Sewer main media.
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:22.680]  Yeah, it's my term in the endearment for them, among others.
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:31.680]  To pay homage to Solante every now and then, I'll refer to them as a Mustang ranch.
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:35.680]  The prestitute media, the chicken ranch.
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:38.680]  Yeah, yeah, I heard you call that.
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:44.680]  I want to talk about, I want to ask you guys, if you know Rush Wimbau,
[02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:51.680]  well enough to tell me why he was, you know, because Max was talking about
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:57.680]  different ways of getting people to really move this thing in the other direction,
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:04.680]  and real vocal people like yourself and others have made so much progress.
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:08.680]  Here we have Rush Wimbau, who will go so far, and he could just,
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:12.680]  he could tip this thing over on the tipping point.
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:16.680]  He could move this thing the other way, with Ron Paul and so forth.
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:21.680]  What is he doing? How can he go so far?
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:25.680]  Well, I mean, they're in there to be steam valves and control people,
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:28.680]  and that's why the system has put him forward.
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:30.680]  There's a lot of people with more talent than Rush Wimbau,
[02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:36.680]  but he's put up there as the big king daddy because he'll play along with the establishment system.
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:43.680]  I mean, that's very, very easy answer, and the sewer stream media.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:45.680]  I appreciate your call. That's a good question.
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:49.680]  Max, where do you see the sewer stream media going?
[02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:57.680]  Well, I mean, this is an interesting question because Rush Wimbau and Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage,
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:02.680]  these guys are what I call the shock right, the right wing on the shock.
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:05.680]  I know, I don't want to get into a whole discussion about right versus left.
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:09.680]  I just wanted for the purposes of making this point, let me digress.
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:12.680]  Okay, he is on the shock right.
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:17.680]  There is nobody in America who's on the shock left.
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:24.680]  There is on MSNBC. You've got Rachel Maddow. She's a centrist.
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:28.680]  You've got Amy Goodman, a democracy now. She's in the center.
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:35.680]  Tom Hartman, who's on RT, he's also a biggest so-called progressive radio host in America.
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:38.680]  I don't even think he's on the left either. He's a centrist.
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:41.680]  There is no left. There is no shock left.
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:49.680]  Imagine if Max Kaiser had a three hour every morning talk show on a major network in America.
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:52.680]  Number one, Rush Wimbau's ratings would collapse.
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:58:01.680]  Number two, all heck would break loose because suddenly you've got both a shock right and a shock left.
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:02.680]  There's no balance.
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:06.680]  But Max, I wouldn't call you left. I don't even go off those terms.
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:09.680]  They've tried to put up the young turd guy.
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:12.680]  I don't want to digress into this whole right-left business,
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:17.680]  but in the case of the radio landscape in America,
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:27.680]  you've got your show, which is completely independent, and you've cobbled together this massive audience by dint of sheer brute strength.
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:32.680]  You've just gone outside of the mainstream and yet you've got this huge audience.
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:37.680]  But other than that, it's a wasteland. There is no opposing voices.
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:39.680]  No, you're right. You're right. Stay there.
[02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:45.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:54.680 --> 02:59:59.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:06.680]  When your country is being turned into a 21st century Banana Republic police state.
[03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:10.680]  Silence isn't golden. It's yellow.
[03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:15.680]  You are listening to Alex Jones Broadcasting Live from the front lines.
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:20.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:24.680]  You know, Max, we should have you back up next week if you could do it.
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:30.680]  You just have a media discussion.
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:33.680]  But I was just looking at the Rothschilds on Wikipedia.
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:37.680]  Hundreds of palaces, castles, more than the royal family of England,
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:41.680]  just owning giant combines all over the world,
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:44.680]  major stock in every major central bank,
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:48.680]  unknown trillions in overall aggregate wealth,
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:52.680]  and they'll sue a newspaper for saying he's a puppet master
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:55.680]  and manipulating Russian oligarchs.
[03:00:55.680 --> 03:00:58.680]  I mean, it just shows how they try to use the courts now against people,
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:01.680]  but thank God the courts ruled against them.
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:04.680]  It's just, it's super creepy, Max.
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:07.680]  Well, first of all, you know, I want to ask,
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:12.680]  is there something I should read into the fact that you're having me on your show on Valentine's Day?
[03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:17.680]  I mean, I know you like me and I like you, but I don't know if I like you like that.
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:21.680]  Okay, Max, I just want to say, I told him about a week ago, I said,
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:24.680]  I want to get Max Kaiser on and they set you up today.
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:27.680]  And so, yeah, that's what's going on.
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:31.680]  Was that intentional that somebody set him up on Valentine's Day?
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:34.680]  Oh, it's so sweet. I didn't know he thought of me like that.
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:40.680]  Well, Max, I have to be honest, I didn't ever even think of such a thing until now.
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:43.680]  But next to you, you've entered that into my mind.
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:48.680]  And here I am just, you know, enjoying a nice glass of tangy tangerine,
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:50.680]  having a fantastic talk.
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:58.680]  Now, anyway, so the Rothschilds are, in fact, they have, you know, that scene in, you know,
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:04.680]  in the good movie reference is in the movie The Sting, where the criminal is on the golf course.
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:07.680]  And he says, I want you to go break that guy's legs.
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:10.680]  And he says, gee, boss, he's just a low level grifter.
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:13.680]  And he goes, well, you know, if we let a low level grifter get away, you know,
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:15.680]  someday they'll be coming after us.
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:18.680]  We got to be, you know, take care of this.
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:22.680]  This is the way they think. If there's any challenge at all, in any sense,
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:28.680]  they will go after you with the full force of everything they have to put you down.
[03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:37.680]  Because they don't want a single scintilla of dissent to any way to challenge their monopoly pricing,
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:43.680]  rent seeking, empire building, kleptocracy.
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:47.680]  Well, you're right. And they want a global government with carbon taxes to shut everybody down
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:50.680]  while ignoring all the real problems in the environment.
[03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:55.680]  Why are the elites allowing all this GMO stuff that's destroying the Earth's original biosphere
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:57.680]  and endangering everything?
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.680]  And why do the elites allow the military to detonate hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere?
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:05.680]  I mean, it's like they're trying to destroy the planet or something.
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:11.680]  Well, Monsanto, of course, the big ad, big, big seller of genetically modified seeds,
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:16.680]  the business model is quite remarkable because they figured out that you could trade seeds
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:21.680]  with a currency. In this case, the Monsanto terminator seeds that don't reproduce.
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:25.680]  So you have to buy those seeds continuously every single year,
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:28.680]  and you have to borrow money to buy those seeds.
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:32.680]  This is why the exact number I don't have in my fingertips,
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:36.680]  but something like 2,000 Indian farmers a month commit suicide
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:42.680]  because Monsanto has priced agriculture so far out of reach of the average Indian farmer
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:47.680]  that they simply kill themselves, and they approach agriculture the way Jamie Dimon
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:51.680]  and JP Morgan approach the credit markets or approach the finance market.
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:53.680]  They fill it with derivatives.
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:59.680]  They completely overextended with massive financialization of something called agriculture,
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:03.680]  and then they subject the people who are supposed to be using this product,
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.680]  farmers, to owner as debt loads to the point where they're indentured servants
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:11.680]  or they kill themselves, and quite frankly, they don't care.
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:14.680]  Monsanto, of course, has a track record of this type of behavior,
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:17.680]  going back to the Agent Orange in the Vietnam War
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:20.680]  and all kinds of other transgressions that the company's been guilty of,
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:23.680]  that makes an extraordinary amount of money.
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:26.680]  The board of directors is full of the same guys and the board of directors
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:29.680]  for Hal Burton or Exxon or any of these other major corporations
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:33.680]  who are part of the Pentagon or part of the Wall Street Banking establishment,
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:36.680]  and they all swap notes and they go to Davos.
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:40.680]  And of course, remember last year at Davos, they floated the idea of recapitalizing
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:44.680]  the whole economy with $100 trillion worth of fresh debt.
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:46.680]  But you'll all go to them and they'll pose as our saviors.
[03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:49.680]  Sorry to some of the other callers. Didn't get to you.
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:52.680]  Max, great job. Thank you for joining us in chronicling
[03:04:52.680 --> 03:04:55.680]  our spiraling descent into the New World Order.
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:57.680]  The answer is, Shane Knowler of the New World Order.
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:05:11.680]  See you back tonight at 7 o'clock.
