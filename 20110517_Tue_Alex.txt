[01:41.480 --> 01:47.480]  article in a paragraph or two of it for posterity to prove that it did happen in
[01:47.480 --> 01:53.000]  case they remove it but we need to point out that a week ago Pakistan said
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.040]  any US aircraft now helicopters coming in over their airspace will be fired
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.000]  upon and there's two different reports either the US helicopters open up first
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.440]  or the Pakistani military opened up first but this is how World War three
[02:09.440 --> 02:18.480]  starts this is a nuclear power with mutual aid packed with China and these
[02:18.480 --> 02:22.920]  people do not play games okay the Pakistanis do not play games Americans

[08:27.520 --> 08:35.000]  NATO helicopter attacks Pakistani army post Bloomberg headline Pakistan troops
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.720]  NATO helicopters clash at border what's the back story on this more than 1000
[08:41.720 --> 08:51.200]  drones are operating run by the army and the CIA each group has over 500
[08:51.640 --> 08:56.320]  operating in Pakistan bombing and killing whoever they want and we could
[08:56.320 --> 09:02.560]  pull up the headlines anybody can NATO and US now targeting no-name terrorists
[09:02.560 --> 09:09.120]  they just see you with a gun in Pakistan running around in the woods and they
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.240]  kill you and they bomb weddings they'll kill hundreds of people to quote get one
[09:14.240 --> 09:18.800]  terrorist and they say that's good collateral damage and this is designed
[09:18.800 --> 09:24.240]  to destabilize Pakistan Pakistan has been run by Western back dictators for a
[09:24.240 --> 09:27.920]  long time been as our Buddha got into office didn't go along with it even though
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.320]  she was former MI 6 and they of course killed her when she went public and said
[09:33.320 --> 09:41.080]  that bin Laden had been killed and that our government was staging events major
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.640]  Pakistani newspapers in the last two days are reporting that the West is
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.000]  running al Qaeda inside the country and is planning to blame it on the Pakistani
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.720]  government they cite the US CIA agent caught trying to give chemical
[09:53.720 --> 09:58.240]  biological and radiological weapons to their Taliban front groups to be again
[09:58.240 --> 10:04.040]  blamed on Pakistan that's a big part of this bin Laden raid domestically it's
[10:04.040 --> 10:07.640]  about setting up a bigger police state putting out new terror alerts kicking
[10:07.640 --> 10:13.680]  off Obama's reelection campaign opposing as our savior but internationally
[10:13.680 --> 10:19.000]  it's about moving towards the excuse to attack Pakistan and say oh look they
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.200]  were protecting someone bin Laden and there's now no doubt that that is where
[10:24.200 --> 10:30.080]  this is headed with the nuclear power extremely extremely dangerous news now
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.440]  remember on May 5th just a week and a half ago Pakistan Army warns us not to
[10:36.440 --> 10:40.640]  stage more raids and then a few days later their prime minister came out and
[10:40.640 --> 10:46.520]  said that if more helicopters came in unauthorized that they would be resisted
[10:46.520 --> 10:54.560]  and so those reports are there for anyone that would like to read them and
[10:54.560 --> 11:01.480]  the saber rattling is now intensifying and moving into actual violence this is
[11:01.480 --> 11:06.560]  the Associated Press headline NATO helicopter attacks Pakistani Army
[11:06.560 --> 11:17.080]  post this is how wars start my friends and it says Der is mail Khan Pakistan AP
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.360]  a NATO helicopter attack a Pakistani Army post or the Afghan border today
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.760]  injuring two soldiers and further increasing tensions following the US
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.960]  raid that killed Osama bin Laden Pakistani officials said and the
[11:30.960 --> 11:34.880]  Germans did this for about six months before they went ahead and attacked
[11:34.880 --> 11:38.720]  Poland is they would have these skirmishes and fire on people and then
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.000]  finally they just stage an attack on the German base at Gliwitz and then they
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.200]  had newsreels out saying how dare the Poland attack us and they again dressed
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.320]  up some concentration camp victims in German and Polish uniforms shot them
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.320]  shot newsreel footage of it and that's all declassified known record and it was
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.640]  how World War two started with the invasion of Poland and that that's
[12:04.640 --> 12:07.880]  exactly what NATO and the people that have hijacked our country these big
[12:07.880 --> 12:14.240]  foreign banks are doing moving towards and remember Cheney later got leaked
[12:14.240 --> 12:20.640]  and then declassified did orchestrate with the dictator minion the dictator
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.320]  elect with those staged elections in Georgia the sneak attack on Russian
[12:25.320 --> 12:30.760]  held South Ossetia in Abkhazia and the Russians responded by invading to
[12:30.760 --> 12:35.520]  repulse the attack and then rolled nuclear weapons in and and their
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.680]  chairman joint chiefs went on television and said we're preparing to use
[12:38.680 --> 12:42.720]  nuclear weapons on NATO if the NATO aircraft landing with NATO troops did
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.000]  not pull out and the United States and NATO and Israel was also involved
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.080]  blinked and pulled the troops out immediately again ladies and gentlemen
[12:51.080 --> 12:56.560]  the globalists are very crazy I mean they're powerful they're intelligent
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.080]  they're smart they they've but at the same time they're nuts that they're
[13:01.080 --> 13:06.280]  crazed like Dominic Strauss-Kahn I mean you can believe one story is fake but
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.840]  two three four five now prestigious reporters saying he goes wild like a
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.480]  chimpanzee starts ripping clothes off this is standard procedure for these
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.440]  people by the way the con news is coming up it does look like that he's been
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.040]  protected all these years and the protection has been removed the it's
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.880]  pointing towards the fact that it looks like he's probably guilty but this is
[13:28.880 --> 13:36.120]  a setup the AP the Daily Mail all the big French papers are reporting that top
[13:36.120 --> 13:42.160]  spin doctors that worked for Sarkozy and one of his aides had Twittered the
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.160]  arrest before it even happened and that's been confirmed you see that's kind
[13:46.160 --> 13:53.400]  of like with Kennedy in New Zealand Australia and Thailand before Lee Harvey
[13:53.400 --> 13:57.720]  Oswald was even apprehended and before his name was released they did print that
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.360]  Lee Harvey Oswald had shot Kennedy within just an hour or so that was back
[14:03.360 --> 14:06.680]  during the days when we didn't have internet and major cities around the
[14:06.680 --> 14:11.000]  world had sometimes 10 15 newspapers per city and they had special editions that
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.440]  would come out and so they reported within an hour or so of Kennedy being
[14:15.440 --> 14:19.600]  killed that it was Lee Harvey Oswald and he wasn't he was being arrested right
[14:19.600 --> 14:27.960]  around that time being picked up so we're not sure if it was right after or
[14:27.960 --> 14:33.520]  right before the point is he was coming out of the theater and that's on record
[14:33.520 --> 14:43.720]  it's it's it's like building seven where CNN one hour before but Aaron Brown
[14:43.720 --> 14:46.600]  lived in New York he goes building seven the Solemn Brothers building has
[14:46.600 --> 14:49.960]  been fallen into its own footprint he looks behind him he goes at least that's
[14:49.960 --> 14:55.040]  the report we're getting but BBC didn't really know New York as well so BBC 24
[14:55.040 --> 15:00.440]  this is all on record this is in terror storm we cover it all history government
[15:00.440 --> 15:09.440]  sponsored terror BBC 24 and BBC World in the same minute read the same
[15:09.440 --> 15:12.920]  teleprompter message that the Solomon Brothers building seven had fallen into
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.560]  its own footprint from fires with the building right behind the reporters in
[15:17.560 --> 15:22.720]  both newscast and BBC first came out for a year and said that that video wasn't
[15:22.720 --> 15:28.440]  real which was asinine on two different channels released by the BBC archive
[15:28.440 --> 15:32.000]  then they put out a TV special and admitted yes it was our footage and
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.320]  Reuters and I predicted that because Reuters is their main internal feed had
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.800]  given them an internal feed that building seven had fallen into its own
[15:39.800 --> 15:43.760]  footprint from fires and the whole official story ladies and gentlemen this
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.520]  is the evidence of the setup how did two one top aide and then Sarkozy's top
[15:49.520 --> 15:56.960]  spin doctor as he's described his Carl Rove his David Gergen how did his David
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.800]  Gergen his Carl Rove put this out before he was even arrested we now learn
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.480]  they said he's been picked up he's been arrested and it turns out that was as the
[16:05.480 --> 16:08.880]  police were about to get to the airport I mean this is within 30 minutes of this
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.760]  going on this is unbelievable no news they knew and now they're saying well we
[16:13.760 --> 16:20.640]  had informants in the hotel I bet you did I bet you had informants in a New
[16:20.640 --> 16:26.840]  York hotel before it's on the news this is happening and again we've got all
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.440]  those articles linked on prisonplanet.com that is coming up doesn't mean
[16:30.440 --> 16:39.320]  Khan is innocent but the you know these guys order hookers like regular folks
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.680]  go to the refrigerator and pour a glass of milk I would say as often as normal
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.320]  people order a pizza but most folks only order a pizza every two weeks it's been
[16:47.320 --> 16:53.440]  said that prostitutes in DC are as ubiquitous as water fountains and that's
[16:53.440 --> 16:58.600]  what rich men in this country do I mean if you go to Georgetown in DC and eat
[16:58.600 --> 17:02.480]  at a decent restaurant there is the cream of American beauties there and
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.480]  they're going out and getting in limos with Secret Service there to be try to
[17:05.480 --> 17:08.280]  walk out and film it they will get in your face in a minute the Secret
[17:08.280 --> 17:11.600]  Service is mainly there for the top people in government to protect the
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.440]  prostitutes and make sure the media I mean I mean we've got footage of them
[17:15.440 --> 17:23.960]  disgorging prostitutes at the Watergate and Secret Service runs over we've got
[17:23.960 --> 17:28.000]  that footage and starts screaming out of saying you turn those cameras off right
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.200]  now you're not gonna film this and they put the cameras down and in went the
[17:32.200 --> 17:36.040]  hookers and whole floors of the Watergate have the gambling have the
[17:36.040 --> 17:42.320]  prostitutes I mean it's it's like Valhalla for these men there in DC but
[17:42.320 --> 17:50.320]  how did I get off into a story about prostitutes I forget where that was I
[17:50.320 --> 17:57.120]  forget where that was going it's it's it's it's just that we have a very very
[17:57.120 --> 18:06.960]  corrupt system and now we have oh I was talking about Khan and I'm gonna break
[18:06.960 --> 18:12.160]  that down at the 33 after but in the next segment I'm gonna get into this
[18:12.160 --> 18:16.560]  NATO helicopter attacks the Pakistani Army post near the Afghan border today
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.960]  injuring two soldiers and further increasing tensions following the US

[23:59.840 --> 24:19.760]  well it's a big big deal to have NATO helicopters according to AP open fire
[24:19.760 --> 24:28.280]  on another Pakistani emplacement and to continue to enter Pakistani airspace
[24:28.280 --> 24:38.040]  this is being done to prod the Pakistanis into doing something stupid it's
[24:38.040 --> 24:43.080]  very very simple and it's very very dangerous NATO coalition spokesman
[24:43.080 --> 24:47.640]  Lieutenant Colonel John Durand confirmed there were helicopters flying near the
[24:47.640 --> 24:51.280]  Pakistan border Tuesday that there was an incident the Alliance was
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.120]  investigating he said a Western military officials of the incident started
[24:55.120 --> 24:58.960]  before dawn when a NATO base in Afghanistan received intermittent direct
[24:58.960 --> 25:03.680]  and indirect fire from a Pakistan side of the border two helicopters flew into
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.720]  the area to provide support one of which fired across the border after twice
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.400]  receiving fire from the Pakistani side said the official speaking of addition
[25:12.400 --> 25:16.880]  anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue the Pakistani army said in
[25:16.880 --> 25:20.600]  a statement that its troops fired on the helicopter after entered Pakistan airspace
[25:20.600 --> 25:24.320]  in the early hours of the morning two of its troops were injured when the
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.600]  helicopter returned fire it said the attack took place in Datal Kel area of
[25:29.600 --> 25:35.640]  north Waziristan tribal region the area is known for a sanctuary for Taliban and
[25:35.640 --> 25:43.120]  al-Qaeda militants and has been targeted repeatedly by US drone airstrikes NATO
[25:43.120 --> 25:46.160]  saying they're still trying to determine if they crossed the border if the
[25:46.160 --> 25:49.560]  helicopter did I wonder if they crossed the border a few weeks ago with a hole
[25:49.560 --> 25:54.360]  with some of bin Laden fabled and I noticed we've got a report up at prison
[25:54.360 --> 25:59.680]  planet dot com where they're now adding a satellite dish to the top of bin
[25:59.680 --> 26:09.920]  Laden's compound and then shooting new photos of that so that they can hype it
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.440]  up and claim that that's how he was commanding the worldwide al-Qaeda forces
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.520]  satellite dish added to bin Laden compound after dubious videos released
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.640]  by the White House and the satellite dish wasn't there before but now they've
[26:24.640 --> 26:32.480]  gone and gone and added one to play along with that entire delusional
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.560]  situation this is a guy with no internet no nothing they first told us
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.960]  running all these attacks and he's got a million plus pages of documents but they
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.480]  killing instead of grabbing the greatest intelligence asset ever but more and
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.480]  more mainstream news articles come out that was one of the current last night
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.000]  pointing out that wow we went around the college it's a college in his paper
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  and most the people we talked to didn't believe the official story I mean no one
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.120]  that I talked to believes it people say why they throw the body in the ocean
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.000]  what why they kill him if he didn't resist why they changed the story so much
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.920]  why they put out the fake White House situation room photos it just goes on
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.560]  and on some of the other news I'm going to attempt to cover when we come back
[27:26.560 --> 27:34.400]  from break is really the huge news that's out US outlines global plan for
[27:34.400 --> 27:39.360]  cyberspace you see it's a global plan with all the major Western governments
[27:39.360 --> 27:44.960]  and governments that are financed with foreign aid with us and European tax
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.440]  money and when they're given the foreign aid they then have to agree to let x y
[27:49.440 --> 27:55.480]  and z corporation come in to adopt certain unified systems so there's a
[27:55.480 --> 28:03.200]  global standardized kill switch in fact I saw a CNN headline yesterday
[28:03.200 --> 28:08.600]  corporations install kill switches in fact you guys put me that CNN headline up
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.800]  I want to give the exact headline I know it's in the link to it's in the tech
[28:12.800 --> 28:20.800]  section also of info wars.com or as it in the police state section and it's
[28:20.800 --> 28:28.640]  it's it's it's media mainstream media admitting that there's kill switches
[28:28.640 --> 28:33.960]  being put in there's the headline why gadget makers wield a kill switch and so
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.120]  because myself and others have been exposing this now the tech sites the
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.880]  tech areas of CNN are having to come out and say yeah this is why they do it and
[28:42.880 --> 28:46.600]  they give all these excuses in fact I'm going to cover some of that later please
[28:46.600 --> 28:50.180]  print that or pull it out of the earlier stack that's important but but but there
[28:50.180 --> 28:54.720]  it is a kill switch now here's the Associated Press US outlines global plan
[28:54.720 --> 29:01.280]  for cyberspace and all the new devices already have it the satellite
[29:01.280 --> 29:07.280]  triangulation systems off the cell towers the location systems the back
[29:07.280 --> 29:11.720]  doors to dial in all the major software has back doors built-in so governments
[29:11.720 --> 29:15.720]  and private corporations most intelligence is now gathered by private
[29:15.720 --> 29:20.680]  corporations who can just get away with literal murder and lie and cheat and
[29:20.680 --> 29:24.160]  steal and make up whatever they want to then get government contracts that's
[29:24.160 --> 29:28.620]  what this is all about but they're now announcing this global takeover of the
[29:28.620 --> 29:33.960]  web with kill switches which are really dual takeover switches and we have this

[32:58.600 --> 33:19.320]  Alex you can run on for a long time run on for a long time general hami gul
[33:19.320 --> 33:22.920]  has retired Pakistani army general known for heading the inter-service
[33:22.920 --> 33:27.840]  intelligence the premier Pakistani intelligence agency after the soviet
[33:27.840 --> 33:32.680]  and during the soviet afghan war hami gul served as director general
[33:32.680 --> 33:37.200]  pakistan's inter-services intelligence from 87 89 mainly in the time of
[33:37.200 --> 33:39.760]  minors arbuta was prime minister of pakistan he was instrumental in the
[33:39.760 --> 33:44.680]  anti-soviet support of the mujahideen in the afghanistan war 79 to 89 he of
[33:44.680 --> 33:51.960]  course was involved in several of the big conflicts with india as a infantry
[33:51.960 --> 33:56.880]  commander and I wanted to get him on because even yahoo ran with the headline
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.840]  yesterday that the head of pakistani intelligence currently has now come out
[34:01.840 --> 34:06.480]  and said the west is creating fake taliban al qaeda trying to give them
[34:06.480 --> 34:10.120]  chemical biological radiological weapons to then frame pakistan so what
[34:10.120 --> 34:14.760]  general hami gul said a few weeks ago here on air is now being said by the
[34:14.760 --> 34:18.560]  government itself and we have the other news that i just covered nato
[34:18.560 --> 34:23.840]  helicopter attacks pakistani army post associated press pakistani military says
[34:23.840 --> 34:30.200]  the helicopters came across the border they opened up on them but it's also
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.480]  been reported that the u.s. helicopters may have fired first claiming they were
[34:34.480 --> 34:39.480]  being fired at from across the border and that to pakistani army soldiers were
[34:39.480 --> 34:45.920]  injured and pakistan says is of serious escalation general gul like what you
[34:45.920 --> 34:50.800]  talked about a few weeks ago is beginning to unfold yes indeed alex i
[34:50.800 --> 34:55.600]  think things are getting worse now because i think the american generals
[34:55.600 --> 35:02.640]  are showing an aptitude for brinkmanship and they want to trash president
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.280]  ovarma's plan to withdraw if he does it wish to withdraw i think the american
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.480]  people are overwhelmingly now looking at panistan a lost cause and that they
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.960]  should not spend even a bullet or a single life we've lost there but
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.840]  unfortunately the generals and their backers there in the congress as well
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.520]  as in the media they they want to press on and they want to open another front
[35:27.520 --> 35:31.880]  towards pakistan i don't know this is a very critical time for the american
[35:31.880 --> 35:38.960]  policymakers now we know that these very good aliban pakistan is being sponsored
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.760]  from across the durand line from afghanistan where raw the indian
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.400]  intelligence and of course mothard is also in collusion with them
[35:48.400 --> 35:53.360]  and under the umbrella of the cia they are creating problems for pakistan
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.000]  they want to create build a case against pakistan that it is a failing state
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.280]  and that a failing state which is under threat of
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.320]  increasingly the taliban ingress and therefore it must not possess the
[36:06.320 --> 36:10.400]  nuclear weapons now this is something which is
[36:10.400 --> 36:14.320]  going to be very dangerous because it could be very easily if they
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.480]  try to play games with pakistan and let's say they actually come in for our
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.600]  nuclear assets then it is going to trigger the third
[36:21.600 --> 36:24.800]  world war i'm afraid i don't wish to go into detail
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.360]  of this but i can tell you that it will ignite an inferno
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.080]  which will consume the entire region and may even trigger a third world war like
[36:34.080 --> 36:37.840]  i said so this is the height of brinkmanship and
[36:37.840 --> 36:40.400]  it is very unfair to the american people
[36:40.400 --> 36:44.720]  who want this money 135 billion dollars a year in afghanistan
[36:44.720 --> 36:50.640]  they wanted to redress their imbalances in their economic system
[36:50.640 --> 36:54.720]  and they are indebted to the tune of about 14
[36:54.720 --> 36:59.920]  and a half trillion dollars so it's very unfair to the people of
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.480]  afghanistan people of pakistan and most of all to the people of america
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.920]  the way they are proceeding about the whole thing general gul for new radio
[37:09.920 --> 37:13.520]  listeners that just joined us it is now in the wall street
[37:13.520 --> 37:16.720]  journal new york times la times that the core
[37:16.720 --> 37:22.080]  group launching attacks on qaddafi and financed by british and us intelligence
[37:22.080 --> 37:28.960]  cia commandos and mi6 commandos is al-qaeda our agents trained in the
[37:28.960 --> 37:31.920]  united states the leader of the rebels for two decades
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.560]  here is yahoo news and the nation magazine
[37:36.560 --> 37:40.160]  even the nation's own reports cia's fake taliban
[37:40.160 --> 37:43.600]  wreaking uh wrecking pakistan terror havoc
[37:43.600 --> 37:47.200]  here's yahoo news cia has created own taliban
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.320]  to wreak havoc terror havoc on pakistan claims pakistan paper
[37:52.320 --> 37:57.280]  and then when i read these articles it's got uh the head of the pakistani
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.680]  intelligence uh coming out now uh and previously i hadn't heard these
[38:01.680 --> 38:05.360]  type of uh i mean incredible statements we already
[38:05.360 --> 38:09.520]  knew the truth it's hidden in plain view and they caught the cia guy now
[38:09.520 --> 38:12.320]  they're reporting with chemical biological and radiological
[38:12.320 --> 38:16.160]  trying to get it to their al-qaeda double agent cia people
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.400]  but it now it appears to be 100 clear i'm getting chills talking about it
[38:20.400 --> 38:22.880]  they're getting ready to try to frame pakistan
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.120]  and launch some type of military attack on you and the whole fake bin laden
[38:27.120 --> 38:30.160]  situation uh the killing of bin laden a few weeks ago
[38:30.160 --> 38:33.760]  is another way to try to frame pakistan what do you make of
[38:33.760 --> 38:36.880]  your government now coming out and being more public
[38:36.880 --> 38:42.480]  and uh seconding what you have said yes i've been saying that all along alexa
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.840]  and i on your shows also i've been mentioning this
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.680]  but now i think the democratic government in pakistan has come
[38:49.680 --> 38:52.400]  fully on the back of the military institutions
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.120]  it has passed a resolution and if it must be read carefully
[38:57.120 --> 39:01.600]  because america values democracy and it is the representative house
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.480]  which has passed a unanimous resolution and it should not be taken lightly that
[39:06.480 --> 39:10.240]  pakistan is a pushover pakistan is a very important country very
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.720]  large country and people of pakistan are really angered and enraged against their
[39:14.720 --> 39:17.280]  own institution that they are not doing anything
[39:17.280 --> 39:23.920]  so i think this shirad must end now this playing along of the military and the
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.720]  isi along with the c is all dirty tricks it has to come to an end and i think
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.040]  people of pakistan are going to take account of all these things
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.200]  and you may find that uh america line of supply
[39:37.200 --> 39:41.120]  may be cut off like it was done in the past for 10 days
[39:41.120 --> 39:44.800]  one of the roots only one of the roots there are two roots which enter
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.560]  afghanistan and only one of the roots was blocked for 10 days
[39:48.560 --> 39:52.800]  and they came because they ran out of the toilet papers and the mineral water
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.400]  and all the others it's not going to be easy i don't know why
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.200]  these generals they are making such huge mistakes they are being very impetuous
[40:01.200 --> 40:06.000]  about this this administration president obama's
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.240]  administration is showing enormous weakness they have got to take a stand
[40:10.240 --> 40:14.320]  against their uh generals who are adventurous and they want to
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.480]  now go in for pakistan it will be a disastrous thing to happen
[40:18.480 --> 40:22.240]  general goal to be clear um and and correct me if i'm wrong i'm reading this
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.080]  from us papers but pakistan did pass a resolution
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.120]  and your prime minister has said that if helicopters come in
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.960]  with another raid they're going to basically be shot down
[40:32.960 --> 40:37.280]  uh if that happens then i would imagine that we know the pentagon
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.080]  is basically trying to start a war uh with pakistan and we have this latest
[40:42.080 --> 40:49.120]  incursion firing on the military base uh can can you briefly expand on that and
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.880]  uh do you have intel the uh basically to expand on
[40:54.880 --> 41:00.080]  your statement that us generals are trying to continue the wars and trying to
[41:00.080 --> 41:03.840]  basically flee forward and force obama to continue the wars
[41:03.840 --> 41:09.600]  by uh trying to stir up trouble exactly they are provoking this conflict
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.000]  unfortunately they want to expand and open another front they have open front
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.080]  in libya and they have gone into it all the al-qaeda
[41:18.080 --> 41:21.760]  members as you were just mentioning who were fighting in iraq now they are
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.000]  congregating in libya so what is this paradox on the one hand
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.440]  you are hunting for al-qaeda on the other hand you are supporting al-qaeda
[41:29.440 --> 41:32.640]  this is a very strange policy which is being pursued
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.920]  same for pakistan now pakistan has to be treated either as enemy or friend
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.920]  now this is a strange situation a very ambivalent situation
[41:41.920 --> 41:45.600]  where pakistan is being described now as
[41:45.600 --> 41:51.280]  enemy i mean friend as well as enemy now this can't last very long i think we
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.640]  are a nation of 180 million people we are a nuclear power and i can assure you
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.280]  that if they have any designs against our nuclear efforts then they will be
[42:01.280 --> 42:07.040]  making a very huge miscalculation they must not play this dangerous game
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.960]  so these generals are out of the control they are
[42:10.960 --> 42:16.720]  training on the leash to be to be launched against pakistan
[42:16.720 --> 42:21.200]  and this this is not going to work i can assure you this will be a very
[42:21.200 --> 42:24.640]  great historic disservice to the people of america
[42:24.640 --> 42:28.960]  well sir uh just a few final questions in the minutes we have left with you
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.880]  the 2008 report that was leaked to roiders
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.600]  where the bush administration had the plan floated by them by micristal
[42:37.600 --> 42:44.720]  uh to launch commando raids on the nuclear launch sites
[42:44.720 --> 42:48.960]  and a nuclear weapons program of pakistan and
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.800]  i mean they've got to know that those forces would be destroyed
[42:52.800 --> 42:56.880]  they've got to know that's impossible so that would be a sacrificial gambit
[42:56.880 --> 43:03.520]  with a pawn to have pakistan crush that pawn and then
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.760]  say we must avenge our troops i mean they i mean micristal
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.320]  was not insane and uh
[43:12.320 --> 43:16.880]  patreus is not insane they have to know that pakistan has a giant heavily
[43:16.880 --> 43:20.640]  trained military and that those nuclear bases
[43:20.640 --> 43:25.360]  are heavily guarded and that would be a suicide mission
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.080]  i mean is this what they're trying to gear up for
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.800]  or or how else are they planning to try to start world war three
[43:32.800 --> 43:35.760]  well if they try to come in they will have to attack
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.360]  almost hundred places in pakistan not at once
[43:39.360 --> 43:42.560]  because pakistan's nuclear assets are spread out
[43:42.560 --> 43:46.800]  we are we have always been suspicious of america's design
[43:46.800 --> 43:52.240]  against our nuclear assets and therefore uh we have taken good care of it and
[43:52.240 --> 43:57.600]  our command control system is very good if they have gotten encouraged
[43:57.600 --> 44:02.640]  because of their raid on abetabad on so-called osama's compound
[44:02.640 --> 44:07.040]  and they think that they can repeat it against our nuclear weapons also
[44:07.040 --> 44:11.840]  i think there could be nothing more headbrain than this particular idea
[44:11.840 --> 44:15.360]  the sooner they disabuse themselves of this notion
[44:15.360 --> 44:21.120]  the better it is for all of us well they're openly floating for now three
[44:21.120 --> 44:26.080]  years special forces attacks on giant pakistani military bases
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.400]  i mean you guys have gone to war with india fighting a much larger force and
[44:30.400 --> 44:32.880]  basically beat them and backed them off i mean
[44:32.880 --> 44:36.560]  they're really asking for this is insane clearly they know it's going to fail
[44:36.560 --> 44:40.000]  do you agree with me that that could be a plan to then say we must avenge the
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.680]  american soldiers that died on the raids because we know they're not gonna
[44:43.680 --> 44:46.480]  they're not going to succeed i mean if they go in it's as soon as trying to go
[44:46.480 --> 44:51.200]  into heavily fortified bunker military bases with helicopters
[44:51.200 --> 44:54.960]  not only that not only that they will not succeed and they will
[44:54.960 --> 45:00.320]  suffer a lot of casualties but after that withdrawal from afghanistan will become
[45:00.320 --> 45:04.480]  virtually impossible there is no gulf of tonkin
[45:04.480 --> 45:07.920]  adjoining afghanistan where they could ferry their
[45:07.920 --> 45:12.080]  troops by helicopters to the waiting ships in the gulf of tonkin
[45:12.080 --> 45:16.320]  here they will have to go through pakistan and what will happen then
[45:16.320 --> 45:20.080]  is anybody's guess and i can assure you we will
[45:20.080 --> 45:25.280]  come full throttle as far as the american withdrawal is concerned and
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.800]  this is will become an impossibility so they better not harbor these ideas
[45:30.800 --> 45:34.240]  they have to withdraw they have to provide relief to their own people
[45:34.240 --> 45:40.160]  they are suffering because of economic deficit and shortfall
[45:40.160 --> 45:44.080]  they have to take care of the health problems
[45:44.080 --> 45:47.600]  the health care etc we know the problem that the america is suffering
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.800]  so why now open another front i don't know what
[45:50.800 --> 45:54.880]  what has gone wrong i think there is some very very dark impulse
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.120]  which is driving them to this madness well yes they want to open this up as a
[45:59.120 --> 46:02.160]  front to i guess entice china and a lot of our
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.360]  inside sources say the insane elite that run our system
[46:05.360 --> 46:08.960]  are contemplating having a nuclear war with russia and china right now
[46:08.960 --> 46:12.560]  and that they just plan to trigger the whole thing in pakistan that's what a
[46:12.560 --> 46:14.960]  lot of our high-level sources are saying general gul
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.840]  in closing you talked to a lot of the pakistani elite
[46:17.840 --> 46:21.120]  you're a three-star general retired former head of pakistani intelligence
[46:21.120 --> 46:24.160]  highly respected you're all over international tv not just
[46:24.160 --> 46:27.920]  pakistan television what are the pakistani elite saying because
[46:27.920 --> 46:31.600]  from what i've seen that this is getting them out of the ambivalent
[46:31.600 --> 46:34.880]  you know trying to work with the west and bending over backwards
[46:34.880 --> 46:38.960]  understanding that you better get on a war footing and it seems to be hardening
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.200]  pakistan ahead of what's coming i mean is that an
[46:43.200 --> 46:46.880]  incorrect summation and do you see any way out of this
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.880]  no i think they have got to it depends on the political decision that
[46:50.880 --> 46:54.480]  president obama has to take and i think he should take this decision
[46:54.480 --> 46:57.760]  before or around first of june so that his troops start
[46:57.760 --> 47:01.680]  withdrawing as he had promised so starting from first of july
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.320]  so that their families can celebrate the return of their troops on 4th of july
[47:06.320 --> 47:10.320]  which is your national day so i think this should this ought to be
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.320]  the concern of president obama not the other way around that you get more
[47:14.320 --> 47:17.680]  engaged and go into deeper and deeper morse
[47:17.680 --> 47:23.120]  now pakistan is naturally of course the mood is very belligerent in pakistan
[47:23.120 --> 47:26.560]  we think that we have been terribly betrayed we have been betrayed in the
[47:26.560 --> 47:29.760]  past but not to the extent that we have been betrayed now
[47:29.760 --> 47:33.760]  we have suffered hugely on account of this phony war
[47:33.760 --> 47:38.080]  against terrorism and pakistan is now getting
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.400]  closer and closer to china and to russia this is the first time that pakistan has
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.000]  reached out to mosco this is amazing now because
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.560]  it is the doing of americans because part country like pakistan who's been such
[47:50.560 --> 47:55.200]  a staunch ally and who's done so much of service to american
[47:55.200 --> 48:00.320]  being in the place where they are now and if we are pushed into the lap of russia
[48:00.320 --> 48:06.160]  and china wholly i mean we go whole hog to this camp
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.240]  then this is going to be a very major upset for the american strategy
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.000]  it's almost like someone wants to destroy america i mean looking at this
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.840]  from a geopolitical uh...
[48:17.840 --> 48:21.360]  purview and and and studying all the different angles and and different
[48:21.360 --> 48:26.480]  permutations uh... it it it's horrible for the west it's horrible
[48:26.480 --> 48:30.000]  uh... for freedom it's it's it's it endangers
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.200]  uh... the entire planet and the stratagem is clearly
[48:33.200 --> 48:38.160]  during this global depression to try to launch at least a major regional war
[48:38.160 --> 48:41.520]  general hami gul thank you so much for spending time with us
[48:41.520 --> 48:45.920]  and adding your uh... considerable gravitas and acumen
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.440]  uh... to our overall uh... analysis thank you general
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.280]  thank you sir thank you so much all right there goes general hami gul folks the
[48:53.280 --> 48:56.640]  globalist already tried to start world war three with the russians
[48:56.640 --> 48:59.920]  and cooler heads prevailed when the russians rolled nukes in
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.760]  uh... in georgia and uh... somebody told cheney knock it off and they pulled the
[49:03.760 --> 49:08.720]  nato troops out again i'm an american
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.800]  but they they the globalist want to position us in this primitive
[49:12.800 --> 49:16.960]  simple minded one-dimensional thinking of well if you're for america let's have
[49:16.960 --> 49:20.880]  nuclear war with china and russia woohoo
[49:20.880 --> 49:25.360]  and and and let's get them pakistanis pakistan's been our ally folks i mean
[49:25.360 --> 49:28.640]  this is insane and they've got al-qaeda brigades all
[49:28.640 --> 49:32.240]  running over to libya openly run by the criminals that run our government
[49:32.240 --> 49:34.880]  our government has been taken over by globalist
[49:34.880 --> 49:38.720]  who want to destroy america who want to destroy our economy
[49:38.720 --> 49:44.480]  and who want to get us into wars while they finance our destruction and then
[49:44.480 --> 49:47.440]  they end up on top sitting over in europe and i told you this for years
[49:47.440 --> 49:50.800]  because in the thirties we got some of the numbers on the fellow reserve and
[49:50.800 --> 49:54.640]  haven't gotten them since uh... but you can also go separately study the
[49:54.640 --> 49:57.920]  fellow reserve us members and then who really owns them
[49:57.920 --> 50:00.960]  and i told you most of it more than seventy percent is what
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.080]  many of our experts have broken down ron paul and others
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.680]  he's owned by european banks i'm not bashing people in france or germany
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.160]  or england it's not about them it's about the the parasitic
[50:12.160 --> 50:15.360]  bank system that runs them runs us and then
[50:15.360 --> 50:18.800]  you know i mean the global bankers put hitler into power financed him
[50:18.800 --> 50:23.360]  financed stalin set that whole thing up that's part historical record
[50:23.360 --> 50:26.240]  go did hitler told him he'd have support in vating
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.240]  the king of england was pro hitler that's why they had to root off his fly

[55:11.440 --> 55:15.440]  alright here's what i'm gonna do
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.440]  i have absolutely got to take phone calls i want to take phone calls
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.440]  but we've got Naomi
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.440]  friends on all the huge economic developments former Goldman Sachs managing director
[55:27.440 --> 55:31.440]  joining us huge developments on that front
[55:31.440 --> 55:35.440]  i've got the Dominique Strauss con situation the fact that they are
[55:35.440 --> 55:39.440]  normally a globalist can rape whoever they want kill people
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.440]  and the police won't press charges especially in new york city i mean that's a new world order
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.440]  central the feds can blow up buildings and say they blow them up
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.440]  and follow orders and say yes sir
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.440]  we're gonna say bin Laden did that
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.440]  this is definitely and that's what the french almost to a person they're saying in their polls
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.440]  believe it's a setup because he was set to beat Nicholas Sarkozy
[56:03.440 --> 56:07.440]  notice Strauss con is the socialist leader a big banker
[56:07.440 --> 56:11.440]  3,000 a night hotel rooms they even know they had those
[56:11.440 --> 56:15.440]  every british french airways aircraft had to keep a
[56:15.440 --> 56:19.440]  seat open for him
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.440]  by the way you know us tax money goes the imf
[56:23.440 --> 56:27.440]  a lot of the bailout money went there
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.440]  so the Dominique Strauss con can have 3,000
[56:31.440 --> 56:35.440]  a night hotel rooms but that's only the beginning these people have created
[56:35.440 --> 56:39.440]  over a thousand trillion in derivatives
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.440]  we're gonna be going over that and we've got
[56:43.440 --> 56:47.440]  this really well spoken sovereign citizen
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.440]  you could call him publisher the Annie Scheister magazine great
[56:51.440 --> 56:55.440]  work for decades they did a really scary demonization piece
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.440]  as you know many of you two nights ago on 60 minutes where they
[56:59.440 --> 57:03.440]  basically tell cops if somebody is for the bill of rights and constitution they want to murder you
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.440]  and they're your enemy so we need to wage war against them it's the main
[57:07.440 --> 57:11.440]  lining of people that know their rights and aren't slaves
[57:11.440 --> 57:15.440]  they know to the TSA stick in their hands down their pants or who are against the income
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.440]  tax which you didn't have until 1913 that you're a terrorist so that's all
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.440]  coming up and just again I scan over the
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.440]  news I read it and then I don't get to a lot of it sometimes because it's also shocking
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.440]  I've spent most of the hour just on the incredible situation with Pakistan
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.440]  but I do have a big stack of news dealing with the police state
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.440]  that really illustrates where we're at just some of the police state from today
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.440]  every day I see stuff 10 years ago that would have been
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.440]  freaked everybody out this is how we're being conditioned but before I go to break
[57:47.440 --> 57:51.440]  and come back and start getting into all this news I want to just
[57:51.440 --> 57:55.440]  remind all of our great listeners that we have a lot of wonderful

[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:38.440]  There is a key article up on infowars.com. It's red linked. It's titled,
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.440]  Globalist Secret Weapon Exposed, Tech Kill Chips.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:51.440]  You know, we're getting four or five million views a week just on one of our YouTube channels.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.440]  And we've got at least seven others, many of which are ours.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.440]  They're fan auxiliaries, so I'm not even counting that up.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.440]  And that's good news for everybody. I mean, just on YouTube.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.440]  Because we're on AM and FM, XM, satellite, all that stuff.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.440]  Globals for 800,000 watts, reaching millions of people every day.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.440]  But YouTube, every week, we've got videos of the top video in their section,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:22.440]  sometimes top video period, that are getting 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,000 views.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.440]  And that is very exciting.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:32.440]  It is very exciting. And much of what we have at PrisonPlanet.tv has then moved over to that
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.440]  because it's a general public service to try to get this information out.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.440]  You do, of course, with the PrisonPlanet.tv membership, get the live streams, the archive of that,
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.440]  the expanded extras. We're about to start the TV show that will be there live for members
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.440]  on PrisonPlanet.tv every day, or at least five days a week.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.440]  And I'm thinking about even doing a best of every week. It's like an hour long, a media review show.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  And we're getting close to that. But that's why we have PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.440]  But that YouTube channel, almost everything is there, and it's free.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.440]  You can subscribe there for free and then have it all sent to you.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.440]  Though YouTube blocks most of our subscribers, we're told,
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.440]  from actually getting our updated videos, trying to, I guess, stop it from becoming viral.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.440]  I had to file in federal court twice to stop YouTube from deleting the channel
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  with false claims that are put on it.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.440]  There's whole groups that dedicate themselves to trying to shut it down.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.440]  But it doesn't matter. Now, so many other huge sites repost our stuff.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.440]  They can't stop the signal overall.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.440]  That's why we encourage everybody to repost our videos on their YouTube channels.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.440]  Because just the amplifying effect is off the charts.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:51.440]  But this globalist secret weapon exposed, tech killchips, is so important because
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.440]  we now have CNN yesterday.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.440]  And I saw the headline on InfoWars as opposed to a link to it and a couple paragraphs of blurb.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.440]  And I thought, oh, our guys must have changed the headline.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.440]  You know, they do that sometimes. Why gadget makers wield a kill switch?
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.440]  And I saw that headline and thought, wow.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.440]  And I clicked on the CNN article, and that's their headline.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.440]  And they kind of whitewash why it's being done.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.440]  I mean, it's all federal mandate.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:28.440]  But we're going to be covering that more later.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:37.440]  And we have the other article out of AP that basically backs up that research.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.440]  The U.S. outlines global plan, global plan for cyberspace.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.440]  A worldwide plan by financing governments to put these hubs in
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.440]  and the kill chips going in the new washers and dryers, dishwashers, computers.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.440]  And I saw a host of other articles in CNN and other places yesterday going,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:05.440]  oh, yeah, the new Intel chips got a kill switch built into the main operating system.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.440]  Built into the core processors.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440]  All these other systems rolling out with it.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.440]  Remember John McCain seven years ago, he said, if you download music illegally,
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.440]  we're going to kill your computer.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.440]  People are like, oh, that old idiot, he doesn't know how the internet works.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]  You're not going to kill my computer.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440]  Oh, yeah, they are.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.440]  Your computer's already got back doors, kill switches all over it.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440]  Get that straight.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.440]  This whole thing's DARPA NSA designed.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.440]  But I want to get into the other police state news when we come back.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.440]  That's why in this segment I didn't get into it yet.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.440]  I want to run through just what is in front of me today.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.440]  And then this is only part of it because I got police state news and all these other stacks.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.440]  I mean, look at this folder of police state news.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.440]  That Alfred, a dash, Tennessee wants to cover.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.440]  I'm not going to be able to read all that before we get Alfred on.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  But it's all coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.440]  Prison Planet dot TV and Forza come.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440]  Hi, folks.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.440]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.440]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440]  Saving means to make money.

[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.440]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.440]  the information war continues.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.440]  Well, the Pentagon is trying to start World War III
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.440]  with Pakistan with US helicopters now.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.440]  For the second time in the last six months,
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.440]  attacking a military base across the border in Pakistan.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.440]  This time, they didn't kill people.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.440]  They just wounded them.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.440]  I want to go over just the incredible police state stacked today
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.440]  to illustrate how out of control the system is.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.440]  Also, more on Dominique Strauss-Kahn
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.440]  and the latest developments on that front
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.440]  to the judge denying bail to IMF chief in sexual assault case.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.440]  He's got to stay pretty much indefinitely in that New York jail.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.440]  I saw the AP video when they opened the door up
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.440]  and they shot 15, 20 seconds of video inside the jail.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  It looked like what New York jail, the precinct I was kept in.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.440]  They had skeleton keys to open the doors.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.440]  It was over 100-year-old jail.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:14.440]  There was feces all over the ground, vomit, snot all over the walls.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440]  I'm sorry to get gross here.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.440]  Moning people and jail guards coming up and laughing at me
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.440]  and giggling like something out of a horror movie
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.440]  who I don't think were operating with a full deck
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440]  and probably had IQs of about 75.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440]  I thought one of the cops that came back was,
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.440]  I'm sad for him, was mentally retarded.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.440]  He was like, I'm not going to imitate him.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440]  I was only in there about three hours.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.440]  They were like, you're going to be in there for days.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.440]  It's a Friday night.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.440]  You might see a judge on Monday and just really acting weird
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.440]  and coming up with McDonald's bags going, you want the McDonald's?
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  You want the McDonald's?
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.440]  And people begging, yes, I was like, whoa.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.440]  And then all of a sudden I heard the chanting outside.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.440]  Hundreds and hundreds of protesters came in and circled the precinct
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.440]  and said, let him go, let him go.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.440]  All I'd done was bullhorn Geraldo Rivera when he was outside.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.440]  There's video of that and Truth Rising, Geraldo flipping us off and everything.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.440]  And it was like in a movie and all of a sudden this captain shows up
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.440]  a few hours into it and says, you take those people,
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440]  you tell them to break up and leave or we're going to get rough
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440]  and it's rock and roll time.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440]  You got me and kind of poked me in the chest and I was tired
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.440]  and I said, okay, and I went out and said, folks, can we just leave?
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440]  Thanks for getting me out.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.440]  But they didn't like the fact that the captain or whatever
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440]  had to come down to see what was going on at the precinct
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.440]  so they just got rid of me.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.440]  And it turned out I had to send a lawyer into court for it
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.440]  that it was a non-arrestable offense.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.440]  It was a ticketable ordinance for an unauthorized sound device
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.440]  and I could have sued them for it but they almost broke my wrist.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440]  When they put my arms on my back,
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.440]  they hit the thing where they raise your arms up in the middle.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.440]  It's a torture move and then put the handcuffs on
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.440]  so that you can't lower your arms and then they cut my wrist
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.440]  and that was very enjoyable for them teaching me about the First Amendment
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.440]  and that little scum won't get away with anything
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.440]  while the feds blow up Building 7 and Larry Silverstein says
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.440]  he blew it up on PBS and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.440]  And by the way, the cop pension funds all over the country
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.440]  along with other public service that the feds have announced
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.440]  and the states, they are going to be cutting them.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440]  So enjoy the bankers.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440]  Remember, I'm the enemy.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.440]  I'm that sovereign citizen.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440]  I'm that bad guy.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440]  So run to Papa's arms.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.440]  Run to the New World Order.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440]  Learn to hate me.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.440]  I'm that evil American who wants my due process.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.440]  But I'm digressing.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.440]  Dominic Strauss-Kahn, I'm sure, is enjoying the New York jail.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.440]  Isn't looking as arrogant as he was on the video I saw
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.440]  when they brought him in on Sunday.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.440]  Not looking as arrogant now after just two or three days
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.440]  in the fetid rat holes.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.440]  And I've been in quite a few jails demonstrating.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.440]  New York is nothing like it.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.440]  I've been in Dallas jail.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  I've been the Austin jail, which was also covered
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440]  with different excretions.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.440]  And I got to have a midget redhead guy slam my head in the wall
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.440]  for no reason and then giggle and see if I wanted to do something
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.440]  at the Austin jail for just protesting the thumb scanning
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.440]  that would then be used to buy and sell and track all of us.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.440]  Now the state police guy was nice, pulled over,
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.440]  took my handcuffs off, was very friendly to me
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.440]  and said I was ordered to do this by the head of public safety.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440]  The head spokesman came down there when I was protesting
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440]  and ordered me arrested.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.440]  And he apologized for it and said he was concerned
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440]  about the biometrics.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.440]  I don't want to get him in trouble.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.440]  But then when I got down to the snot-covered walls
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.440]  of the Austin jail, the midget redhead,
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440]  and nothing in short people, I'm not that tall,
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.440]  did feel manly when he was taking the handcuffs off,
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.440]  slamming my head in the wall and then giggling.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.440]  I mean, can you imagine how low and unhappy that guy is?
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.440]  Guaranteed can't get a woman.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440]  Guaranteed unsuccessful.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.440]  Guaranteed a loser.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.440]  But side issue, I'm having flashbacks here
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.440]  just thinking about jails I've been in,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.440]  trying to defend the Republic.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.440]  But Strauss-Kahn isn't as arrogant looking now
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.440]  after he's been enjoying.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.440]  I have to step down the New York jail.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.440]  I saw some video of the one they brought him into.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.440]  It looked like a 100-year-old jail as well.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.440]  From the $3,000 night hotel, I would imagine, Mr. Kahn.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.440]  But LA Times, Schwarzenegger, had child with Stafford.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.440]  And I was told this by Hollywood people,
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.440]  even a few years ago, that he had an eight-year-old kid.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.440]  I guess it's a 10-year-old kid now, a boy.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.440]  And I was also contacted by a famous black bodybuilder
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440]  who's in the pumping iron.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440]  You see him working out with Arnold,
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.440]  who was on record when Arnold's saying
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.440]  you blacks are subhuman and all this stuff.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.440]  And Arnold, you can say one thing, he's not a coward.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.440]  He's starting fights with big black guys in the gym.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.440]  Routinely, trying to start fights with people, according to him.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.440]  And then he had a book coming out and didn't want to come on,
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.440]  but he contacted me and I got to hear about the kids and all that.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.440]  Because, reportedly, there's more than one,
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.440]  but I never talked about it because I couldn't prove it.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.440]  I was also told by some Hollywood folks about it.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.440]  Schwarzenegger's out with his other kids in public.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.440]  LA Times, Schwarzenegger, when he was the governor,
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.440]  you politically don't talk about that at your newspaper.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440]  You get blackballed.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.440]  Just like Kahn, if they didn't want to flush him down the toilet,
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.440]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn, DSK,
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.440]  who has this long reported history
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.440]  of jumping on women, quote, like a rutting chimpanzee.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.440]  That's how this woman describes it.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.440]  See, the globalist immunity has been decloaked.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.440]  He reportedly had diplomatic immunity, but they're saying it doesn't count.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.440]  Oh, see, because they make the rules.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.440]  That's what it's all about.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440]  We don't have to do the regular radiation testing of these
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440]  that everybody else does under federal law at the TSA.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.440]  We just do it.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.440]  We're all powerful.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440]  We don't care if federal law says we can't stick our hands down your pants
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  and an FBI agent can't do it.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  We can because we were told we could.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440]  And that's a new headline out today.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440]  TSA responds to Texas,
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.440]  says resistance is futile.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440]  And that's what I've been, and they're saying it doesn't matter.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  We have federal law.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.440]  Article 6, clause 2,
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.440]  prevents states from regulating the federal government.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440]  Boy, isn't that delusional.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.440]  You're out of your jurisdiction.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.440]  I mean, just 20 years ago,
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.440]  the FBI had to get permission to come into your county.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.440]  Now, you just got the TSA going,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440]  we do whatever we want around here.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.440]  We're going to be on the streets now
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.440]  and train stations.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440]  We do, you can't do,
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.440]  regulate nothing, we say.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440]  We'll see about that.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440]  We'll see about that.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.440]  The mounting lawsuits, the state reps,
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.440]  the U.S. reps being
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  being groped.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440]  This isn't going to go away.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.440]  People say, oh, Americans are going to put up with it.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.440]  No. Americans are lazy
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.440]  and hypnotized by television.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440]  They have been on average.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440]  But they're still under the surface,
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440]  vicious frontier pirates.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440]  I don't care how you came here,
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.440]  black, white, Hispanic.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.440]  This is the rough and tumble, wild lands.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.440]  I mean, this place,
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.440]  this continent, you go back to the Native Americans.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440]  It's always been perpetual war,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440]  perpetual, the veneer of civilization
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440]  is burning off.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.440]  Like the space shuttle coming back in
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.440]  from orbit and the tiles turning red hot.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.440]  I mean, it's not going to happen.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.440]  People are not going to put up.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440]  Oh, you can find some sheep
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.440]  that will let you stick your hands down
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440]  a one-year-old girl's pants and feel their genitals.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.440]  But let me tell you, there's a big percentage
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.440]  that didn't. And so go ahead
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440]  and tell us where this is futile.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.440]  Go ahead and tell us that we're going to drink the fluoride,
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440]  federally mandated, and we can't stop you.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440]  It's getting removed all over.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.440]  Go ahead, blow up some more buildings, set a nuke off.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.440]  We know you're run by foreign banks.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.440]  We're going to defeat you.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.440]  Find the dumbest people you can
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.440]  that want the job of sticking their hands down people's pants.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440]  More and more, we're going to get busted for pedophilia.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.440]  Rape. Planting drugs on people.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440]  Stealing stuff.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.440]  Just keep pressing.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.440]  Keep pushing with your primitive,
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.440]  dominate Strauss con
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  need to dominate everybody.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.440]  You guys had everybody
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.440]  if you kept going with the slow kill.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440]  But you got to perch on us and spit in our face
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.440]  conscious in the face, and it isn't going to work.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440]  And that's the news here
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.440]  about Swartzy.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440]  Now it's pouring out all the women
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.440]  and him grabbing them
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.440]  and forcing himself on them.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.440]  It's the same attitude. A normal man
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  does not
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440]  want to force anything on a woman.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440]  That's the opposite of fun.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440]  You know, I mean,
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  that's the opposite of what you want.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.440]  These guys, it's about taking.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.440]  The devil is never a maker.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.440]  What you give, it's a taker.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.440]  You know, the lover of life, my friends,
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  in the center, it's the people
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440]  that hate life. You know, the globalists
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440]  have miscast
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.440]  sin as having a good time,
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.440]  a passion for life, gusto.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440]  That's not the big
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.440]  sin, folks. Sin is wanting
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.440]  to dumb people down, control people,
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.440]  lie to people, hurt the children.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.440]  Sin is
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.440]  being so selfish and petulant and greedy
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  that you seek to dumb
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440]  people down and shutter their minds
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.440]  and souls from the greater truths
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.440]  and mysteries of the universe because you're too
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.440]  threatened by the
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.440]  indomitable human spirit.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.440]  And all your aspartame and MSG
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440]  and vaccines and fluoride
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440]  and aluminum dioxide being sprayed on us
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.440]  now admittedly, mixed with the jet fuel,
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.440]  the airlines don't even know about it.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.440]  Federal mandates now on record.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.440]  None of that is going to work in the end
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.440]  because it's only going to make the true
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.440]  survivors and fighters
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.440]  come through on the other side
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.440]  and expose what you've done
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.440]  and you've thrown
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.440]  everything at us and you're going to fail.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.440]  All your control grids, all your
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.440]  human predictability systems,
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.440]  all your spy gadgets, all
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.440]  of your tech at the
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.440]  end of the day isn't going
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.440]  to help you and you're so
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.440]  predatory that
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.440]  you're going to steal your own government people's
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440]  pension funds now and have the Republicans
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440]  come out and say that'll balance the budget.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.440]  And when you can get rid of all of that, it would do
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.440]  nothing to the fake derivatives that
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440]  we've been forcibly signed on to.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.440]  And sure, they'll find
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.440]  dumber and stupider people that'll work
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.440]  for even less and less pension funds to be cops
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.440]  who enjoy abuse
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.440]  because they'd pay to be able to have a badge
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440]  and gun and go around and abusing people.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.440]  And that'll just make more folks
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440]  wake up
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.440]  and more public schools coming out
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.440]  saying the kids belong to them
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.440]  and more arrogance and more attacks
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440]  and ranchers and Amish.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440]  Just keep showing us who you are.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.440]  Now I'm going to blitz through police state news
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440]  and I'll get more into this with Alfred
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.440]  Adask, but we've got another guest coming up.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.440]  But I want to go through this police state news
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.440]  on the other side, but see, it's all coming out
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440]  about Swartz and Anger, Dominique, Strauss, Con,
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.440]  all of them
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.440]  because, well, quite frankly, the globalists
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.440]  don't like them, I guess, because they like women.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.440]  Now that's a big no-no with the elite.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:05.440]  Stay with us.

[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.400]  We have another guest coming up here in just about eight minutes middle Tennessee police
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.560]  Profiting off of drug trade. This is out of news channel five
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.240]  news channel five
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:52.640]  Nashville, Tennessee a major news channel five investigation hasn't covered serious questions about Tennessee's war on drugs among these questions
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.680]  Are some police agencies concerned more about making money off drugs than stopping them?
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:01.120]  That's why the government made drugs illegal is to boost their price
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:06.360]  At the center of this month's long investigation our laws that let officers pull
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.840]  Drivers over looking for cash those officers do not even have to file criminal charges against a person to take his or her money
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.040]  All over Texas all over Cal every state Michigan
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:24.480]  They have federal regulations where they lobby states to pass laws where as long as they give the money to the feds
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.200]  80% of it goes back to the local police department the state laws most of it has to go to the general state fund notice
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.240]  Everything's written. So the feds are the people that control the money
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:40.200]  And in Texas it's routine where mayors from other cities are pulled over and cops go thousand bucks mine
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.080]  You're like officer. What are you doing? You go ahead and try to beat the rap
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:52.640]  They'll take people's cars the Dallas police department put chalk and thousands of people's vehicles said it was cocaine the crime lab at the Houston
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.840]  I mean
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.480]  Tulia, Texas planted drugs on 60 plus black people to fill their own private prison in towns
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.280]  They don't have enough beds basically owned by the local boss hog
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.880]  and the point is I see these type of articles every day and
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:13.000]  They pull you over no judge. No jury. No drugs. Can you prove where that $2,000 came from?
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.440]  They've had cases in Texas where 85 year old old lady and one case turned out. She was, you know, a well-known wealthy socialite
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.640]  She had four thousand in her purse and they said, why do you have this much money?
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.640]  She said well, I like to you know have cash. They just took it. That was the Texas state police and and and
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:38.060]  This is the the whole federal system trying to corrupt police. So there you go. That's just in the stack
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  And it goes through cases
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Where they just you know
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.360]  Even take a few hundred boxes. You don't have cash slave. I mean land of the coward home of the slave
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.040]  Doesn't matter bigger crooks than you are gonna steal all your pension funds

[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.640]  Here is
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.280]  Rolling Stones saying what she wrote six seven years ago in her best-selling book
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.120]  The people versus Goldman Sachs a Senate committee has laid out the evidence now
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:19.000]  The Justice Department should bring criminal charges when Obama is completely financed by these people four times what McCain was
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.040]  Not saying McCain was good. He was clearly the heir apparent
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:29.800]  Here's some of the other headlines China for fifth month straight accelerates dumping of US treasuries not buying them
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.160]  Here's another one Washington post treasury to tap pensions to help fund government
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:40.240]  And I'm now hearing calls to tax private pensions just as the same group of foreign banks
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:47.280]  The bailout money shows who owns the fellow reserve mainly foreign banks have started taking the private pensions the hundred percent owned by you
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.040]  This isn't welfare
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.600]  Yeah, most these government pensions you paid for as well
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.280]  But now they're going after the private ones and that's coming next these people aren't gonna stop
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.400]  They haven't set up anti-terror brigades and having 60-minute specials about

[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.880]  Is our guest for five minutes to the next hour?
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:21.480]  She is a journalist and senior fellow at Demos her latest book. It takes a pillage behind the bonuses bailouts and backdoor deals
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.360]  She is a author of other people's money the corporate mugging of America 2004 a devastating expo
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.560]  Say so I guess she did this seven years ago and a corporate corruption politics collusion on Wall Street
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:38.640]  I read the book. She predicted everything that now happened other people's money was chosen by the best book 2004 by the economist
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.960]  Barons in the library journal
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.000]  Her book a jacked how conservatives are picking your pocket whether you voted for them or not
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.680]  It's into how they're claiming their conservative that are running all the corporate welfare
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.960]  and
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.200]  Before becoming a journalist know me work for the Wall Street journals a managing director Goldman Sachs
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:04.200]  Not a Wall Street journal at Wall Street as a managing director at Goldman Sachs and running the international analytics group at Bear Stearns in London
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.560]  And we've got her here to talk about all of this
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.680]  Know me since we had you on a month ago a lot has happened
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.840]  What is most important on your radar screen that I've got my questions?
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.360]  Well, you know everything that's important
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:21.120]  I want to start at the end maybe and work backwards because it just was the latest bit of news that pissed me off
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.100]  And I think it's just ridiculous which is that Tim Geithner
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:29.980]  Has said that in order to make the debt cap if Congress doesn't raise it
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.700]  He is going to have to stop paying on
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.180]  civil
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:40.660]  Personnel their disability funds their pension funds potentially private pension funds
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:45.300]  These are things that people have paid into this disease or obligations that have already been agreed upon
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:49.300]  And this is what he's talking about going after in order to
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:55.540]  Manage the debt problem now. I just want to point out and I saw this on the show and I just want to re point out
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:57.540]  There is over four trillion dollars
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:03.820]  Trillion at the Fed today in their latest report in their weekly report
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:10.460]  It breaks down into one and a half trillion of treasuries almost a trillion of mortgage and asset backed up
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:18.980]  Securities from the bailout time and one and a half trillion dollars worth of excess reserves reserves to the banks are putting money at the
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:22.180]  Fed to get interest upon that is just sitting there
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:27.100]  So while we were talking about while he is talking about taking money away from people
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:33.460]  Who have earned it have saved it have have agreed that they are going to receive it
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:38.300]  Small tiny little amounts. There is over four trillion dollars of money doing nothing
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:44.860]  But sitting at the Fed to subsidize the banking system and we talk about the debt problem
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:52.060]  We talk about the deficit problem four trillion dollars bigger than the size of our budget bigger than the size of any problems created
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.060]  since the fall of 2008
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:59.820]  Still there still only a portion of the full bailout of the banking system, but sitting there and if
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:06.620]  Anyone had if Geithner or anyone had you know a small modicum of
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.740]  Logic or or or brainfulness or whatever it might be that would be a place
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:14.940]  To get the money from you know, we gave it to the banks
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:20.540]  Banks profit is from it banks still profit is from it. They are not changing the way they do things and what they do
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.020]  And there is money there fitting
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:24.940]  Available while all these
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:33.300]  Pontifications and and the notion of taking it away from individuals is going on. It's just it is mind-boggling and by the way your main line
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:38.660]  Democrats have been fooled. They say raise taxes pay my pension funds
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:45.860]  Which is exactly what the big central banks want because that won't go to them. It'll go offshore to their fraudulent
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.780]  Interest and the systems now they fool the main line
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:57.100]  Conservatives by saying we got to fix America slash these public pension funds. Maybe even go after private ones
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:00.580]  It's conservative when you could get rid of all of that
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:05.620]  We've broken down the numbers and it wouldn't do anything to the thousand plus trillion and derivatives
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:12.300]  The unfunded mandates all of it and and and then they say well quit bashing Wall Street, Alex
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.660]  They're free market really Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Wells Fargo
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:18.860]  Berkshire Hathaway City Bank
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:26.180]  They're the ones that got the banker bailout and then they sit there and lecture us about free market while they all file
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:33.700]  Record profits record bonuses just domestically not to mention that what over 80% of it's being shipped overseas
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:38.220]  And they're paying near zero on it. This is going according to plan
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:42.420]  They're robbing us the greatest robbery in history and you hit the nail on the head
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:49.260]  They've got four trillion sitting there liquid, but they're waiting to loan that out to widows at seventy nine point nine percent
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.940]  Credit card rates. They're not gonna no no no sir
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:57.540]  They're gonna hold us hostage and cut the benefits and cut people's pension funds
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:04.660]  They paid into and then they're gonna have the republicans go right along with it like idiots killing the economy. Well, exactly
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:10.020]  And it is a bipartisan issue. Yes, it is Republicans going after it's a Democrats not noticing on it
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:14.540]  It's like stealing four trillion dollars and having it out there like an in the middle of daylight
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.740]  and not have anybody sort of who is in
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:24.340]  Control of potentially getting to it do anything about it. It's mind-boggling and then you move on to
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:30.780]  What's going on in Europe and you know the bigger scandal of the IMF, which isn't just
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:37.860]  Whatever might come out of the sexual assault case on the former chief or you know chief in
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:42.540]  Waiting for his his home bail or in jail or wherever he might be right now
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:46.420]  Which is that for example, Greece is being asked to pay 25%
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:51.940]  Interest rates on money that's coming to them not just from the IMF and the EU
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.340]  But of course because the market the bankers are slaughtering the country
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:01.500]  Which is what has happened with all of the peripheral countries in Europe. It's not really different from what's happening to those
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:06.180]  You know the widows and and the pensioners and everyone else here
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:09.540]  We're being asked to pay 30% or more on credit card rates
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:14.580]  We're having homes taken away under fraudulent means and everything else the same thing that's happening systematically
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:18.900]  Through the IMF through the EU and Europe for the peripheral countries
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:22.700]  And there have been bailouts that Greece for example to get a bailout
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:28.020]  141 billion dollars last year and by the way before that bailout
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.180]  The head the former head of the IMF
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:36.700]  Dominic Strauss-Cahn had said that everything was going to be fine a only one bailout would be needed
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:41.300]  Be austerity measures that would be put upon the people of Greece would be enough
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:47.220]  And there would be no other bailouts happening in the rest of Europe for example in Portugal, which just got its bailout
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:48.500]  um
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:54.700]  Created and approved by the EU and the IMF on Monday while Dominic Strauss-Cahn was in court
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:45:01.260]  So so the stuff that happened under him and the stuff that the IMF has been doing has been extracting again and blaming
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:03.980]  pension funds and and and
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:10.460]  Society types of programs when in fact it was the banks that trashed those accounts
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:12.980]  Well that came out in just last year in
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:20.780]  Iceland the people finally called their bluff and got the documents and even the financial times I had to admit over 90%
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:27.100]  Of the debt was not the government or the peoples. It was the very central banks demanding the money
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:32.380]  That's what's crazy. They're like pay us back the debts and it's their debt same thing in Ireland
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:38.460]  They're the apple of the world's eye until they go into the EU that puts them under these banking rules and suddenly
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:43.780]  They're in trouble and now they're maneuvering the maneuvering the US to losing its triple A rating
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:47.140]  So we'll be paying 25% and then once we go to that point
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:49.980]  There's no way to ever get out of debt
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:54.340]  It's designed to make us debt slaves and and know me what about this because you worked at the highest levels
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:57.020]  With these people
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.620]  How do you deal with?
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:01.100]  Geithner up there saying if you don't raise the debt ceiling
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:07.900]  You're gonna cause a default when they've already technically defaulted by monetizing 70 plus percent
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:14.460]  Of the Treasury bills. I mean even Stan and poor said it's it's it's it's all this spending and the banker bailout
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:21.300]  That's doing this but then Geithner stands up there blaming what they've created on us trying to reverse what's happening
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.900]  Well, again, he's completely
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:32.180]  Incompetent in this guy it becomes from the same banking system that enabled all of this to happen as head of the New York Fed
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:37.220]  No, he didn't work at Goldman. He didn't work at JP Morgan Chase, but you know the New York
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:43.900]  Fed class 8 prime director was Jamie is Jamie diamond and was Jamie diamond at JP Morgan Chase
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:47.380]  So they really came from the same fold and the fold was to enable
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:53.580]  The least amount of rules and the cheapest amount of capital to leverage the most and that when it all fell apart
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:57.060]  That would be created and Geithner just sort of moved from his
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:03.620]  Post at the New York Fed to the Treasury Department where it's officially a public office
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:11.180]  But in fact, it's really just an extension of the private banking functions that he was doing our debt and our
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:16.700]  GDP are almost equivalent, you know, we're talking the difference of a couple hundred billion dollars
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:20.460]  We our entire debt is because of this and most of it
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:25.260]  Has happened in the last decade, but more of that has happened in the last two and a half years
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:32.740]  Since the financial crisis was made apparent by Wall Street four trillion of debt again is that the Fed four trillion was created by the
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:38.340]  Treasury Department. It's the same number. There was just a transfer and that all happened
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:42.220]  With with Tim Geithner. So it's wrong economically
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:48.820]  It's certainly wrong socially wrong from a policy perspective, but they stand again by wrecking societies
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:54.540]  They've done this to countless third-world countries cheaper. It is cheaper. You do it. Yeah, you do to third-world countries
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.780]  You raise the interest rates and it's not just by doing it
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:04.700]  Um, officially you do because that's where cap capital flies in capital flies out capital makes decisions
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:07.020]  It's the derivatives market. It's the currency markets
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:10.940]  It's the way the central banks operate and he wind up creating some dominant
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:18.300]  Bank-oriented countries in every other country and every other individual those countries winds up suffering from the cost of having
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.300]  Created that debt to make the whole
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:27.780]  Excellent points, isn't it? I mean it's elementary, but how do you explain something so simple to a population that the
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:34.340]  Establishment media has been fed the left-right paradigm of rob the middle class to keep the welfare net going
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:41.580]  On the left to Republicans slash everything to keep things going either way is just two different arms of
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.300]  The same predatory system. I mean, here's what I'm getting at here
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:47.420]  We know
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:53.380]  That they create the derivatives bubble make huge profits on the way up then they use the crisis
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:49:00.020]  They've created as this giant cancer and they say you've got to feed the cancer or the whole body is going to die
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:05.020]  And then it's so massive that now the whole world orbits the Ponzi scheme
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:10.460]  Because we're buffalo that the whole world will collapse financially if we don't get into them
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:13.940]  But we're being absorbed the giving in is the slow death
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:18.580]  We've got a chance if we I mean how do we break through to the public that doesn't understand this?
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:20.580]  How do you simplify it for him?
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.580]  Well, that's the it's almost like
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:29.860]  bodies like the Fed the Treasury Department the the IMF that are all in that same philosophy that you just outlined is this idea of
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:37.100]  You know a mass thing profit very quickly moving capital around when it all falls apart creating debt
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:44.740]  To keep it going and extracting that debt from everybody else who wasn't in the position of power to benefit or to benefit from the original
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:52.540]  profit profit on the way up profit on the way down and it's sort of like those bodies and the people it's like the
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:56.580]  Mafia sort of like running into your town or or you know basically taking over
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:02.340]  You know anything or you hit the pizza place the the dry cleaner the whatever it might be and say you know what you're gonna
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:08.380]  Keep on paying us because if you don't pay us, we're going to kill you and by the way if you can't pay us
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.780]  We're going to kill you and by paying us it will kill you
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:18.740]  Um, it's it's a very it would just be better to go ahead and make sure the mafia got it and make it back out of the business
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:25.780]  This is the mafia the controls
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:35.140]  It's foreign banks that have hijacked America that have 20,000 nuclear weapons and
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:38.060]  Know me incredible information
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:44.620]  Let's come back and talk about what you see coming in the future any comments on Dominic Strauss the Rudding chimpanzee con
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.260]  and we'll also get your take on
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:50.100]  Ideas to reverse this
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:57.140]  Former managing director at Goldman Sachs. I've been blowing the whistle now for seven eight nine years. No me Prince is our guest
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.220]  Hi, this is Alex Jones
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:07.740]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:12.500]  Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:17.900]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:23.140]  So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:30.700]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:34.660]  And here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:38.420]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:47.980]  So visit them today at survival seed bank comm that's survival seed bank comm or give them a call at 877-327-0365

[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:36.100]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks stockbrokers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:42.100]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement

[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:10.220]  But to benefit at all from protein your body must first be able to break down protein into amino acids
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:17.500]  Once amino acids are liberated from proteins your body uses them to make brain chemicals that make you feel alert and peaceful at the same time
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:24.420]  If pancreas uses them to regulate blood sugar and insulin people are waking up and doing an about face when it comes to nutrition
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:28.940]  They're learning that a high carbohydrate diet may encourage obesity and diabetes
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:36.340]  They are now emphasizing proteins more to compensate one protein source that is more easily broken down into amino acids is

[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:18.540]  Nomi the good news is major publications now admit we've been robbed blind even last year
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:22.220]  They were having a celebratory Jekyll Island 100 year anniversary
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:25.840]  And I played the clip here on air of former Fed
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:27.980]  chairman
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:29.500]  saying
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.380]  Greenspan that you know the big banks have done a lot of criminal stuff
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:38.500]  Wacovia and others Wells Fargo caught laundering a 376 billion in drugs
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:46.180]  I mean people are really starting to to get the facts here and Rolling Stones coming out saying where's the criminal indictments?
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:48.180]  I mean we know they're committing crimes and
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:53.260]  And this old line that Greenspan used two years ago on Lair News Hour that we're above the law
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:55:00.180]  We control the government, you know, no one can touch us. Well people inherently know even if they're not lawyers on its face
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:03.580]  That's a fraud. I mean who are these people? We didn't have them till 1913
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:09.980]  So it seems momentum is shifting against them and they can't stop stealing and using their advantage
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:15.180]  To steal the taxpayer money. So I think it's a matter of time till they go down. What do you think?
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:19.380]  I want to believe that and I do think that in order for that to happen
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:22.180]  You know, you said people have to be more and more aware
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:27.180]  I'm sure you get much more than I do being I get emails all the time saying, okay, you know, what do we do?
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.980]  What can we do? You know, this is just words, but you know, it's not just words
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:32.460]  people have to know people have to talk to each other and
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:36.900]  Get an understanding that you know the reason that it costs more money
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:43.140]  Whether it's putting gas in your tank or whether your weed is aren't going as much forward or whether your pensions won't be worth as much when you
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:48.580]  retire is because there's all this money being stolen out from under you and and being used
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:53.940]  Sort of against you and and the people that want it are not elected officials
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:57.660]  They're they're publicly appointed and that's something that that makes it very difficult to Fed
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:01.940]  Enabled and it was a joint effort. It was collusive
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:06.620]  But the Fed enabled the Treasury Department to issue four trillion dollars worth of debt in the last two and a half years
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:11.900]  That's a lot of debt that that is a significant portion of our GDP and it's the most historically
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:18.580]  Quick creation and let's be clear they get our money. They get to use it and then we pay them interest on it
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:26.020]  They pay them interest on it and and and it's right there. We're talking about not paying disabilities for for for public employees
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:30.220]  It doesn't even make it or potentially private one. It doesn't actually make any sense
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:36.100]  So so and now you have again on the IMF you have John Lipsky who was a JP Morgan Chase guy
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:41.020]  Who's going to be doing the same types of procedures and and philosophies?
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:43.020]  which is basically
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:48.860]  Bankrupting individuals in order to subsidize banking systems throughout Europe and it all comes together because in the meantime
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:53.180]  It looks like what the Fed is doing isn't even so bad because that stuff is happening in Europe
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.980]  So it makes our dollar look which is very weak and should be weak
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:58.940]  It's concerted implosion by design
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:05.540]  I mean G 20 a minute two years ago. It's coordinated devaluing. It's totally dashardly
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:13.660]  What about the word that a big new world order promoter global mr. Global Governance Gordon Brown may replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:17.900]  Again if that happens that is that is just more of the same
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:21.780]  That's basically going to promote the continued policies of the IMF
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:26.700]  Which is to do everything it can to make sure that capital bank capital quick
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:31.780]  Speculation can continue in and out of these countries that the banks who manifested are
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:38.140]  Bailed out and supported when things go wrong as the individuals pay the tap. It's the exact same
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:46.140]  Philosophy unfortunately. Yeah, he might be a little less pushy of it than than Dominique Strauss-Kahn because of the whole sort of French English
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:50.100]  relationship, but it's not that different the English the
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:53.580]  English banking system and I worked in London for seven years
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:59.340]  I worked in London when the euro was being discussed and created and there was a lot of debate between the central
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:03.580]  stronger quote economies and the peripheral ones that are now having problems and
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:08.420]  Not much has changed there. There's been a notion of kind of using them
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:15.380]  When it's convenient to speculate bailing the banks who did it and then hurting the individuals when people come out
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:21.900]  And it's not too different from what's going on here. You're subsidizing a system that's it's dealing from us with with
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.780]  So much more money than you could use to subsidize the population if that were to be the choice
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:33.780]  And that's what we need to basically work towards. All right. No me friends with us for five more minutes on the other side
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.500]  I want to get her view
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:40.180]  Just on the on these bankers, you know the $3,000 a night hotel rooms

[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.700]  Alex Jones
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:28.940]  We have a surprise guest that's gonna be in studio with us
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:35.140]  At the two o'clock hour central standard time 3 p.m. Eastern in Pacific
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:37.980]  One p.m. Mountain
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:44.940]  We have Alfred a desk a demonized by the big 60 minutes piece
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:49.820]  Saying that if you question any of this corruption, you don't like the Federal Reserve
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:55.940]  They're putting out manuals for the cops that we first got over two years ago saying if anybody doesn't like what the Federal Reserve's doing
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:01:00.860]  They're enemy number one. We also got documents for the army and plain clothes goes out to
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:04.900]  In the Fed protest. No me. It's very clear
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.740]  That these bankers know they've committed these crimes
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:16.780]  They know they run our government and they're trying to maneuver the the the government workers to be enemies of the American people that are awake
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:19.300]  and they
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:25.060]  Support the highest leaders of our government, you know, which they don't just support
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:29.380]  They pay for them to be in office and then to ultimately appoint people
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:37.100]  Who basically maintain the philosophy and and they monger fear they they basically talk about these notions that you know
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:41.300]  Again back to the debt cap that if we don't raise it that if we don't increase our debt
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.380]  But if we don't do more of the same which is not helping the average individual on the street
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:50.500]  That somehow it's going to be cataclysmic when what was cataclysmic to begin with
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:53.020]  was the financial
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.300]  crisis that led up to the excess debt and and the lack of
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:01.740]  Not just anyone going to jail just just a lack of any kind of
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:03.820]  structural change
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:10.580]  To the system itself as opposed to just allowing more of the same to continue in that piece on on Goma
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.580]  Which was an excellent piece
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:13.740]  noting that
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:17.940]  You know this this matter to now go to the Department of Justice
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:20.740]  Well, we're talking about the same Department of Justice that
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:27.460]  Investigated AIG for a nanosecond last year and decided that there wasn't enough evidence to bother to prosecute, you know
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:30.300]  So we're talking about a kind of endemic unwillingness
[02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:36.660]  To really probe into what's wrong, and it's not that complicated. I've written books on it many other people have written books on it
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:44.740]  It's not that complicated to understand that rules were bent and broken and sidestepped in order to create a financial
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:46.900]  leverage system that
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:52.500]  Profited a lot that imploded and that now we are all paying for and now they're building up science
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:53.820]  Correct me if I'm wrong now
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:59.140]  They're building up to do it again, and they're actually emboldened by the fact that they got away with the swendles
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:01.580]  They have more money exactly right now
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:08.220]  They're paying 0% on the money with which they can do it again when when they did it the first time or the most recent time before
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:13.220]  The 2008 financial crisis and they were paying between you know up to four or five percent on money now
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:14.420]  They're paying zero
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:22.180]  So you know and they're getting interest paid on reserves that they're keeping in the meantime at the Fed so the result of this crisis
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:25.140]  Was that they have more money to continue to do what they're doing?
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:28.540]  So yes, they're emboldened and they're also more financed
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:32.820]  No me friends.com is the website in
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:41.940]  No MIP r ins dot com and we've got links to her up on info wars dot com again. No me friends
[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:47.260]  Dot com and tell us about your latest book
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:56.340]  Well, I'm actually trying to work on a book where I go back to the hundred years of what happened leading up to the Fed and how
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:03.660]  All the sort of lies that we've been told going back to their own documents and what was said publicly versus what was said privately
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:07.820]  Over the last century, so it's a pretty ambitious work. It's gonna take a while
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:12.700]  But that's sort of what I'm working on now and it's it's much more in depth than a historical
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:17.220]  Then it takes a pillage which was very much looking at the most recent crisis and some history that led up to it
[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:21.900]  But but this will be more probing. I'm looking at some old-fed documents and other things over
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:27.500]  Last century to really piece together just just what happened rather than talking about it
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:30.940]  We show the real evidence. Well in closing when we got 30 seconds
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:39.660]  $3,000 night hotel rooms the IMF and World Bank or taxpayer funded and they're always lecturing us about how they care about third-world countries
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:45.580]  Meanwhile, they're they're caught by design imploding them. I mean, I mean, these are a bunch of pretty sickening people in your experience
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:59.820]  We'll talk about it next time you're back. No me. Thank you so much
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:02.820]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:09.380]  You should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:15.860]  Number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:23.340]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:29.900]  Power grid is dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:37.300]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a

[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:46.300]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:21.260]  60 minutes hit piece that aired a few nights ago and one of the main people they zeroed in on is
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:23.820]  radio host
[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:29.140]  Publisher of the anti-shyster news magazine ran for Texas Supreme Court a

[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:50.740]  Meanwhile, we have foreign banks openly stealing 27 trillion. We haven't gotten new numbers in a year. That was two years in
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:56.540]  We have the bill of rights being trampled. We have the TSA out of their jurisdiction
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:09:03.820]  Outside federal and state law sticking their hands down children's pants and saying they're gonna ignore this the state law passing
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:05.820]  They can't do it. I
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.340]  Read earlier articles are pouring in mainstream TV
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:17.540]  Is admitting the in Tennessee and other states that police all over are pulling over even prominent people
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:19.540]  That's when they get in trouble is when it's a judge or
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:26.340]  Country music singer you name it it's happening to everybody old ladies and they're taking as low as a hundred bucks out of their wallet
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:32.340]  You got proof that hundred dollars is yours. Give it to me cops are plugging their cell phones in stealing all their data
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:37.460]  All of I mean, I mean look this happens in history over and over again. It's called tyranny
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:42.020]  Here's some of the news items while you were sleeping. They abolished the Fourth Amendment
[02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:45.620]  US Supreme Court claims that if they
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:52.260]  Hear sounds they don't need a warrant to go in your house and those against the decision said it's the end of the Fourth Amendment
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:10:00.140]  The Indiana Supreme Court stated for any reason including no reason at all no Fourth Amendment and I read that the
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:07.020]  Head judge's quote. He said there is no Fourth Amendment. I mean they said we can do whatever we want even without a reason
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:11.260]  And he went on and attacked Magna Carta and said it was unreasonable
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:15.700]  Again, the government works for us. You got to go to an elected judge to get that warrant
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:18.420]  You got to be able to face your accuser. It's all out the window
[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:23.460]  I mean now they admit devices are spying on everything. No Fourth Amendment. No Tenth Amendment
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:26.620]  They're coming after the second the ATF has been caught now
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:32.420]  We learned for two years shipping tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to the drug cartels to trace them back here
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:37.060]  So they could then say we got a restrict and ban semi-autos which they did and they don't even care
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:42.980]  They got caught. They're still going ahead. I mean this it's bigger than Obama folks. It's total mafia. Okay?
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:47.700]  He's just their front man. So you learn to hate him. They pull him out put a new one in
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:51.860]  Now continuing while you were sleeping they abolished the Fourth Amendment
[02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:57.860]  Here's another report a global a secret weapon kill chips
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:04.140]  CNN and now has a report out admitting yes industries putting kill switches takeover switches and everything
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:08.300]  The president is to start breaking in with videos and text bossing you around
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:13.220]  They're now announcing the feds are going to break in a local radio and TV not for emergency alerts
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:20.140]  But just with brainwashing tell us screens going in 9,000 locations saying spy on your neighbors public schools nationwide with AI
[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:26.980]  Software cameras tracking the kids recording everything they say run by the Pentagon laptops that got school gives the kids
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:34.300]  Taxpayer money paid for spying on them at school schools. Don't care. They're out in the open. We're being bum-rushed by the criminal class
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:39.260]  I mean, they're just running wild there. Their theory is a blitzkrieg of corruption
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:45.100]  Just hit us anybody who speaks out. We got the homeland security mic reports two years ago
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:52.460]  Gun owners conservatives returning veterans Ron Paul supporters people that want to end the Fed anybody that criticizes the central banks are
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:12:00.380]  marked for arrest and they're trying to brainwash the cops and that's what this show said if you don't worship the government you want to kill cops
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:05.060]  That's the message global a secret weapon exposed tech kill chips
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:10.220]  Continuing federally mandated light bulbs going to affect next year
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:17.900]  $50 each owned by GE GE shutting down all the other power plants that they basically don't owe. They're giving waivers
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:25.220]  There's a new list out of the thousands of groups that have been given the presidential waiver. I do not have to get insurance. It's government
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:34.500]  Clubs Nancy Pelosi restaurants McDonald's general electric just total mafia where you've got to buy the socialist healthcare
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:39.500]  But from the insurance company, but anybody who's part of the inside group their employees don't have to have it
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:44.660]  So they can beat you with unfair trade advantage. Just total blind mafia
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:50.260]  Neo eco fascist light bulbs cost $50 each
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:54.020]  Look at this one and this is out of Fox business
[02:12:55.020 --> 02:13:00.140]  Philly police harass threatened to shoot man legally carrying gun legal to carry open
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:03.340]  The cops beat him up cuss at him all recorded
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:10.020]  And said we don't care what the law is and just throttled him and talked about we'll blow your head off a slave
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:14.500]  Doesn't have a gun. We'd play the audio, but there's so many F bombs from the cops. We can't do it
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:21.980]  Spokane photographers considered suspicious alkytotypes. We have the newscast with the police a spy on your neighbors
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:28.940]  Anyone photographing evil get them with the government surveilling us TSA backscatter radiation safety tests were rigged
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:30.940]  They wouldn't give Congress the studies for a year
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:38.580]  Then they gave them fake studies. That's out. Here's the middle Tennessee police profiting from drug trade robbing cash
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:44.940]  Here's the CNN article. I mentioned why gadget makers wheeled a kill switch. Well, it's a federal mandate
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:47.780]  TSA responds to Texas resistance is futile
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:51.740]  We're gonna play this clip and then go to Alfred a desk who would dare
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:58.180]  Chronicle the crime of the crime syndicate who would dare point out the 10th and 9th amendment of the states
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:00.860]  That's why they hate him so much
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:04.400]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes and it gets even worse
[02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:12.020]  They say in the newscast if you criticize the Fed or anybody else you're a cop killer and the cops say we've got to know
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:16.300]  Who these people are we got to have a list? Well, that's what these threat fusion centers are all about
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:20.260]  They want to know who the real Americans are. Here's the clip. Oh
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:22.500]  What is a sovereign citizen?
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:30.080]  So I'm a citizen in its simplest form believes that he is above the law JJ McNabb has been studying sovereign citizens for a decade
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:34.180]  She's testified before Congress and is writing a book about the movement
[02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:39.980]  He has a twisted sense of history and he thinks that people who lived in the 18th century
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:45.700]  Were free of all legal constraints and they want to return to that time now didn't have a fellow sir
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:53.620]  Okay, we're part of an anti-government didn't have an end come tax back to the racist posse come attack standing army in the
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.620]  Montana Freeman of the nineties
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:02.460]  Convicted Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols was a sovereign citizen of the federal operation totally proven by actor Wesley Snipes
[02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:09.580]  Convicted of tax evasion in 2008. He's tax loopholes the private banks. He is sovereign language average sovereign
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:12.820]  They're the only ones allowed to pay zero tax bankers
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:20.220]  35 and he is in economic dire because a big fat parasites like you they've probably
[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:22.740]  Lost the wife paranoid
[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:27.620]  Many are conspiracy theorists most are do you trust the government? I
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:31.340]  Would argue that it's un-American to trust the government
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.260]  Alfred Addis has been a sovereign citizen for 28 years
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:39.940]  He's what's called a sovereign guru one of the movement's leading voices a
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:45.140]  Roofer by trade Addis once published a magazine critical of the legal system
[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:50.140]  Oh, Darian is a sovereign citizen movement growing. What's driving people to it is
[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:57.860]  They are beginning to understand that the government has moved away from fundamental principles that this nation has built on
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:00.500]  Where are the limits in limited government?
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:05.620]  The sovereignty movement is attempting to discover those limits and reassert them
[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:10.060]  You're eligible for social security. Yes, sir. Do you click? No, why not?
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:16.020]  If you take these benefits you wind up being in the status of a subject rather than a sovereign
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:20.140]  You pay taxes one they're due, you know necessarily
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:26.380]  It's not true that everyone has to pay taxes has the IRS ever come after you for back taxes. Yes. Did you pay? No
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:33.380]  You don't like this government very much to you. I think the government has gone far beyond its constitutional limits
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:38.820]  They think hey, we're not how we're the government. We can do anything and some people are saying no
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:42.020]  I don't think you can at ask like others sovereign
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:46.700]  All right, that's Alfred at us and he joins us now for five minutes into the next hour
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:50.740]  We have a surprise surprise guest for about 30 minutes or so after that in studio
[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:57.420]  Alfred they are moving now from getting rid of the Bill of Rights the name of fighting their al-Qaeda brigades
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:17:01.500]  Which are now the heroes in Libya were told to the domestic groups
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:08.420]  I believe they're really thinking about staging some new domestic events so they can really come after people like you and I and
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:14.060]  It it shows they're getting scared because you're you and others are calling them out Alfred
[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:20.340]  Well, I agree with you and I think you know they have certainly stepped up their activity in recent times
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:24.820]  But that's not necessarily evidence that they're becoming more powerful
[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:28.140]  It may be evidence that they're becoming more desperate
[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:35.020]  They realize this thing is coming to a head and they're trying to grab whatever they can before the whole thing explodes in their face
[02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:40.740]  I think they see the direction things are going and I think there are perhaps desperate to stop
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:42.860]  People like you and me
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:47.620]  Thousands millions of others that are beginning to understand, you know, this can't continue
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.580]  Yeah, they're not building hardened bunkers in every city and then we get the internal training manuals
[02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:55.620]  It's not for guys wearing turbans that they know work for them
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:59.300]  Yeah, it's it's for the American people. They know they're criminals
[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:05.700]  Now we are we are living in difficult dangerous and interesting times
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:10.380]  And the most important thing is to stand up
[02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:16.620]  You know, the worst thing you can possibly do right now is hunker down and be quiet
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:22.820]  It's precisely when they come up and they try to exercise try to try to hit us with as much force as possible
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:28.300]  They do that to intimidate people into being quiet. They do it to intimidate you into fear
[02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:33.100]  You can't succumb to it now is the time when you really have to stand up
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:37.620]  And if and if they're all possible you need to stand up with other people at the same time
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:43.620]  Yeah, they're like a they're like a marlin fish on the line that's desperate and runs out a hundred or two hundred yards
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:49.020]  That fish is getting tired when he finally runs the hardest, you know, he's about to give up
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:56.260]  And that's why they're sticking the hands down the baby's pants. That's why they're beating up photographers because they're they're running on that line
[02:18:56.460 --> 02:19:01.780]  Desperately they got blood coming out their mouth their hearts beating their muscles are burning. They're about to implode
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:08.940]  Yeah, I agree. So the point to this is that, you know, if this system was operating smoothly
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:12.980]  And if they were really running this this this operation
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:20.140]  People wouldn't even be complaining. They wouldn't be suspecting the sheep would be sheared and they would thank the guy that sheared them
[02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:22.140]  They say well, thanks very much for taking my fleece
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:29.940]  It's because the system is on the edge of maybe losing control that it becomes desperate
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:35.820]  That means now is the time for people like us people that are listening this program. You got to stand up
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:42.380]  This is our opportunity. It's not just our danger. It is our opportunity. All right, we're gonna come back

[02:23:09.620 --> 02:23:18.780]  Many years ago, sought after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing
[02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:22.820]  Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:30.780]  You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible landscaping, effective predator protection and even home butchering
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:37.540]  Everyone is talking about Marjorie's DVD and it's highly recommended by Jim Rawls, Jack Spirko and Boutiful Gardens
[02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:43.220]  Read her free reports on how to have a green thumb making free fertilizer and answers the question
[02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:54.820]  Do you need a gun to garden? If you want the security, savings and freedom of food self-reliance, buy Marjorie's DVD and get the free reports at BackyardFoodProduction.com
[02:23:54.820 --> 02:24:13.780]  Again, that's BackyardFoodProduction.com
[02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:25.780]  If you studied the Bill of Rights Constitution history in any country in history, this would be called tyranny
[02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:37.780]  I admire the illegal aliens. Most of them don't pay any taxes, they don't have any ID, they do whatever they want and because they do it as a group, they're sovereign
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:46.780]  If you're talking to a bank, no ID, they're giving it. Citizens, though, are kept basically like slaves and the system wants to keep us down
[02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:54.780]  It's like in that clip from a bug's life with the grasshoppers talking about if you let one ant stand up, all the ants might stand up
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:25:00.780]  And I've got to say the illegal aliens behave a lot more like old-time Americans did than we do
[02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:10.780]  And now the globalists want them there to drive down wages, that's why they let them get away with it, but more and more, Alfred, I think it's because the illegal aliens just won't put up with it
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:18.780]  But continue breaking down why they're coming after the sovereign citizen movement, who this new world order is and where you think we're going
[02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:27.780]  The whole idea behind sovereignty, the sovereignty movement, I don't even like that term, for me it's not a movement, I'm not a member of any group
[02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:32.780]  They say, well, what it is, it's an idea whose time has come again
[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:41.780]  That's what it comes down to, and the whole question about sovereignty is who's running this country? Are we the people running this country or is the government running this country?
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:47.780]  What the sovereign citizens are essentially saying, we the people, just like it says in the Constitution, we're running this country
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:52.780]  And the government says, no you're not, you're a bunch of subjects, and that's what this is about, who is in control?
[02:25:52.780 --> 02:26:00.780]  The government says, we got to obey all their laws, but the problem is the law goes in levels, you got God's law number one
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:07.780]  And then you have the law of the people, number two, and that law is enshrined in the constitutions at the state and federal level
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:13.780]  That's the people's law, and then we get the law passed by government, down at the bottom, the government says we got to obey our law
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:18.780]  And we're saying, no, you got to obey our law, you got to obey our law in the Constitution
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:22.780]  And the government says, no, we don't have to obey the Constitution, but you got to obey our law
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:30.780]  That's the guts of the sovereignty problem right now, whose law is going to be followed, and ultimately you're going to have God's law at the top
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:37.780]  We'll take these clergy response teams that Genesis Talk Show hosts, Pastor Butch Paul first discovered, I was then sent hundreds and hundreds of pages
[02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:45.780]  And the preacher got threatened over it, and people didn't believe the documents until two years later when national and local TV covered it and said how great it was
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:51.780]  Oh, the tens of thousands of preachers are trained per year secretly to tell their flocks to submit and do whatever government says
[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:56.780]  Because Romans 13 out of context, Hitler's favorite verse to control the Germans
[02:26:56.780 --> 02:27:01.780]  Well in America, we the people are the government, surrender unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's
[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:04.780]  That's exactly right, exactly
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:10.780]  And that idiot from 60 Minutes was going, you know, you don't like the government, Alfred Adask is the government
[02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:15.780]  Oh well, you don't like to pay your taxes, we didn't have this till 1913, this is alien, go ahead
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:21.780]  Well, nobody's crazy about paying taxes, but the government's not crazy about obeying the Constitution
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:27.780]  What is worse, a handful of people aren't paying taxes or a government that's not obeying the Constitution
[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:32.780]  Why should we pay taxes to a government that doesn't obey the Constitution?
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:39.780]  Or that's run by banks that exempt themselves, that's really waking people up that all these mega banks pay almost zero tax
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:44.780]  Yeah, they want all the little people to pay taxes and the big operators
[02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:49.780]  Why doesn't the Federal Reserve pay taxes, it's a private company, why don't they pay taxes?
[02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:52.780]  Probably make more money than anybody but the government
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:55.780]  Well, you know, it's come out, I've even seen it in the Washington Post some years, they do a study
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:59.780]  Upwards of half of Congress doesn't pay taxes and nobody prosecutes them
[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:05.780]  Yeah, if you're in the workplace and they can get away with it
[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:14.780]  They undoubtedly, not simply because they have power, but because when they do get away with it, now there's leverage to come after them
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:20.780]  And now they're on a leash, you don't have to pay taxes, but you better vote the way you have to vote
[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:28.780]  Alright, we'll tell you how to vote, you get away without paying taxes, but if you step out of line, we're gonna throw your butt in the slammer
[02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:31.780]  It's the old corruption, how they try to get you into the corruption
[02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:32.780]  Yeah, I understand
[02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:36.780]  Oh no, I'm just making sure the listeners do, Alfred, I've got to get you on more often
[02:28:36.780 --> 02:28:42.780]  We've got a long segment coming up and a couple more after that, then we've got a surprise guest in studio scheduled
[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:49.780]  But when we come back from break here in an 18-minute segment, I want to get into some of the outrages of these crooks
[02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:52.780]  And why you say they're illegitimate, let's start rolling now
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:55.780]  I mean, start
[02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:57.780]  Okay, you want me to start talking now, okay
[02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:00.780]  No, I mean, what woke you up just briefly before we go to break?
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:07.780]  Oh, I went through a divorce in 1983, I was as fat dumb and happy as anybody else, and I went through a divorce, suffered injustice
[02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:13.780]  One thing led to another, and I became a student of the legal system, and that's what really precipitated this and got this going
[02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:17.780]  I never got it, never quit, you know, just keep on and you keep on
[02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:22.780]  I made a comment on the 60 minutes program that it's un-American to trust the government
[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:24.780]  A lot of people would find that remarkable
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:26.780]  No, that's true, stay there, we're gonna come back with that
[02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:28.780]  We're gonna come back right there
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:31.780]  Stay there, we're gonna have the floor when we come back, definitely have this guy back
[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:36.780]  I've listed him on the radio off and on for years, always meant to get him on, and we've got him on now
[02:29:36.780 --> 02:29:43.780]  Alfred Adask, it's adask.wordpress.com, adask.wordpress.com
[02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:46.780]  Our sites, of course, are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv
[02:29:46.780 --> 02:29:48.780]  We'll be right back with Alfred, stay with us
[02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:54.780]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:58.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:57.780]  SilverLungs.com
[02:31:25.780 --> 02:31:28.780]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:32.780]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:35.780]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:37.780]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:39.780]  They're asking for more matches
[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.780]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:43.780]  Today seems like nobody does care
[02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:48.780]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:53.780]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[02:31:53.780 --> 02:31:59.780]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:04.780]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:08.780]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:14.780]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:20.780]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:24.780]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:28.780]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:28.780 --> 02:32:32.780]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:35.780]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:40.780]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:44.780]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:46.780]  One of my oldest sponsors
[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:50.780]  Get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:52.780]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:54.780]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:56.780]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:56.780 --> 02:33:00.780]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:04.780]  From the front lines of the Information War
[02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:06.780]  It's Alex Jones
[02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:10.780]  Cultures go through cycles
[02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:15.780]  And we are in a very deep cycle of decadence and corruption
[02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:21.780]  Mixed with nuclear weapons, bioweapons, high-tech surveillance, television brainwashing
[02:33:21.780 --> 02:33:24.780]  We're all living an experiment here
[02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:31.780]  And as we went to break, Alfred Adask was making the point that his maxim is
[02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:34.780]  It is American to not trust your government
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:36.780]  Well, that is as American as Apple Pie
[02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:39.780]  But that's alien to some new listeners
[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:42.780]  That shows how domesticated many of us have become
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:45.780]  Alfred, please continue repeating what you said
[02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:47.780]  You have the floor
[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:50.780]  You look at, I mean, the genius of the American Constitution
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:53.780]  And there's things to complain about it and maybe some flaws
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:59.780]  But as originally drafted, the genius is that it's an anti-government document
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:02.780]  The reason we have separation of powers
[02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:07.780]  Is so the three branches of governments fight amongst each other and don't fight with us
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:11.780]  The reason we have the right to keep and bear arms is to protect us against the government
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:16.780]  The reason for freedom of speech and freedom of the press is not so we can read gossip
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:20.780]  About what they're doing on the new housewives of New York or some damn thing
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:24.780]  It's about telling people what someone saw in the government
[02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:26.780]  Somebody saw something, the government's doing something wrong
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:30.780]  Talk about it, it's intended every bit of that
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:32.780]  The reason we have elections every two years
[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:36.780]  If we really trusted the government, why don't we just elect these guys one time
[02:34:36.780 --> 02:34:38.780]  And they stay there until they die
[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:42.780]  It's because we give them two years at the max, at least at Congress
[02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:45.780]  And you better watch your step or we'll throw you out
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:51.780]  Every bit of that Congress, every bit of the Constitution was designed to protect us from government
[02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:56.780]  They recognized it's a necessary evil, but they did not trust the government
[02:34:56.780 --> 02:35:03.780]  Let me read a section here from the, there's a preamble to the bill of rights
[02:35:03.780 --> 02:35:06.780]  And it explains the purpose of the bill of rights
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:09.780]  You can look this up on the internet, it's not usually published, but you can find it
[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:13.780]  You can go to the internet and just enter preamble to the bill of rights
[02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:17.780]  And you'll get this, and it's only, I don't know, 50-100 words or something like that
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:21.780]  It says resolved by the Senate, it says the conventions of a number of states
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:24.780]  Having at the time they're adopting a Constitution expressed a desire
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:29.780]  In order to prevent misconstruction abuse of its powers
[02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:31.780]  Meaning the powers of the Constitution
[02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.780]  The further restrictive and declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:40.780]  Those declaratory and restrictive clauses are the first ten amendments
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:44.780]  Their purpose is to prevent abuse of the Constitution
[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:50.780]  Who could abuse the Constitution except federal officers, officials, and employees
[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:56.780]  The only people who can abuse the powers of the Constitution are the people who have them to exercise
[02:35:56.780 --> 02:36:02.780]  And that tells us that the purpose of the first ten amendments was to protect the people of the states against the federal government
[02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:05.780]  They didn't trust the government as far as they could throw it
[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:08.780]  They said we gotta have one, but we don't trust the SOBs
[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:10.780]  And what's the reason for the second amendment?
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:13.780]  To protect us against the federal government
[02:36:13.780 --> 02:36:22.780]  It says so by implication right there in the preamble to the bill of rights
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:26.780]  And it's what I would try to talk about on that 60 minutes interview
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:32.780]  And they brought me in because I said oh the purpose of the second amendment is to shoot people in the government
[02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:34.780]  And I said yeah and here's why
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:40.780]  But it's not intended to be a license just go out and start shooting cops and judges and whatever
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:47.780]  It is the means of protecting yourself from despotism
[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:53.780]  If and when the government becomes despotic and tyrannical, it's like it says in the Declaration of Independence
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:56.780]  It's your right, it's your duty to throw off that government
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:59.780]  The second amendment is the means to throw off that government
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:03.780]  If the government becomes despotic, second amendment kicks in
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:06.780]  It doesn't mean you go shoot every cop you can find, that's never been my point
[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:10.780]  But the point is if they are despotic, second amendment
[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:18.780]  If I could or not, I was sent the internal FEMA footage from Kansas City in 2000 where FEMA gets up in front of cops
[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:22.780]  And firemen and teaches them the founding fathers were terrorists
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:26.780]  The Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence is an evil document
[02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:33.780]  They are openly saying in some of these federal documents we've gotten
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:37.780]  That those that make frequent references to the U.S. Constitution
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:42.780]  All the cops have sworn an oath to that and now we have the Indiana Supreme Court
[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:48.780]  I don't know if you saw that ruling but the lead judge said cops can come in for any reason or no reason at all
[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:50.780]  There is no fourth amendment
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:55.780]  This is open despotism, this is open evil
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:38:00.780]  And the police more and more are caught just pulling people over, stealing cash out of their wallets
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:02.780]  You heard me run through that raft earlier
[02:38:02.780 --> 02:38:07.780]  And now on the TSA website blogger Bob, the official voice of them
[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:11.780]  Says that Texas, it doesn't matter what you say
[02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:18.780]  We have article 6 clause 2 prevents states from regulating the federal government
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:23.780]  I mean that is on its head claiming that the commerce clause, the supremacy clause
[02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:27.780]  Gives them all this power only in the issuance of currency
[02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:30.780]  Only in the Navy and only in protecting the borders
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:34.780]  I mean why even have states if they are so busy
[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:41.780]  I mean look until 1913 the state's legislatures voted and picked the U.S. Senators
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:46.780]  That shows the power of the states, they ran the Senate, they ran the veto
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:49.780]  And now they are telling us states have no power
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:54.780]  We will stick our hands down your pants and we don't care if the state of Texas unanimously votes
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:39:00.780]  In one of the houses to say don't stick your hands down people's pants, well that's already illegal
[02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:05.780]  And the feds laugh and giggle on a blog about it
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:12.780]  Well there is a reason to believe that what passes for state government right now may not be state government
[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:16.780]  It may be a territorial government
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:20.780]  It may be a territorial government and under article 4 section 3 clause 2
[02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:25.780]  The federal constitution that Congress has exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the territories
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:30.780]  I strongly suspect, I can't prove it, but I strongly suspect that what passes for Texas today
[02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:34.780]  They presume it to be a territory rather than a state of the union
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:38.780]  Part of the reason for that, article 1 section 10 clause 1
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:46.780]  It says in part, no state shall make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:52.780]  Now how does the government of the state of Texas function without gold and silver
[02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:55.780]  The constitution has never been amended to eliminate that clause
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:39:58.780]  And it doesn't apply to territories and it doesn't apply to federal government
[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:00.780]  It's a territorial script
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:05.780]  Yeah, that's right, and they have, by taking the gold and silver out of circulation
[02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:10.780]  I think what they have done is they've rendered the du jour government of the state of the union
[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:14.780]  I think they've rendered them insolvent and unfunctional
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:17.780]  And they've done what some sort of a territorial setup
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:21.780]  No, they created the state police in 33 under federal auspices
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.780]  They went and financed it basically as part of the federal receivership
[02:40:25.780 --> 02:40:31.780]  And they took territorial law that had already been perfected out west and exported it as the federal model
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:38.780]  It's not just your theory, I've read in the federal rulings where they talk about force majeure, force du jour, admiralty law
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:42.780]  This is how they're operating, it's how the cops seize cash out of your wallet
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:49.780]  When no drugs or no arrest is made, they're operating under the federal mandates
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:57.780]  As state police as part of their agreements with the feds to get 80% receivership back of the money
[02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:01.780]  If they go through the feds and not the state, they're operating under admiralty
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:04.780]  Yeah, the world continues
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:08.780]  Well, let me give you, here's a cause dear to my heart
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:13.780]  I was sued by the Attorney General of the State of Texas for $25,000 a day
[02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:18.780]  That's $9 million a year for the manufacturing distribution of a controlled substance
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:21.780]  It's not cocaine or methamphetamine or any of that
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:30.780]  I was fiduciary for a trust that leased some equipment, just tables and chairs to a corporation that was manufacturing, colloidal silver
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:38.780]  They brought me in as the last of seven defendants, the case started in 2001, last of 2007
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:45.780]  I was the last one added, first three defendants hired attorneys, they paid them $160,000 for defense
[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:49.780]  All they did is drive them into bankruptcy, first three defendants went into bankruptcy
[02:41:49.780 --> 02:41:52.780]  Two of them, husband and wife, divorced, split, they're gone
[02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:57.780]  I got involved in this and read the relevant drug laws because that's what we're charged under
[02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:04.780]  And under the Texas Health and Safety Code, section 431.002, subparagraph 14
[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:10.780]  It says, drug means, articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopia, yada, yada, yada
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:19.780]  Articles intended or designed for use in the diagnosis, cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals
[02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:26.780]  And the first time I saw a man or other animals, I thought, what the damn fools, I don't even know what they're writing
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:29.780]  These means they presume man to be an animal
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:33.780]  No, that's an inside joke by them, but let me expand on that
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:40.780]  They put last year in the Food Safety Act, written by Big Pharma, they gave $17 million in just a one week period
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:44.780]  Written by Big Pharma and Big Agribusiness to shut down local farms and ranches
[02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:51.780]  Codex Alimentarius, that that entire European Union, EU Act, would be implemented
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:56.780]  Luckily, it's been defeated so far, but Europe is now implemented, you can pull up the headlines
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:43:00.780]  Hundreds of herbal remedies, vitamins banned from over the counter sale
[02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:07.780]  And so, yes, they are saying under this, they've had SWAT teams raid aloe vera farms
[02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:08.780]  That's exactly right
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:11.780]  I mean, these people are mafia, it's very simple
[02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:17.780]  We found it in 23 separate laws at the state and federal level that applied directly to our case
[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:21.780]  I realized the significance, you can't declare me to be an animal
[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:28.780]  Because my Bible says that Genesis 1, 26 through 28, on the sixth day God created man in his image
[02:43:28.780 --> 02:43:31.780]  And gave man dominion over the animals
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:35.780]  As a Christian, or a Jew, and probably even as a Muslim
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:39.780]  The government can't declare us to be animals without violating our freedom of religion
[02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:44.780]  I made a religious freedom defense, I created a religious freedom defense to this case
[02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:50.780]  That the attorney general had spent almost half a million dollars on in six years
[02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:54.780]  And I drafted a religious freedom defense to this, and I said, you can't call me an animal
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:56.780]  Your law doesn't apply to me
[02:43:56.780 --> 02:43:57.780]  And they dropped the case
[02:43:57.780 --> 02:43:58.780]  Let me stop you
[02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:03.780]  Feds win 98% of the time now, because they have special kept juries
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:07.780]  How did Alfred Adask defeat these demons?
[02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:10.780]  Well, we advance, because here's the point
[02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:14.780]  This law, this definition that defines man to be an animal
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:19.780]  And the drug law, it's also found in the definition of medical devices
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:25.780]  It means, just thinking about drugs, the war on drugs is based on the presumption that the people are animals
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:29.780]  The war on drugs gave rise, started by Nixon in 1971
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:32.780]  Gave rise to most of the modern police state
[02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:37.780]  And what do they say in the Godfather, which is a globalist love, because everything's a message
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:41.780]  The mafia's sitting around and they go, we're going to start bringing narcotics in
[02:44:41.780 --> 02:44:43.780]  Don Carleone had to let us do this
[02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:46.780]  And Don Carleone says, I'll lose all my judges and police
[02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:49.780]  They'll deal with hookers and alcohol, because they like that
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:51.780]  But they don't like heroin and cocaine
[02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:55.780]  And the mob boss says, only have it in the colored areas
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:57.780]  They're animals, let them lose their souls
[02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:01.780]  And when you get into globalist doctrine, they believe we're all animals and dumb
[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:03.780]  It's social Darwinism, we deserve this
[02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:07.780]  So they're saying, and you mentioned this is in federal states, I've seen it as well
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:10.780]  Read it again, we are animals, they're saying
[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:15.780]  Man or other animals, we found 23 separate instances that applied to our case
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:18.780]  Laws at both the Texas level and federal level
[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:23.780]  We found it in five other states where we looked, I presume it to be true in all 50 states
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:25.780]  Or at least the vast majority of them
[02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:28.780]  Last night I got an email from someone in Australia
[02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:32.780]  Who's been visiting the website and he's seen the articles I have on Man or Other Animals
[02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:34.780]  And he's looked at the Australian law
[02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:38.780]  The Australian drug law also defines the people to be animals
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:45.780]  Which tells me that this business of presuming the people to be animals is not confined to the United States
[02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:48.780]  No, it's not, it's a legal fiction that they've created
[02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:52.780]  That they then run everything through, then we through contract fraud
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:57.780]  Explain that to people, we sign on, we now agree as indentured servants
[02:45:57.780 --> 02:46:00.780]  A lot of my family came here as slaves, white slaves
[02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:05.780]  They were indentured servants, 7 year, 14 year deals, wherever they signed on to
[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:10.780]  You come here and then they make you buy everything through the contract from the company store
[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:13.780]  They have a strong man that keeps you under their control
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:16.780]  You never basically get off the plantation
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:21.780]  In fact, many historians broke down that white slaves or indentured servants were worse off than blacks
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:26.780]  Because the small 2% that owned slaves that were black wanted to take care of their property
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:29.780]  But white slaves were even worse than that
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:36.780]  I understand this issue is powerful because, for example, our Declaration of Independence
[02:46:36.780 --> 02:46:40.780]  Principles this country has built on, second sentence, we hold these truths to be self-evident
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:45.780]  That all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
[02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:48.780]  Among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[02:46:48.780 --> 02:46:54.780]  Those rights only attached to men and women made in God's image
[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:56.780]  They don't attach to animals
[02:46:56.780 --> 02:47:00.780]  Third sentence of the Declaration says that to secure these rights
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:04.780]  Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of government
[02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:08.780]  When they say that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men
[02:47:08.780 --> 02:47:11.780]  They're telling us that in the vision of the founding fathers
[02:47:11.780 --> 02:47:17.780]  The principal reason for government was to secure to every man, woman, and even unborn child
[02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:22.780]  Those God-given, unalienable rights which attach at the moment of your creation
[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:23.780]  Not your birth
[02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:27.780]  Under the Declaration of Independence Principles, if you're recognized to be a man, a woman
[02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:31.780]  Or even an unborn child made in God's image, they can't abort you
[02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:33.780]  You become the master
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:36.780]  If you are endowed by God, that's the foundation for sovereignty
[02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:40.780]  That's why they changed the definition to fetus
[02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:45.780]  That's why Frank Herbert's book, this globalist philosophy, is that the secret cult group
[02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:48.780]  Then puts you through a ritual to decide if you're a human
[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:50.780]  They see everyone else as animals
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:55.780]  That's what Albert Pike wrote, that most people are animals, steak on the table to be eaten
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:57.780]  This is really Illuminati philosophy
[02:47:57.780 --> 02:48:00.780]  Absolutely, and this is important, powerful stuff
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:03.780]  Again, if this goes out and people understand it
[02:48:03.780 --> 02:48:06.780]  The reason they dropped this is its political dynamite
[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:10.780]  The police state is built in large measure on the drug laws
[02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:13.780]  The drug laws are built on the presumption that the people are animals
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:18.780]  They can't stand in front of a jury and tell them we think you're all a bunch of animals
[02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:22.780]  But tell them that, if you can draft a religious freedom defense against these people
[02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:26.780]  They have to back off, because if this goes public
[02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:29.780]  And you get a case like this that goes all the way to the Supreme Court
[02:48:29.780 --> 02:48:31.780]  And they have to admit that the people aren't animals
[02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:34.780]  They lose the war on drugs, they lose much of the police state
[02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:38.780]  They lose the prison industrial complex
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:41.780]  And of course, big pharmaceuticals are built on this
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:43.780]  Albert, what you've said
[02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:48.780]  Go back to the fact that us not being animals made the image of a creator
[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:50.780]  People don't believe in that or not
[02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:53.780]  The point is that's the law system, that's the precedent
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:55.780]  Is that we're made in the image of God
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:58.780]  We are the sovereigns on this planet
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:49:00.780]  And so the elite can't be above us
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:04.780]  We have inalienable, basic, organic, galactic rights
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:06.780]  Well, that's exactly right
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:09.780]  What people don't understand about sovereignty
[02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:11.780]  The reason the king of France was sovereign
[02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:14.780]  Was because he alone had the divine right of kings
[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:18.780]  He became king in a church ceremony
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:20.780]  He got his rights directly from God
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:25.780]  All the rest were subjects because they did not get their rights directly from God
[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:31.780]  In our country, when it started out, it started with an incredible, profound concept
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:34.780]  They said, no, we hold these truths to be self-evident
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:38.780]  That all men, not just the kings, the individual kings of England and France and Spain and so on
[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:40.780]  All men are created equal
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:44.780]  And endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
[02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:47.780]  With that statement, they made each of us an individual sovereign
[02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:49.780]  It's borne out in Chisholm versus Georgia
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:56.780]  1793 Supreme Court of the United States declared this is to be a nation of sovereigns without subjects
[02:49:56.780 --> 02:49:58.780]  Well, this is the fight
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:01.780]  That makes the government our servant
[02:50:01.780 --> 02:50:04.780]  If you and I are sovereigns, the government is our public servant
[02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:07.780]  If you and I are animals, the government is our master
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:11.780]  Now, notice they don't use terms like public servant or peace officer
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:16.780]  It's law enforcement, it's official, it's authority
[02:50:16.780 --> 02:50:19.780]  This is just nothing but modern slavery
[02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:23.780]  Where they are above the law, they don't pay taxes, they do whatever they want
[02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:25.780]  And don't follow our original just laws
[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:28.780]  And then they make unjust laws for us
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:30.780]  This is the essence of tyranny
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:34.780]  They say we have to obey their law, but they don't have to obey our law
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:37.780]  Again, the hierarchy is God's law, number one, we the people
[02:50:37.780 --> 02:50:42.780]  Our law, number two, and that's the constitutions of the states and the federal government
[02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:44.780]  And finally, we have the government's law
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:46.780]  That's number three, they say we're always subject to that
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:49.780]  But they don't want to be subject to people's law
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:54.780]  This is a, you know, this is cause for shooting revolution if they're not careful
[02:50:54.780 --> 02:50:58.780]  If this goes badly, we're going to have an American spring rather than an Arab spring
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:01.780]  Alfred and Dad, let's talk about that when we come back, powerful
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:04.780]  Do I have garlic breath after I take Alley C?
[02:51:04.780 --> 02:51:08.780]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:13.780]  And the answer is Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:15.780]  And the active ingredient in crushed garlic
[02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:17.780]  But will not give you garlic breath
[02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:19.780]  Scientifically proven in double blind studies
[02:51:19.780 --> 02:51:24.780]  Using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:28.780]  Our powerful Alley C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin
[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:32.780]  Just one tablet of Alley C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves
[02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:36.780]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections
[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:39.780]  And helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol
[02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:41.780]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent
[02:51:41.780 --> 02:51:45.780]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Alley C
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:50.780]  For more information than to order Alley C, call 877-888-7126
[02:51:50.780 --> 02:51:52.780]  Or go to garlichealthproducts.com
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:57.780]  That's 877-888-7126 or garlichealthproducts.com
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:59.780]  Fight back with Alley C
[02:52:02.780 --> 02:52:04.780]  Alex Jones here with key information
[02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:08.780]  The U.S. government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury
[02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:12.780]  Continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:18.780]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S. bonds in order to rebuild its own nation
[02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:22.780]  And the U.S. antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators
[02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:27.780]  The Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S. Treasuries
[02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:29.780]  Will soon be the only buyer left of U.S. Treasuries
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:32.780]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe
[02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:34.780]  That the U.S. Dollar will soon become worthless
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:38.780]  And Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed
[02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:44.780]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter
[02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:47.780]  At www.inflation.us
[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:53.780]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at www.inflation.us
[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:57.780]  To learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:01.780]  He looks five years younger
[02:53:01.780 --> 02:53:04.780]  He doesn't fall asleep at his desk like he used to
[02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:06.780]  He no longer drinks those energy drinks all day
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:08.780]  He used to be gloomy
[02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:09.780]  Now he's upbeat
[02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:11.780]  He obviously has lost weight
[02:53:11.780 --> 02:53:15.780]  He's now drinking Moringa in the morning from bigjo.us
[02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:21.780]  Moringa is a delicious, all-organic, 100% bio-available blend from the Miracle Moringa Tree
[02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:25.780]  Considered by many to be the most nutrient-rich plant ever discovered
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:30.780]  Moringa in the morning will suppress cravings for junk food and energy drinks
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:32.780]  And make you feel like a kid again
[02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:36.780]  Drink Moringa in the morning, available from bigjo.us
[02:53:36.780 --> 02:53:39.780]  That's B-I-G-J-O-E.us
[02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:44.780]  Vibrant health is just a click or call away at bigjo.us
[02:53:44.780 --> 02:53:48.780]  Or 800-503-0515
[02:53:48.780 --> 02:53:52.780]  800-503-0515
[02:53:52.780 --> 02:53:56.780]  That's 800-503-0515
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.780]  Drink Moringa in the morning
[02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:10.780]  There must be some kind of way out of here
[02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:13.780]  I'm gonna have to get Alfred to the desk back on very soon
[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:15.780]  I've heard a show off and on over the years
[02:54:15.780 --> 02:54:17.780]  Red Annie Scheister
[02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.780]  Even one time
[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:21.780]  I wrote an article that got published and I can't remember
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:24.780]  The point is, is that he's been around for a long time
[02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:25.780]  Fighting tyranny
[02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:27.780]  We got him for five minutes in the next hour
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:30.780]  Then our surprise guest is gonna be here any moment now
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:32.780]  With some very good news for everybody
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:34.780]  So stay with us for that into the fourth hour
[02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:36.780]  Of Overdrives where local AMR FM doesn't carry it
[02:54:36.780 --> 02:54:38.780]  InfoWars.com
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:42.780]  First I want to tell you about the National Inflation Association
[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:44.780]  For two-thirds of Americans getting ready to retire
[02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:47.780]  Social Security will be more than 50% of their income
[02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:50.780]  And for 22% of upcoming retirees
[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:52.780]  Social Security will be their only income
[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:55.780]  With massive inflation wipes out the purchasing power
[02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:57.780]  Of American Social Security payments
[02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:00.780]  Retirement in America will become a thing of the past
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:03.780]  And we will see millions of retired senior citizens
[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:05.780]  Re-enter the workforce
[02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:07.780]  Combined with millions of government workers
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:09.780]  Who will soon need to find new jobs and the dollar becomes worthless
[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:11.780]  And the government goes bust
[02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:13.780]  It's nearly impossible for upcoming college graduates
[02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:15.780]  To find a job in the U.S.
[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:18.780]  Go to inflation.us and click on the videos tab
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:20.780]  To see the breakthrough documentary film
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:22.780]  The College Conspiracy
[02:55:22.780 --> 02:55:25.780]  Again that's inflation.us to watch the film today
[02:55:25.780 --> 02:55:29.780]  Now continuing with Alfred Adask
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:31.780]  Alfred, we are at a crossroads
[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:33.780]  The quickening's here
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.780]  The system is trying to break our will
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:39.780]  And we've seen police chiefs in New Jersey and Maryland
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.780]  Say in public statements
[02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:43.780]  Get out there, break their will
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:45.780]  Wear black masks, scare them
[02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:47.780]  Fox News headline, police chief admits
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:49.780]  They want to scare us
[02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:51.780]  First take your shoes off, answer questions
[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:53.780]  Now we're going to squeeze your genitals on the outside
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:55.780]  Now we're going to go inside
[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:57.780]  We're not going to change our gloves
[02:55:57.780 --> 02:55:59.780]  They know that if they can get away with that
[02:55:59.780 --> 02:56:01.780]  They're desperately trying to break our will
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:04.780]  And train us to basically be prisoners
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:06.780]  I agree, I agree
[02:56:06.780 --> 02:56:09.780]  And that's exactly the point then
[02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:11.780]  Is you can't allow that to happen
[02:56:11.780 --> 02:56:14.780]  But the most important thing is you can't succumb to fear
[02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:17.780]  They're trying to scare us, but here's the truth
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:20.780]  The police are outnumbered about 300 to one in this country
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:23.780]  It's only about three-tenths of a percent of the population
[02:56:23.780 --> 02:56:24.780]  That are police officers
[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:26.780]  Same thing with the military
[02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:28.780]  About three-tenths of a percent of the population they're about
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:31.780]  I mean, even if they brought all the military back
[02:56:31.780 --> 02:56:33.780]  And they combined them with all the police
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:36.780]  They're technically outnumbered by at least a hundred to one
[02:56:36.780 --> 02:56:38.780]  On the basis of adults
[02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:40.780]  And what's happening is they're running around
[02:56:40.780 --> 02:56:42.780]  Trying to get everybody to be spies for them
[02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:44.780]  Spies, we're not hiding
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:46.780]  We know who the crooks are
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:48.780]  And the average cops that I talked to are waking up
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:50.780]  The military's waking up
[02:56:50.780 --> 02:56:52.780]  And on one level
[02:56:52.780 --> 02:56:54.780]  This is not an us against them
[02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:56.780]  Meaning us against the police
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:58.780]  The police are standing on the breach on this thing
[02:56:58.780 --> 02:57:00.780]  And they need to make up their mind
[02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:02.780]  Who do they serve and protect?
[02:57:02.780 --> 02:57:04.780]  We do not always serve and protect
[02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:06.780]  But do they serve and protect the government
[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:09.780]  Or do they serve and protect the people of the United States?
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:11.780]  They better understand that the government
[02:57:11.780 --> 02:57:14.780]  Regards them as nothing but disposable
[02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:16.780]  You know, cattle
[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:19.780]  Kissinger wrote a book and called our troops
[02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:20.780]  Dumb animals
[02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:22.780]  That's exactly right
[02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:25.780]  And they will dispose of them fighting with us
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:28.780]  The police really have a lot more in common with the people
[02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:30.780]  Than they do with their employer
[02:57:30.780 --> 02:57:34.780]  And certainly, they can't afford to go to war with the people
[02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:37.780]  You can't pick a war where you're outnumbered 100 to 1
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:38.780]  You can't do that
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:39.780]  You're not going to win this
[02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:41.780]  And I don't care what kind of weapons you got
[02:57:41.780 --> 02:57:42.780]  You can't do it
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:45.780]  100 to 1, bring your best weapon, we'll bring our bricks
[02:57:45.780 --> 02:57:46.780]  You understand?
[02:57:46.780 --> 02:57:48.780]  Here comes 100 bricks coming at you
[02:57:48.780 --> 02:57:51.780]  Well, I've seen that with Vietnam, Afghanistan, anywhere
[02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:55.780]  And the biggest contributors of the military in 2008
[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:57.780]  Were the military to Ron Paul
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:00.780]  And so I, but at the same time
[02:58:00.780 --> 02:58:02.780]  The system does need to know they're in the wrong
[02:58:02.780 --> 02:58:05.780]  We need to quit licking their boots and being afraid to call them out
[02:58:05.780 --> 02:58:09.780]  Because the police everywhere are violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:11.780]  They are enforcing stuff that isn't law
[02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:12.780]  I agree
[02:58:12.780 --> 02:58:15.780]  And it's part of the reason why the object is not simply to go out
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:19.780]  And get yourself a firearm or a dozen firearms and a bunch of bullets
[02:58:19.780 --> 02:58:24.780]  You have to understand the reasons for a rational application of force
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:27.780]  You've got to pick up and understand the fundamentals out of the Constitution
[02:58:27.780 --> 02:58:29.780]  And the Declaration of Independence
[02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:31.780]  Say, wait a second, these are principles
[02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:34.780]  We're not talking about just picking up a gun and shooting out the window
[02:58:34.780 --> 02:58:37.780]  We're talking about you must have reason
[02:58:37.780 --> 02:58:38.780]  That's what Indiana just said
[02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:41.780]  We can do whatever we want to you, you can't resist
[02:58:43.780 --> 02:58:45.780]  Thank you for listening to GCN

[02:59:15.780 --> 02:59:18.780]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:21.780]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:24.780]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[02:59:24.780 --> 02:59:25.780]  And it's a real eye-opener
[02:59:25.780 --> 02:59:27.780]  I can't stress this enough
[02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:29.780]  You should at least watch this free video online today

[03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:20.780]  Alfred Adas
[03:00:20.780 --> 03:00:24.780]  Adas.wordpress.com is our guest for another 5 minutes
[03:00:24.780 --> 03:00:28.780]  And we have our surprise Gaffson studio with some very positive news
[03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:30.780]  But going back to that Indiana ruling
[03:00:30.780 --> 03:00:32.780]  Because that's exactly where Alfred was going
[03:00:32.780 --> 03:00:34.780]  They said in the case
[03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:36.780]  If a cop has no reason at all
[03:00:36.780 --> 03:00:38.780]  To want to bust in your house without a warrant
[03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:39.780]  They have a right to
[03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:41.780]  And you can't even resist
[03:00:41.780 --> 03:00:42.780]  Because the guy reportedly pushed the cop
[03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:44.780]  So they charged him with assaulting the cop
[03:00:44.780 --> 03:00:46.780]  But that goes back to Magna Carta, 1215
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:48.780]  The man's home is his castle
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:50.780]  It's our government, we create the state
[03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:52.780]  We create the federal government
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:53.780]  Then we elect judges
[03:00:53.780 --> 03:00:55.780]  You have to go with evidence to them
[03:00:55.780 --> 03:00:57.780]  Where you're going, what you're going to search
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:58.780]  You've got to have a witness
[03:00:58.780 --> 03:01:00.780]  Who people later have a right to confront
[03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:02.780]  Or the cops don't get the warrant
[03:01:02.780 --> 03:01:04.780]  Now you can't resist the warrant
[03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:06.780]  Because it's a warrant of the people
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:07.780]  And the people's will
[03:01:07.780 --> 03:01:09.780]  But the idea that they can just come
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:10.780]  And do whatever they want
[03:01:10.780 --> 03:01:11.780]  Indiana also just ruled
[03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:14.780]  No-knock warrants for, you know
[03:01:14.780 --> 03:01:15.780]  Unpaid parking tickets
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:17.780]  So it's all about terror
[03:01:17.780 --> 03:01:19.780]  And terrorizing
[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:21.780]  And it's on, Alfred had asked
[03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:24.780]  Insummation
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:27.780]  You just mentioned a man's home
[03:01:27.780 --> 03:01:28.780]  Is his castle
[03:01:28.780 --> 03:01:31.780]  But animals don't have any homes
[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:33.780]  Then they certainly don't have any castles
[03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:35.780]  And so far as the government presumes you
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:36.780]  To be an animal
[03:01:36.780 --> 03:01:37.780]  And so far as their laws say that
[03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:40.780]  You're just livestock on the global plantation
[03:01:40.780 --> 03:01:42.780]  And they can handle you like a chicken
[03:01:42.780 --> 03:01:45.780]  In a Tyson poultry processing plant
[03:01:45.780 --> 03:01:47.780]  And clip your little beak off
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:49.780]  And keep you jammed in with the rest of the chickens
[03:01:49.780 --> 03:01:50.780]  When it's time to harvest
[03:01:50.780 --> 03:01:52.780]  They'll harvest you
[03:01:52.780 --> 03:01:53.780]  If you're an animal
[03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:55.780]  And they say in all the writings
[03:01:55.780 --> 03:01:56.780]  If you let them do it
[03:01:56.780 --> 03:01:57.780]  You are an animal
[03:01:57.780 --> 03:01:59.780]  Yeah, that's what it does
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:00.780]  I understand
[03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:02.780]  I don't know how much time we have left
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:03.780]  But where this goes is
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:04.780]  If you go to a business
[03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:08.780]  There's a place called GenocideWatch.org
[03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:10.780]  And they have a document up there
[03:02:10.780 --> 03:02:11.780]  That's entitled
[03:02:11.780 --> 03:02:13.780]  Eight Stages of Genocide
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:15.780]  And the third stage in genocide
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:16.780]  To commit genocide
[03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:18.780]  It's not necessary that you kill anyone
[03:02:18.780 --> 03:02:20.780]  It's only necessary under the genocide law
[03:02:20.780 --> 03:02:22.780]  That you create circumstances where
[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:24.780]  A particular group or race
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:27.780]  Or whatever is more likely to die
[03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:30.780]  And the third stage in the genocide law
[03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:34.780]  Is dehumanization
[03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:35.780]  And they specifically say
[03:02:35.780 --> 03:02:37.780]  When they reduce people to the status
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:39.780]  Of animals, insect, or vermin
[03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:41.780]  It's an act of genocide
[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:42.780]  For example, when the Hutus
[03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:44.780]  Decide to kill all the Tutsis
[03:02:44.780 --> 03:02:45.780]  The first thing they do is say
[03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:47.780]  The Tutsis are all a bunch of animals
[03:02:47.780 --> 03:02:49.780]  And when they're animals
[03:02:49.780 --> 03:02:50.780]  You can kill them all
[03:02:50.780 --> 03:02:51.780]  You can kill the women
[03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:52.780]  You can kill the children
[03:02:52.780 --> 03:02:54.780]  You can kill the non-combatants
[03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:55.780]  You can exterminate them
[03:02:55.780 --> 03:02:56.780]  Like a nest of wasps
[03:02:56.780 --> 03:02:58.780]  Because they are animals
[03:02:58.780 --> 03:02:59.780]  That's what the Nazis said
[03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:01.780]  If you go back to the Israelites
[03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:04.780]  The Israelites 3,000 years ago
[03:03:04.780 --> 03:03:05.780]  Went into areas and said
[03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:06.780]  These people are animals
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:08.780]  Our government, by that definition
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:10.780]  You apply the facts of the drug laws
[03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:12.780]  The medical device laws
[03:03:12.780 --> 03:03:14.780]  This goes back as far as 1906
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:15.780]  And I'm going to be able to find
[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:17.780]  In the Food and Drug Act of 1906
[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:18.780]  That's where this started out
[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:20.780]  They presume the people to be animals
[03:03:20.780 --> 03:03:23.780]  You apply those facts to the law of genocide
[03:03:23.780 --> 03:03:25.780]  And you conclude that the government
[03:03:25.780 --> 03:03:27.780]  Of the United States right now
[03:03:27.780 --> 03:03:29.780]  Is committing genocide against
[03:03:29.780 --> 03:03:31.780]  The American people
[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:35.780]  Technically they are guilty of genocide
[03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:37.780]  To me that's a pretty big story
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:38.780]  And there's evidence
[03:03:38.780 --> 03:03:39.780]  I mean if you can lay this out
[03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:41.780]  And show people here's what we got
[03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:42.780]  You make up your mind
[03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:43.780]  Don't believe me
[03:03:43.780 --> 03:03:44.780]  I'll show you the law
[03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:45.780]  You make up your mind
[03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:46.780]  Well you know Alfred had asked
[03:03:46.780 --> 03:03:48.780]  I've always known this
[03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:50.780]  And briefly talked about it here and there
[03:03:50.780 --> 03:03:52.780]  But the way you codify it is so powerful
[03:03:52.780 --> 03:03:53.780]  And as you're speaking
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:03:55.780]  I think of thousands of examples
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:57.780]  Of where this is in universal law
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:03:58.780]  Through every culture
[03:03:58.780 --> 03:04:00.780]  The priest class of the Aztecs
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:01.780]  When they were chopping people's hearts out
[03:04:01.780 --> 03:04:03.780]  Said that these are animals
[03:04:03.780 --> 03:04:05.780]  We're gods
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:06.780]  You know it's more than that
[03:04:06.780 --> 03:04:07.780]  Not just we're men you're animals
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:09.780]  We're gods you're animals
[03:04:09.780 --> 03:04:11.780]  And this is the new world order religion
[03:04:11.780 --> 03:04:13.780]  Absolutely
[03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:14.780]  Absolutely this is powerful stuff
[03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:16.780]  It's not just a curiosity
[03:04:16.780 --> 03:04:19.780]  It goes to something that is fundamental
[03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:22.780]  That's been going on for thousands of years
[03:04:22.780 --> 03:04:23.780]  Are you animals
[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:25.780]  Or are you men and women made in God's image
[03:04:25.780 --> 03:04:27.780]  Are we men or mice
[03:04:27.780 --> 03:04:29.780]  That's exactly what it comes down to
[03:04:29.780 --> 03:04:30.780]  If you're mice you can be slaughtered
[03:04:30.780 --> 03:04:32.780]  And there's no reason why you shouldn't be
[03:04:32.780 --> 03:04:34.780]  Well I'm not a slave
[03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:35.780]  We're not your slaves
[03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:36.780]  As I've always said
[03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:38.780]  And they're trying to train us to be slaves
[03:04:38.780 --> 03:04:40.780]  And turn us into gibbering idiots
[03:04:40.780 --> 03:04:42.780]  Hooked into all their propaganda
[03:04:42.780 --> 03:04:44.780]  Incredible interview Alfred Adask
[03:04:44.780 --> 03:04:45.780]  We're going to let you go
[03:04:45.780 --> 03:04:47.780]  That we will interview you
[03:04:47.780 --> 03:04:49.780]  Very soon my friend
[03:04:49.780 --> 03:04:50.780]  And be safe
[03:04:50.780 --> 03:04:51.780]  I know why they're so scared of you
[03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:53.780]  And have 60 minutes coming after you
[03:04:53.780 --> 03:04:54.780]  And others
[03:04:54.780 --> 03:04:56.780]  You are definitely a force to be reckoned with
[03:04:56.780 --> 03:04:57.780]  I salute you
[03:04:57.780 --> 03:04:58.780]  We'll be right back
[03:04:58.780 --> 03:05:00.780]  Thank you sir
[03:05:00.780 --> 03:05:03.780]  Fear of falling is the number one reason
[03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:05.780]  Seniors leave the home they love
[03:05:05.780 --> 03:05:08.780]  And millions of aging Americans can no longer enjoy

[03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:32.780]  Well, the man who created this video has been right
[03:06:32.780 --> 03:06:34.780]  About many predictions in his career
[03:06:34.780 --> 03:06:36.780]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM
[03:06:36.780 --> 03:06:39.780]  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner
[03:06:39.780 --> 03:06:40.780]  General growth properties
[03:06:40.780 --> 03:06:43.780]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy

[03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:30.780]  Well, Dr. Paul Conant is here and he's got another local doctor
[03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:32.780]  Who's with the group fighting the forwardation of water here with him
[03:08:32.780 --> 03:08:34.780]  And I know you've been in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Europe
[03:08:34.780 --> 03:08:36.780]  Here in the US traveling all over the place
[03:08:36.780 --> 03:08:38.780]  So that's why we're doing the free video with us for a couple segments
[03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:40.780]  And we're gonna do another interview in our new studio
[03:08:40.780 --> 03:08:43.780]  Dr. Paul Conant is a PhD from Dartmouth College
[03:08:43.780 --> 03:08:46.780]  And joined the faculty at St. Lawrence University in 83
[03:08:46.780 --> 03:08:49.780]  Conant's opposition to
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:53.780]  The way they're handling the solid waste
[03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:55.780]  Basically fluoride dumping in our water
[03:08:55.780 --> 03:08:56.780]  Has gotten international attention
[03:08:56.780 --> 03:08:59.780]  In the websites fluoridealert.org
[03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:02.780]  And he's here in Austin, Texas, tonight
[03:09:02.780 --> 03:09:04.780]  Speaking to the city council and others
[03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:10.240]  He also is going to be speaking tonight at 7 p.m. at 1904 Guadaloupe Street and City
[03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:16.960]  Hall Wednesday 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and then there's another little factoid here 10% of
[03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:23.200]  children in 1940 had dental fluorosis 45% of kids have it now and since you were last
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:27.720]  in studio with us I have a few very exciting positive things to talk about that I want
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:28.720]  you to address.
[03:09:28.720 --> 03:09:35.500]  EPA proposes phase out a fluoride based pesticide and they admit it bioaccumulates and attacks
[03:09:35.500 --> 03:09:41.760]  all the organs in the body that just came out a few months ago on the same day US wants
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:48.600]  to reduce fluoride and drinking water from 1.2 to 0.7 parts per million and they're
[03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:54.720]  admitting increase of dental fluorosis bone cancer all of this so but I wonder when you
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:59.280]  speak to the city council this time will they laugh at you because they don't do any research
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:03.520]  they don't have any facts they just pay a million bucks of taxpayer money every year
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:09.760]  to get a toxic waste that they'd have to store somewhere why not just put it in our water
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:16.120]  and give us bone cancer and laugh at us because we're animals after all dr. Connick well unfortunately
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:21.920]  what happens with these councils is they will defer to their local health officer and without
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:27.920]  realizing the local health officer with the issue of fluoridation is simply a mouthpiece
[03:10:27.920 --> 03:10:34.000]  a clockwork toy if you like for federal policy that whence the US public health service
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:39.360]  endorse fluoridation a lot of things ensued today we have the center of disease control
[03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:43.080]  telling everybody that fluoridation is the best thing since sliced bread it's the one
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:47.880]  of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century and quite frankly the people
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:52.520]  in the middle of these bureaucracies in the chain of command if they were to come out
[03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:57.680]  against this policy they would be out of work tomorrow that's what you got to remember
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:03.000]  they're out of work if they don't support policy they are trained bureaucrats are trained
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:09.400]  not to question policy their job is to promote policy and that's unfortunately the so when
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:15.040]  you have councils who don't have medical degrees scientific degrees or dental degrees they
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:20.880]  are they have to choose between these group of concerned citizens and their health officer
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:25.360]  and unfortunately they appear to be siding with the health officer even though he doesn't
[03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:30.320]  have the science to support his case and that person's a politician to the big chemical
[03:11:30.320 --> 03:11:36.640]  lobbies want us to pay for their toxic waste it of course has the degenerative and population
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:42.920]  reduction qualities of infertility and IQ reduction that the eugenics is favored but
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:47.680]  getting into the pure science what do you make of all these big moves by the government
[03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:53.720]  quietly to start reducing the amount of fluoride well two things happened in January the 7th
[03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:57.880]  the one you heard about was that the Department of Health and Human Services was lowering
[03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:04.920]  the standard to point seven the amount recommended to fight tooth decay a few days later we heard
[03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:10.280]  that the EPA pesticide division had withdrawn its support for sulfur or fluoride that was
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:14.800]  been an eight-year battle from the fluoride action network we've been fighting that it
[03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:18.680]  was clear from the very beginning that they didn't have a leg to stand on because kids
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:24.160]  were already being overexposed to fluoride so whatever reference dose so-called safe
[03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:29.720]  dose that you can come up with children are already exceeding it so there's no way that
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:35.560]  the EPA legally could have permitted sulfur or fluoride but the pesticide division and
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:41.320]  the water division working together had two choices were they going to pull the rug out
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:46.040]  of Dow agro sciences and their use of sulfur or fluoride or were they going to pull the
[03:12:46.040 --> 03:12:51.520]  rug away from the water fluoridation program because the major source of fluoride which
[03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:57.600]  is exceeding the safe limits and preventing sulfur or fluoride from being used is water
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:02.560]  fluoridation so if they pull the rug from underneath the water fluoridation program
[03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:07.240]  Dow agro sciences could have continued to use sulfur or fluoride but they didn't do that
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:14.120]  they pulled the rug from out of out from under Dow and continued to support fluoridation
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:21.280]  so when you got the statement from the EPA office of water the death sentence was we
[03:13:21.280 --> 03:13:27.200]  are going to protect children's health at the same time protect children's teeth and
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:31.480]  that's a way of telling you that they're not going to do honest science here and they
[03:13:31.480 --> 03:13:37.240]  clearly they're not doing honest science because they haven't considered the 24 IQ studies
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:42.960]  since I was in the studio there's been an update on one study and a new study indicating
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:49.040]  at low levels of fluoride children's IQ is being lowered in China so they're ignoring
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:54.600]  all that so they are saying Alex they are saying that the the the most sensitive end
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:14:02.560]  point of fluoride toxicity is severe dental fluorosis and they they claim to be able to
[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:07.560]  protect against that they didn't use a margin of safety in their calculations they didn't
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:13.440]  get that it was incredible the whole thing is but the fact is the stone wall the Berlin
[03:14:13.440 --> 03:14:18.240]  wall is cracking yes they're having to respond what about us saying don't use it as a pesticide
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:23.720]  because from my research that's where it really is building up yeah with this they were allowing
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:28.680]  incredible levels of fluoride residues a child with sulfur fluoride is it when you use it
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:32.960]  on food to protect food you leave residues of fluoride and that's what got them and the
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:38.440]  levels that they were permitting like 125 parts per million in wheat flour well think of all
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:43.800]  the things you make for wheat flour but pizza dough biscuits I could make cookies cakes
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:50.720]  bread I mean 125 parts per million we could have kids vomiting just a few parts per millions
[03:14:50.720 --> 03:14:54.680]  reducing IQs I mean no wonder you I mean I talked a lot of professors that have been
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:59.000]  teaching a long time and they say people are not as sharp as they were even 20 30 years
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:04.680]  ago and it's because we've got brain damaged zombies we also have television no insult
[03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:08.160]  to you I mean commercial time oh no you're right you're right yeah that's dumbing down
[03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:13.480]  the people so no we've had some tremendous victories and Canada is the place where things
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:19.400]  are happening I think it's a race between Canada New Zealand and Ireland I was in Dublin
[03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:23.840]  just a few days ago I think it's a race between those three countries as to which country cracks
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:28.720]  first because they don't want to be lobotomized but the big chemical industry is pushing pushing
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:35.840]  pushing give us a survey of your your travels around the world okay well let's start with
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:40.320]  Canada where I launched we launched the book in Toronto we've got the two wings of Canada
[03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:46.480]  essentially fluoride free British Columbia and Quebec essentially fluoride free we had
[03:15:46.480 --> 03:15:53.520]  a major victory in October when Waterloo Waterloo about five or five or six hundred
[03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:59.760]  thousand people voted out fluoridation by a tight whisker but it was very important and
[03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:06.080]  then just a few days ago the final ratification that Calgary in Alberta has stopped fluoridation
[03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:12.240]  it's finished as of May 19th it's out so the hoax is imploding lago vista outside Austin
[03:16:12.240 --> 03:16:17.200]  I was reading is moving to not have it a San Diego has put a hold on putting it in correct
[03:16:17.200 --> 03:16:21.440]  I'm not sure about San Diego they had they had gone ahead the government had gone ahead
[03:16:21.440 --> 03:16:27.160]  despite enormous protests I was I was there in San Diego again launching the book last
[03:16:27.160 --> 03:16:31.800]  time I saw it just a few like a month ago there was a hold but perhaps that's been overturned
[03:16:31.800 --> 03:16:35.720]  well what happened was that the Commissioner the Commission five I think they call this
[03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:42.480]  tobacco money tobacco tax money is being used to finance the operations of fluoridation
[03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:48.240]  in California so when when a committee they can't put fluoride in the water unless they
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:53.200]  got a private source of funding and so this Commission five the tobacco money which actually
[03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:58.360]  is tax money so that was illegal but they're using this tobacco five money to Commission
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:03.280]  five money to because they care so much about our teeth but yeah but they've cut back and
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:07.560]  they've had a cut back on their funding of all kinds of programs but guess which one was
[03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:12.680]  not cut back fluoridation so they cut back on all kinds of clinics and other important
[03:17:12.680 --> 03:17:18.960]  things that they were supporting but apparently they've left the fluoridation and as you were
[03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:24.080]  saying all over the world we're seeing major headway oh absolutely I've just been as you
[03:17:24.080 --> 03:17:30.400]  said in Australia New Zealand the responses from the audiences compared to last time is
[03:17:30.400 --> 03:17:37.120]  huge double triple the audiences incredible amount of enthusiasm organization fan New
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:41.360]  Zealand is making great strides we had very good meetings council meetings where both
[03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:46.880]  sides were heard at length so we've got my fingers crossed in particularly New Zealand
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:56.160]  and Canada what does it signify though that they're I mean they Stonewall and I know I've
[03:17:56.160 --> 03:18:01.200]  gone back to this twice but the fact that they're now having to back up and say okay
[03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:04.640]  we're going to stop using it for pesticide we're going to cut it in the water I mean
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:08.400]  that's got to add a lot of weight for people like you and other doctors when they go before
[03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:12.560]  city councils and they smirk and laugh well why are they cutting the levels then yes right
[03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:17.920]  well they can't deny that American children are overexposed of fluoride this is what they
[03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:26.240]  said 41 percent of children age 12 to 15 have some form of dental phlerosis 41 percent and that's
[03:18:26.240 --> 03:18:31.680]  all American kids that's an average of kids living in non-fluoridated and fluoridated so the kids in
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:37.520]  the fluoridated communities are probably over 50 percent now have dental phlerosis and remember when
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:43.280]  they started this in 1945 they thought just 10 percent of children would have dental phlerosis
[03:18:43.280 --> 03:18:50.960]  in its very mild form now we have 3.6 percent of American children with either moderate or
[03:18:50.960 --> 03:18:59.040]  severe dental phlerosis that's a hundred percent of the tooth enamel discolored and indented and
[03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:04.400]  in the severe form made brittle and imagine what it's doing to the bones and imagine what it's
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:11.440]  doing to the brains I mean this has been the whole point you know to add absurdity on absurdity
[03:19:11.440 --> 03:19:18.320]  fluoridation should have ended in 1999 when the central disease control conceded that the major
[03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:24.400]  benefit of fluoride is topical my goodness it works on the outside of the tooth not from inside the
[03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:31.440]  body why on earth once you know that are you forcing it on people that don't want it when anybody
[03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:36.080]  can get fluoridated toothpaste if they want it it's universally available it's difficult to get
[03:19:36.080 --> 03:19:42.160]  non-fluoridated toothpaste why force it on people that don't want it and why expose every tissue
[03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:47.920]  in the body if this stuff works topically well that's I've made the joke but it's not funny
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:52.480]  that'd be like drinking sunscreen instead of putting it on your skin absolutely dr connet let's
[03:19:53.280 --> 03:19:57.360]  let's talk about what you think is most important in this final quick segment on the other side
[03:19:57.360 --> 03:20:00.160]  so glad to have you here in town speaking at brave new books tonight

[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:14.720]  know they're trying to crucify dr andrew wakefield would just cooked up baloney that he lied about
[03:24:14.720 --> 03:24:20.160]  there being an autism link to the marisol mercury when all these other separate institutions have
[03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:24.400]  found the same thing and now he's learned that government institutions learned it before he
[03:24:24.400 --> 03:24:30.320]  even did separately so he's he's not engaged in fraud they just say it the moon is made of cheese
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:37.120]  andrew wakefield's a fraud well dr connet just pointed out vaccine autism research paul thorson
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:43.840]  indicted for fraud for two million dollars sent by the u.s government to basically come out and
[03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:48.000]  say the marisol it mad for you that was the research we've played where they say mercury's
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:52.720]  good for kids contrary to what we thought and it turns out he just took the money for the research
[03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:58.080]  didn't do it and just told him what they wanted and now he's been indicted uh vaccine autism
[03:24:58.080 --> 03:25:04.000]  researcher paul thorson indicted for fraud but no discussion of andrew wakefield and then i was
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:08.800]  just showing you h e b water but every brand has it i mean you go to stores in the water section
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:14.720]  it's for your baby for your school children uh you need purified water and there's a heart on it so
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:20.640]  it must be good for the baby uh and and according to studies i've seen doctor the florida is an
[03:25:20.640 --> 03:25:27.280]  even bigger effect on small children yeah i mean this is absurd it says purified water with fluoride
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:34.160]  added uh as i'm i'm believe it to me and this is almost a criminal act we know that the original
[03:25:34.160 --> 03:25:39.600]  idea that you have to give fluoride to babies because it accumulates supposed to accumulate in
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:46.720]  the enamel before the teeth have erupted in 1999 the center disease control came back and said whoops
[03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:52.800]  we were wrong not enough fluoride is accumulating in the enamel to protect them when they finally
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:59.600]  erupt in the mouth the main benefits are topical after the tooth have erupted but what we also know
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:05.360]  is so whilst this is not going to do your baby's teeth any good it's going to do them harm because
[03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:11.040]  it's the first year of life which is most sensitive in terms of developing this dental ferocious
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:17.920]  that's what they've said the a d a actually sent out a e-gram to their members saying to recommend
[03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:24.720]  to parents not to use fluoridated water to make up baby formula so the a d a is saying don't do it
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:28.880]  and then the c d c followed wapson with some mealy mouth that when they make these statements
[03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:34.560]  they're always very careful well try to not um undermine the fluoridation program well was it
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:39.440]  six years ago that the american dental association came out and said under fives don't use fluoride
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:44.320]  toothpaste yeah yeah and on the back of a tube of toothpaste it says keep out of the reach of
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:49.360]  children under six but you can tell the city council that they're just going to laugh and say hey we
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:55.040]  can get formula one racing of their brain damaged yeah get it through this is this is terrible this
[03:26:55.040 --> 03:27:01.360]  is terrible and parents are not being warned nor are black families being warned that black children
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:07.760]  are more sensitive than white children to developing dental ferocious oh and by the same token and
[03:27:07.760 --> 03:27:12.560]  hispanic children this is what they show that the rates of dental ferocious amongst black children
[03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:18.800]  and hispanic children is higher than white children in a given community but the n double acp and
[03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:23.600]  lulac and all them are funded by uh dial chemical and others i've seen it listed so they're going
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:29.600]  to tell them you fight the evil white man you take more fluoride but you know the good news on that
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:36.560]  front is that we've had two major leaders black leaders in atlanta andrew young who's who former
[03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:43.200]  ambassadors united nations whose father was a dentist was previously pro fluoridation when he
[03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:49.760]  heard these facts that blacks are unduly risky have greater risks than white children from at
[03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:54.080]  least dental ferocious and probably other health effects he's come out against it made a public
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:28:00.320]  statement calling for georgia to stop having mandatory fluoridation and then a few days ago
[03:28:00.320 --> 03:28:06.720]  dr marty luther king's daughter beaches came out against fluoridation so this is a major
[03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:11.600]  development in the black community and there's so much other good news you've got we're going to go
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:16.960]  to a taped interview that'll be on prisonplanet.tv later in a few days and uh i'm glad that you
