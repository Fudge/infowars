[00:00.000 --> 00:14.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, December 6, 2020.
[00:14.360 --> 00:21.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting live from the Info Wars World Headquarters
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.520]  in Austin, Texas.
[00:24.520 --> 00:27.920]  Sitting in studio for Alex today, I'm Owen Schreuer.
[00:27.920 --> 00:34.880]  We will be hearing a special report from Alex coming up in the next segment.
[00:34.880 --> 00:43.080]  I've got big, special guest, intelligence expert, insider, international expert, insider
[00:43.080 --> 00:47.640]  Steve Puchenek is going to be joining me coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:47.640 --> 00:52.280]  And then Ali Alexander with the latest news developing on the Stop the Steel movement.
[00:52.280 --> 00:55.840]  And of course, he was front row at President Trump's rally last night as well, will be
[00:55.840 --> 01:00.360]  joining me in the third hour.
[01:00.360 --> 01:05.040]  A lot of important news to cover and little time to do it in between the guests.
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.640]  So let me try to combine two major election stories right now in this short segment before
[01:10.640 --> 01:16.040]  we have a special report from Alex on the other side.
[01:16.040 --> 01:20.840]  President Trump multiple times now has announced that he won the election.
[01:20.840 --> 01:27.640]  Of course, you probably realize that anybody with a free thinking brain or observation
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.480]  skills who has been paying attention knows that President Trump won the 2020 election.
[01:32.480 --> 01:39.680]  And if it wasn't for massive election fraud, voter fraud and straight up fake news, he
[01:39.680 --> 01:44.320]  would have been announced the winner on election night.
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.560]  But he's once again put out a statement saying I won the election big on Twitter.
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.600]  Now here is the rub.
[01:51.600 --> 01:57.840]  Here is the interesting phenomenon that you are witnessing right now that is illustrative
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.280]  of everything that's coming in the very near future.
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.200]  If we don't overthrow the fake results of a Biden victory, get Trump in for another four
[02:08.200 --> 02:17.560]  years and continue the America first platform, which values human freedom, rugged individualism
[02:17.560 --> 02:24.480]  and empowers the individual more so than a governing body or a corporate government,
[02:24.480 --> 02:26.560]  which is where we're going, which is what this is all about.
[02:26.560 --> 02:31.000]  Now, when President Trump makes a statement on Twitter like I won the election big as
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.720]  he just did hours ago, Twitter puts up a statement that says this claim about election fraud
[02:35.720 --> 02:37.280]  is disputed.
[02:37.280 --> 02:40.800]  Now they won't put that up about any other claim.
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.600]  It's only when you say that Trump won or President Trump does it.
[02:43.600 --> 02:44.880]  You make any other claim.
[02:44.880 --> 02:52.200]  You can go on Twitter right now and say that Al Gore won the 2000 election or you could
[02:52.200 --> 02:58.640]  say that anything you wanted, you could say that Trump won New York.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.600]  They wouldn't say anything about that.
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.320]  But if Trump says anything or if you say anything about Trump in Georgia or Arizona or Michigan
[03:06.320 --> 03:09.880]  or Pennsylvania, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook says no, this is disputed.
[03:09.880 --> 03:16.600]  Now, to be more specific, and this is what it's really all about, not just about Twitter
[03:16.600 --> 03:26.960]  deciding what's real or what's not, or just by its own osmosis, just declaring your leader
[03:26.960 --> 03:30.920]  to be Twitter or Facebook or YouTube, no, we decide who's won the elections.
[03:30.920 --> 03:33.320]  This is the notification they give you on YouTube.
[03:33.320 --> 03:38.280]  For example, last night you had over a quarter of a million people tuned in live to right
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.760]  side broadcastings stream of President Trump's rally, consistently over a quarter million
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.760]  people.
[03:44.760 --> 03:47.120]  But they also have their little notification here.
[03:47.120 --> 03:54.600]  It says it's always under it, under every Trump video, under every right side broadcasting
[03:54.600 --> 03:55.600]  video.
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.000]  U.S. elections, the AP has called the presidential race for Joe Biden.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.240]  See more on Google.
[04:01.240 --> 04:11.320]  Now think about that, oh, the AP, the AP decides, the AP now decides who wins your election.
[04:11.320 --> 04:15.880]  Not the president of the United States, not you, the people that voted, the AP decides.
[04:15.880 --> 04:21.040]  The AP announces, and then if you have any questions about that, they redirect you to
[04:21.040 --> 04:26.880]  Google.
[04:26.880 --> 04:29.760]  Why is this illustrative of everything that's to come?
[04:29.760 --> 04:37.240]  It's a corporate world government that uses mainstream media propaganda to indoctrinate
[04:37.240 --> 04:39.960]  you and propagandize you.
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.080]  So it doesn't matter what happened, it doesn't matter that Trump gets tens of thousands of
[04:44.080 --> 04:47.640]  people at his rallies, nobody goes to Biden, it doesn't matter that Trump gets a quarter
[04:47.640 --> 04:51.440]  million people on live streams of his events, nobody tunes into Biden, it doesn't matter
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.760]  that Trump got nor votes.
[04:52.760 --> 04:59.640]  The AP and Google said Biden won, and they're your boss now, they're your daddy.
[04:59.640 --> 05:04.640]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist
[05:04.640 --> 05:06.960]  Chinese and the United Nations.
[05:06.960 --> 05:12.400]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.480]  of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house for months and months are being
[05:16.480 --> 05:21.800]  announced, and in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons
[05:21.800 --> 05:26.400]  to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put
[05:26.400 --> 05:27.400]  them under her control.
[05:27.400 --> 05:32.040]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years, and the same thing is
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.040]  coming here to the United States.
[05:34.040 --> 05:35.040]  This is world government.
[05:35.040 --> 05:40.280]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested, they're
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.320]  announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.600]  This is what the communist takeover looks like, to bankrupt you, to take read of all your
[05:46.600 --> 05:52.320]  due process, and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[05:52.320 --> 05:54.040]  How long have we warned you about this?
[05:54.040 --> 05:57.360]  But you can fight back, America is the last bastion.
[05:57.360 --> 06:00.520]  Stop submitting.
[06:00.520 --> 06:15.160]  It's Sunday, December 6th.
[06:15.160 --> 06:18.760]  Coming up on December 15th is a key day.
[06:18.760 --> 06:25.080]  That is when the Congress begins to try to certify the electors, and now even CNN is
[06:25.080 --> 06:32.600]  admitting today that the vice president is moving to contact the electors and have them
[06:32.600 --> 06:38.360]  not certify the election on December 15th, because the investigation is just now having
[06:38.360 --> 06:45.960]  a chance to actually get to the videos and the eyewitnesses and thousands of affidavits.
[06:45.960 --> 06:51.640]  Hundreds of affidavits were signed in Georgia alone, witnessing election officials shutting
[06:51.640 --> 06:57.840]  down the election in the middle of the night, and then bringing in ballots and suitcases
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.320]  and secretly recording the votes for Biden, which the graph showed, while claiming they
[07:02.320 --> 07:03.480]  weren't counting votes.
[07:03.480 --> 07:07.440]  So the same person who's staying behind now, the same person who cleared the place out
[07:07.440 --> 07:11.520]  under the pretense that we're going to stop counting, is the person who put the table
[07:11.520 --> 07:14.760]  there at 8.22 in the morning.
[07:14.760 --> 07:20.200]  Yeah, I saw four suitcases come out from underneath the table.
[07:20.200 --> 07:25.600]  That smoking gun in Atlanta alone, ladies and gentlemen, and it's duplicated all over
[07:25.600 --> 07:34.080]  Georgia, all over Pennsylvania, all over Michigan, all over places like Arizona.
[07:34.080 --> 07:39.200]  It's incredible if you watch these legislative hearings, the hard, cold proof.
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.520]  But the gaslighting media that told us that Trump was a Russian agent and that Trump
[07:42.520 --> 07:48.320]  would be impeached, that Trump be removed and all those lies, they simply use the election
[07:48.320 --> 07:55.080]  as a smoke screen for their ballot stuffing, not voter fraud, election fraud at the highest
[07:55.080 --> 07:58.040]  levels down to the election counting floors.
[07:58.040 --> 08:00.440]  You know, I called early on for a signature audit.
[08:00.440 --> 08:04.520]  Obviously, the Secretary of State, per the laws in the Constitution, would have to order
[08:04.520 --> 08:05.520]  that.
[08:05.520 --> 08:06.520]  He has not done that.
[08:06.520 --> 08:07.520]  I think it should be done.
[08:07.520 --> 08:11.200]  I think, especially with what we saw today, it raises more questions.
[08:11.200 --> 08:13.680]  There needs to be transparency on that.
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.840]  I would again call for that and I think in the next 24 hours, hopefully, we'll see a
[08:18.840 --> 08:23.960]  lot more from the hearings that the legislature had today and we'll be able to look and see
[08:23.960 --> 08:26.400]  what the next steps are.
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.560]  Trump has come out in a big Georgia speech last night with more than 40,000 people.
[08:30.560 --> 08:33.640]  They perpetrated the largest fraud in the history of our country.
[08:33.640 --> 08:37.680]  They've thrown down the gauntlet and said, media, you keep laughing.
[08:37.680 --> 08:40.160]  I've raised $450 million to fight this lie.
[08:40.160 --> 08:42.640]  You're not going to be laughing in a couple of weeks.
[08:42.640 --> 08:45.200]  You see the money these people have raised?
[08:45.200 --> 08:54.240]  I mean, it's really, it's very, well, of course, I just raised $250 million and I didn't raise
[08:54.240 --> 08:55.240]  it.
[08:55.240 --> 08:58.760]  It just goes, I said, how are we doing in that front, you know, because we didn't get
[08:58.760 --> 08:59.760]  great publicity.
[08:59.760 --> 09:02.800]  Boy, they were so happy, these guys.
[09:02.800 --> 09:09.440]  You might not be happy in a few weeks, you know, you might not be happy, you know, they
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.840]  were so happy.
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.640]  Because they know these cases are strong and of course the Democrat courts below them are
[09:15.640 --> 09:17.800]  overruling Trump just like they always did.
[09:17.800 --> 09:23.480]  But when it gets to the Supreme Court, if they follow the law, they will overturn Georgia,
[09:23.480 --> 09:28.920]  they will overturn Pennsylvania, overturn Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and the evidence is pouring
[09:28.920 --> 09:33.040]  out in all these states that Trump won by a landslide.
[09:33.040 --> 09:43.400]  And we'll be going up to the Supreme Court very shortly and we really, if we have, if
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.520]  we have courage and wisdom, I think you know what the answer is going to be because you
[09:48.520 --> 09:51.320]  can't let people get away with what they got away with.
[09:51.320 --> 09:56.760]  When they closed the polls that night and kept counting, he was two, three, four, five and
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.520]  six points ahead.
[09:58.520 --> 10:01.360]  That's again, double and triple the leads he had before.
[10:01.360 --> 10:03.920]  He won most of those states by half a point or one point.
[10:03.920 --> 10:10.800]  I got more votes than any sitting president in history, 11 million more votes than we
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.800]  got in 2016.
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.800]  And we thought that if we could get 68 million, 67 million, that would be the end, all of
[10:18.800 --> 10:25.160]  our great brilliant geniuses said, you'd win if you get 67 or 68, it's over.
[10:25.160 --> 10:31.560]  We got 74 million plus and they're trying to convince us that we lost, we didn't lose.
[10:31.560 --> 10:35.480]  But magically, magically they found all those ballots.
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.640]  So here's the good news, CNN is crapping itself, their gaslighting is not working, it pulls
[10:41.640 --> 10:48.040]  out that 70 plus to 90 plus percent of Republicans don't believe Joe Biden really won.
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.080]  Some polls show up to half of Democrats not believing it.
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.320]  No one is buying this, Kamala couldn't pull half a percentage points when she was running
[10:55.320 --> 10:56.320]  Democratic primary.
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.960]  So this is such an exciting time and Trump talked about, we're going to win, the evidence
[11:01.960 --> 11:03.120]  is going to come out.
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.760]  They cheated and they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it, we will
[11:08.760 --> 11:14.080]  still win it, we'll still win it.
[11:14.080 --> 11:19.800]  So the deep state is in trouble, they've bet everything on this, they couldn't have Trump
[11:19.800 --> 11:25.120]  win by a landslide and repudiate their fraud and their Russia gate and their Ukraine gate
[11:25.120 --> 11:26.480]  and all the rest of it.
[11:26.480 --> 11:32.000]  So now they're putting a Chinese agent, a communist compromised agent, Joe Biden and
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.920]  his family in charge, you they get away with it.
[11:34.920 --> 11:38.880]  But just because you come to somebody's house and steal their jewelry and run out the back
[11:38.880 --> 11:40.680]  door where that doesn't mean it's yours.
[11:40.680 --> 12:03.160]  You can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob.
[12:03.160 --> 12:06.920]  So we're never going to accept this fraud, we're never going to accept Joe Biden and
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.720]  unlike the lies about Trump and Russia, we have the proof.
[12:11.720 --> 12:17.040]  And so talking to a lot of people in the Trump campaign, in the White House and patriots
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.280]  and U.S. intelligence, they've said day one, look, they knew this was coming, Trump signed
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.520]  executive order two years ago to prepare and get the evidence and now they are bringing
[12:25.520 --> 12:26.520]  it forward.
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.280]  It's been brought forward, it's mountains of evidence, it is incredible.
[12:30.280 --> 12:36.040]  We had about a month ago incredible crowds of people, they were angry as hell at the
[12:36.040 --> 12:41.200]  election and they showed up and it was incredible, hundreds of thousands of people.
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.440]  So we simply have to continue to fight on and point out the censorship trying to suppress
[12:45.440 --> 12:47.760]  the truth of what we are laying out.
[12:47.760 --> 12:51.640]  And finally, before I turn this over, on this live Sunday edition, to Owen Schroder, Dr.
[12:51.640 --> 12:57.120]  Steve Pachennick, with major breaking news on this December 6 Sunday broadcast, look
[12:57.120 --> 12:59.760]  at this story at infowars.com.
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.160]  George Soros taps former chairman of Smartmatic, one of the big companies engaged in all the
[13:04.160 --> 13:08.400]  fraud to become president of the open society global government UN foundation.
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.040]  This guy used to head up major UN operations, he's a Brit.
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.640]  So just think about that CNN said Soros isn't involved with Smartmatic or Dominion, of course
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.720]  he is, Venezuela is not involved when it was started in Venezuela.
[13:22.720 --> 13:25.200]  It's like saying Hitler wasn't Austrian.
[13:25.200 --> 13:31.320]  So here it is and it's on Soros' own Twitter bragging about this and almost every tweet
[13:31.320 --> 13:32.680]  back thousands of them.
[13:32.680 --> 13:38.640]  I read hundreds of them this morning seriously over an hour, just tearing him up.
[13:38.640 --> 13:40.720]  So this is an amazing time to be alive.
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.200]  It's a Psyop, it's a confidence game, Biden did not win.
[13:44.200 --> 13:46.120]  There's an office of president-elect.
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.480]  He said he wouldn't concede until it had all been certified by the electoral college and
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.320]  that hasn't happened and now Pence is moving to properly block it.
[13:54.320 --> 13:58.720]  They Pelosi tried to get the Democrats to block Trump, remember four years ago, but
[13:58.720 --> 14:00.020]  they had no evidence.
[14:00.020 --> 14:04.080]  This time we have evidence and we're not giving up an inch and we're never backing
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.080]  down.
[14:05.080 --> 14:08.720]  So to everybody you know, tune in right now, history's happening, we have the evidence,
[14:08.720 --> 14:11.960]  we have the fraud, we have the proof and we have right on our side.
[14:11.960 --> 14:15.400]  So if you believe and if you spread the word and if you discredit the corporate media and
[14:15.400 --> 14:21.040]  don't believe their lies, President Trump will be rightfully reelected and certified
[14:21.040 --> 14:24.960]  on January 20th and we've got so much evidence of fraud, it's incredible.
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.160]  That's why the control justice department won't even look at it or touch it.
[14:28.160 --> 14:35.320]  Now we continue to fight, we've had some great moments, we just need somebody with courage
[14:35.320 --> 14:38.680]  to do what they have to do because everyone knows it's wrong.
[14:38.680 --> 14:41.200]  We need somebody with courage, somebody that makes decisions.
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.280]  Even though they have all the video, the ballot stuffing and the fraud and everything because
[14:45.280 --> 14:48.680]  they've already doubled down and said there was no fraud during the election.
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.080]  A friend of mine said, oh don't worry about it sir, you're way up in the polls, you'll
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.080]  win in 2024.
[14:54.080 --> 15:00.240]  I said, I don't want to wait till 2024, I want to go back three weeks.
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.000]  This is a globalist attack on America, but if you pray to God and you take political
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.400]  action and you're steadfast, we will win.
[15:06.400 --> 15:11.120]  Now back to Owen Schreuer and the live transmission, Dr. Steve Pachennick with Key and Tell coming
[15:11.120 --> 15:12.120]  up.
[15:12.120 --> 15:19.200]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.000]  We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.960]  We will never give in, we will never give up and we will never back down.
[15:26.960 --> 15:39.160]  We will never, ever surrender because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white
[15:39.160 --> 15:58.600]  and blue.
[15:58.600 --> 16:01.960]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.280]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[16:06.280 --> 16:11.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.520]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[16:15.520 --> 16:20.280]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[16:20.280 --> 16:26.040]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[16:26.040 --> 16:32.040]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[16:32.040 --> 16:38.840]  Studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.280]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[16:43.280 --> 16:49.040]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[16:49.040 --> 16:51.880]  facts that pertain to reality.
[16:51.880 --> 17:16.880]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.720]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria, if it hurts them?
[17:22.720 --> 17:23.720]  We'll see.
[17:23.720 --> 17:26.440]  That'll knock out all the smaller lines and it's all they control and it's the same
[17:26.440 --> 17:30.520]  in every single industry and the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[17:30.520 --> 17:35.160]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[17:35.160 --> 17:38.680]  That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some
[17:38.680 --> 17:39.680]  central banks.
[17:39.680 --> 17:42.800]  This is how the globalists take control.
[17:42.800 --> 17:47.800]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare
[17:47.800 --> 17:52.200]  and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.800]  in fake derivatives.
[17:53.800 --> 17:59.600]  Only the truth will set us free in FullWars.com.
[17:59.600 --> 18:05.040]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.040]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.240]  with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.120]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020.
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.320]  Global government of the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're
[18:20.320 --> 18:21.320]  doing it.
[18:21.320 --> 18:26.760]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even
[18:26.760 --> 18:28.480]  worried about COVID-19.
[18:28.480 --> 18:30.880]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[18:30.880 --> 18:34.360]  Think about how it's saying that as oh, a big tech's got to track you, they've got to
[18:34.360 --> 18:37.840]  trace you, they've got to control you, you've got to have to absolutely leave your house.
[18:37.840 --> 18:43.120]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because, my God, this thing has one-tenth
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.560]  of one percent chance of killing you, give your ability to cancer or heart attack.
[18:48.560 --> 18:50.480]  This is their takeover.
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.440]  Imagine on America's death certificate, killed by the fear of the common cold.
[18:54.440 --> 18:58.560]  Yeah, that's fear monitoring, that's mind control.
[18:58.560 --> 18:59.560]  The Great Reset.
[18:59.560 --> 19:01.560]  Where have I heard of that before?
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.560]  Oh, the Great Leap Forward.
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.680]  Now, say tongue ordering all the small towns on small farms to basically shut down and
[19:09.680 --> 19:14.060]  have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under
[19:14.060 --> 19:17.480]  communist and commune control, and that's all this is.
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.120]  The big megabanks want to break us in the same ones that put now they tongue into power
[19:21.120 --> 19:24.040]  and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy, bringing in the new
[19:24.040 --> 19:29.000]  economy, where everything's free, because when you're a prisoner, well, everything's
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.460]  free but you're also a slave.
[19:30.460 --> 19:35.740]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level, but of course
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.220]  you got to take those vaccines. You can't have any kids and oh, don't worry though, all of the
[19:40.860 --> 19:46.700]  tampons and stuff like that's free too as well. I'm not kidding. So give me some free paper.
[19:46.700 --> 19:50.940]  They give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment, but they own you. They control
[19:50.940 --> 19:55.740]  you. That's the great reset. That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting
[19:55.740 --> 20:11.660]  it at infowars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.700 --> 20:32.140]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show when Troyer sitting in studio. Dr. Steve Pachena coming up in
[20:32.140 --> 20:44.300]  the next segment. You know, the information that we lay out here for you is so extreme.
[20:44.300 --> 20:52.940]  It's hard to properly even report on it without getting hysterical.
[20:55.660 --> 21:03.020]  And the fact that President Trump is basically alone aside from Rudy Giuliani and a few others
[21:03.020 --> 21:08.220]  who are coming to his aid in defense of this election theft that's really been happening
[21:08.220 --> 21:16.140]  in this country for a long, long time is something that makes it even harder to properly
[21:17.180 --> 21:19.740]  relay and get people to understand this information because
[21:21.020 --> 21:28.940]  you can see when you get on to Google or YouTube or Twitter or Facebook, you can see how they say,
[21:28.940 --> 21:35.260]  oh no, Trump lost. No, we at Facebook declare buying the winner. No, we at Google declare
[21:35.260 --> 21:41.420]  buying the winner. No, no, we at Twitter say the AP decides who wins the U.S. presidency,
[21:41.420 --> 21:47.340]  not you, the people that voted, not the Electoral College. No, they don't believe in any of that,
[21:47.340 --> 21:50.380]  not even the President of the United States. They're bigger. They think they're bigger.
[21:50.380 --> 21:56.620]  And see, this is all about delegitimizing the office of the United States President. This is
[21:56.620 --> 22:03.500]  about delegitimizing the Commander-in-Chief and then you put Biden in there to just certify the
[22:03.500 --> 22:10.220]  deal, just complete demoralization of the position. And now Google is in charge. Now YouTube is in
[22:10.220 --> 22:15.180]  charge. Facebook, social media, all these big corporations are in charge. All the corporations
[22:15.180 --> 22:19.260]  that can survive the fake pandemic, which is an economic weapon, now they're in charge. They tell
[22:19.260 --> 22:29.420]  you have to vaccinate. And so this is the giant transfer of power that's going worldwide. And it
[22:29.420 --> 22:35.180]  has to be successfully completed in the United States of America to be fully implemented worldwide.
[22:35.180 --> 22:38.300]  Otherwise, we the American people will still be over here sitting as a sovereign nation,
[22:38.940 --> 22:44.300]  refusing to buy into their globalism. And they can't have the entire world system collapse
[22:45.420 --> 22:49.340]  in the name of one world government with medical tyranny while the United States still thrives
[22:49.340 --> 22:54.860]  under self-government free market capitalism, which it inevitably would. And more people would
[22:54.860 --> 22:59.420]  continue to race here from other countries. That's been the story for about a hundred years now.
[23:01.260 --> 23:11.420]  So again, I can show you the, I mean, you can go see it how Twitter says,
[23:11.420 --> 23:15.820]  nope, Trump is not allowed to say anything about the election. We say it's fraud.
[23:17.020 --> 23:23.020]  How on YouTube, any videos posted of President Trump say the AP has called the President
[23:23.020 --> 23:27.660]  race for Biden. See more on Google. So I can show you that and I can tell you,
[23:28.540 --> 23:32.460]  hey, this is the new system of power. This is the new implementation of power. This is the
[23:32.460 --> 23:38.060]  new corporate government. But I don't even think it's enough. I don't know how it sets home. How
[23:38.060 --> 23:44.860]  do people even understand this? Because it's so simple. You think, okay, it can't be that complex.
[23:44.860 --> 23:55.500]  It's too simple. No, it's a world corporate government. It's taking the power and the will
[23:55.500 --> 24:03.260]  and the destiny for the future from you and putting it in the hands of giant worldwide
[24:03.260 --> 24:10.940]  corporations who are in the process of stealing our election. And so they just say, no, the media
[24:10.940 --> 24:16.620]  declares who the winner is. And we're so deep into this propaganda that
[24:19.020 --> 24:27.820]  Trump has to sit here and say it is rallies. We need people of courage to do their jobs.
[24:31.180 --> 24:35.180]  Everybody knows the fraud happened. Everybody's seen the eyewitness reports.
[24:36.060 --> 24:39.660]  And so these committees now have a decision. The state legislatures now have a decision.
[24:39.660 --> 24:45.500]  The Supreme Court is going to have a decision. Are you going to go along with the propaganda
[24:46.060 --> 24:51.260]  that the AP and Google and big tech and corporations worldwide run our country,
[24:51.260 --> 24:56.380]  run our elections and run our lives? Or are you going to side with the American people,
[24:58.620 --> 25:01.660]  refuse to certify this fraudulent election for Joe Biden?
[25:03.180 --> 25:06.620]  Which will take an act of courage because, again, that's going against the face
[25:06.620 --> 25:14.940]  of the entire system of propaganda. Something which probably most of these state legislatures
[25:14.940 --> 25:18.460]  have never done, never thought they would have to do, couldn't even conceive the notion,
[25:18.460 --> 25:24.380]  and they're now faced with that decision. And of course, it's easier for them at this point to
[25:24.380 --> 25:29.420]  just go along with the system of propaganda, just go along with the fake election, a lot less
[25:29.420 --> 25:33.980]  hassle for them. At least that's what they think. That's the understanding of the current
[25:33.980 --> 25:39.500]  culture and civilization wars that could change overnight.
[25:43.420 --> 25:48.380]  So I don't know how else I can say it. I don't know how else we can get Americans to
[25:48.380 --> 25:55.740]  realize how dangerous this is. That corporate media and big tech companies now decide who our
[25:55.740 --> 26:01.660]  presidents are. And they just announce it and they just put their propaganda up everywhere
[26:01.660 --> 26:05.900]  and they censor the president of the United States and they go directly against the president of
[26:05.900 --> 26:12.620]  the United States. Whether they like it or not, even if Trump did lose this 2020 election, which
[26:12.620 --> 26:23.500]  he didn't, even if he did lose, he's still the president. They're censoring the president. They're
[26:23.500 --> 26:31.100]  saying that their corporate government has more value and more standing to make claims
[26:31.100 --> 26:38.700]  than the president of the United States. Now, the good news is Americans are awakened to this.
[26:38.700 --> 26:45.740]  The world is awakened to this. And so there's rallies happening. I mean, it's like every day,
[26:45.740 --> 26:52.620]  but every weekend for sure, for sure. We were at a rally in Dallas yesterday with a huge
[26:52.620 --> 26:59.260]  turnout I spoke at, that full HD video from the whole rally is available at Band-Aid video.
[27:00.060 --> 27:04.460]  There were multiple rallies in Pennsylvania, rallies in California, where they just implemented
[27:04.460 --> 27:09.900]  a new shutdown curfew. So again, Trump supporters go out in the streets at 10 p.m., wave their flags.
[27:09.900 --> 27:16.300]  I've got all kinds of video with that. Maybe we'll have time to get to it. I mean, I saw rallies
[27:16.300 --> 27:23.180]  in Australia to stop the steal for President Trump. So the whole world is watching this.
[27:23.900 --> 27:29.660]  And I hope that President Trump is being facetious when he, actually, he just said it at a Christmas
[27:29.660 --> 27:34.780]  event today. He said, we're fighting for another four years, but if we don't get it,
[27:34.780 --> 27:39.740]  I'll be back in four years after that. I don't even like to hear him say that. Quite frankly,
[27:39.740 --> 27:44.060]  it's a little demoralizing. I almost don't even want to report that to you here, but he said it
[27:44.060 --> 27:51.740]  today at a Christmas event from the White House. But yes, this is going to come down to state
[27:51.740 --> 27:56.460]  legislatures now seeing the overwhelming evidence of the voter fraud and then making decision to
[27:56.460 --> 28:02.140]  either make the right decision, which is to say this is clearly voter fraud. This nullifies these
[28:02.140 --> 28:06.700]  results. We're going to either have to tabulate the legal votes and make a decision or just make a
[28:06.700 --> 28:11.580]  decision or call for a revote. And they don't want to do any of that. They would much rather go with
[28:11.580 --> 28:17.900]  the system of propaganda and say, no, Biden won and then not get terrorized by the terrorist party
[28:17.900 --> 28:21.900]  of the Democrats. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Steve Pachena coming up. You know what? I didn't even

[29:02.140 --> 29:07.100]  different mixes of the two. One is born of Renaissance. The other is born of conquest.
[29:07.100 --> 29:12.300]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[29:12.940 --> 29:18.940]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength. The other is based on the massive number of slaves
[29:18.940 --> 29:26.220]  it controls with a tiny elite above it. America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos
[29:26.220 --> 29:32.060]  of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery. That's why the globalists tell us
[29:32.060 --> 29:36.540]  America was founded on slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils so they can
[29:36.540 --> 29:41.420]  invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters. A global permanent lockdown is here.
[29:41.420 --> 29:45.260]  It is already causing millions and millions to starve to death. When they're done, billions
[29:45.260 --> 29:49.900]  will starve to death. Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general
[29:49.900 --> 29:54.540]  have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war. That's
[29:54.540 --> 30:01.500]  the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon. Promo Code Patriot. Promo Code

[30:58.860 --> 31:06.700]  Introducing info war's life, pure turmeric extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure
[31:06.700 --> 31:13.100]  turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken
[31:13.100 --> 31:19.180]  as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue
[31:19.180 --> 31:23.740]  into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's
[31:23.740 --> 31:28.940]  more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates
[31:28.940 --> 31:32.940]  and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months.
[31:32.940 --> 31:38.220]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both amazing
[31:38.220 --> 31:42.540]  for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the info war. So get our new

[33:29.980 --> 33:39.260]  cesspool of New York City but in Austin, Texas. Now Dr. Steve Pachinic joins me now here for the
[33:39.260 --> 33:43.820]  remainder of this hour and hopefully beyond and I want to put a frame of reference into
[33:44.620 --> 33:49.820]  this segment and beyond and then have Dr. Steve Pachinic paint the picture within.
[33:49.820 --> 33:55.900]  First of all, you know, I don't have much faith in these state legislatures. I'm just going to
[33:55.900 --> 33:59.260]  be honest. I don't have much faith in the Supreme Court. I'm not even sure how much faith I have
[33:59.260 --> 34:03.820]  in Donald Trump but I have faith in God and more so I also have faith in the American people
[34:04.700 --> 34:09.900]  and I have faith that if we believe we will win and we consciously continue to fight until we
[34:09.900 --> 34:14.940]  win and visualize our victory then we will win and we have God on our side and we have all the
[34:14.940 --> 34:20.380]  facts and evidence on our side but we have to have that will we have to have that faith. Now
[34:20.380 --> 34:24.620]  the reverse to that is will you go around and you see the people wearing masks you see the
[34:24.620 --> 34:29.580]  leftist that burn the American flags and stuff we have to understand through a lens of reality
[34:30.140 --> 34:36.460]  that's like being mad at a triple amputee war veteran for not being able to run a marathon.
[34:37.420 --> 34:42.060]  These people have been hit with psychological warfare weapons that have crippled their mind
[34:42.060 --> 34:49.340]  to to unreturnable statuses folks and so it's sad when you see the triple amputee from war
[34:49.340 --> 34:54.780]  that's a sad thing. That's who these lefties are that's who these Democrat voters are from
[34:54.780 --> 34:59.580]  the mainstream media propaganda. Now on the other the other side of this frame and now
[34:59.580 --> 35:05.340]  Steve Pettenac will paint the picture within we have look if I know the Democrats are about
[35:05.340 --> 35:09.900]  to steal the election if millions of Americans know the Democrats are about to steal the election
[35:09.900 --> 35:15.820]  then Donald Trump knows it Donald Trump's people know it his legal team know it and they all knew
[35:15.820 --> 35:21.980]  it they knew it all along now did they set the proper infrastructure in place to catch the
[35:21.980 --> 35:26.300]  steal and then prosecute the steal we're finding that out right now if people have the will to do
[35:26.300 --> 35:31.260]  it but we catch them with the dead voters we catch them stuffing the ballots we catch them
[35:31.820 --> 35:35.740]  filling the ballots voting multiple times we catch them pulling out briefcases clearing
[35:35.740 --> 35:42.380]  the polling places I mean the list goes on and on and on uh illegal mail-in ballots eyewitness
[35:42.380 --> 35:48.460]  saying we had fake mail-in ballots now dr. Steve Pettenac I start I start off the question with
[35:48.460 --> 35:55.820]  this if I know and you know and we talk about this and many other people know everything the
[35:55.820 --> 36:00.780]  Democrats are about to do to steal the 2020 election surely president Trump knows it surely
[36:00.780 --> 36:04.940]  people on his team know it his legal team know it and they had to know it just like we did I would
[36:04.940 --> 36:09.980]  assume so now that we have all the evidence and the affidavits and all of it and we've already had
[36:09.980 --> 36:16.940]  the election is there going to be enough evidence to overturn the minds and the hearts of the state
[36:16.940 --> 36:22.780]  legislatures of the American people that no matter what come hell or high water president Trump will
[36:22.780 --> 36:29.820]  be re-inaugurated in January what do you believe the current status is dr. Steve Pettenac what I
[36:29.820 --> 36:36.460]  said a long time ago to you and I said if this was a sting operation uh I don't share the same
[36:36.460 --> 36:44.460]  view you do in terms of the left being amputees I see them as ineffectual corrupt individuals
[36:44.460 --> 36:49.580]  who have been in power for 30 40 years and have destroyed well I'm not talking about the
[36:49.580 --> 36:52.780]  Nancy Pelosi's I'm talking about the people that go out in the streets and like to spin on
[36:52.780 --> 36:57.820]  Trump supporters and stuff I understand but this is far more serious it's what I said to you
[36:57.820 --> 37:02.780]  probably a month ago this we're running a sting operation out of cyber command
[37:03.660 --> 37:10.380]  and this wasn't an accident this was already pre-planned when Trump came in he did the national
[37:10.380 --> 37:18.380]  emergency order in 2019 the will and the power is there as well as the forces it's not an accident
[37:18.380 --> 37:25.900]  we I told you that we had cyber designations on every ballot as well as every machine we know
[37:25.900 --> 37:32.780]  where they are we knew about dominion we knew about smart maddox we've already deployed countless
[37:32.780 --> 37:38.380]  numbers of soldiers all over the united states I think in texas if you look at ford and other
[37:38.380 --> 37:46.620]  places you will see major deployment of american soldiers we're not relying on local police we'll
[37:46.620 --> 37:54.380]  literally relying on our military to basically call out what the cia and other uh secular
[37:54.380 --> 38:00.540]  institutions have been doing in terms of running this country the corruption was well known by
[38:00.540 --> 38:06.620]  trump it was also known by many of us in the military intelligence in other areas way back in
[38:06.620 --> 38:11.260]  terms of hillary clinton that's why she didn't come in and we're running now the sting operation
[38:11.260 --> 38:16.860]  that I told you about it so trump is there to stay he's not going anywhere in the georgia
[38:16.860 --> 38:22.620]  speech he made very clear there's no way he's leaving there's no way he will allow any of this
[38:22.620 --> 38:28.380]  corruption to continue and basically what he's doing is a revolution and that's really what
[38:28.380 --> 38:34.380]  we're in I don't want to call it a second civil war but basically it is a state of emergency so
[38:34.380 --> 38:41.900]  to speak where trump anticipated this used our brave men and women in the intelligence community
[38:41.900 --> 38:49.660]  to preempt biden and all the other people on the democratic side and I think biden understands this
[38:49.660 --> 38:56.060]  he may not always be the sharpest bulb in and the sharpest mind around but I think he has a pretty
[38:56.060 --> 39:03.580]  good idea that he's under indictment his son is and if anything is to come about my suspicion is
[39:03.580 --> 39:12.540]  that biden will resign as well his son because either or or both might go to prison my suspicion
[39:12.540 --> 39:18.940]  is trump will remain he will be a president for the next eight years biden will concede and somewhere
[39:18.940 --> 39:25.660]  there will be remuneration that's only my suspicion you said eight years was that intentional
[39:26.700 --> 39:34.860]  yes it's not a Freudian slip I don't believe in Freud so are you based on the fact that for four
[39:34.860 --> 39:40.060]  years they've been sabotaging the trump agenda with with all their fraud is that how he would
[39:40.620 --> 39:47.580]  legitimize four more years well it's not just four more years of his administration he would
[39:47.580 --> 39:55.100]  legitimize it simply because he came in understanding very well that he was there to become the best
[39:55.100 --> 40:00.540]  president we better have that's one they call that narcissist the best healthy narcissist
[40:00.540 --> 40:06.060]  number two he knew that he could not accomplish everything he wanted in the first four years
[40:06.060 --> 40:12.060]  so he needs another four years and he wants to position pants and others in the republican party
[40:12.060 --> 40:17.580]  to have another four years beyond that so what I'm talking about is not just another four years and
[40:17.580 --> 40:23.420]  the past four years I'm talking about another eight years and that's exactly what he has in mind
[40:23.980 --> 40:29.260]  now he knew there would be corruption what he's done is no president in the United States has
[40:29.260 --> 40:36.700]  ever done this other than I think Eisenhower who indicted the CIA by saying they were a legacy
[40:36.700 --> 40:43.340]  of ashes and they were a disaster this is the first president in the 21st century to say
[40:43.340 --> 40:50.300]  I will not allow any form of corruption to exist in our voting system simple as that and I will
[40:50.300 --> 40:56.780]  remain in power he utilized all the men and women in our intelligence community in the White House
[40:56.780 --> 41:04.860]  General Nakasone General Keith Alexander Boykin special forces I mean these are names that I've
[41:04.860 --> 41:11.820]  told you about before but they're quiet and these are the real heroes and unfortunately
[41:11.820 --> 41:17.980]  as Adam Perry said in one of his shows he said they're not going to televise the revolution
[41:17.980 --> 41:25.100]  and that comes from an old song in 1971 as you know but he understood that we had to break away
[41:25.100 --> 41:30.060]  from the main media in other words the New York Times Washington Post all of those they're not
[41:30.060 --> 41:35.740]  relevant except for the New York Post that was ready to stand there he also understood that he
[41:35.740 --> 41:41.100]  would control the Senate he would control the House and that basically you're going to see a
[41:41.100 --> 41:47.260]  red revolution come about where in fact they say they proclaim that Biden is the president of life
[41:47.260 --> 41:53.180]  Biden is nothing of that sort Biden is just literally biding his time well in the last 60
[41:53.180 --> 41:57.020]  seconds let me follow up with a Biden comment you made and then let's get back into the sting
[41:57.020 --> 42:02.060]  operation in detail in the next segment Biden and Hunter Hunter and Joe Biden and James Biden
[42:02.060 --> 42:07.500]  actually have all committed money fraud international crimes there's many people that know about this
[42:07.500 --> 42:12.300]  is there any will other than in Ukraine to prosecute them as criminals
[42:14.140 --> 42:20.140]  uh I think there is a major will in the White House which is far more important than anything
[42:20.140 --> 42:27.260]  else to prosecute both of them or possibly three of them but I can't go into specifics of the
[42:27.260 --> 42:34.380]  prosecution you have to talk to someone who's you can trust in the Department of Justice I don't
[42:34.380 --> 42:40.700]  trust law and I don't trust Donald so I'm not getting into the specifics of that but I will
[42:40.700 --> 42:46.460]  tell you they are in they are within our site in terms of military intelligence and other
[42:46.460 --> 42:51.740]  intelligence so just I mean quickly it sounds like the only thing the only institution Trump has
[42:51.740 --> 42:57.980]  on his side is the military is that accurate correct but a certain portion of the military which
[42:57.980 --> 43:05.420]  back in 1996 the head of the world food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[43:05.420 --> 43:11.420]  due to a virus year to bring in world government that also came out in the north american union
[43:11.420 --> 43:17.580]  documents the judicial watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well so we know their plan
[43:17.580 --> 43:21.580]  and if they're able to keep this lockdown going it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression
[43:21.580 --> 43:26.380]  but mass starvation of hundreds of millions millions have already starved to death not from
[43:26.380 --> 43:31.260]  covid but from the lockdown that's why it's important for people in north america to get
[43:31.260 --> 43:35.340]  prepared hell all over the world but we have high-quality swarble food ready to ship to you the

[44:19.420 --> 44:24.060]  instead of getting total power and total control and there are major uprisings happening across the

[45:04.940 --> 45:09.900]  goes to territory i'm talking about deviant against their ancestors deviant against their own
[45:09.900 --> 45:15.820]  species deviant against the order of nature even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous
[45:15.820 --> 45:21.100]  they still do it because they want to play god everything they touch they destroy their their
[45:21.100 --> 45:26.940]  sacrament is affording babies and then using their body parts their their religion is not
[45:26.940 --> 45:31.820]  taking care of the old but euthanizing them their whole system is designed for the un to keep their
[45:31.820 --> 45:36.860]  world countries in serious poverty and poor ballooning populations than watching all that
[45:36.860 --> 45:43.100]  new fruit down the vine to continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again
[45:43.100 --> 45:47.260]  they truly are the children of satan they are the children of the devil have you look at the slaves
[45:47.260 --> 45:52.220]  that serve them byton and kamala harris it really has manifested being a slave of satan is not
[45:52.220 --> 45:57.100]  profitable sin is not profitable i'm alex jones and this is the info war
[45:59.660 --> 46:02.140]  the globalists and their minions want to play god
[46:03.100 --> 46:09.180]  chucky schumer hillary clinton varado mama you look at these sacks of garbage and you think
[46:09.180 --> 46:16.220]  why do they hate humanity so much why do they love death because they hate themselves they project
[46:16.220 --> 46:23.100]  their own disgust with their soul on to us and once you understand that basic psychological point
[46:23.740 --> 46:29.180]  every other answer is completely clear that's why they hate info wars we believe in humanity we
[46:29.180 --> 46:34.780]  think you're beautiful we think you're amazing info wars knows you're fallen but that you have
[46:34.780 --> 46:39.820]  god's potential that god gave you ladies and gentlemen the great epic battle is now here it's
[46:39.820 --> 46:43.980]  now upon us i want to encourage you all spread the word about info wars now more than ever
[46:43.980 --> 46:48.220]  when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth we know you're gonna override these
[46:48.220 --> 46:51.820]  globalists we know you're gonna defeat them i just want to salute you all for your action
[46:51.820 --> 46:56.220]  everything you've already done because god's on our side and the globalists know it
[46:56.220 --> 47:12.140]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:19.100 --> 47:23.580]  dr steve pochinnik is with us he was uh going on there during the break and so i want to
[47:23.580 --> 47:32.300]  uh let him finish up on the biden crime family and then we'll get into the 2020 election sting
[47:33.180 --> 47:38.300]  uh as he's put it we'll get into the details of that steve i believe i mean i i've seen it
[47:38.300 --> 47:43.820]  with my own eyes i mean there are millions of americans that are so fed up with politicians
[47:43.820 --> 47:51.180]  selling our country out and betraying us for decades the bushes the clinton's um obama i mean
[47:51.180 --> 47:58.380]  the list goes on and on we know the names and so i believe trump has a will to have these people
[47:58.380 --> 48:05.180]  meet justice i guess i'm asking you now then what is the biggest obstacle to this what is in the way
[48:05.180 --> 48:11.100]  and how do we clear those obstacles to finally get justice including uh with the criminals that
[48:11.100 --> 48:19.420]  just tried to steal our election dr steve pochinnik uh tell that dogfight to calm down steve pochinnik
[48:19.420 --> 48:28.700]  does not run dog fighting rings basically the problem that's in the way see as i tell you
[48:28.700 --> 48:34.380]  even the pochinnik dog is pissed off he's in there i can i can speak dog he's saying arrest biden
[48:34.380 --> 48:42.860]  already he's saying lock them up i feel your dog's pain steve uh believe me i can i feel it
[48:42.860 --> 48:49.820]  it's fine give the dog the platform he said lock them up listen you can hear the dog what's that
[48:49.820 --> 48:59.980]  doggie lock them up i can hear it that's what he's saying uh they're not they're not gonna arrest
[48:59.980 --> 49:05.980]  biden first aid nor are they gonna arrest hunter the point of fact is there will be a deal that
[49:05.980 --> 49:14.060]  will be met made with the officials on the trump side the real problem that's hindering all of this
[49:14.060 --> 49:20.540]  is the question of time and belief it's taking a lot of time only because we're talking about years
[49:20.540 --> 49:27.100]  and years of corruption this isn't just the past four years we're also talking about the intrusion
[49:27.100 --> 49:33.580]  of another president obama who came in here and as i said years ago and i was penalized for it he
[49:33.580 --> 49:41.260]  is a cia operative he is totally a liar pathological liar there's nothing about him that's african
[49:41.260 --> 49:48.060]  american or concerned about the african americans he's so pathetic that when he went to occidental
[49:48.060 --> 49:53.820]  college in los angeles he didn't write about it and instead he said he went to columbia he had
[49:53.820 --> 50:00.380]  accident occidental college says he's the best alumnus they have so the internal lies the internal
[50:00.380 --> 50:06.380]  conflicts they're coming out very quickly and what we're working on is the notion as i've said to
[50:06.380 --> 50:12.380]  alex and you before is within the system particularly among democrats and republicans
[50:12.380 --> 50:19.660]  politicians make tradeoffs in that tradeoff part of their own personality of narcissism is involved
[50:20.220 --> 50:26.380]  but at the same time the more power and the more narcissism they use the easier it is for people
[50:26.380 --> 50:32.540]  like myself and others in the cybert community and the intelligence community to allow them to
[50:32.540 --> 50:39.660]  self-destruct so what trump is doing even though it's not splayed out in the mainline media you
[50:39.660 --> 50:46.460]  you he had a brilliant hour and a half monologue basically on the amount of corruption that exists
[50:46.460 --> 50:52.780]  in this country for so many decades and it was in georgia but nevertheless social media picked it up
[50:52.780 --> 51:00.780]  and we were able to mainstream it in alternative channels so you owen and alex have become one
[51:00.780 --> 51:08.300]  of those major channels so we have changed literally the way we express the narrative it's no longer
[51:08.300 --> 51:16.540]  in print or even on the twitter it's literally on social media be it important that trump and
[51:16.540 --> 51:23.580]  people have to understand this trump came in four years ago using twitter he wasn't just using his
[51:23.580 --> 51:30.540]  mouth and a narrative or a piece of paper he was queuing in to other people who didn't really get
[51:30.540 --> 51:37.420]  it particularly the democrats and other republicans who fail like mit romney that he is in the 21st
[51:37.420 --> 51:44.700]  century and he's going to act accordingly so he is the first president to use a social media on a
[51:44.700 --> 51:51.500]  continuous basis 24-7 so if you really want to understand what trump is doing you've got to go
[51:51.500 --> 52:01.180]  on twitter and you've got to see how much output he does in a 24-hour day now compared to trump
[52:01.180 --> 52:07.180]  and biden you're talking about biden with two histories of aneurysms mental deficiency
[52:07.820 --> 52:13.420]  psychological well yeah and by the way by the way what do you think they're claiming he has a you
[52:13.420 --> 52:18.300]  know a fractured ankle or whatever he tried to chase his dog he gets out of the shower he's
[52:18.300 --> 52:23.500]  chasing he's grabbing his dog's tail i've never heard of such a thing from a 77 year old man do
[52:23.500 --> 52:28.460]  you believe that what is up with that because by the way he did say that he would fake an illness
[52:29.020 --> 52:33.580]  for some obama agend he said all this fake an illness and step aside so i mean he's admitted
[52:33.580 --> 52:37.100]  he'll fake an illness so is he faking this injury i mean what's the biden dog story
[52:37.100 --> 52:44.380]  well you know it's the old dog story i have no idea whether you know i've said to alex perhaps
[52:44.380 --> 52:49.260]  they already have a bracelet on him meaning that we know exactly where he is and where he's going
[52:49.260 --> 52:57.180]  the old gps flight risk tracker that's correct and that's one of the ways we would keep a tab on him
[52:57.180 --> 53:04.060]  listen biden understands from the day he came in 47 years ago he stated very clearly in a video
[53:04.060 --> 53:11.580]  which you guys can access i know i can be corrupt and i am corrupt and that is the nature of politics
[53:11.580 --> 53:18.060]  i didn't make it up he said it he knew historically he's been a corrupt politician you know and almost
[53:18.060 --> 53:22.300]  you know steve in that in that fashion he's almost been one of the most transparent politicians of
[53:22.300 --> 53:27.020]  all time i mean he goes on tv at the council foreign nation says yeah i bribed i bribed the
[53:27.020 --> 53:31.340]  ukrainians to get my son millions yeah i did it his son calls people always like i'm friends with
[53:31.340 --> 53:36.460]  the richest chinese in the world where is he i'm making deals with them i want my billions i mean
[53:36.460 --> 53:41.340]  so it's like it's all out there but that brings me back so so like you were saying at the beginning
[53:41.340 --> 53:46.060]  of though uh so what kind of a deal i mean biden is caught in all of these crimes i mean that we've
[53:46.060 --> 53:50.780]  seen the emails 10 for the big guy i mean this has been going on for decades polosi's daughter is
[53:50.780 --> 53:54.700]  implicated schumer's family is implicated all these democrats republicans as well they're all
[53:54.700 --> 53:59.820]  implicated so what kind of deal i mean how i feel that trump's already offered them the deal like
[53:59.820 --> 54:05.500]  look just walk away just right off into the sunset let me let me be the president and they always
[54:05.500 --> 54:09.900]  refuse that deal i mean what level are they at now where's the bargain where's the negotiation
[54:12.620 --> 54:19.020]  i'm not privy to what he's saying in terms of negotiation i am privy to one factor and this
[54:19.020 --> 54:26.700]  you can take as it is one of my neighbors here in northern florida happens to be involved with
[54:26.700 --> 54:33.020]  increasing the number of fencing and the amount of guards and gates you have in a prison
[54:33.580 --> 54:41.260]  a year ago he went down in guantanamo in cuba and doubled the size of guantanamo so i leave it to
[54:41.260 --> 54:47.900]  your imagination in your and your audiences to understand what will happen to various individuals
[54:47.900 --> 54:53.340]  as we deploy military soldiers all over the country and we're already rounding up
[54:53.340 --> 55:00.860]  hundreds of people for pedophilia now that is also in conjunction with what's going on because
[55:00.860 --> 55:07.980]  there was a huge amount of pedophilia sexual perversion at trafficking that was going on under
[55:07.980 --> 55:15.900]  the biden the obama the clinton's and those administrations so we have a apopry of different
[55:16.860 --> 55:22.220]  indictments here i'm not a lawyer i don't want to pretend to be a lawyer but i don't even get
[55:22.220 --> 55:29.820]  involved on the legal part at the local level i could say if i were biden i could see very early
[55:29.820 --> 55:37.660]  on to say okay i'll play my role i'll get kamala harris to work with me and basically if i understand
[55:37.660 --> 55:44.620]  correctly i biden then i will play the role and assign all of my former obama officials
[55:44.620 --> 55:50.540]  as potential candidates for another administration which will never exist so you got a bit of the
[55:50.540 --> 55:56.700]  fear of the absurd there but it has to be played out because trump said repeatedly even though
[55:57.260 --> 56:03.820]  mainstream media doesn't pick it up that it has taken years to point out how much corruption
[56:03.820 --> 56:12.300]  has gone on and he wants to show that corruption at every level of politics from the governor
[56:12.300 --> 56:18.780]  to the local officials to the congressman and senators so we're going to have a much larger
[56:18.780 --> 56:24.460]  indictment than people think about and it's the romney's and the others who've been involved with
[56:24.460 --> 56:30.460]  bane capital well what was bane capital nothing more than a corrupt institution created by mit
[56:30.460 --> 56:37.740]  romney and bb when they came out of mit business school and it was funded by latin american uh
[56:38.700 --> 56:47.260]  scoundrels and what was the uh the bloating machine dominion was created by three venezuelans
[56:47.260 --> 56:55.100]  and then manipulated by the cia so you have a theater the absurd here that trump has to deal with
[56:55.100 --> 57:02.620]  and take apart piece by piece how arrogant are they in the last 30 seconds here i mean how arrogant
[57:02.620 --> 57:09.740]  are they dominion dominion like they're claiming dominion over us well that my point is they're
[57:09.740 --> 57:16.300]  exceedingly arrogant the nature of elitism and both the republican and democrats it's the notion
[57:16.300 --> 57:22.700]  i could never be caught and i can do whatever i want irrespective of the constraints that's the
[57:22.700 --> 57:29.820]  nature of malignant narcissism where the psychiatrist said trump had it in fact it's really biden in
[57:29.820 --> 57:35.900]  the entire institution of politics in the united states and that's what trump is showing and the
[57:35.900 --> 57:42.860]  psychiatrists gave biden all of those dynamics to accuse trump of what i accused biden of being seen
[57:42.860 --> 57:50.380]  now now that we're going to a break now don't go anywhere there is an economic war taking place of
[57:50.380 --> 57:55.420]  the ruling class to consolidate power and control there's a headline out from zero heads that breaks
[57:55.420 --> 58:02.700]  down bloomberg numbers the global airlines are set to lose 157 billion dollars this year by the end
[58:02.700 --> 58:09.660]  of december it's already over 130 billion dollars they've lost why would they take part in the hoax
[58:09.660 --> 58:14.860]  in the lockdown in the hysteria if it hurts them we'll see that'll knock out all the small airlines
[58:14.860 --> 58:19.740]  and it's solid a control it's the same in every single industry and the big megabanks have unlimited
[58:19.740 --> 58:25.100]  capital they want to bankrupt the world economy go to buy it up for pennies on the dollar that's
[58:25.100 --> 58:29.500]  why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks
[58:29.500 --> 58:35.420]  this is how the globalists take control it stars the third world to death makes the first world
[58:35.420 --> 58:41.100]  poor it's economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of

[59:51.980 --> 1:00:07.900]  the alex jones show
[1:00:07.900 --> 1:00:26.060]  all right we've got a couple more segments with dr steve pacinic if you were going to run a sting
[1:00:26.060 --> 1:00:35.260]  operation on election fraud well you would let the criminals engage in all their election fraud
[1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:42.060]  with the dead voters you would let them stuff the voting machines so that you would get voter turnout
[1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:46.860]  higher than any other election ever so that when you audit that you can find that information out
[1:00:46.860 --> 1:00:51.020]  you would allow them the use of mail-in ballots so that when you audit the mail-in ballot you
[1:00:51.020 --> 1:00:56.780]  could find the counterfeit mail-in ballots and then do the forensic analysis data analysis
[1:00:56.780 --> 1:01:02.220]  finding out they were all for joe biden you would film it you would have dozens of pull
[1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:09.260]  watchers which they did and so it all ran successfully and we all saw it now we're waiting to see
[1:01:09.260 --> 1:01:15.900]  justice happen and so dr steve pacinic reported this on the war room with me probably about a
[1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:20.300]  month ago and steve you know you said this the other day on alex jones but that interview went
[1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:25.260]  totally worldwide and i also went viral in china as well the chinese people are watching us hoping
[1:01:25.260 --> 1:01:32.060]  we can save these elections as well uh you would also monitor the election electronic data on the
[1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:36.060]  machines which are connected to the internet dominion lied about that so all that information
[1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:40.220]  can be cyber analyzed and then you collect it when it goes through frankfort germany
[1:01:40.220 --> 1:01:45.260]  so this is all on record steve so uh in this segment in the next uh talk about this process
[1:01:45.260 --> 1:01:51.660]  if you're running this process uh from a military perspective how you launch it how you let it happen
[1:01:51.660 --> 1:01:58.380]  and then how on the back end you prove it all uh so that you have a case in court and and then also
[1:01:58.380 --> 1:02:02.380]  maybe tied into this runoff election in georgia which they're obviously going to be monitoring
[1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:07.260]  where if you have a huge republican turnout and these republican senate candidates win by you
[1:02:07.260 --> 1:02:12.300]  know 20 percent well oh my gosh there's your smoking gun after everything else it's like okay
[1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:17.020]  clearly everything else was fraudulent before this uh dr steve pacinic explain how this would go down
[1:02:18.780 --> 1:02:26.860]  well what happens in a sting operation like this is number one time is something you control
[1:02:26.860 --> 1:02:31.820]  in other words what we're what we're really doing is something i've done in the past in other
[1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:40.460]  situations in the soviet union in pianama cambodia and what i was privileged to become or be within
[1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:47.660]  this scenario was the messenger of a regime change the irony is not that trump would be
[1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:55.340]  taken out of power but in fact the converse would curse so trump really set up the operation in a
[1:02:55.340 --> 1:03:03.260]  way that america could see for the first time the density and thickness of the corruption we had all
[1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:11.100]  away from the top to the bottom biden knew this it wasn't a surprise to him and the more that came
[1:03:11.100 --> 1:03:17.340]  out and and trump said it in the speech look he said they even told they being the democrats told
[1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:23.500]  biden not to do anything just stay in the basement do whatever you do and we have won the election
[1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:30.460]  that was in the georgia speech you don't see it in mainstream news the converse is that what happens
[1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:37.820]  is you get some idiot like komo on television to say that trump is delusional crazy so what happens
[1:03:37.820 --> 1:03:45.100]  is you stimulate the response and that's what we call in the business of transfer regime or regime
[1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:51.660]  change agitation propaganda and what trump was doing with the twitter and i'm going to be technical
[1:03:51.660 --> 1:04:00.220]  now was really agitating all the components within the corruption system so republicans democrats
[1:04:00.220 --> 1:04:08.540]  local officials senators congressmen all of them on our notice including people in his own team
[1:04:08.540 --> 1:04:16.620]  william bar done them and others and i've said for a long time bar has a very unscrupulous background
[1:04:16.620 --> 1:04:23.900]  he was a di an analyst a ddo a cia for seven years in the cia and he becomes attorney general under
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:33.340]  bush whose cia and then allowed the iran contra to be free and sanctioned the invasion of panama
[1:04:33.340 --> 1:04:39.660]  which i was involved with in other words he is exposing everything including his own cabinet
[1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:46.060]  to allow the american public a historical revolution that we'd never had before using social
[1:04:46.060 --> 1:04:51.180]  media all right i'm going to stop right there short break here 60 second break here and we're
[1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:53.740]  going to come back and conclude with dr steve pacinic don't go anywhere

[1:05:54.700 --> 1:06:10.700]  fight the great reset get prepared now all right we're back here dr steve pacinik is
[1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:18.700]  experienced we'll say an expert in regime change and so i want to put out my notion of what he's
[1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:25.420]  talking about here and then let him finish this segment the regime change that we're dealing with
[1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:32.300]  here it's confusing because it's not about trump who's already the president trump is the president
[1:06:32.300 --> 1:06:36.780]  the deep state regime is still in power the deep state regime is still running the department of
[1:06:36.780 --> 1:06:42.300]  justice the fbi the cia the mainstream news and our elections trump is exposing all of this
[1:06:42.300 --> 1:06:48.860]  this with the military at his at his back doing things in the shadows to catch all of this as
[1:06:48.860 --> 1:06:54.140]  it's happening so this is a long-term regime change president trump at the head of it now the
[1:06:54.140 --> 1:06:59.660]  second wave of this is happening mopping up all of the deep state as we'll say it and dr pacinik
[1:06:59.660 --> 1:07:02.620]  you were just breaking down how it's all been exposed in the last four years you're a hundred
[1:07:02.620 --> 1:07:08.780]  percent spot on so so you run so so get back to where you left off about the regime change happening
[1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:14.460]  explain how it's the regime change of putting it with trump at the head of just america first
[1:07:14.460 --> 1:07:18.700]  american patriots you know people that aren't bought and paid for by foreign entities out of
[1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:26.540]  china or other communist areas uh or blackmailed with the cia or ebstein blackmail and then talk
[1:07:26.540 --> 1:07:33.020]  about how you allow all of these shenanigans to go on you're watching it from a cyber security
[1:07:33.020 --> 1:07:38.780]  perspective a military perspective a legal perspective and then you have the entire front
[1:07:38.780 --> 1:07:44.380]  of information to say okay here's who the traders are here's who in the deep state here's who
[1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:48.860]  compromise here's who's compromised and then you could only at that point use the military to do
[1:07:48.860 --> 1:07:52.540]  it because you've learned now every other element every other institution of our government has
[1:07:52.540 --> 1:07:57.580]  been totally compromised uh steve pacinik get back to the uh explaining that and and get into the
[1:07:57.580 --> 1:08:03.420]  sting operation that the military has run right now to catch the democrats uh stealing the election
[1:08:03.420 --> 1:08:11.340]  for joe biden well let's understand that this is not just the democrats it involves all politicians
[1:08:11.340 --> 1:08:18.940]  at all levels and what trump is doing is number one kind of in the regime change what he's doing
[1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:26.300]  is changing the regime of the way we do politics and the corruption that was inherent both the
[1:08:26.300 --> 1:08:32.620]  democratic and republican sides when he came in and it took a businessman like trump to do it
[1:08:32.620 --> 1:08:38.860]  who had a history of not saying the things that people wanted to hear but doing the things they
[1:08:38.860 --> 1:08:44.940]  could not do and that's what i was explaining before for over a couple of years don't trump can
[1:08:44.940 --> 1:08:51.420]  say whatever he wants but you have to look at the outcome of trump's initiatives he built
[1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:58.460]  42nd street he did fifth avenue he did casinos in new jersey he did a skating rink in new york for
[1:08:58.460 --> 1:09:05.900]  the kids so what trump is doing now is giving america a lesson in what had happened in the
[1:09:05.900 --> 1:09:14.300]  past 30 40 years in the deep state using a very effective social media the twitter but ironically
[1:09:14.300 --> 1:09:20.940]  he has been the most intimate president i have ever think of thought about for the past 40 50
[1:09:20.940 --> 1:09:28.140]  years he's far closer to the american public with his speeches and rallies than any other president
[1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:35.820]  i've ever seen nixon was aloof carter was uncertain reagan was totally aloof not really all that
[1:09:37.180 --> 1:09:43.260]  prominent with the individual bush senior had a problem dealing with people in general and
[1:09:43.260 --> 1:09:49.180]  here you have a president who really says listen i'm going to tell you what the truth is and by the
[1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:56.060]  way i enjoy what you do and let's have some fun while we're doing it that's the nature of the
[1:09:56.060 --> 1:10:02.780]  overall scheme in which he's delivering probably the most lethal blow we've ever had against the
[1:10:02.780 --> 1:10:11.660]  corrupt system so it's encompassed within humor self-deprecation the notion that he's there as a
[1:10:11.660 --> 1:10:20.140]  teacher pedagogy and at the same time knowing how to use the spear of the military to use it
[1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:27.740]  selectively and surgically in some ways this is a payback to the cia and all the civilians who
[1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:35.420]  sent thousands and hundreds of thousands of us men and women into vietnam cambodia iraq
[1:10:35.420 --> 1:10:42.860]  afghanistan to fight wars we didn't need to fight and what was important to me as a person who was
[1:10:42.860 --> 1:10:49.100]  in the regime change business was listening to the first things trump said and this was the first
[1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:55.420]  president other than eisenhower who said the following there will be no more wars not only
[1:10:55.420 --> 1:11:03.100]  there will be no more wars i'm going to take my soldiers out of afghanistan iraq syria and this is
[1:11:03.100 --> 1:11:07.980]  what people like myself who've been involved in regime change who've been involved with the
[1:11:07.980 --> 1:11:15.420]  military intelligence had said repeatedly we don't need our boys as sacrificial lambs overseas for
[1:11:15.420 --> 1:11:23.740]  nonsensical cowards like chaining who refused to serve our country 11 times bush jr a chicken
[1:11:23.740 --> 1:11:29.740]  hawk who never served our country including his father bush senior who lied about the fact that
[1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:35.100]  he was shot down he didn't shot down he was a coward he evicted from the plane the clinton's
[1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:42.300]  who never served obama who never served other than working with the cia brennan an idiot from
[1:11:42.300 --> 1:11:48.780]  fordham university who has the audacity to talk about a president when he himself has messed up
[1:11:48.780 --> 1:11:55.900]  an analytical solution he's been paid off by the cia and the military industrial complex and it's
[1:11:55.900 --> 1:12:03.580]  a complete moron and was made a dci this was typical of the stupidity of the cia you have
[1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:11.740]  jena haspel a woman who had compromised herself terrorizing and and torturing so-called prisoners
[1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:16.780]  of war then on top of that you had so let me ask you this let me ask you this the cold war i mean
[1:12:16.780 --> 1:12:24.780]  we can analyze democrat party politics republican party politics mainstream news and reporting of all
[1:12:24.780 --> 1:12:30.300]  this but you're talking about something behind all of these walls we're talking about a cold war
[1:12:30.300 --> 1:12:37.340]  where it's the cia it's the fbi it's it's it's all these corrupt federal institutions that sent
[1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:42.620]  our soldiers to war fictitiously for fake news oh weapons of mass destruction oh 9 11 all the other
[1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:47.420]  lies we've been told you know vietnam so it's been for decades even for decades has been going on
[1:12:47.420 --> 1:12:52.860]  and so now it's the military with the proper people in head uh i guess saying you know what you
[1:12:52.860 --> 1:12:58.300]  guys did this to us you did this to the american soldiers now we're gonna do this to you and you're
[1:12:58.300 --> 1:13:02.300]  gonna be exposed as the bad guys because you know that's another angle whenever people talk about
[1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:06.460]  this they always want to blame the military it's not their fault the people in the military aren't
[1:13:06.460 --> 1:13:13.500]  the ones that organize these things right you you hit it on the head so i mean it's exactly what
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:19.260]  i've been saying and these are brave men and women who are in the military they've they've had all
[1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:25.660]  kinds of command overseas command domestic command but this is the first time we have a series of
[1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:33.820]  generals and individuals who are both scholars and warriors keith alexander the head of mass
[1:13:33.820 --> 1:13:43.100]  nsa and then uh was head of g2 army four degrees i have other ones who are kernels they have two
[1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:49.580]  degrees in software i have with almost every military officer i dealt with i'm dealing with
[1:13:49.580 --> 1:13:57.900]  an intellect and a soldier and in a way i was kind of their spokesperson because they knew
[1:13:57.900 --> 1:14:04.300]  i did not want anything from my service to the country i was trained in the intelligence world
[1:14:04.300 --> 1:14:13.020]  i was trained at mit by darpa and ironically by the cia but i never joined the cia and for years
[1:14:13.020 --> 1:14:19.500]  the reason why i never joined is because my loyalty was to the republic not to individuals not to a
[1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:27.340]  military not to a secret society but when 9 11 came in all of the officers with whom i worked with
[1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:34.380]  they began to see the problem that they had and how they were being abused and used for the service
[1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:41.340]  of chicken hawks literally this is the is the final goal here we only have 60 seconds is the final
[1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:47.900]  goal here to reform these institutions or to or do they have a basically a a watch a timer on them
[1:14:47.900 --> 1:14:53.820]  right now that's ticking down that's a timer and eventually they will be reformed or eliminated we
[1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:58.700]  do not need millions of people in the federal government trump was clear about that and we'll
[1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:03.820]  see what happens but there will be a major diminution in terms of the number of federal
[1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:09.980]  employees that we have and the number of institutions but thanks to you and alex we were
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:17.100]  able to develop an alternative way to express this in revolution because we could never have
[1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:24.300]  done it in the mainstream and now we're considered conspiracy theorists or wackos or whatever it
[1:15:24.300 --> 1:15:29.740]  doesn't bother me doesn't bother you doesn't bother alex and quite frankly i want to bless
[1:15:29.740 --> 1:15:35.740]  your audience because that was for the true american patriots who helped sat and i was gonna
[1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:39.900]  say that exact same thing that's incredible that we finish off with that on the same frequency
[1:15:39.900 --> 1:15:44.220]  i was gonna say well thank god for this audience for keeping us on air folks i mean because seriously
[1:15:45.260 --> 1:15:50.780]  i really thank them very well and remember this is a judeo christian world and we need a lot of

[1:15:57.660 --> 1:16:03.740]  show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for
[1:16:03.740 --> 1:16:09.580]  support constantly for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and then we're all this
[1:16:09.580 --> 1:16:14.220]  together and i you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey i got great products please
[1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:18.380]  bomb or we won't be here on air but it's true for the only media organization in the united states
[1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:23.340]  that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've
[1:16:23.340 --> 1:16:27.660]  harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here
[1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:32.780]  and as this whole new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've
[1:16:32.780 --> 1:16:36.700]  got to be taken off air that's why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other
[1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:42.060]  nations enslaved and america's still quasi free you can't have info wars has been proven right
[1:16:42.060 --> 1:16:47.100]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just
[1:16:47.100 --> 1:16:52.140]  get ready so thank you all and get an info war store dot com get some great 2020 election shirts
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:56.140]  supplements and so much more they're wonderful products and they support the info we're thanking
[1:16:56.140 --> 1:17:03.740]  warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover the
[1:17:03.740 --> 1:17:08.220]  giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new
[1:17:08.220 --> 1:17:14.140]  covid lockdown announced by globalist systems in europe in asia and now in the united states
[1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:21.020]  joe bite is set to announce today that he has a new covid task force that is calling for a
[1:17:21.020 --> 1:17:27.100]  national mass mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced inoculations coming
[1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:34.060]  but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to blame for covid and claim
[1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:40.300]  that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work
[1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:44.540]  those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and that's when all the
[1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:50.060]  mass arrest start sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent martial law plan
[1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:55.580]  and trump must be putiated exposed to halcyon gates and the un takeover not play games with it
[1:17:57.180 --> 1:18:03.980]  the trick that social engineers use is very very simple they just teach us that the architecture
[1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:11.260]  of civilization that the trajectory of the species is designed by these ever-knowing loving
[1:18:11.260 --> 1:18:16.300]  liberal technocrats and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great but
[1:18:16.300 --> 1:18:21.260]  then they tell us that humans are obsolete not essential and we're bad for the earth that we
[1:18:21.260 --> 1:18:26.460]  need to be phased out so they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us
[1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:34.460]  just being very passive living in the matrix like system that they're building but what defines
[1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:40.220]  humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment
[1:18:40.220 --> 1:18:46.220]  we build our own environments we create our own systems we really geoengineer and terraform the
[1:18:46.220 --> 1:18:52.540]  planet and its systems towards our aims but instead we're acting like animals and the globalists
[1:18:52.540 --> 1:18:59.020]  play the part of humans and us as cattle and that's the trick the great reset where have i heard of
[1:18:59.020 --> 1:19:06.700]  that before oh the great leap forward mouse a ton ordering all the small towns and small farms
[1:19:06.700 --> 1:19:11.020]  to basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big
[1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:16.460]  cities and go under communist commune control and that's all this is the big mega banks want to
[1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:20.460]  break us of the same ones that put mousey tongue into power and they're creating the process of
[1:19:20.460 --> 1:19:25.180]  getting rid of our old economy bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when
[1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:30.780]  you're a prisoner well everything's free but you're also a slave scotland is going to have universal
[1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:35.500]  guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level but of course you got to take those vaccines you can't
[1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:41.980]  have any kids and oh don't worry though all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well
[1:19:41.980 --> 1:19:46.940]  i'm not kidding so give me some free paper they give me enough money to basically live in a tiny
[1:19:46.940 --> 1:19:52.300]  apartment but they own you they control you that's the great reset that's why it's got to be resisted
[1:19:52.300 --> 1:19:55.340]  to total takeover and we're fighting it and in full wars dot com
[1:19:55.340 --> 1:20:02.540]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:17.420 --> 1:20:22.060]  will you please what will you please won't excuse me will you please wear a mask no please
[1:20:22.060 --> 1:20:25.500]  nope for the sake of other people please wear one please i'm begging you please
[1:20:28.940 --> 1:20:35.180]  there's some big breaking news on this sunday night footage has gone viral from last night's
[1:20:35.180 --> 1:20:43.420]  huge trump rally in georgia they're calling him a soy boy a virtue signaler begging and pleading
[1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:47.260]  for the people going into where their masks they're not buying into the hoax despite the
[1:20:47.260 --> 1:20:53.660]  fact that all the studies show the mask do next to nothing and they just passed a regulation in
[1:20:53.660 --> 1:20:59.180]  florida where with the pcr test they're not allowed to turn it up 20 30 40 times to where
[1:20:59.180 --> 1:21:04.540]  they're getting false positives without putting on the readout that it's a false positive so
[1:21:04.540 --> 1:21:09.900]  this overblown covet hoax is indeed trouble but here's what i want to say to the soy boy
[1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:14.860]  i know you're not a soy boy you're a globalist operative and you know damn well what your mission
[1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:20.300]  is world government here's the key right here it's on info wars dot com it's got the links to
[1:21:20.300 --> 1:21:25.260]  the united nations themselves that have run this global lockdown that is now triggering millions
[1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:31.660]  have already starved to death hundreds of millions were set to starve and now the un says that hundreds
[1:21:31.660 --> 1:21:37.900]  of millions will starve to death because of the lockdowns because of the chain reaction because
[1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:43.340]  of the loss of tourism because of the fact that places like africa most are businesses exporting
[1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:49.340]  agricultural products listen to this article covet pandemic measures could push people over
[1:21:49.340 --> 1:21:57.420]  a billion people worldwide into extreme poverty units 200 million 207 million could be driven
[1:21:57.420 --> 1:22:03.660]  into extreme poverty and could starve to death in the next decade this is the chain reaction
[1:22:03.660 --> 1:22:09.660]  this is the reality but claus schwa with the devos group says it's about depopulation he says it's
[1:22:09.660 --> 1:22:20.060]  about lowering the carbon footprint so now when you see one please please please save people this is
[1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:25.660]  all about collapsing the economy and the leftists know it they want full control it's mega banks
[1:22:26.300 --> 1:22:30.860]  billionaires that pay no taxes that have huge private jets and huge palatial mansions
[1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:35.900]  who are locking us down under total siege and the fact that you go to a trump rally now and nobody's
[1:22:35.900 --> 1:22:42.300]  wearing a mask shows the huge awaying that's happening 96% of the psora tests are fake
[1:22:42.300 --> 1:22:47.340]  german court ruled it portuguese court just ruled it and now huge reports that banned that video
[1:22:47.340 --> 1:22:54.220]  before we play this clip that wolfgang woodard the head of the eu medical commission came out
[1:22:54.220 --> 1:23:01.020]  and looked at the m rna vaccines coming out right now being approved in the uk and they
[1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:06.220]  attack women's placentice so you can't have children and that's the one bill gates wants

[1:24:47.020 --> 1:24:51.100]  too many people that want a virus to come back and depopulate the earth they're the ones like bill
[1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:58.140]  mar that say they want suicide and forced sterilization in the euthanasia of old people but suddenly

[1:25:08.380 --> 1:25:14.860]  operatives of the system their pr men and women out there selling us the idea of rolling over and
[1:25:14.860 --> 1:25:20.380]  dying and giving up on our own futures so they can piratently take it over and the good news is
[1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:26.940]  humanity isn't buying and i'm very proud of trump supporters seeing right through it and calling this

[1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:39.100]  having us run into our houses and never come out believing chicken little and the collapse of the
[1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:46.380]  sky while they take over well guess what your leftist milgram experiment your stanford research
[1:25:46.380 --> 1:25:50.940]  experiment your mass doctrine program may have worked on your own people but it's not working on

[1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:18.380]  you trash thank you alex my goodness what was that a guy begging on his knees for trump supporters

[1:26:23.900 --> 1:26:29.820]  around in a hazmat suit what happened to americans man you know i kind of want to talk about this
[1:26:29.820 --> 1:26:37.020]  vision i had last night um but you know what i really don't have the time but it's just funny how
[1:26:37.020 --> 1:26:46.940]  progressives are actually regressive and the total progression of society for human freedom
[1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:53.900]  for individual liberty is the wild wild west it is every american with a gun on his hip
[1:26:53.900 --> 1:27:04.460]  it is every woman with a a roof over her head that's that's the full progression
[1:27:05.820 --> 1:27:13.180]  of free market capitalism and individual liberty self-government defined that that's the ultimate
[1:27:13.180 --> 1:27:19.020]  conclusion and notice we got there and immediately communism came in to start ruining it for us
[1:27:19.020 --> 1:27:24.540]  you know there's a perfect example of this from the new yorker magazine where in 1957 the cover
[1:27:24.540 --> 1:27:29.500]  was a man and a woman married buying their first home with a dog and two kids in a big yard
[1:27:33.260 --> 1:27:39.980]  now it's a single woman in her dirty disgusting apartment drinking wine with pills on the table
[1:27:39.980 --> 1:27:49.580]  and five cats that's modern-day liberalism that's modern-day progressives which is actually regressive

[1:32:04.220 --> 1:32:10.220]  due to a virus year to bring in world government that also came out the north american union
[1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:16.380]  documents the judicial watch and lu dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well so we know their plan
[1:32:16.380 --> 1:32:20.380]  and if they're able to keep this lockdown going it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression
[1:32:20.380 --> 1:32:25.180]  but mass starvation of hundreds of millions millions have already starved to death not from
[1:32:25.180 --> 1:32:30.060]  covid but from the lockdown that's why it's important for people in north america to get

[1:33:21.980 --> 1:33:29.660]  sitting in the desk for alex today alexander has been one of the busiest men trying to stop
[1:33:29.660 --> 1:33:35.340]  this steal he was front row at the trump rally last night i don't even think he would deny he
[1:33:35.340 --> 1:33:39.100]  was hamming it up for the cameras a little bit but hey your front row at a trump rally that's
[1:33:39.100 --> 1:33:45.500]  pretty much like being floor seats at the lakers in the nba finals so i can't blame him for that
[1:33:46.220 --> 1:33:49.980]  it's incredible though ollie you know i saw you just put this on twitter and we'll get to the latest
[1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:54.460]  information on where we stand right now with stopping the steal but you know isn't it funny
[1:33:55.180 --> 1:33:59.980]  i have noticed the pickup of hit pieces on you lately specifically from the fake news cnn the
[1:33:59.980 --> 1:34:05.740]  filth of the mainstream media cnn the communist news network the clown news network they run hit
[1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:11.100]  pieces on you but it's funny all these news organizations whether it's myself or alex
[1:34:11.100 --> 1:34:14.540]  jones or any of us here fighting for america fighting for human freedom they they love
[1:34:14.540 --> 1:34:19.500]  writing hit pieces on us but ollie they never ask us for comments they never invite us on
[1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:23.820]  to any of their shows look for quotes or do any research they just publish what they think about
[1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:30.380]  us as fact and then uh really it's it's libelous quite frankly but those laws are hard to win in
[1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:35.580]  court uh so so talk about the attacks that have ramped up on you because you're trying to fight
[1:34:35.580 --> 1:34:40.940]  this election theft and then let's get into uh where it stands right now well it's hard to keep
[1:34:40.940 --> 1:34:46.620]  track of all of the hit pieces i don't have myself on google alerts we don't have a communications
[1:34:46.620 --> 1:34:51.660]  director i don't have a publicist you know we're about putting bodies in the streets in these six
[1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:57.020]  key states and then all 50 states on saturday at noon and we've done dc once we're going to do dc
[1:34:57.020 --> 1:35:04.620]  again december 12th on the national not mall not freedom plaza and um but you know i i i've seen
[1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:11.340]  clips of three different segments where cnn has ran hit pieces on me um nobody can make heads or
[1:35:11.340 --> 1:35:16.220]  tails of it you know the new york times and the washington posts have reached out and they want
[1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:21.740]  to do pieces and you know i'm just not really interested in it we're talking to more people using
[1:35:21.740 --> 1:35:31.660]  info wars oan in newsmax epic times ntd tv and uh right side broadcasting then all of the fake news
[1:35:31.660 --> 1:35:38.060]  media i think the flippening is here okay i've been waiting for this moment for years and thank god it
[1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:44.860]  coincides with a liberty patriot movement to stop the deal yeah we're totally kicking their ass
[1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:49.420]  culturally right now i mean just look at the rally turnouts that we're getting every day there's
[1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:54.380]  rallies in in in every state of america bigger than any biden rally i've ever seen so i mean
[1:35:54.380 --> 1:35:58.860]  that's a total victory for us but let's talk about and by the way that's done without any
[1:35:58.860 --> 1:36:03.660]  establishment anything no promotions no social media none of it it's all completely centered off
[1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:08.220]  that uh but still having those victories but ollie where do we stand right now we're we've had
[1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:13.820]  five hearings already next week we're gonna have a hearing in wisconsin all the evidence no evidence
[1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:21.660]  all the evidence 10 000 plus affidavits eyewitness testimony uh 30 plus hours of it and that's only
[1:36:21.660 --> 1:36:27.900]  that's just in front of the committees they've done side um testimony as well with it's another
[1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:31.340]  like 30 hours of that i mean i can't even keep up with it there's so much of it but they say no
[1:36:31.340 --> 1:36:36.700]  evidence i'm drowning in voter fraud evidence but so the state legislatures have seen it the supreme
[1:36:36.700 --> 1:36:41.900]  court has seen it it looks like the decision may come down to them or at least it is going to
[1:36:41.900 --> 1:36:45.740]  whether that ends up being the final level or not uh but where does it stand right now
[1:36:45.740 --> 1:36:53.100]  in your view ollie alexander well i'm a little punch drunk you know i'm i'm so tired um but
[1:36:53.100 --> 1:36:59.660]  what i what i can tell you is that in pennsylvania and arizona and george well look here it i don't
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:05.500]  it doesn't look like we're going to get uh special sessions called by governors be it
[1:37:05.500 --> 1:37:10.700]  democrat governors or be it by bad republican governors um but we're not going to get the
[1:37:10.700 --> 1:37:15.340]  traditional special sessions but what rudy juliani believes and he needs your prayers
[1:37:15.340 --> 1:37:20.380]  because he was just diagnosed with uh covid you know who knows what kind of targeted assault
[1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:27.340]  this actually was and uh uh what rudy believes what jenna ellis believes what i believe is that the
[1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:34.140]  state legislative bodies because the united states constitution grants them the uh the the
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:44.300]  rights and the powers to um to uh select electors we believe that you don't actually need um to be
[1:37:44.300 --> 1:37:50.860]  called by the governor not for this you might need a special session called by a governor uh to to
[1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:55.980]  you know pass some bill about pork or some bill about fences or something but not to exercise
[1:37:55.980 --> 1:38:01.500]  your constitutional authority so we're contending that if if a quorum of the state legislative
[1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:07.420]  body meets and they say these are the electors as long as it's recorded according to robert's
[1:38:07.420 --> 1:38:13.660]  rules of order then uh those are the electors and and there's a process for determining which slate
[1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:17.660]  actually gets the voting electoral college on the summer 14th and all of that and it's very
[1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:24.540]  powerful because you know my pence will would play a role in in choosing the slate so so in my in my
[1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:30.060]  view what's happening behind the scenes is we're aggressively lobbying the state legislators the
[1:38:30.060 --> 1:38:37.500]  brave men in arizona the brave men and in uh uh george and the brave men and uh in pennsylvania
[1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:43.500]  to force their caucuses to meet and if the speaker or the senate president which they've all been
[1:38:43.500 --> 1:38:50.860]  traders um decide not to call a caucus meeting then to call a caucus meeting and then impeach them
[1:38:50.860 --> 1:38:55.820]  so we want to impeach bad republicans i know that the process sounds you know kind of mundane or
[1:38:55.820 --> 1:39:00.460]  whatever but we'll have a video up soon explaining the entire process but that's kind of where we
[1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:07.660]  stand the supreme court and then these constitutional irregular um sessions to select electors
[1:39:08.540 --> 1:39:12.540]  well and just to put this in layman's terms because political science can be as you said
[1:39:12.540 --> 1:39:20.780]  mundane or confusing basically it first goes to the state legislatures to decide are we gonna
[1:39:20.780 --> 1:39:26.140]  certify or send the electors to certify the results that we currently are are having or
[1:39:26.140 --> 1:39:31.660]  reporting which would be let's say in georgia or pennsylvania michigan for biden and so that's
[1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:36.620]  why this eyewitness testimony is so key because it lays out look you can't certify this for biden
[1:39:36.620 --> 1:39:42.220]  look at all the fraud look at all the criminal activity i mean even even just by law see this
[1:39:42.220 --> 1:39:49.020]  is what's so frustrating by law in georgia and pennsylvania and michigan i'd have to do a little
[1:39:49.020 --> 1:39:53.820]  bit more deep research i didn't hear it get brought up by trump's legal team but by law in those three
[1:39:53.820 --> 1:39:58.780]  states the vote is null and void in multiple counties where they didn't allow pull watchers
[1:39:58.780 --> 1:40:03.340]  that's illegal every single vote that was counted without a pull watcher is 100 of legal so but
[1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:09.420]  that's the trick though the state legislatures are really i mean it's like do they want to go
[1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:13.660]  against this fraudulent election that they've seen all the evidence of or they want to go with the
[1:40:13.660 --> 1:40:18.220]  establishment do they want to go with the corruption go with the fraud because it's more comfortable i
[1:40:18.220 --> 1:40:23.660]  mean that seems to be where we're at right now right and and here's the question i'm just going
[1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:29.100]  to tell everybody i'm going to blow the rape whistle on the republicans and that is that if
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:38.060]  they can get basically you know 60 percent 70 percent of the republicans to stop their feet
[1:40:38.060 --> 1:40:45.660]  but take no action and they can do that in all six states then there are no primary ones because
[1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:52.620]  how can you possibly primary and win at a majority of the state level you're talking about hundreds of
[1:40:52.620 --> 1:40:59.980]  hundreds of feet you can't and so what we're doing is stop the seal and what info wars has done is
[1:40:59.980 --> 1:41:05.820]  spotlighted the brave men and made them heroes and women and then tackled the really really bad ones
[1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:12.140]  but let's not forget the majority of them haven't released a statement either way and so that's what
[1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:17.260]  we need to concentrate on we need to concentrate on calling a caucus meeting a caucus meeting
[1:41:17.260 --> 1:41:24.220]  is a meeting of just the party so if all of the state rep to a republican in pennsylvania meet
[1:41:24.220 --> 1:41:30.300]  and then they pass a resolution in their caucus that we want a special session then if the speaker
[1:41:30.300 --> 1:41:35.260]  the senate president doesn't do that then they can impeach him within the caucus they can say
[1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:41.180]  okay well we want to impeach you and we'll came up with the democrats to impeach you and uh so that's
[1:41:41.180 --> 1:41:46.540]  that's what we that's what's happening right now the republicans are running out the clock on you
[1:41:46.540 --> 1:41:52.620]  on me our vote and our beloved president yeah and you know it because we know that republicans can
[1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:56.700]  be just as corrupt as democrats maybe not so bad in this current time in this current time
[1:41:57.340 --> 1:42:02.700]  but it just makes you wonder right it makes you wonder oh are they not being told hey just go along
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:07.580]  with this and don't worry our smartmatic dominion voting machines will ensure you'll be elected again
[1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:13.500]  something very bizarre is happening it's it's something that defies math it's something that
[1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:19.820]  defies political uh science and uh you know at the end of the day you have to say well that's
[1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:25.260]  coupled with the coincidence the republicans don't lose a single house seat that we are allowed to
[1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:31.660]  keep um Susan Collins seat Tom Tillis's seat polling said we were losing those and i didn't
[1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:36.620]  believe the polling with Tom Tillis but it's strange it's like we'll protect all incumbents and
[1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:42.540]  let's say you know you're like i'll eat Owen that means they're in on it well no it's like it's like
[1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:47.820]  if you had two basketball teams and one team every member is ahead taller than the other team but
[1:42:47.820 --> 1:42:51.820]  then the average height said that the shorter team was taller you'd be like what i can see one team
[1:42:51.820 --> 1:42:57.740]  taller ollie alexander thank you so much we'll see in dc next weekend most of the world submitted
[1:42:57.740 --> 1:43:02.780]  to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the comics chinese and they get out of
[1:43:02.780 --> 1:43:07.900]  the nations and now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the worst
[1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:12.780]  australian models of complete lockdown so you can't even leave your house for months and months
[1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:18.540]  are being announced and in germany the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons
[1:43:18.540 --> 1:43:23.580]  to blast men women and children that protest the fact that Merkel the dictator has put them under
[1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:28.780]  her control that's right she's been rigging elections for years and years and the same thing

[1:44:13.580 --> 1:44:18.540]  us go into their control but if we expose they're the ones doing it they go to prison instead of
[1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:23.340]  getting total power and total control and there are major uprisings happening across the world

[1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:07.100]  robots being controlled by wireless internet commands but if you were a person just 200
[1:45:07.100 --> 1:45:10.860]  years ago and you saw that you think it was magic you wouldn't even know really what the
[1:45:10.860 --> 1:45:16.060]  machines were what was controlling them so for that person it would be spiritual or it would be
[1:45:16.060 --> 1:45:22.220]  something of a spirit and it's similar to how ducks and butterflies many other species of animal
[1:45:22.220 --> 1:45:26.220]  know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born
[1:45:26.220 --> 1:45:31.020]  they're following magnetic lines they have magnetic cells in their brains we now know
[1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:35.100]  side of what's going on there's been a lot more than that so we talk about the spirit
[1:45:35.900 --> 1:45:38.540]  we're talking about all the dark matter we're talking about all the things you don't understand
[1:45:38.540 --> 1:45:43.260]  but we know it's there and just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system
[1:45:43.820 --> 1:45:48.700]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people
[1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:53.420]  and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a
[1:45:53.420 --> 1:45:59.500]  consciousness manipulated in space time continuum there is an economic war taking place of the
[1:45:59.500 --> 1:46:04.220]  ruling class to consolidate power and control there's a headline out from zero hedge that
[1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:11.180]  breaks down bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose 157 billion dollars this year
[1:46:11.180 --> 1:46:17.020]  by the end of december it's already over 130 billion dollars they've lost why would they take part
[1:46:17.020 --> 1:46:22.940]  in the hoax in the lockdown in the hysteria if it hurts them we'll see that'll knock out all the
[1:46:22.940 --> 1:46:27.500]  small airlines and consolidate control and it's the same in every single industry and the big
[1:46:27.500 --> 1:46:31.980]  megabanks have unlimited capital they want to bankrupt the world economy go to buy it up
[1:46:32.860 --> 1:46:37.020]  for pennies on the dollar that's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was
[1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:42.780]  engineered by some central banks this is how the globalists take control it stars the third world
[1:46:42.780 --> 1:46:48.380]  to death makes the first world poor it's economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks
[1:46:48.380 --> 1:46:54.300]  that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives only the truth will set us free
[1:46:54.300 --> 1:47:13.180]  in full wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:30.700]  verse two antifa commies and actually kicking their ass that they have to get up and run away
[1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:37.420]  you know let that be a lesson let that be an illustration to the left of what you're asking

[1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:07.340]  standing up against this but uh you know i think what it is is that the culture has made it men
[1:50:07.340 --> 1:50:13.420]  believe that being some cuck libtard is like what women actually want that's all fake news
[1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:18.300]  as soon as men realize that women want a strong man women want a tough guy women want a patriot
[1:50:18.300 --> 1:50:23.020]  the whole thing will change overnight uh but but i'm digressing i'm going to get to this news

[1:51:41.900 --> 1:51:47.420]  how can any state legislatures certify this vote how can anyone certify this vote with
[1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:53.580]  all the election fraud here's one data analysis response when he was asked that question
[1:51:55.580 --> 1:52:01.180]  if you could just tell us in your um the simplest way possible as an expert
[1:52:02.380 --> 1:52:07.500]  what is your opinion as to the validity of the numbers that were certified today
[1:52:08.460 --> 1:52:15.500]  by the secretary of state and the governor about this election if i was an executive at a publicly
[1:52:15.500 --> 1:52:21.660]  traded company i would never sign that because i risk jail time and having all my money taken from
[1:52:21.660 --> 1:52:29.500]  me in lawsuits so to answer your question i would never ever have certified i'd rather resign than
[1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:38.700]  have certified those results so your professional opinion is that the numbers are fraudulent i
[1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:43.100]  believe they're fraudulent based on the data and my sister asked me a simple question this morning
[1:52:43.100 --> 1:52:48.300]  she goes how sure are you and my sister is a pretty stubborn person like me and i said i'd be
[1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:54.620]  willing to put my life on it i'm that sure about the analysis assuming that the data that i got
[1:52:54.620 --> 1:52:59.260]  from the state and everything else was accurate so you know if you give me all inaccurate data
[1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:06.300]  from everywhere then you know that's my only caveat and americans are putting their lives on the line
[1:53:06.300 --> 1:53:12.940]  tens of thousands more than ten thousand sworn affidavits of eyewitness to voter fraud folks
[1:53:14.620 --> 1:53:21.100]  that's your life on the line that's risking the punishment of perjury if you're lying of course
[1:53:21.100 --> 1:53:28.620]  they're not lying and you know i i watched all these hearings and you can see you can tell
[1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:33.420]  there's different state legislatures that then there's different committee members that are at
[1:53:33.420 --> 1:53:38.540]  these hearings some of them are very interested you know eyes perked like whoa some of them are
[1:53:38.540 --> 1:53:42.620]  very stubborn and hardcore but they're getting the information they're accepting it and then you
[1:53:42.620 --> 1:53:47.420]  have one democrat operative on each one of these committees that's just full blown leftist radical
[1:53:48.140 --> 1:53:52.460]  nonsensical operative from the democrat party and you can tell which ones they are because they
[1:53:52.460 --> 1:53:57.100]  say the exact same things oh that's when debunked that's when debunked literally they're just like
[1:53:57.100 --> 1:54:03.660]  parrots they play a video first time it's ever viewed anywhere in front of a committee in
[1:54:04.620 --> 1:54:08.460]  georgia first time it's ever been viewed this video first time ever been viewed ever made public
[1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:13.180]  and the democrat gets up and said that video has been debunked and then one of the state
[1:54:13.180 --> 1:54:16.460]  one of the committee members says actually um it's my understanding that this video has never
[1:54:16.460 --> 1:54:19.340]  been seen before not by trumps legal team or anybody in the media we're actually just seeing
[1:54:19.340 --> 1:54:23.340]  this for the first time trumps legal team confirms yeah we just got this before this hearing and now
[1:54:23.340 --> 1:54:28.780]  we're presenting to you now oh i thought it was debunked oh libtard wrong again democrat wise again
[1:54:30.300 --> 1:54:33.180]  and so this is just happening over and over and you can see that some some of the state
[1:54:33.180 --> 1:54:37.100]  legislators some of these committee members are like wow this is just outright fraud that wow
[1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:43.420]  but they have to be in a consensus but look at what's happening right now around the world
[1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:48.780]  i mean i don't even know what to think about this this is just wild norbin laden this is
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:54.140]  osama bin london's daughter says the message is clear president trump is fighting for america
[1:54:54.140 --> 1:54:58.220]  his energy is off the charge and he will and he will never give up he isn't going anywhere
[1:54:58.220 --> 1:55:03.420]  because he won he knows it and we know it georgia chanting we love you is exactly what we feel
[1:55:03.420 --> 1:55:11.180]  watching from all over the world again that's osama bin london's daughter i mean a cia cut out
[1:55:11.180 --> 1:55:19.820]  a cia informant that they burned so but i mean that's just but see she knows trump is fighting
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:23.740]  the very people that burned her father i'm not sticking up for her father saying he was a good
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:30.380]  guy i'm telling you he was cia he was cia cut out and then he was the boogeyman that they
[1:55:30.380 --> 1:55:35.820]  blame 911 for and then they lied about his death for political reasons an interesting point made
[1:55:35.820 --> 1:55:43.180]  by laura lumer from last night's event in georgia barely any applause for kelly lefler and david purdoux
[1:55:44.620 --> 1:55:49.260]  last night and then a fight for chump fight for trump broke out it was the biggest one of the
[1:55:49.260 --> 1:55:53.820]  night so basically the message is if you're not fighting for president trump in this election
[1:55:53.820 --> 1:56:01.900]  right now you're basically dead to republican voters and i did notice that but hopefully
[1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:07.980]  they'll turn out to vote for those two anyway and then in such huge fashion as a victory if they don't
[1:56:07.980 --> 1:56:13.420]  use the same election theft that it'll prove all the other uh tal tabulations and tallies to be
[1:56:13.420 --> 1:56:18.380]  completely fraudulent by the way these stop the steel marches are happening around the world folks
[1:56:18.380 --> 1:56:23.340]  they're happening around the country and around the world every day um there's a whole bus tour
[1:56:23.340 --> 1:56:31.740]  that's happening right now i will i just have to say i love the fact that info wars is always first
[1:56:31.740 --> 1:56:38.140]  i love it i love it i love it i'm not ashamed of it i love it so we did the first caravan we
[1:56:38.140 --> 1:56:42.140]  launched the whole thing and now everyone's doing it i love it i don't care that we never get credit
[1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:47.100]  or you know we're like bold more or whatever i love it now here's an interesting one her meat
[1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:51.580]  dylan by the way guys when you pull up her what she puts in her bio on twitter because i'm not
[1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:56.540]  sure i know she's a lawyer but i think she's just a fox news legal expert i don't really know what
[1:56:56.540 --> 1:57:01.420]  her true credentials are beyond that so linwood is pretty extreme right now and i tend to agree
[1:57:01.420 --> 1:57:05.340]  with most of what linwood says but he says basically any republicans who certify this theft
[1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:10.460]  belong in jail and harm eat dylan who goes on fox news says that that's crazy we can't do that well
[1:57:10.460 --> 1:57:17.980]  why why can't we do that see that to me is a losing message to say linwood is bad for saying these
[1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:24.220]  people belong in jail for certifying a fraudulent election no harm eat dylan that's a loser that's
[1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:31.180]  a loser so all these fox news analysts and all these people that oh we'll fight they'll never fight
[1:57:31.740 --> 1:57:36.860]  they like their tv deals they like keeping the peace they like being popular in dc all right
[1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:42.460]  that does it for today's alex joneshow harrison smith hosts sunday nightlife coming up i'll see
[1:57:42.460 --> 1:57:55.500]  you tomorrow on the war room you stay classy info warriors
