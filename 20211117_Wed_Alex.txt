[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:28.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  Manufacturers are embracing robots, the perfect pandemic worker.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  Orders for automated machines are up 30% at manufacturers like Eastman Machine Company
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  as producers race to meet booming demand as economies recover, but face a skilled labor
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  shortage and continuing virus concerns.
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  The demand is basically exploding, so you just need somebody to understand how to set
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.000]  up and push the button and run it.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  The dagger has been raised behind the back of the American dream as Biden's policies
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  stagnate the job market, the human workplace grows more obsolete.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  Able-bodied and or able-minded adults tend to contribute more to society than they cost,
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  meaning that they can afford to live off their wages and still contribute to businesses or
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  their community at large making the world a richer place.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  But in this post-automation world, we don't really need them to balance balance sheets
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  real-to-real estate or generally manage general management positions.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  That will all be done by machines.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  What won't change is that humans still need to be fed with food and housed in homes and
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  transported with transport, and all of this puts a drain on finite resources.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  Total and complete absolute vindication.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  The United Nations is directing a planetary corporate government with a World Medical ID app on your
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  phone that is then used to track everywhere you go what you do to charge you carbon taxes
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  for everything you eat, everywhere you travel, and it also surveils you in live time.
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  Even the New York Times is like, wow, this is beyond North Korea, but we guess it's needed.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  Everyone by law will have a phone and they say if you don't want a phone, they're going to come out
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  with chips.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  This is being announced on TV.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  And or they're going to biometrically scan your hand or your retina and it's going to
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  track you in live time.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  And if you don't either wear a bracelet or have a hand scan of the chip or the phone,
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  you will be arrested and you will spend five years in a labor camp.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  They're also announcing that you will, quote, do labor.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  You're not going to just be in this camp and do no work.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  The CDC has announced its shielding program to, quote, shield children during an outbreak
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  to take them from their families who aren't even sick and put them in government camps
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  for their safety.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  The Holy Grail is getting you to hand your children over.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  If you'll do that, they've spiritually won.
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.000]  It's over.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  A radical plan to crack down on social media abuse is being considered by the federal
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  government.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  For more nines, Oliver Haig joins us live in Adelaide.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  Oli, how will it work?
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Well, good morning.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  Essentially, it will work the same as a passport.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  Australians forced to submit 100 points of identification like their driver's license
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  or passport when using social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  Now, police would have access to those social media accounts and it's all part of a crackdown
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  on online abuse.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  Now, users could be liable for defamation suits or even criminal prosecution.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  It's all part of a plan hoping to deter people from engaging in bad behaviour.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Bloomberg reported that labor shortages and rising wages are pushing U.S. business to
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  invest in automation.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  A recent Federal Reserve Survey of Chief Financial Officers found that it firms with difficulty
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.000]  hiring.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  One-third are now implementing or exploring automation to replace workers.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  Executives from a range of businesses confirmed that trend.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  The number of industrial robots installed in the world's factories have more than doubled
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  to about 3 million.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Automation has been spreading into service businesses, too.
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  According to Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum, by 2025, more than half of all current
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  workplace tasks will be performed by machines as opposed to 29 percent today.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  Technology will change everything.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  Business models, but it will also change society.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  And we have to be prepared for it.
[04:39.000 --> 04:47.000]  The new technologies like artificial intelligence, like drones, blockchain, can bring many benefits
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  for society.
[04:49.000 --> 04:56.000]  So we have to be prepared to make sure that we exploit those benefits.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  But...
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  John Bown reporting.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.600]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[05:06.600 --> 05:09.000]  working for, quote, dark forces.
[05:09.000 --> 05:16.000]  The FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  And Moderna is in trouble as well.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft-kill weapons,
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front, and so people are waking up.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  The weapons work a little too good.
[05:43.000 --> 05:49.000]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead, they're making too big of a noise.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  But it's too late for a return back now.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  They're coming after our children.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  So it's up to us to protect our little children, or God will not look favorably on us.
[05:58.000 --> 06:19.000]  Remember, God is watching.
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.000]  This is all about sort of a one-world order that they're moving toward.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  And this is not a conspiracy theory, Alex.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  This is a conspiracy.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  And what we have to understand is that the big take is the United States of America.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  We're in this battle between really competing ideologies, and this is no kidding.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  And the competing ideologies is whether we're going to continue on as a democracy and a constitutional republic,
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  or whether we're going to become a communist country.
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  My father was a World War II vet, and my mom, thank God that she decided to have as many kids as she did,
[06:56.000 --> 07:02.000]  they handed my brothers and sisters on a silver platter a beautiful country.
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  I am not about to take that platter that I was given and turn it over to my children and my grandchildren as a communist country.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  Politically, people have to get active.
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  When somebody says to me or somebody says to you around the Thanksgiving table here coming up,
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  if you could afford the turkeys that might be on the shelves,
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  and they say, well, I don't do that political thing.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  Politics is for whatever.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.000]  Then you know what?
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  You better not complain, because our entire lives right now, everybody, every American,
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  their lives are wrapped around politics right now.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  If you don't think that something's changing, you don't feel the way I feel right now,
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  you don't feel the way these 5,000 people out here feel, then something's wrong.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  What we're really facing is an attack or an assault on all of our basic rights.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  I mean, I think the real issue here in play is the attack on freedom of speech.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  You have this incredibly failed foreign policy by the Biden administration.
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.000]  You have more and more very clear evidence coming out about COVID and really the conspiracy behind COVID
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  and some of the things that are happening with it.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  I applaud you for, it was one of your interviews 10 years ago,
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  probably 10 years ago, it may have been more than 10 years ago now,
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  where you actually were talking about these issues and you covered it for quite a while actually at that time.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  And I think that you got a lot of bashing by others in the media and by others around the world,
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  because it was like, God, this guy Alex, I don't know what he's talking about.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  And lo and behold, here we are a decade later and they have implemented this strategy, this great reset strategy.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  The globalists have said in their white papers, in their own UN documents,
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  that they want to create race specific bio weapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  A lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release bio weapons,
[08:58.000 --> 09:07.000]  claim that they're naturally occurring and then use that as the cover for civil emergency societal control crackdowns on free speech.
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago and when he got confronted by it by Congress,
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  he said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  Just type that in.
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.000]  CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out and they have to control panic
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  and direct every website in the US to one government announcement.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  to bring in a world government to counter a global problem.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  And the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[09:41.000 --> 09:50.000]  In a powerful hour long interview, General Flynn lays out the peaceful blueprint to save our republic and the world.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  The interview goes live on Wednesday, November 17th at high news.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  Find the interview at band.videoandinfowars.com.
[10:01.000 --> 10:13.000]  It's Wednesday, November 17th, the year is 2021 and coming up in the third hour today,
[10:13.000 --> 10:23.000]  we are going to air large portions of the hour long emergency warning that General Flynn laid out for me Saturday
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  that just blew my crew away.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  And again, I don't have a bunch of yes men around me.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  People that tell me what they really think and this was the most powerful thing.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  It is the blueprint.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  I totally agree with General Flynn to take the country and the world back and the fact that it's due or die time.
[10:39.000 --> 10:48.000]  So that is going to be in the third hour today and it will also go live at band.video
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.000]  which again, you can't share that on Twitter or Facebook, but you can share its backup URL that takes you to the same place
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  and even has links to the videos itself that you're able to share, freeworldnews.tv
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  freeworldnews.tv and please share that link.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  This is going to be a very powerful interview.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  We posted a little clip of it yesterday that's got 500,000 views on band.video
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  but it needs to get 20, 30, 40, 50 million views.
[11:18.000 --> 11:25.000]  Okay, you just heard a clip of where I was saying three and a half years ago that they would release a bio weapon
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  and say it was naturally occurring.
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  I specifically set out of China.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  I can see all the pre-programming.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  These are all PR rollouts that are targeting people at a subconscious level.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  So at about a 70 IQ point level.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  I mean by that, people are basically asleep and so it's very dumb down.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  And I mean I said just a week and a half ago, I said Gates likes everybody to know he's in charge of the government
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  and he's been somewhat removed from the direct command of the scientific division of the New World Order
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  which is the most important division under the banking cartel
[12:08.000 --> 12:16.000]  and that he might and a more radical group within their group may even just accelerate things including a war with China.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  And so I said last week anybody can go find the clips.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  I think I said it about 10 times at least on air.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  What was it about?
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  How many days ago did Gates come out and say smallpox being released by terrorists is imminent in airports?
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  Was it nine, 10 days ago?
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  Probably played the clip more than 10 times here.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  So I guess we've talked about it more than 10 times.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  And I said now I believe they'll hit us with smallpox and that's just what they do.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  And people will be like logically, wow, he just said it and just happened.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  He likes to rub it in your face.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  He likes to terrorize people that are awake.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  And then he likes to further dumb down those that are in a sleep state.
[12:54.000 --> 13:04.000]  And so here it is, a Yahoo News FBI investigating vials labeled smallpox found in a lab near Philadelphia.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  Just in FBI CDC investigating questionable vials labeled smallpox found at Merck Lab near Philadelphia.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  And of course they knew exactly what was labeled.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  They knew what was going on.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  And that's just to heighten the fear a little bit more.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  And that's how I was able on 9-11 which radical Islam does exist.
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  And if that goes on and you see the global spanking radical Islam today or Orthodox Islam.
[13:31.000 --> 13:46.000]  But I said on 9-11, I said 80% chance the next month the deep state launches a bio attack to distract off of people looking at evidence of bombs inside the buildings and just to create more fear.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  I just said that's how they operate and I think that'll happen.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  And of course we now know that the deep state mailed out the anthrax and they tried to frame several different patsies and finally killed the third patsy.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  So I've learned kind of the satanic algorithm they operate on.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  And so when you study them long enough you know what they're going to do next.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  You know what cards they have to play.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  And most of the time you can even guess what they're about to play.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  So this is a big deal.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  And it ties in with imminent conflict with China.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  China and the globalist arm that are in bed with it, that have married it.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  It's a league of doom.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  A legion of evil.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  They've already couped the U.S.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  They've already pretty much got control.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  They don't control some of the governors and legislatures and some people in Congress.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  But they're making their move to show up to take over the United States and the merger into the globalist system.
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  And so I've got an incredible report on that from Greg Greese that we're going to be airing coming up at the bottom of the hour at SunInfoWars.com
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  with the support of big banks, the CCP prepares for world domination.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  And I just want to tell everybody it's time to pray to God because I'm a pretty focused person that's been getting ready for this for a long time.
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.000]  And I'm telling you as a man and as somebody that doesn't have fear generally,
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  I can tell you that we are crossing the threshold right now to hell on earth.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  So get right with God.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  And I mean, there could be nuclear war within days.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  I mean, it's just so sad.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  We're so cursed.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  And there's already a space war going on.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  It's just really bad.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  And I'll try to explain it all when we come back and just so much more.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  But there's a good chance this could get backed off a month, a year, two years.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  But the Pentagon and the whole system says war with China is going to happen.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  And I'm going to explain how there's different factions and how that's going to play out.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  But there's a good chance it can get out of control.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  We'll have a full, full blown nuclear war.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  So get right with God.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  Your voice counts.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  They know you're angry.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia,
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.

[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  God fearing systems must fail.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  They started a fight with you.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  And they're not going to back down, and they're not going to go away,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  until they have the fear of God put into them.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order,
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  Not until people understand that, and that we're under attack,
[18:56.000 --> 19:24.000]  we have any chance of beating these people.
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep,
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  and ready to take on the next day.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  It uses a unique, quick-release capsule system
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  to ensure fast delivery of deep-sleep support ingredients
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  like melatonin and magnesium.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep,
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  and wake up feeling rested.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  Get the new RocketRest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at InfowarsStore.com,
[19:57.000 --> 20:26.000]  so you're ready to take off.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Welcome to the endgame.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  Welcome to the beginning of the end of civilization
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  and the rise of the technocracy robot hell.
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  Prepare to die.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  Or be part of the Great Awakening,
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  and choose the truth, and choose God,
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  and do the right thing no matter what happens to you.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  It's that commitment that'll take us out of this.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  Not many of us adults, but if we do the right thing and fight hard,
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  our children will be protected by God.
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  But if we won't stand for our children,
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  and if we'll let the enemy come at them with these bio weapons disguised as vaccines,
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  God will remove the final hedge,
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  and all hell will be unleashed.
[21:18.000 --> 21:27.000]  Okay. You know, it was Bill Gates that funded Peter Dazik and Fauci,
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  not just at the Wuhan lab, but at the University of Texas,
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  Galveston, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  and other level four bio weapons facilities for Dietrich Maryland
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  that created the COVID-19.
[21:41.000 --> 21:53.000]  And the COVID-19 is only a weak version of other generations they have on ice
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  in liquid nitrogen,
[21:56.000 --> 22:04.000]  and it's synthetic nanotech based off of those viruses.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  And they are prepared to release toxic self replicating poisons,
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  which is what they are,
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  that have a 99 to 100% kill rate.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  And when you get it, it makes a bowl look like a walk in the park.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  Blood just starts coming out of every orifice of your body
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  and it kills you in just a matter of a day or so once you contract it.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  And they're preparing with drones to fly over all the major cities of the world
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  to spray this on you.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  But first, they've got to get everything locked down.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  They've got to get their police state in place.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  They've got to get the robots in place, the self-driving cars in place.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  They've got to drill everybody like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drill
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  that, oh, you know, progressive viruses are worse and things get worse,
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  but it's really global warming and, you know,
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  if we're just good and do what they say and learn to be locked down
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  and learn to be controlled and learn to obey and wear our masks and stay in our houses
[22:55.000 --> 23:03.000]  and take our shots, then we'll be safe.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  So that when they really start killing everybody,
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  you will Stockholm syndrome and just stay there and die.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  So I'm sorry to have to really just be completely honest with everybody,
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  but, I mean, this is happening, okay?
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  And you have to understand that.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  I don't care if you're in the military.
[23:22.000 --> 23:23.000]  I don't care if you're in the FBI.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  I don't care if you're a professor.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  I don't care if you're a big banker.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  I don't care if you're in Hollywood.
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  You're all going to get killed.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  So the decision has been made to kill everybody and I've been trying to stop it, okay?
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  They tried to recruit my dad when he was in high school.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  He got out of it, okay?
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  But I mean, this is all extremely real and you just better understand
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  that it's going down, okay?
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  They have committed to this criminal action.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  And if they think they're going to lose in the extermination operation,
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  they'll just start a nuclear war.
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  The only way to stop them would be for a total mass epiphany and awakening.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  Now, the good news is that's happening.
[24:13.000 --> 24:22.000]  And I could go over a lot of examples of it, but we have successfully laid this out first
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  and in the most detailed ways.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  That's why we're public enemy number one.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  And people now see each chapter unfolding as I said it would.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  And so, I mean, I can tell you that people now are just coming out admitting the truth themselves.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  I mean, Joe Rogan last night came over to visit and then we did a podcast together with Tim Poole,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  who's very nearby.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  And, you know, Joe just said on the show, this is a cult.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  This is a brainwashing cult.
[24:50.000 --> 24:58.000]  This is a global group of psychotics that want total power and basically gave me a hug when he left.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  He said, wow, you were just right about everything, basically is what he said.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  And he said that on air, too.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  But Joe's legitimately very freaked out.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  He should be because he loves his children.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  And so is Tucker Carlson, a lot of other people.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  So we've got a real shot if enough leaders understand what's happening.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  But if we don't, it's all over.
[25:19.000 --> 25:32.000]  Now, it was General Flynn that I first heard from and some other people in the military that deal with medical issues.
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  People in the military that deal with science about the simulant virus proteins.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  And that's really what they're spraying on people.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  It's not a normally replicating virus.
[25:44.000 --> 25:52.000]  They hit Texas, they hit Florida, they hit what they want.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  And that Flynn interview is coming up in the third hour.
[25:54.000 --> 26:03.000]  But even a year ago when I heard that from Flynn, I was just kind of like, really, even I have trouble believing they're actually already doing it.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  And they are.
[26:04.000 --> 26:12.000]  The people that run the Democratic Party, the Communist Chinese, are running around spraying the stuff into ventilation systems.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  And that's directly from the highest levels of the Pentagon, just so you know.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  I mean, they know what's going on and their hands are tied.
[26:18.000 --> 26:25.000]  And the globalists are poking, trying to get a civil war going so that we'll be in a civil war while China takes over the South China Sea.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  And then just from there, all the dominoes fall.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  So I'm a moral person.
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  I'm not perfect.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  I've made mistakes, but I'm a good, true person that loves God and I love justice.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  And I have a responsibility to fight this.
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  But I understand that they've war-gamed every aspect of this.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  And you could remove the entire leadership at the top of the Pentagon and the rest of it.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  They're not even running anything.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  This is all technocrats now.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  This is AI out of big tech.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  And they've turned over it.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  It's already turned over to AI.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  And it's not going to work well.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  I mean, this is going to be spectacularly horrible.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  And it's because crazy people have been put in charge.
[27:13.000 --> 27:21.000]  I mean, why did Hitler do all the stuff he did and hundreds of millions got killed as a result of the chain reaction that came out of that?
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  Because these people like death, folks, and the people running things are way more twisted and sick than Hitler.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  I mean, Hitler was an amateur set up by British intelligence to lead the world into war.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  So I understand what they're doing.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  I can see their whole plan.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  And I can just tell everybody that signed on to this, you're crazy because you're going to die.
[27:48.000 --> 27:57.000]  I mean, this is, this is, you might as well just pour gasoline on yourself and light yourself on fire because it's all going up in flames.
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  I mean, you are destroying yourself.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  And I'm not trying to demoralize people here.
[28:06.000 --> 28:20.000]  I just, we have to be totally honest about how much trouble we're in if we've got any hope because hardened military veterans and others that are the real deal can barely mentally deal with this.
[28:20.000 --> 28:27.000]  I understand it's hard to face this, okay, but you're being hit by modern war. This is absolutely real.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  And you've already been put into a dystopia.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  You're already wearing a death shroud over your face.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  You're already marked for death.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  And only admitting that is going to get us out of this.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  And all I care about is doing the right thing in front of God because I'm not scared of these people.
[28:43.000 --> 28:58.000]  I'm got fear and not in a bad way. It's love, fear of removal from God. And that's the only reason I can even face these truths and stand against these people is because I am continually millisecond to millisecond being empowered by God.
[28:58.000 --> 29:17.000]  Hey, everybody.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  The whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media, the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head.
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  Still on the steering committee is Klaus Schwab.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  And he has set up the great reset in global government.
[29:48.000 --> 29:56.000]  And as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  We don't have a shot. If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[30:07.000 --> 30:16.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[30:16.000 --> 30:33.000]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[30:33.000 --> 30:44.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[30:44.000 --> 30:52.000]  That worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[30:52.000 --> 31:19.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[31:22.000 --> 31:29.000]  Protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[31:29.000 --> 31:32.000]  That's why everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com.

[32:10.000 --> 32:18.000]  Defeat humanity, then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[32:18.000 --> 32:31.000]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists. They must first play God, they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[32:31.000 --> 32:43.000]  And in a way they're right, if we let them lie to us and dump us down and poison us, destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to us.
[32:43.000 --> 32:54.000]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[32:54.000 --> 33:02.000]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[33:02.000 --> 33:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.000 --> 33:29.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he.
[33:29.000 --> 33:35.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:35.000 --> 33:44.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, November 17th transmission.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  You're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:47.000 --> 33:56.000]  I have a very important paramount announcement to make at the start of the next segment.
[33:56.000 --> 34:06.000]  And it's an announcement that involves all of you that listen and watch this broadcast and it's a choice you have to make.
[34:06.000 --> 34:17.000]  And that will be up to you and that will be the deciding factor in much of what we do forward because I've decided to use this as a gauge to make some decisions I've got coming up in the near future.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  So look for that in the next segment.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  As I said, the big General Flynn emergency alert, emergency message, peaceful battle plan to retake America and the world.
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  I haven't even figured out the title yet. I need to during the next break finish up the title for this because it's powerful.
[34:36.000 --> 34:44.000]  And it's a little under an hour long and then there's a whole second interview with General Flynn and in a panel that we're going to be airing tomorrow.
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  Coming to the Info War in the third hour today will be posted in the third hour to Band-Aid video.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  It's incredibly important.
[34:52.000 --> 35:01.000]  But again, I want to walk a very fine line here and a very straight line here, a very crisp point here.
[35:01.000 --> 35:12.000]  If you are given over to fear and if you were given over to a spirit of weakness, you will hear the things I talk about and it will demoralize you further.
[35:12.000 --> 35:27.000]  If you decide that you're an eternal spirit and that what really matters is what you do in your life in front of God and in front of everybody else as an example to be a leader.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  And that is what this whole process and this test on this planet in the third dimension is.
[35:36.000 --> 35:52.000]  And so when I lay out the horrible scenarios that the system is testing and looking at, as if there was a gun to their head to do it, not to save the earth but to keep themselves in power.
[35:52.000 --> 36:03.000]  Think about the end of the world coming in 2030 if they don't kill 90% of us and all the rest of this garbage, it's because they know the end of their reign is coming.
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  I mean, do they know something is going to arrive?
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  What is it?
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  Well, I think it's all right there in the Bible.
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.000]  And if you really look at the Bible from a little bit different angle than what you've been taught by these small-minded preachers, it's very clear what it is.
[36:21.000 --> 36:30.000]  And it's an exact warning, a transmission, delivered in person so that you would understand what was playing out.
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  God gave us free will but loves us so much, we were given the cheat sheet.
[36:34.000 --> 36:45.000]  We were given the pamphlet on how to pass the test.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  And we're now here.
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  This is it.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  It's starting right now.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  It might take a year, it might take 20, it might take 100.
[36:50.000 --> 36:58.000]  But you better believe that they're trying to force what this entity does to planets on us right now.
[36:58.000 --> 37:09.000]  This has been done before, ladies and gentlemen, and this has been repeated quite a bit.
[37:09.000 --> 37:15.000]  And there are a lot of people that are scared and they decided to join it.
[37:15.000 --> 37:23.000]  You know, I realize that my broadcast has driven a lot of people into the arms of the New World Order.
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  I know a lot of prominent people, prominent talk show host who have signed on to this.
[37:31.000 --> 37:40.000]  But they've signed on to try to make it a better Star Trek future as they always say.
[37:40.000 --> 37:48.000]  But it's not going to be a Star Trek utopia where humanity is empowered and everybody has a job that's expected of them and we're all on one big team.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  Are you kidding?
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  You look at everything that comes out of this system, it's the opposite of that.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  It's here to destroy us.
[37:56.000 --> 38:05.000]  So people can rationalize all day long what this is, but you can see it, you can taste it, you can smell it and it's death.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  It's bad.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  I need to get to this Gregory's piece and there's just so much damn news.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  And I'm going to try to stop pontificating.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  Very interesting three hour long podcast with Tim Poole last night.
[38:19.000 --> 38:26.000]  Joe was supposed to pop out for 30 minutes, he was there over an hour and Joe is definitely super awake now.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  And that's good.
[38:29.000 --> 38:42.000]  And that's just going to be the choice that everybody else is going to have to make in their lives about what side you're on, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.000]  But it is heartening to see the most popular people with the people are awake.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  But that's because we're humans.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  We want freedom.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  We want justice.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  We're nice people.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  And we all have the same enemies, folks, and it's a spiritual enemy.
[39:01.000 --> 39:09.000]  And everybody's going to have to come to grips with that or you will be destroyed.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  So let's go ahead and go to Gregory's report.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  And then we will come back on the other side.
[39:20.000 --> 39:31.000]  Here it is with the support of the big banks, the CCP prepares for world domination.
[39:31.000 --> 39:41.000]  Have you heard of this blasts in China all within a week, 10 explosions, 10 bomb blasts in one country in less than a week.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  Between October 21st and October 27th, there were at least 10 mysterious explosions throughout China,
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  killing at least 13 people and injuring many more.
[39:55.000 --> 40:05.000]  These mysterious explosions came just weeks before Xi Jinping was anointed as a revered leader of the CCP,
[40:05.000 --> 40:12.000]  preparing him for next year's CCP Congress, which is scheduled for next October.
[40:12.000 --> 40:23.000]  This gives Xi less than a year to make good on his commitment to absorb Taiwan into the CCP and unite all of China under communism.
[40:23.000 --> 40:30.000]  Allowing this to happen would be handing the world economy over to the communist Chinese.
[40:30.000 --> 40:42.000]  The CCP deploys massive fishing fleets to illegally plunder protected areas such as the Galapagos Islands because they are hungry.
[40:42.000 --> 40:55.000]  The CCP is undergoing a food shortage crisis, warning people to stock up on essential items and adopting laws against food waste and binge eating.
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  The CCP has been buying massive amounts of farmland in Australia and the United States.
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.000]  Handing over the world economy to the communist Chinese would be national suicide for both nations,
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.000]  who have already been infiltrated at the highest levels of government by the CCP.
[41:15.000 --> 41:21.000]  A handful of Republican senators visited Taiwan to vow U.S. support.
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  The U.S. Secretary of State has said that the U.S. will defend Taiwan,
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.000]  and Australia's Minister for Defense has vowed to back the U.S. and Taiwan against China,
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.000]  but who currently has control over the Australian military or the U.S. military?
[41:41.000 --> 41:54.000]  The CCP's own woke American puppet, General Mark Milley, says that the U.S. is incapable of defending itself against China's hypersonic missile tech.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  Psyops, something we have all been learning about firsthand.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  Many of us have read how they've done it in history,
[42:04.000 --> 42:13.000]  but today we are all witnessing in real time how the banking cartel is capable of orchestrating a world war.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  As China's housing giant Evergrand defaults on billions of dollars of debt,
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  Goldman Sachs is busy buying up these garbage assets with U.S. taxpayer dollars.
[42:26.000 --> 42:37.000]  Goldman Sachs is bailing out the CCP with U.S. tax dollars while the CCP is preparing to wage war against the U.S.
[42:37.000 --> 42:47.000]  By hook or by crook, the ethos of the Communist Chinese is what the bankers want for their world government dream.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  Every individual connected to a central bank, controlled by a social credit score,
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  is capable of doing so.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  All right folks, full report is on Band-Aid video, stay with us.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[43:06.000 --> 43:07.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  Good, bro.
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  Great last caller.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  The X2 group does wonders.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  They recommend it to everybody.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  You're on the fence about it.
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  Get off the fence.
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  Get the product.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  Support the import.
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  Thanks for rolling.
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  Go ahead.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  It's an honor.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  Awesome.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  So, just number one.
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  It definitely works.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  It's not a joke.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Absolutely.
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  And there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  hive mind in less than nine years.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  we know this is all really happening.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  And it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  And so we must prepare,
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  water filtration, survival gear,
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  seeds, shortwave radios,
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.000]  and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  Granny Do Right.
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  Granny Do Right.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  Challenge first of all.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  Let me say I love your products.
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  I am a granny.
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  And for all the senior citizens out there
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  as they're lovingly called.
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements,
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  but I thought, you know,
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  well, maybe that's what I need to do
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  But when I started taking it,
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  But, you know, over a period of time,
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  This is working. This is wonderful, you know?
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know?
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  They're here all over the world,
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  and threatening, in some cases, actually,
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  And they're planning in the next year
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  to expand their shield process
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  where they come and take, quote, healthy people away
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  is to get high-quality Faraday cages,
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  many of which are made here in America
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.000]  and are very compliant,
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  meaning U.S. government military grade
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  We have the entire line of silent pocket
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  We have special dry bags.
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  We've got them for cell phones.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  We've got them for laptops.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  We've got them for iPads.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  So protect your privacy today
[46:56.000 --> 47:17.000]  and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  I don't need to tell this amazing audience of activists
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  that without info wars, the planet would be in a lot worse shape.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  And it's because of you.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  You are info wars.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  That we have come so far together
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  and that we have a real fighting chance against this evil.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  It'll overtake us for a while,
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  but then we know what happens on the other side.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  The big victory.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  They'll win battles,
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  but they'll lose the war.
[47:48.000 --> 47:55.000]  Now, I can't reveal to all of you our strategy.
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.000]  And I know the enemy strategy.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  And so we have ways to ensure
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  barring my shelf being put in present,
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  which they're trying to do around the clock,
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  but I'm so clean that they're going to have to
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  completely set me up, which we're prepared for.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  We understand.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  That's something that needs to happen.
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  It's going to happen.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  Or kill me.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  We know they've already been trying.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  I'm in God's hands.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  And so I'm going to be on air as long as God wants me to be,
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  but I've also got to be a good steward of that.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  And I've got to really now do my most important work,
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  which we're doing now.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  And in just a few weeks,
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  we're going to make a lot of announcements,
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  and then in the new year even more.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  And you've got my commitment that I'm going to be working
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  16 to 18 hours a day,
[48:51.000 --> 48:58.000]  because we've been given this important office of resistance.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  And my prayers have come true.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  I really don't like corruption.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  I don't like child molesters.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  I don't like devil worshipers.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  And the Holy Spirit placed it on my heart really strong
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  to want to fight them.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  And I prayed to God that God would raise me up
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  and help me work with others to stand up for the innocent.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  And God has done that.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  But I will tell you, the Holy Spirit each time came to me
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  and said and showed me what was going to happen
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  down the road and different permutations of that.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  And it will not be fun.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  But I want to be Christlike.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  And we all need to strive to be like Christ.
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  And so it's a great honor to be persecuted.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  And it's a great honor to be attacked.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  And it's a great honor to be killed
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  if that's what needs to happen.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  It's an extreme honor.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  I'm very blessed.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  And I know my parents are very proud of me.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  And they're very committed.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  They understand it.
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  So is my whole family.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  And that's the good thing about this is
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  that I am just the most blessed person in the world
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  to be in this position.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  And my only regret is that I'm worldly and I've gotten mad.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  I've been annoying and I made a lot of mistakes.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  But my heart was right.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  And I love God.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  And I love you.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  And I'm not really worried about me.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  I just want to be able to finish this race as best I can,
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  carry out the course, and do as best I can for the children.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  Because I have a stack of news right here
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  where they're teaching pedophilia to our children
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  all over the country secretly.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  And it's coming out in federal documents.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  And where the federal government's creating a list
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  of millions of Americans as terrorists to be arrested
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  and rounded up.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  That's congressional hearings happening right now
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  in the Intelligence Committee, in the national security areas,
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  and the FBI.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  And I get tears in my eyes thinking about this
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  because we were once a really great country.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  We've always had problems.
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  But we really are captured and run by evil now.
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  And that's a very sad thing.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  We have the very worst people you can imagine
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  around our government now.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I mean, they are.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  It starts with child molesters, and it just gets worse from there.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  And so, God's in control, and prophecy's being fulfilled,
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  and it's our job just to be the light in the world
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  and to stand up to evil and to just know
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  that Christ is going to pull us through at the end
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  no matter what happens to these bodies.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  So, with that said, I have never really pushed hard
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  for donations.
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  I've done it here and there sporadically,
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  and I have sold my house,
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  and I am fully putting everything into expansion
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  so that just during this key time,
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  we just launch everything we've got at the globalist
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  and just absolutely do our job.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  That means traveling around the country.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  That means launching more shows, making films,
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  backing films, backing other people.
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.000]  It just means really focusing and letting the Holy Spirit guide you
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  and do the right thing.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  And so, I don't want to say I'm a proud person,
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  but I also never took loans to start this operation.
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  I depended on you and your support, and I appreciate it.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  But we need to continue to fight these rigged court cases,
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  even though we know they're rigged.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  We have to make them go through all their procedures
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  and then what they plan to do at the end of that
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  and the rest of it.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Because that's the right thing to do,
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  is to go forward and to defend ourselves
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  and to show what's happening and let them lie
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  and let them cheat and let them steal
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  and let them engage in all their corruption
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  with the media and the courts and the systems and all of it,
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.000]  ganged up on us because they want to get you.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  So, for those that don't know what a decent legal defense costs
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  to actually fight major Democratic party litigators
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  that bankrupted Remington,
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  it's a lot of money.
[53:04.000 --> 53:10.000]  And so, it's very, very simple.
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.000]  If you want to see info wars on a war footing,
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  if you want to see us maximize what God's given us
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  to warn as many people as we can
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  and to save as many children and others
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  from these poisonous, blood clotting bio-weapons,
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  and if you want us to really be able to,
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  in this key chapter, really fulfill what we're meant to do,
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  then you need to support us and I know you are,
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  but it's very serious and I don't care if you have a $10
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  or $1,000 or a million dollars,
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  I know we got all these billionaires, everybody else listening,
[53:46.000 --> 53:51.000]  to donate to info wars at saveinfowars.com.
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  Because then I can spend the money we've got
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  to run the operation and expand the operation
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  and take that money for all these trials.
[54:01.000 --> 54:08.000]  They have, right now, six trials
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  that they've all coordinated and prepared
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  for this summer and fall,
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  where obviously that's what the defaults are about
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  so I can't defend myself,
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  so they just say you're guilty and now the jury,
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  it's like a gladiator where he stabs them
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  before he fights them, imagine your arms and legs tied
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  and you're tied to a post and then the gladiator
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  comes out and fights you.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  They would never let us actually get in front of a jury,
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  so that's why they've rigged all this and done all this,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  they're gonna have all the TV cameras there,
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  it's gonna be all over, I mean, we're talking five,
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  excuse me, six trials,
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  four of them, the Sandy Hook garbage,
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.000]  and that's okay because they're sending pedophiles,
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  you know, the globalists are into our schools,
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  they're teaching critical race theory,
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  they're destroying the nation, they're devaluing the dollar,
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  we're in a war, so this is their plan for me
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  to try to take us off the air,
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  and then they just keep thinking I'd roll over
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  or submit to them because they think I'm like them
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  where it's all about me, this is about the mission,
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  so what matters is that we be able to complete the mission,
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  they wanna burn us up, millions of dollars,
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  and that's what it takes, a couple million dollars
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  in today's inflationary thing, it's not that much,
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  it's like a fire suit, and I gotta go into the burning house
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  and I'm gonna end up getting burned up in the end,
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  but I've gotta get the children out, that's the analogy,
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  and so I've got the fire suit on,
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  and the money you give us is the fire suit,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  I've already been in the house a while, okay,
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  and it does not feel good, okay,
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  but I understand there's a mission,
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  and we've already hauled out a bunch of the kids,
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  there's a lot more in there,
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  and I'm gonna stay in the burning house, ladies and gentlemen,
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  I mean, you're gonna watch us burn down,
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  you're gonna watch me burn up, okay,
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  I'm gonna keep going in there and hauling kids out
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  until I'm dead, you understand that?
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  In fact, I wanna keep going in the house,
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  that's the number one thing I wanna do,
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  so I need you to keep me in the game,
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  to keep me in the fight, you understand that?
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  I'm literally dependent on you,
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  I'm like a horse that lives in a stall,
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  you don't feed me, you don't take care of me, I die,
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  and all I wanna do is run, all I wanna do is fight,
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  all I wanna do is stand up for you,
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  I wanna fight for you, I wanna be your champion,
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  I need your prayers, I need your word of mouth,
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  because that's what they wanna suppress,
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  is what we're doing here, and I need money.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  Hell, I mean, the work we're doing,
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  we should be given billions of dollars
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  by these rich people, but that's why they're rich,
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  they hold on to it, you know,
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  if they had a piece of coal up their rear end,
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  they turn into a diamond, okay?
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  Good, they can be buried with it all.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  What I'm telling you is, is that I'm fully committed,
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  I'm gonna spend everything I've got
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  to stay on air as long as we can,
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  because I know that's our mission,
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  to keep transmitting and fighting,
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  and putting ourselves in harm's way,
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  because we're gonna lose everything anyways,
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  if we don't turn this around, so I'm fully committed,
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  I'm basically a kamikaze mission, everybody knows that,
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  and I appreciate our crew and everybody else,
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  and I really thank you for all your prayers,
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  but go to saveimfullwars.com, it's Gibson Go,
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  Great Patriots, I was already planning to do this,
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  they wouldn't let us raise money anywhere else,
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  you know, these are great guys,
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  ran to the CEO at the Flynn event,
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  and he said you really should raise money for yourself,
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  and I'm like, yeah, you're right,
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  and so it also supports Gibson Go,
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  they're great people, we're putting 5% towards them,
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  because it's a free service, they need to fund themselves,
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  it's very important that we as Christians and Patriots
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  have a place to do this, so,
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  saveimfullwars.com, please go there and donate,
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  so that we know we have the other money that we have
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  to actually expand at this key point in the battle,
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  I mean, I wanna really give it all to them,
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  and not be distracted with monetary issues,
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  because I don't wanna fold legally,
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  but we've run out of money basically, okay?
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  So please go to saveimfullwars.com,
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  saveimfullwars.com, one word.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda,
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  and with spiritual warfare,
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food,
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  it's all come out, and they're doing that,
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God,
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  the Creator, and we are powerful,
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  and the social engineers fear that so much,
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  so that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy,
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  is it true?
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  if the situation was hopeless.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  They need all their propaganda, and all their lies,
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  and all their evil, and all their cultural death,
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  because they know we are strong,
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world,
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  who is a loser, and that's why it's so important
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  that everybody keepimfullwars in the air now more than ever,
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  because even if you don't believe in God,
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling,
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  and we are opposing the one world government
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  By now you've heard me talk about the bio-pros,
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  and how they're creating amazing products.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  They've done it again, and have just released an entire suite
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  of bio-remediation products,
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  They're literally changing the industry
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  The bio-pros are excited to release Biorv Pro,
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  a product specifically designed to establish healthy,
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  black and or gray water holding tanks.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  Biorv Pro digests grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper,
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  and organic matter with ease.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  It is also human and animal safe.

[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  coupled with an easy application scoop.
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  Just pour and flush, it's that simple.

[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  and is safe for black, gray holding tanks,
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  sewer hoses, and plumbing.

[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  gas build-up, and odor.

[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  Stick it to the stinky slinky with Biorv Pro.
[59:44.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  Visit thebiopros.com and see for yourself.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  What a time to be alive, my friends.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  We're going to have such a jam-packed second hour.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  I had a general plan in the third hour.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  And we have some really good news.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  It's what they're supposed to do,
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  but that hasn't been the case.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Biden ordered OSHA, you remember last week,
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  three days after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  yet again, the full court this time
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  said this is outrageous constitutional power grab
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  with a federal police force to occupy the states.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  You have to get a law passed,
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  you have to have a constitutional amendment.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Four martial laws, what the ruling said.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  I mean, that's where we are now.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  People here are saying the whole world is like Alex Jones made it.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  No, I didn't make any of this.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  I was studying them and their plans.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  People keep thinking I'm Nostradamus.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  That's what makes me mad.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Have you gone and read what Klaus Schwab says?
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Have you read what the Carnegie Endowment does?
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  They run the damn CIA.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  They want to make humans laboratory creatures.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  You're already getting pigs now.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  So, Biden comes out last week when they have that ruling,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  and he says, do not listen to that,
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  he tells the federal government,
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  ignore the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Now, even the criminals that work for him at the high levels
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  try to follow the order, but their employees won't.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  We already saw multiple rounds of resignation
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  in the FDA and the CDC and the NIH,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  but they had to keep removing board members,
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  dozens and dozens and dozens of them,
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  and putting new lunatics on that would do this.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  I guess we're going to find out what this does, give it to kids.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  I hope they don't get to this.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I mean, Cuckoo Land, folks.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  It's all authoritarians seeing what they can get us to do,
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  playing with us like we're pawns.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  So now Osha says,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  no, we're not going to listen to Biden, the puppet.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  We're not going to enforce this.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  We're staying it.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  See, that's the way other talk shows would come in and say,
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  ladies and gentlemen, Osha has suspended
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Joe Biden's vaccine mandate initiative,
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  but I want to give everybody the backstory on that.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Now, they're setting it up for the Supreme Court to say,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  oh, it is quite normal to force or want to take shots.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Oh, well, we better all do it then,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  because they like the tyranny of the court,
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  and Amy Comey Barrett is horrible.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Robert Barnes was right about that.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  They were in Sotomayor and all of them
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  had been just butchering everything.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  But there's big pushback in the courts of political body,
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  and they got a lot of family members that are dead
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  or half-dead, wishing they were dead.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  So this is a real deal, folks.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  It's all about a spiritual choice.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  I mean, this is going to get real obvious, real fast,
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  that bad people run things.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  I mean, you think, like I told you a year ago,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  you think this is bad? Wait till a year from now.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Wait till two years from now.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  You're going to look back on 2021 like a vacation
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  to a beautiful Caribbean destination.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  And I don't say that.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Again, the enemy thinks you're weak.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Oh, you're all done for.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  No, I think you're like me.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  That when you learn you're getting screwed over,
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  you're not going to just roll over to it,
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  and you're going to at least speak out and say no.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  And if people just do that, the whole system falls apart.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  That's why they can't get half the airplanes off the ground
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  now to fly around.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And the globalists plan to have some of that,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  but not as much.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  And they plan to blame the collapse of society
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  on global warming and humans, and we deserve this,
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  but people are figuring out that's not what this is,
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  so they got a big problem.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  So, look, I'm loaded for bear.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  I mean, I got so much just over the top news to cover,
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  and I'm going to do my best now to cover it in the next hour.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  We've got General Flynn interview,
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  little premiere in the third hour,
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  but OSHA suspends Joe Biden's vaccine mandate initiative.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  That's one in FullWars.com,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  and we'll come back and talk more about that.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  And then, oh, but it's OK, right?
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  I mean, the elites have to take the shots,
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  and they've got to do quarantine.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Oh, no, they're all exempt.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  The heads of Google, a JPMorgan chief,
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  skips quarantine as he jets into Hong Kong.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Well, they're right back.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Triple A, 2139 is the info orstore hotline.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  infoorstore.com is simply the best.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  infoorstore.com beats out all the rest.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:06:12.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:31.320]  because there's a war on for your mind, body and soul here we are in the year 2021 in the
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:49.080]  waning weeks staring in to eternity wow that's pretty pretty epic and then we see our fellow
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:58.080]  humans obsessed with Netflix and video games and selfies to impress their friends when they
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:11.680]  have the keys to the universe in their hearts all of it thrown away all of it turned over
[1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:25.760]  the birthright to Satan for nothing so OSHA suspends Joe Biden's vaccine mandate initiative
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:32.480]  OSHA has suspended activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ETS pending
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:40.000]  future developments in the litigation says the agency comes after fifth circuit ruled workplace
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.800]  vaccine mandate poses grave statutory and constitutional issues yeah it's just flat
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:53.160]  out martial law they say it's a federal the establishment of federalization of all I mean
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:59.360]  federalizing the state police is like martial law but the federalizing businesses and saying
[1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:05.680]  like they said oh all businesses of a hundred more people are federalized and then you wonder
[1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:11.560]  why the banking department nominee is a committed communist and she says we're gonna seize all
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:15.240]  your bank accounts and all your bank accounts will now be owned by the Federal Reserve that's
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:20.480]  what they didn't zimbabwe you understand it came out that she's a shoplifter and they're
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:27.600]  defending her in hearings I mean this is just this is the takedown of America through incompetence
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:31.560]  so China can take over the South China Sea and then Europe will be under martial law
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:37.440]  Australia forever so will we I mean this is just unbelievable I mean what's great again
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:49.120]  it's a spirit though because 99.99999999999% of people are gonna get totally temporarily
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:57.680]  you don't care about the spirit okay physically your flesh is gonna get raped literally with
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:04.320]  these poisons and with starvation and everything else and they just do it because they're pretending
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:09.440]  they're part of the power structure they're pretending in that little mental facsimile
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:16.880]  they built that you're in charge and that you're playing along with this you ain't
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:25.680]  playing along with shit you're not playing along with anything but your own destruction
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:37.680]  doom I mean man I read this federal ruling and I already know all this but still I know
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:42.520]  you know it too you're reading courts going well that would be basically violates all
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:46.360]  these amendments and you'd have a federal police force over all businesses and I mean
[1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:56.120]  not even North Korea is that centralized I mean we're being brought into a North Korea
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:03.040]  but with a high-tech icing by a geriatric that craps his drawers every day with some
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:08.200]  crazy cackling witch with the crazy Clintons up there and the crazy Soros and it's all
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:19.040]  these ultra-rich people up there that are channeling off-world death and are just delusional
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:24.160]  they're crazy he ever been around really rich people most of them are nuts but I mean they're
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:29.120]  really rich powerful ones generation generation generation generation generation they're freaking
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:35.480]  out of control they're not human anymore something's gone on with these people you know I'm being
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:43.160]  philosophical here I mean cuz I've just got hundreds of articles here but this is such
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:51.320]  a problem yeah I never played that yesterday I should really play the famous Chinese dissident
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:56.440]  when they question him on PBS a few days ago and say is America isn't Trump horrible aren't
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:01.000]  the white people racist and he only goes he goes no no you're an authoritarian state you
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.800]  don't know what you have the takeovers the gun no no no no no Trump with the Nationalist
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:09.920]  or good you need to protect yourself he's like you're in danger to the host like you
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:16.520]  don't you're in danger but see they've grown up in a free country they don't know that
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:22.120]  they think it's funny dodo birds again on Galapagos Island would run right up to a man
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:26.360]  with a club or a gun and they'd watch one dodo bird killed right in front of them and
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:30.760]  the dodo bird would just sit there while another one whack them on the head blonk eat them
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:42.000]  for dinner and again I understand the paradox where people think well you know the people
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.720]  are dumb so let's let them die they're gonna kill you you think they're gonna collapse
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:57.480]  everything and do all of this and that you're not gonna be affected by that are you crazy
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:02.320]  yeah here's the clip from the Chinese dissident that I meant to get to you actually go ahead
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:08.560]  and roll it in your book you're describing the directives of Mao Zedong during the Cultural
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:15.000]  Revolution that would be distributed publicly every night and then you write this is your
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:22.320]  quote they served a function similar to Donald Trump's late night tweets while in office
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:27.560]  they were the direct communication of a leader's thoughts to his devoted followers enhancing the
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:37.600]  sanctity of his authority so do you see Donald Trump as an authoritarian I well I don't you
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:43.440]  know he if you're authoritarian you have to have a system in supporting you you cannot
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:52.960]  just being authoritarian by yourself but certainly in United States with today's condition you
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:13:00.440]  can easily have for authoritarian in many ways you already in the authoritarian state you
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:09.880]  just don't know it how so many since happens today in us this can be compared cultural
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:19.160]  revolution in China like what like people trying to be unified in certain political
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:29.600]  correctness that is very dangerous oh that's very dangerous hmm if you go to any of these
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:36.440]  leftist meetings or even read the WikiLeaks it's they're running a Maoist plan and I knew
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:42.600]  China was heavily involved but I always kind of thought of them as junior to the globalist
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:46.560]  but they've taken over it's all out of control and of course they're enslaving their own
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.160]  people and here's the guy telling you hey you're already in an authoritarian state you
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:56.320]  just don't know it and here's a little pampered PBS host making a million bucks a year whatever

[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:12.320]  man you mean she just doesn't know because there's no leadership there and she's just
[1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:16.280]  stock homing out to this and then here's a guy a famous distance like no no you're in

[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:44.720]  probably be dead so Biden comes out with a martial law announcement that's what this
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:48.600]  is a medical market we're not gonna lock in your house we're gonna make you take something
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:52.800]  and they gaslight you know we don't know why people don't love this this is completely
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.960]  normal and then it starts killing a bunch of people so everybody gets fired or quits
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:04.600]  their job which was part of the plan but they had this great plan lined out how they get
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:08.560]  control and depopulate us and get all the money and not to pay off the old people because
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:13.280]  they'd kill them but now now Fauci they were like but they really hate us and no one's
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:17.360]  going along with this and they're they're angry at us so let's persecute them let's

[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:26.600]  thanks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:31.240]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:35.680]  manipulated market for they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:37.840]  or it would cause massive inflation.
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:42.320]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:48.360]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:52.880]  force the collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things
[1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:53.880]  left standing.
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:58.640]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now, war on everyone is the only way to stop it.
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:38.520]  I tried to paint your clusters of information as they moved through the computer but it didn't
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:40.520]  look like it.
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:21:07.360]  And then one day you got into the third dimension from the higher dimension, we came from above
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:14.840]  and that big secret is going to be dawning soon and those that have kept humanity enslaved
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:20.160]  and controlled will be banished.
[1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:27.560]  That's why they seek to enslave us because they will be expelled.
[1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:31.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us as we reach the close
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:41.320]  to halfway point on this November 17, 2021 global broadcast, OSHA suspends Joe Biden's
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:46.640]  vaccine mandate initiative and again, the news is like, oh, that's just a formality
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:51.480]  while the court is going, no, he ordered them.
[1:21:51.480 --> 1:22:01.480]  Couple days after it happened last week, he ordered them to not follow the court ruling.
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:11.680]  Now compare that with Trump not wanting his executive privilege violated about private
[1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:21.160]  meetings totally protected versus a judicial demand by the executive branch that we're
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:25.040]  just not even going to follow what the court said.
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:28.800]  When what the court is saying is right, this is totally unconstitutional.
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:33.520]  You judge that and what's happening because if a president defied, say the Supreme Court
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:40.640]  said confiscate all guns, the president would say we have a constitutional crisis.
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:42.760]  You'd have to have a special session at Congress.
[1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:47.120]  You'd have to do something about that because that violates the bill of rights on its face,
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:48.440]  the charter of the country.
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:51.000]  But that's not what the courts are doing.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.280]  The Fifth Circuit right beneath the Supreme Court said, whoa, this isn't just unconstitutional.
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:58.960]  This is crazy.
[1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:02.840]  See, everything they've been doing has been crazy.
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:05.040]  Everything they've been doing has been out of control.
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:09.120]  Everything like a young man's being chased while people burn down buildings by a child
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:13.800]  molester and other criminals and they're shooting at him and he shoots two and kills them and
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:16.160]  shoots another and wounds them.
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:21.840]  I mean, that's on its face, self-defense, but they tried to turn that all around and
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:30.240]  now they're pissed that they can't gaslight everybody and say this guy's a terrorist.
[1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:33.760]  So everything they're doing is about overthrowing our republic.
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:41.440]  There's a big article on Info Wars that really breaks it down.
[1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:47.240]  Rittenhouse case proves establishment wants to bring back star chamber tyranny.
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:50.160]  Let me tell you who's living under star chamber tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:53.160]  It's Alex Jones and I'm not a victim.
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:54.160]  I mean, I expected this fight.
[1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:58.480]  I want to stay in this fight and I appreciate you keeping me in this fight.
[1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:04.600]  But they're never going to let me have a jury trial in these fake defamation cases because
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.840]  I didn't do the things they even said I did and they admit they want to use this as a
[1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:10.360]  pretext to take everybody's free speech.
[1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:11.360]  They're on MSNBC bragging.
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:15.560]  Oh my God, we'll just default to all the republicans and our judges should just default them and
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:18.040]  it's all, it's all desperation.
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:23.240]  It's people barely hanging on by their fingernails to power.
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:26.920]  And it's like a woman that's been beaten over and over again and she's finally packed
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:27.920]  up her car.
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:33.040]  She's finally leaving and the abusers trying to beat her up in the parking lot in the driveway
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:34.160]  to make her stay.
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:35.680]  You think she's going to stay?
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:37.560]  No, she's gone.
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:38.880]  We're gone.
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:39.880]  We're out of your clutches.
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:46.160]  I mean, you people are firing on every cylinder of Satan with the pedophile garbage all over
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:52.840]  the news, with the attack on our children, with all of it, people are sick and tired
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:53.840]  of the new world order.
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:55.480]  In fact, where's my stack?
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:01.120]  I have a stack right here of all the pedophile news and the federal documents as well.
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:04.960]  You know, here's the problem.
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:09.280]  I really do overprepare last night and this morning and then I've got all these stacks
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:12.000]  I've looked at and read and I've got them all ready and they're all lined up and they're
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.520]  all they're all prepared and then a bunch of other stuff breaks and then I just I just
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:28.080]  totally go off the rails here, but reprint me all the pedophiles.
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:34.120]  They've got oh, just there's so much of it and I don't know why I can't find it here
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:40.120]  in my stack, but I'm going to find it.
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:42.120]  We all know about it.
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:49.680]  I mean, my God, they're just everywhere coming after our children and then the parents complain
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:56.320]  about it and then it came out, you know, it broke yesterday, hasn't gotten any attention.
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:58.320]  Congress has the documents.
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:05.320]  I've got the documents right here and I'll show you that when we come back.
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:10.680]  And it says they're secretly creating a database of resistors that are going to resist, wait
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:12.360]  for it.
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:15.120]  That's right here.
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:23.200]  Drag Queen Storytime CRT and transgender training where children as young as five are going
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:27.120]  to be screwed up and told they're another sex.
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:30.440]  So then when they get confused, the state can take them and have them sterilized.
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:34.400]  I mean, imagine reading the science fiction book 20 years ago where that would be going
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.400]  on.
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:40.520]  You'd think this is never that would never happen and it's going on now.
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:41.520]  Yeah, they found one of the articles.
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:44.520]  I actually found them right here.
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:49.200]  Yeah, just reprint me that and reprint me the mom that's all upset that they're attacking
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:50.200]  on the news.
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:53.520]  I'll try to find her in the break.
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:54.520]  Let me just do this right now.
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:58.040]  And I've got some clips of myself and Joe Rogan last night where Joe really wakes up.
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:26:59.040]  It's pretty powerful.
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:04.280]  That's coming up in a moment, but saveinfullwars.com.
[1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:10.880]  I'm just going to tell you in the next minute we have until break that $2 million sounds
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:11.880]  like a lot of money.
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:15.000]  I mean, again, back when I was making $100,000 a year, I was super happy.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.520]  Nice car, nice house, everything was wonderful, had a hot tub out back.
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:22.360]  When you got a lot of employees and you're fighting the Democratic Party, you're up against
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:25.840]  some $2 million is like a quarter.
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:31.080]  But we can go a long way on that quarter and we can keep this call of the truth going out
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:33.720]  with that quarter put in this phone booth.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.400]  So I need to raise $2 million so that we can just continue to operate.
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:42.120]  Because if I got to take the funds of operations and put it towards legal and people go, well,
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  you're just going to lose.
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  It's all rigged.
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  Well, exactly.
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:52.240]  So we have to stay on air as long as possible and go through every permutation.
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:55.720]  And I'll go in on national TV and they'll attack me and lie about me and won't let me
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:58.880]  talk while I'm under attack, won't let me show evidence, you know, I've already been
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:27:59.880]  found guilty.
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:01.160]  I'm going to go to a trial where I'm already guilty.
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:03.960]  I mean, even the average person gets that that's ridiculous.
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:06.760]  And this will be an example of their tyranny.
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:11.640]  They are so mechanical, these leftist globalists that they don't even know what it's going
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:12.640]  to do.
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:16.560]  I mean, it won't be enjoyable for me, but I'm ready for it.
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:20.800]  But I need really good people and I need to just, I mean, it costs so much money to get
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:22.600]  a transcript from a court hearing.
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:26.880]  So $2 million is what we need to know that I'm going to be able to fight this.
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:31.360]  And if you want me to fight this and stay on air for a few more years, of course, I'll
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:36.280]  always be heard, but they can try to diminish us, then I need you to go to the new website.
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:37.280]  It's give send go.
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:43.320]  And I need you to donate today, ladies and gentlemen, saveinfowars.com.
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:48.560]  Make a $10, $100, $1,000 donation so that we have the other money to spend fighting
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:49.560]  the tyrants.
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:52.240]  They're suing us to pin us down so we can't expose their agenda.
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.440]  The children need our help from the deadly shots from the pedophiles.
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:59.360]  So support us.
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:05.160]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:12.880]  working for, quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:15.120]  evil groups are.
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:19.320]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:22.240]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:27.120]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:31.400]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:35.840]  but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[1:29:35.840 --> 1:29:38.840]  And so people are waking up.
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:41.560]  The weapons work a little too good.
[1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:45.920]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too
[1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:49.800]  big of a noise, but it's too late for them to turn back now.
[1:29:49.800 --> 1:29:51.520]  They're coming after our children.
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:56.520]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[1:29:56.520 --> 1:29:59.680]  Remember, God is watching.
[1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:06.600]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:12.200]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:17.560]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design.
[1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:23.600]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:28.480]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:33.600]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:38.240]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.240]  exist.
[1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:43.600]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee,
[1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:49.720]  it's called Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government and if as a liberty
[1:30:49.720 --> 1:30:54.400]  movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide
[1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:56.920]  authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:30:56.920 --> 1:30:59.160]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:30:59.160 --> 1:31:08.200]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:13.840]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:14.840]  in place.
[1:31:14.840 --> 1:31:19.720]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:25.160]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:27.920]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:36.240]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:40.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:43.600]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:47.560]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:31:47.560 --> 1:31:49.560]  the World ID and carbon taxes.
[1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:52.520]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:55.880]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:31:59.760]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:05.160]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:09.200]  happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:13.960]  my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:14.960]  with the climate.
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:19.960]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:25.360]  So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:28.720]  back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't
[1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:32.680]  really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate change, but did you
[1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:38.480]  know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations
[1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:43.320]  and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN, they have weather control trees
[1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:48.160]  from 1979, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:52.760]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for the idea of spraying different
[1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:55.480]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:00.840]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:18.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:42.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:34:01.280]  And that's what all this martial law and tyranny is about, is putting us under their thumb.
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:05.320]  Let's talk about the war on our children.
[1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:13.360]  Here I have two huge stacks just today of this, breaking, House Republicans have obtained
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:17.800]  whistleblower documents showing that the FBI is using its counter-terrorism division to
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:23.000]  investigate and add threat tags, that's secret illegal databases that Nixon got in trouble
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:28.800]  for, to parents, and say that again, House Republicans have obtained whistleblower documents
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:34.120]  showing that the FBI is using its counter-terrorism division to investigate and add threat tags
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:40.120]  to parents contradicting Attorney General Garland's sworn testimony that no such thing
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:45.840]  was happening before Congress last week, a lying criminal.
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:50.760]  I mean, this is a war, they're taking over, they're injecting people with a bio-weapon
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:53.080]  that's already killing millions all over the world.
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:57.360]  I mean, of course they're lying in front of Congress, while Congress just keeps pretending
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:02.520]  we're not in a war, we're sold out to China, they're devaluing the currency, the borders
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:07.400]  are wide open, they've got pedophiles making first contact with our children under pedophile
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:15.240]  story time, it's here, it's unbelievable.
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.040]  And here's the letter, Congress of the United States, and they got the documents, it's all
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:27.120]  in infowars.com, internally, how they're running this entire scam.
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:35.000]  And now we learned, two days ago, that the Attorney General Garland reached out to the
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:42.080]  National Association of School Districts and had them write the letter saying, terrorist,
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:49.680]  oh look, the grassroots is asking for us to go out for parents, I guess we will.
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:54.760]  We'll have helicopters land at school board meetings with guys getting out in suits, touching
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:36:04.880]  their ear, whoa, I'm getting intel, I'm, you're a joke, and I wish you weren't a joke.
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:06.160]  Believe me, I wish it.
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:13.180]  So this is ridiculous, and that's just one article, it goes on from there, I mean, they're
[1:36:13.180 --> 1:36:18.880]  teaching pedophilia in schools, I've got audio, video of teachers in to first and second
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:24.080]  graders, I don't want to play this.
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:29.360]  As an adult, I've never thought about things like this, or said these things on air.
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:38.880]  As a 47 year old that's been around the block a few times, I am made dirty by reading what
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:46.600]  they're teaching children, I'm like, what the hell, I mean, I can't even get my brain
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:50.600]  around this, and that's what the behavioral psychologists are doing, they know what they're
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:55.480]  doing, they are just trying to just absolutely, yeah, I mean, watch these people go, oh, I
[1:36:55.480 --> 1:36:59.880]  just want to be with your children, oh, they're so delicious, oh, I mean, yeah, the videos
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:00.880]  are just horrible.
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:07.480]  I mean, I'm talking about salivating convicted pedophiles, going, we're coming, we're the
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:11.080]  Democrats, we're getting your children, people are like, what the hell is this, well, it's
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.520]  what happens when we don't stand up for ourselves.
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:20.000]  Anyways, a joint message from the criminal investigative division of the counterterrorism
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:25.320]  division, the counterterrorism division, why they go up against, you know, the al-Qaeda
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:31.080]  and ISIS, and now it's, you know, send a security guard for a dad mad that his daughter
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:35.360]  got raped, no, no, you arrest him, and then Obama says he's a liar, and nobody raped
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:44.080]  your daughter, and of course, the person's plug guilty now.
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:50.080]  I mean, just like, like, why would a former president endorse the rape of a woman?
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:55.080]  Because it's about power, it's like, well, he's black, so, oh, if Obama's black, he's
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:38:02.280]  an Arab, oh my God, the Arab guy says it's okay.
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:06.240]  So it's all public about the threat tag, we just showed you the document, and then we've
[1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:10.440]  got this, I never played this yesterday, well, you guys cue it up, I got over a thousand
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:16.000]  soldiers ready to go, locked and loaded, black militant threatens any CRT parents at Texas
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.240]  School Board meeting, and this is the guy that runs around, and then I didn't even cover
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:30.800]  this yesterday, a congresswoman and an MSNBC host both said that a white supremacist at
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:36.760]  this guy's rally shot a black person when it was another black person shooting them,
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:42.600]  it's on record, and they're like, I tell you, Carl Rittenhouse needs to go to jail because
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:47.280]  that white supremacist shot us in our rally, and that was the famous rally where the black
[1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:56.120]  guy discharges the gun and shoots some people.
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:00.640]  I mean, I don't even know what to say at this point, because again, it's just lying, lying,
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:05.640]  lying, lying, because a lot of people are unconscious, this stuff works.
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.600]  I've had four times now in the last couple of months, people walk up to me at the mall
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:15.640]  at a grocery store on the side of the street, and at a gas station, twice it happened in
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:19.720]  front of witnesses, they walk over and they go, you murdered those children, you bleeping,
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:24.640]  and they'll have their fists ready, it's been a white male every time, like using over 50
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:29.480]  in every case, and you're just like, what children did I kill?
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:34.600]  You know the ones in Connecticut, you're like, no, I didn't kill any kids, because you don't
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:39.760]  know about Adam Lanza and Sandy Hook, you know about Alex Jones, and that's how unconscious
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:42.840]  these people are.
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:45.840]  They're just walking around like believing anything they're told, like, did you hear
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:49.920]  a white supremacist shot the black people at their gun march, yeah, yeah, no, the black
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:58.680]  guy did it, doesn't matter, because they're talking to people that are in a trance.
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:02.080]  And why should evil give us the advantage of ever telling the truth?
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.280]  Like me, like, every once in a while I want to lie about something, and I just say it's
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:12.680]  so hard to do, I can't even do it now, like I used to lie some to my wife or my mom when
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:16.840]  I was a kid or my dad, I mean, now I just, cops like, have you been drinking, yeah, boom,
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:21.760]  you're arrested, people say, why'd you tell me, I just couldn't lie, I just, well they
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:26.880]  don't say anything, because I mean, truth is like a river, you just can't stop it, and
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.560]  I can't imagine what it's like to be these people that are the people of the lie, that's
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:37.720]  what satanists do, they lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie,
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:43.400]  and they lie, who wants to live in a world with these people?
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:50.080]  Go and do a school board, because parents of black kids, white kids, Hispanic kids, children
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:53.920]  don't want to hear that white people are the devil, and that communism's good, and here
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:59.520]  he is threatening a bunch of people, oh and the FBI thinks that's wonderful, here it is.
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:03.760]  I got over a thousand folks ready to go.
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:13.480]  We're not the board, he's the judges, we're not the board.
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:17.220]  You're not a judge, and against the board, you're the judge, and against the board,
[1:41:17.220 --> 1:41:28.600]  it's not me, if you want to talk to me, I'd be happy to talk to you, turn on the
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:44.360]  And then look at the theater. You've got the black sheriff's deputy wearing a Darth Vader
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:50.640]  outfit because of COVID. I mean, this is, this is clown world, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:56.520]  You got a bunch of parents don't want pedophilia and, and, and, and, and I'm sorry, Aztec prayers
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:03.160]  for human sacrifice being taught. And a black dude shows up and says, I'll bring a thousand
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:09.240]  people in here and take your ass out. He doesn't represent black people. He represents the
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:15.920]  establishment. You better believe the feds in my opinion are paying him. I bet my right
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:24.400]  arm probably Southern probably lost center ADL. I mean, just look at this. He's there
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:31.760]  to create division, ladies and gentlemen. And it's disgusting. All right. I hit some
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:38.720]  of it. And I got a lot more here. But wow. Of course, the justice department directed
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:43.080]  the National Association of school districts to say anybody protesting. This is terrorist.
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:48.920]  This is an authoritarian takeover. When we come back, when we come back, I've got the
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:54.920]  Joe Rogan clubs from last night, which are really, really good news. And the big Flynn
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:43:02.040]  interview. I'm up here working on a Thursday when run contact tracers aren't coming. They're
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:06.920]  here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:10.400]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:16.120]  house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:21.280]  facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:25.040]  they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:28.840]  safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.480]  back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:39.040]  are very compliant, meaning us government military grade at info war store.com. We have

[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:31.160]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:35.400]  passports. They even admit it. Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it. They're
[1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:38.920]  going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you
[1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:44.240]  can do. That's what the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that. You'll accept anything.
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:48.400]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:51.320]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:55.480]  nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all
[1:45:55.480 --> 1:46:00.240]  of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:04.720]  By now, you've heard me talk about the Biopros and how they're creating amazing products.
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:10.280]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:14.520]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer. They're literally changing
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:19.200]  the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system. The Biopros are excited to
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:25.920]  release Bioportapro, a product specifically designed to establish healthy waste tanks
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:31.040]  and pits. Bioportapro, digest grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper and organic matter with
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:36.500]  ease. It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and it's safe for all portable restrooms, porta
[1:46:36.500 --> 1:46:43.680]  potties, outhouses and pit toilets. It is also human and animal safe. Get up to 20 treatments
[1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:49.240]  with the scoop for easy applications. Just pour and flush, it's that simple. Say goodbye
[1:46:49.240 --> 1:47:15.000]  to anyone with了吧양, you'll be free to donate it to your community at risk, like
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Hold on, and I can feel it!
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  The globalist hatred of yours truly is a badge of honor.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  It's a badge of fulfillment,
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  completion, and that's why I'm so blessed for you keeping me in the fight.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  You're the ones that kept me in the fight.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  You're the ones that kept us on air to persevere and to defend the children and the innocents and to expose the globalist.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  And so they could kill me tomorrow.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  They could put me in prison next week.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  But at the end of the day, we are having a massive victory and we've already won.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  But I do want to stay in this fight a lot longer.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  See, that's the paradox.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  As their whole globalist system unfolds and everything I've told you was coming happens,
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  what are they going to do?
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Well, you can't have Alex Jones around, so what do you do?
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Well, you look at everything Jones has done, everything he's covered, he questions every big event.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  So he questions Sandy Hook, shoo him for that and said, Alex Jones up against children.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  But then when he didn't do the things they said he did, well, you can't have a jury trial.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  So let's default him.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  But it's too late.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  I mean, just like persecuting Rittenhouse or persecuting Donald Trump or anybody,
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  the public gets what you've done now.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  And so your attacks only then give us that much more support.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  I mean, I've known Joe Rogan for, I met him in like 1998, started hanging out with him in 1999.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  I'd say about 2001, we were friends, you'll hang out quite a bit.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Got to be really good friends, 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  But Joe always thought I was crazy.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  You know, Joe doesn't go off what other people think.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  He doesn't go off what other people believe.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  He's a really smart guy, very smart.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And he just thought my worldview was insane and now Joe doesn't think that anymore.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  Now Joe is like beginning to really wake up and saying, oh my God, it's worse than you say, Jones.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  In fact, let me explain.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  Joe Rogan isn't an Alex Jones acolyte.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  He's worse than me now.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  He's slicker.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  He's better.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  He's more judo about it.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  I know he's a jitsu, but it's judo what he's doing.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  And the more they mess with him, now it's a sport with him.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  It's a combat sport and then Joe is a badass.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  And so now that he gets, he's under attack.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  Well, it's game over, New World Order.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  See how that works.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  And that's what General Flynn interview next hour is about, is realizing you're under attack, realizing it's happening.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  And then saying, I'm not going to roll over and die to this.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  I'm going to fight this with economics and with information and spiritually.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  And if they come for you physically, and that is a beautiful moment when you reach that point of life.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  Wow, they're really out to get me.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  This wasn't some paranoid stuff that this is happening.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  And then you're in that moment of clarity.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  And it's not just Joe that Info Wars has, I mean, Joe said it, the critical piece getting him to the next level and beyond.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  And Tucker Carlson.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  I mean, I'm like Count Dracula, man.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  If you want to use a vampire analogy, I bit every day in one of these people.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  And that's why the New World Order hates my ass.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Because I'm, in their view, they're really the vampires.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  You understand, they're literal vampires, spiritual vampires.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  But see, they see everything through their lens. I'm the big Count Dracula.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  Which is true.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  I mean, I am patient zero for the big awakening, but that's because I knew what was going on and I dialed into all of you.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  You are Count Dracula to these people.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  You got that?
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  I know history. I understand destiny. I understand what they were doing.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  I thought, hey, we'll fight these people.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  We'll expose them when they launch their operation.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  That's credibility. I'll get killed the process, probably.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  I mean, I knew, wait, I'm not stupid.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  I mean, I was shining on, baby, in blood.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  That meant total commitment.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  How many of the Joe Rogan clips next segment, and then I'll get to the Flynn interview.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  The Flynn interview just went live. It's amazing.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  It's probably our best work yet.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  I mean, in-game, you could say overall is more important, but this is in-game 2.0.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  This is the battle plan for victory.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  General Flynn issues emergency warning to Americans.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  And the world and the video is now live on infowars.com.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  That's the live show feed name.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  The actual name of the video is Global Exclusive General Michael T. Flynn lays out plan to save America and the world.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  And what's crazy is that's real.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  There's fake stuff in the universe. There's real stuff in the universe.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  General Flynn's real. I'm real.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  As real as a heart attack. Here it is.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Got a thousand views on Bandai Video. Just went live. Go share it.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  Go get it out. Download it. Take clips out.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  Freeworldnews.tv. Freeworldnews.tv. That's the URL. They're not sent to me yet.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  You can get out on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  Email it. Share it. The battle plan, the answer, it's all there.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  It's on infowars.com. It's on freeworldnews.tv. It's on Bandai Video.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  How long is this little thing we're about to play? I forget.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  It's not on my list here. The reset war video we're about to play.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  Three minutes. That's what I thought.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  So this is just a prelude of what we're launching in 15 days.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  About 15 days. 14 days.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  This is a prelude to what we're about to release.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  And we've got even more stuff we're going to release.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  So this is just one more of the things we're doing and it's God inspired this.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  And this is the keys to your mind and soul.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  This is what the enemy's got that you want to get back.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  That through divine revelation, literally, we've been given to take back power.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  I mean, this is hydrogen bomb stuff. This is victory. Big fat Vs.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Just think of that. And it's there for you right now.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  This is not on the web yet. This is not been posted to Bandai Video.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  We'll be later. So you can share it.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen, resetwars.com.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  And it's a simple sign up for an email right now.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  So you'll get the exclusive information coming up in just a few weeks.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  This is resetwars.com.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  This is resetwars.com.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Evil is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  and that group consciousness is forming and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Everything that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  and not just enslave us, but finally completely destroy us
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  and absorb our energy into this system they're building.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  This is beyond the Satanic ritual. This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  because this is actually happening in the real world today.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  And we have discovered their secrets. We've discovered how to stop them.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And we have put it all together in an easy to understand system
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalists,
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  but to transcend to the next level.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  It's so important for all of you that already know this and have already witnessed this for yourselves to understand.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  You are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  so that you and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  before they get trapped in this artificial matrix system the globalists are building.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original. Documents came out in 1990 from the late 1970s
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very similar to The Matrix
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  and all that information is now public. They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  not just holding us a third dimension but actually creating an artificial slave system
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Humanity are not robots. No matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell us this
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  but they are trying to turn us into robots.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  That's why in December of 2021 we are launching reset rules.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  Find out more information at ResetWars.com
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  ResetWars.com
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  The Globalists
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Jacob and Ohio, welcome go ahead.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  Hey how's it going Alex? Good bro.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  They're basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  If I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the product.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  The XG does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the info ward.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  Honor, talk to you.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it. Alright, it helps in the bedroom.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  Absolutely.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  I got a big Flint interview coming up.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  I just went live at Infowars.com and NewsWars.com.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  I hope you share the hell out of it.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  Let me tell you, it's the stuff of victory.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  It's 1776 part two.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  It's lightning and a bottle, and that's why they just put out a smoke screen.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:44.440]  put out a smoke screen, a millions of lies and propaganda and, and an indis-info and, and all
[2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:49.000]  their crap. So you just get so confused, you just hide in your house because there's the answer.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:53.800]  General Flynn is on fire. But let's go to some of these Joe Rogan clips I mentioned. Just, just
[2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:59.000]  go ahead and start and go right through them. Go ahead. Go ahead and start with the top one
[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:07.160]  of Joe. You're talking about how the left is a cult. And, and, and, and as listeners, you're
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:12.040]  awake. You know that. But I mean, look, people are waking up some of them later than others
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:17.240]  because they just couldn't believe it was true. Here it is. Understand is this propaganda is so
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:21.480]  dangerous not because they're just telling lies, but they're attempting to control the narrative,
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:25.320]  which is an attempt to control your mind. And that's what's dangerous. Whether you're Republican or
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:29.800]  Democrat, that should seriously concern you because this is what they do to control the minds of
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:34.360]  millions of people. And it's allowed on a daily basis. And it's like, why don't, it's encouraging.
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:38.680]  Why don't people take issue with this that people are trying to control your mind?
[2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:43.560]  It's so sad because I don't know any progressive. I know a lot of progressives and not one of them
[2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:49.160]  knows that one of the victims of Kyle was a pedophile. They all think it was an innocent
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:54.120]  black BLM protestor who raped the kid. It's not like he had a traction. Five kids, five kids,
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:02:00.520]  five kids, and he was an underage boy during this, you know, battle with him. So it's it
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:03.960]  messed with people so badly. I know so many people that have no information about the case,
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:08.200]  but have an opinion completely made up. It wasn't the other guy. Didn't he get all his charges
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:13.160]  dismissed on the previous six days before? Yeah. Six days before he had a DUI charge dropped,
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:17.320]  but he was a career criminal. I mean, he went down for domestic abuse, prowling, trespassing,
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:22.040]  two DUIs, felony burglary, two counts of carrying a firearm while intoxicated. Bro,
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:29.880]  this is a cult. Yep. We're in a cult. This is a cult. Tell us Joe. Tell us Joe. Speak to us,
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:38.120]  leader. The Kool-Aid tape. This information is not based on reality. This is a left wing cult
[2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:42.520]  and they're they're pumping stuff out and then they're confirming this belief. They're they're
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:46.920]  all getting together and they're ignoring contrary evidence. Yes, they're ignoring any narrative,
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:50.920]  the challenges, their belief about what happened, and they're not looking at it realistically.
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:55.720]  They're only looking at it like you would look at it if you're in a cult. So that video is all
[2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:03.400]  over the country right now. That was last night. So there's a lot of other clubs, but they're
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:08.600]  on enforce.com everywhere where you can go watch the three hour podcast and pull. Joe had to go
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:13.160]  to a comedy show at the Vulcan Gas Company where we hang out quite a bit. Everybody already knows
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:21.480]  that's a secret, but I love Tim Pool and I love Michael Mouse, but they wouldn't like Joe would
[2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:25.560]  barely talk for the hour he was there and they would not let him talk. So you think Alan Jones
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:29.160]  is the interrupter? They were even worse, but I get it. It's their show and there was like
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:34.840]  five, six people. I guess we're seven people in there. And so it was a great three hour podcast
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:40.680]  an hour with Joe Rogan and just Joe was being Joe now. He's super awake. Joe doesn't just buy
[2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:47.480]  into some ideology right away, but I've been like a woodpecker for 20 plus years putting a bug in
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:53.480]  his ear and he doesn't need me to tell him stuff now. In fact, most of the time, Joe tells me about
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:04:00.120]  stuff. I mean, we talk a lot. I'll leave it at that. I mean, 10 times a day. I mean, the point is,
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:07.480]  is that we've woken a lot of people up and that's all you ladies and gentlemen. That is the listeners
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:11.480]  of this broadcast that did this because you don't just think it's Joe Rogan we're talking to. We're
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:17.800]  talking, you know, the emperor of Japan is a listener. We're a Vladimir Putin and I'm not
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:22.680]  saying this to that powerful. Why do you think the left hates us so much? Because I get I'm Alex
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:27.560]  from Texas and we're just the show and everything. You understand we we're winning folks. God's real.
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:35.080]  Jesus is real. Praise God. There is a global awakening happening at the next level and a
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:39.320]  lot of people that even are part of the system, they don't want to be part of this evil. They don't
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:43.320]  want to be part of this takeover. They don't want to be part of the Satanism. They want freedom too.
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:47.960]  We just have to be there and be the example against the evil and then people will join us.
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:53.080]  But if we don't take the field, then evil wins. Remember what Thomas Everson said all the
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:05:00.200]  women in towers flourish. Good men do nothing. When it comes to regain. So when I first started
[2:05:00.200 --> 2:05:05.320]  taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds. I was overweight. I had brain fog like
[2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:10.200]  you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:14.680]  listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked
[2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:18.760]  pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that shield. You had with a deep bird
[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:24.440]  and I got really excited about that. So I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog
[2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:30.520]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened. I could think again. I could connect with people
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:35.560]  again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:39.960]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:45.000]  like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:49.160]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. That's a break free of the
[2:05:49.160 --> 2:05:53.800]  globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:05:57.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:11.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:16.040 --> 2:06:25.720]  Okay, I know when I see victory. I know when I see the truth. I know, not just intellectually,
[2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:33.880]  that you're sure that always lines up with it when it does. I know my soul. I know in my heart,
[2:06:34.520 --> 2:06:40.680]  in my gut, in my mind, like a burning desire for freedom. I know when we've got
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:49.560]  the sword of destiny, when we pull the sword from a stone, when destiny is confirmed.
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:56.040]  But to pull the sword is one thing. That's half the battle. Then you've got to wield the sword.
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:02.600]  And General Flynn has been through the fire and he's not compromised. And he is a patriot.
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:07.160]  You see CNN freaking out. Oh my God, he said we should have a one religion. No, he didn't say that
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:12.520]  like the UN says. He said, we need to be a nation under God. He said, I don't care what Christian
[2:07:12.520 --> 2:07:17.160]  faith, we're a Christian nation. He didn't say force people to do it. He said, we must recognize
[2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:21.160]  it and make ourselves a Christian nation through the people, through the collective.
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:26.600]  And that scared them so much because that's the answer. And I can tell you as sure as the sun came
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:33.000]  up, General Flynn is the real deal. Is he sinless? No, neither am I.
[2:07:36.040 --> 2:07:42.440]  And I'm not against Trump. Trump I know is a good person and means well and gets deceived. Flynn
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:48.520]  has his own issues. So do I. But if Trump doesn't run, Flynn is going to run. And we need to get
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:52.280]  behind him. And he says, I'm willing to die. I mean, he knows that's the type of person
[2:07:52.280 --> 2:07:58.440]  will try to assassinate. So the full interview is up on info wars.com and band up video, share
[2:07:58.440 --> 2:08:05.720]  the hell out of it. This is not a this is not a spectator sport. But whatever you do, get this
[2:08:05.720 --> 2:08:11.800]  out. Global exclusive General Flynn lays out plan to save America and the world. And that's what it is.
[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:15.560]  And it's a powerful interview. So here it is.
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:22.680]  Wow, General Flynn, thank you for taking time out while you're visiting Texas here at this giant
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:27.480]  crowd to hear you speak in San Antonio to talk to info wars. Last time we talked was on January
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:33.160]  5th at the Willard Hotel about that. Wow. A lot of things have happened and have happened. Yes,
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:37.800]  sir. Well, I know you've got a lot to brief the American people on the short time we have. But
[2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:43.240]  just from my perspective, the great reset and the UN, they've bragged that they're using COVID is
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:47.400]  the pretext to take the world over. And I see so many of our leaders don't talk about that,
[2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:52.280]  even the good ones like Senator Paul and Ted Cruz and others, I know you've been aware of that
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:57.240]  and aware of some of the war games they've had, how they would use COVID to take over. Can you
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:02.200]  speak from your military background just in general about the great reset and how important
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:08.040]  you think it is to get nationalist, Christian, conservative, populist leaders to understand,
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:14.120]  because I've seen you talk about this, that COVID is being used as a pretext for a UN takeover.
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:19.400]  Can you speak to that? Yeah, so I think that what people have to understand, when you look at these,
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:24.600]  the people that are running these organizations like the World Health Organization, World Trade
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:32.440]  Organization, the World Bank, and you dig down a couple of layers into the kinds of evidence
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:37.720]  that we have now discovered about COVID and the treatments for COVID. And you start to look at
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:43.480]  the reasons behind it, which is vis-a-vis the great reset. I think what people have to understand
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:48.920]  now is that this is no longer, and they're not even talking about it being a health crisis,
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:56.600]  this is about a control mechanism in order to take over, I mean, not only the United States,
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:02.520]  but the world. This weekend, and last weekend, they had, you know, as it led into the World
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:06.600]  Economic Forum, right? So this weekend is the World Economic Forum is going on right now.
[2:10:07.160 --> 2:10:11.080]  And I think, and I pay attention to these kinds of things and the types of agendas that they're
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:17.240]  following and the talking points that come out of them and the various topics that they talk about.
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:21.800]  And this is all about sort of a one-world order that they're moving toward.
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:27.400]  And this is not a conspiracy theory, Alex. This is a conspiracy. And what we have to understand
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:34.040]  is that the big take is the United States of America. So it's been going on for decades.
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:41.160]  This is not, in fact, actually, I applaud you for, it was one of your interviews 10 years ago,
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:45.160]  probably 10 years ago, may have been more than 10 years ago now, where you actually were talking
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:50.600]  about these issues and you covered it for quite a while actually at that time.
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:54.520]  And just everything we talk about here, the magnitude is off the chart. I mean,
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:59.960]  I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful. And I hope that you pay attention
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:08.120]  to what we cover here minute by minute. Because I've had chills since last night. This just confirms
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:16.040]  everything else we've already researched. But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:21.880]  controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:28.040]  the family, everything that's in the other documents. But this dovetails of all the other
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:32.520]  Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:36.840]  And the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we
[2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:42.680]  take our government's back from these eugenics madmen. I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:47.480]  Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:53.160]  horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to
[2:11:53.160 --> 2:11:57.240]  look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:05.320]  I'm a liar. I know why because it's scary. And if you admit this to yourself, you're not going to
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:09.800]  be able to go to the ball games anymore. You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk
[2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:13.800]  with your friends. You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:20.120]  time and not spend some of your energy on resisting this. And once you've faced this information,
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:24.840]  once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life. It should take over
[2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:37.160]  your life. What else, what else could it do? The only chance we've got of beating this scientific
[2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:43.560]  dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you,
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:58.440]  to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:06.680]  on what your destiny is going to be. When loser draw, you need to choose a side. You need to spend
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:15.880]  some time this afternoon, this evening, over the weekend to close the shutters, to sit there in
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:24.840]  your easy chair and to just sit back and think about the claims I've made here and decide on
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:29.800]  whether or not you're going to research the information we've laid out. Because this information
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:35.560]  is too important. I do not want you to simply sit here and listen to what I've said and then go out
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:40.760]  on message boards and say, Alex Jones says they want to reduce our population and that they are
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:47.640]  poisoning us and that they're incrementally increasing the amount of poisons and genetic
[2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:53.800]  manipulation that's going on. And I think that you got a lot of bashing by others in the media
[2:13:53.800 --> 2:13:58.120]  and by others around the world because it was like, ah, this guy Alex, I don't know what he's talking
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:14:04.040]  about. And lo and behold, here we are a decade later and they have implemented this strategy,
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:13.640]  this great reset strategy. So people can go read the great reset book. They can dig deep into all
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:19.640]  of the aspects of the things that are coming out of these different organizations that now,
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:25.800]  you know, bringing it from the sort of the great reset in the world view, bringing it into the
[2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:30.520]  view of the United States of America and what is happening with our administration right now. So
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:37.720]  they are taking the COVID crisis and I call it this COVID tyranny and they are using it to
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:43.880]  basically go after it is a total assault on our bill of rights top to bottom, not just our ability
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:49.080]  to be able to speak freely and have a conversation like this. And what I'm telling people now is
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:53.800]  go back and look at the bill of rights are very simple. It's a very simple document to read,
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:59.560]  read them. And I mean, read them. You know, when at the end of this show, break them out. Or if
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:04.120]  you're watching this show, break them out and start reading them because every single one of them
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:11.080]  is being threatened by this great reset, every single one. And, you know, I think of people that
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:16.040]  are following what I'm doing or what's happening in my life and everything that's happening in yours
[2:15:16.040 --> 2:15:25.320]  as well with all of this stuff with the January 6th, that call it the insurrection crucifixion,
[2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:29.720]  because that's what it is. And in a way, you know, from a biblical sense, Nancy Pelosi is like the
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:37.480]  punches pilot of this, of this operation that they are doing to basically steal away all of the,
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:42.360]  the other aspects of what's happening across this country, like you got to go.
[2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:47.480]  All right, stay right there. The full interview is now at bandotvideoinfowords.com. Share it.
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:51.800]  It's the truth. It's a battle plan for victory. Global exclusive, General Michael D. Flynn lays
[2:15:51.800 --> 2:15:57.640]  out plan to save America and the world. Get it and share it now. Hey, everybody. If you've
[2:15:57.640 --> 2:16:03.160]  info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:08.520]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:14.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:21.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experience
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:26.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:33.080]  trials. And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:38.840]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[2:16:38.840 --> 2:16:44.120]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:49.400]  activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:55.320]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:01.560]  pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air.
[2:17:01.560 --> 2:17:06.760]  We'll continue to bring you the band guests. We'll continue to bring the information that

[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:39.320]  do marketing campaigns. I think I think for kids, that'd be great. Calcium good for them, the vitamin
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:46.280]  D. So that's at info wars store.com. And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:51.480]  So the supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies,
[2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:56.680]  the emergency supplies at info wars store.com. Your support there keeps us on the air. We cannot
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:04.120]  thank you enough. I'm sitting here. It's in the early morning hours. And I'm looking at mainstream
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:11.080]  news reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:17.080]  the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:22.520]  they did on children, it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks. And then I
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:27.000]  noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:31.160]  It's not on the national news. And it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:37.000]  It's just crazy. And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:42.600]  vaccines. It doesn't hurt anybody. Your conspiracy theorists, if you say it, it's just crazy. And
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:46.200]  then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to
[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:51.640]  cause heart problems. They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened. That's why info wars is
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:56.440]  on air. Because if we weren't on air, they get away with even more of this crap. This is just insane.
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:19:03.320]  These people are killers. The engineers at bio pros are very excited to announce a major expansion
[2:19:03.320 --> 2:19:09.320]  of new products into the retail consumer market. Since their rollout of their first product almost
[2:19:09.320 --> 2:19:17.880]  a year ago, they come out with four new products. Biodrain Pro, Bio RV Pro, Bio Marine Pro and
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:25.240]  Bio Porta Pro. For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:32.280]  patented naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:38.600]  disasters. That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are. The bio pro system is
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:44.200]  light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once. These bacteria begin to breed
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:49.720]  and live in your septic tank. And now it's available for the general public's use for the
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:20:02.200]  first time on the retail market exclusively available at the bio pros.com. You're listening to the Alex
[2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:26.680]  Jones show. This isn't a movie. This is real.
[2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:44.680]  Oh
[2:20:51.480 --> 2:20:56.040]  rediscover your humanity standing in table today and touch God.
[2:20:57.080 --> 2:21:01.720]  God's waiting for you, but you got to stand up. I want to thank all of you for your support.
[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:06.440]  I want to ask you to donate to our legal fund to stay on air and give the enemy
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:13.080]  our full fight. Save info wars.com. I want to thank all of you that have donated supported us.
[2:21:13.080 --> 2:21:19.320]  Save info wars.com. Let's go back to the exclusive general Flynn interview. And then again, the full
[2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:24.120]  thing has just now been posted at band video and info wars.com. It's up to you that it reaches tens
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:28.760]  of millions and I know you'll take action. Here it is. You got the Durham report, right? Whatever
[2:21:28.760 --> 2:21:33.160]  comes out of that, the Durham investigation is ongoing. And there's been a lot of things dropped
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:37.080]  in the recent days, recent couple of weeks about indictments from that. So and we're
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:40.280]  learning a lot more about that. And that's another thing I want to ask you about.
[2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:46.040]  How vindicated, we'll get back to a great reset in a moment, but that's the great tyranny. That's
[2:21:46.040 --> 2:21:49.880]  the generals running it on the bad guy side. But how vindicated do you feel now that it's
[2:21:49.880 --> 2:21:54.920]  come out that Russiagate was indeed completely manufactured to stop you from giving Trump
[2:21:54.920 --> 2:22:01.880]  real advice? Get Flynn to get Trump. The lead FBI agent, the lead FBI agent, his name is Barnett,
[2:22:01.880 --> 2:22:09.240]  he did a 302, which is basically a testimonial under oath. In October of 2020, you can find it
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:14.600]  online. Barnett, he was the lead agent in Crossfire Hurricane. And he basically said,
[2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:19.560]  get Flynn to get Trump. That's what the whole thing was about. And it was a total setup.
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:26.360]  So yeah, I mean, vindicated, I always knew, you know, where I was at with this whole that
[2:22:26.360 --> 2:22:31.480]  mess. But these are things that are in the news today. COVID is another one, the whole idea
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:36.040]  about election security and all the all the fraud that keeps coming out. Let's speak to that because
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:41.400]  the Democrats were all over election integrity and security until 2020. Now you're not supposed to
[2:22:41.400 --> 2:22:45.720]  talk about it. They'll censor you even try to discuss that. But I thought the State Department
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:50.600]  and our own government goes around the world to grade other people's elections. But now they
[2:22:50.600 --> 2:22:56.200]  don't want our elections graded. Right at all. So there are there is a great documentary that was
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:23:03.800]  that the Democrats basically put together. And I mean, in the 2020 timeframe, to prepare for a
[2:23:03.800 --> 2:23:09.640]  potential loss to Trump. And so in every one of them, and this and it's all these various senators
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:16.840]  from from the Democratic side of the of the aisle, so to speak, that that talked about how the machines
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:21.960]  how mail in ballots, everything's fraudulent, it's all fraud with fraud. And it's an incredible
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:28.760]  it's incredible testimony to what we know to be to have been happening in our country. And it's
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:34.840]  been happening for over 100 years, election fraud or fraud action fraudulent activity and our
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:39.560]  elections have been happening since around the turn of the last century. So we're not we're
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:43.720]  kidding ourselves by saying, oh, there's no fraud. And all of a sudden, we have a presidential
[2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:51.560]  election. So what the to go back one step on the on the election in 2016, I believe, based on what
[2:23:51.560 --> 2:23:57.160]  we've learned in the last nine months, 10 months, that I believe that there was massive fraud
[2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:03.560]  conducted in the 2016 election, they just didn't have the mail in ballots. So they used the machines
[2:24:03.560 --> 2:24:09.720]  to to manipulate. But Donald Trump in that case ran, you know, they I mean, essentially ran the tables,
[2:24:09.720 --> 2:24:14.120]  he and he out did the algorithms, all you know, this word that everybody's learned the algorithms
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:18.440]  of these machines. And he beat the odds and he became president. And then for four years,
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:23.800]  they tried to take them out, they tried to cut him off at the knees every single day. And that
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:29.000]  story is still being told. And so what they decided, and I think that they decided this right
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:34.680]  after the 2016 election, they said, this is never going to happen again. We're never going to have
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:42.520]  another election that we're not going to control the outcome of. And so kick in COVID, right?
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:49.320]  Bring in COVID, bring in the COVID control mechanisms. And a very, very smart, they did it in a
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:55.240]  very masterful way. I give a lot of credit. It's like military strategy at its finest. And what
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:25:01.720]  they did was they they used the COVID control mechanisms to bring in the whole mail in ballot,
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:05.960]  right? There's so much fraud in mail and ballot. Everybody has always and now they're trying to
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:09.720]  bring it again for the midterms coming up. I mean, and I think that I think that
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:15.800]  two two big events that just occurred politically was the Virginia elections and the
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:22.120]  and the New Jersey governor, you know, gubernatorial elections. And I still as as I sit here today,
[2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:27.720]  I'm not I don't think that they have finished the counting. I mean, Yonkin won the hands down
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:31.960]  because again, he sort of beat the odds and and frankly, it wasn't necessarily because Yonkin's
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:36.520]  a great guy. He is wasn't because he ran a great campaign. He did. It was because they
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:42.440]  attacked the children of this country. And the moms in Virginia stepped up the moms and dads in
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:47.240]  Virginia stepped up, particularly in places like Loudoun County and Fairfax County. But I understand
[2:25:47.240 --> 2:25:52.200]  they haven't even completed the count. They basically shut the count down in Fairfax County.
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:56.520]  And so it's not even if it even if they counted, it's not going to change the outcome of Virginia.
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:00.760]  And so what Yonkin needs to do as soon as he gets into the into the job, he needs day one,
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:06.360]  he needs to go to Fairfax County and say, I want to do a complete thorough audit of at least that
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:12.120]  county because I guarantee there was fraud. Then you jump to to to New Jersey where where the
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:17.320]  individual who won the night of the election, he goes home that night high fives. He does a big
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:21.800]  victory speech. We won. He gets up the next morning. And I think it was 40,000. There was some
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:27.160]  number of votes. I think the number that sticks in my head was 40,000 from one or two counties.
[2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:31.640]  Bergen County is the one that I think that I remember reading about. And so he gets up the
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:38.520]  next morning. It's like, sorry, he didn't win. It's now back to Murphy. And so in New Jersey,
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:44.440]  for the people of New Jersey that are going to watch this, I know I saw the the the I think
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:48.840]  it's charelli. That think that's how he says his name. He came out with a great statement,
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:52.280]  a public statement video, and he said, here's what we're going to do. We're going to,
[2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:56.360]  we're going to play, we're going to let this thing play out. We're going to do another count
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.120]  of everything. So what he's going to have to do is he's going to have to fight tooth and nail
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:05.800]  because the the law fair is going to kick in. And that's what kicked in after the 2020 election.
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:10.440]  Oh, believe me, I mean, we've been, we've been part of this thing and organizations that I'm
[2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:16.600]  supporting or behind, we've been part of fighting back to try to make sure that that all we want
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:22.600]  to do, you know, if the outcome was that that that Joe Biden won fair and square, no problem.
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:26.920]  It's like a football game or a base. It's an athletic contest, but they don't want us to
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:31.400]  go back and look at the replay. And just to encapsulate that, we have Patrick Byrne going to
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:36.520]  come in here soon and talk with us and others about what's currently happening. But just basic
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:40.120]  strategies, looking at this, traveling the country, talking to all the experts doing your own
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:44.760]  research. You've been very articulate. I've seen you talk about it. But what are some basic things
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:48.760]  the American people can do and that Congress and the states and the legislatures and some of the
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:54.600]  good senators we have can do to get past the intimidation when we're told, don't investigate,
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:59.880]  don't call for election security, don't call for election integrity. What can we do to get people
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:05.880]  moving in the right direction to make sure they don't steal 20. Yeah, good question. And so first
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:15.800]  of all, courage is a decision. Okay. Courage is not something that is in your DNA. It might be.
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:23.080]  But at the end of the day, courage is a decision that you have to make. And people that you that
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:31.480]  wouldn't normally step up in a time of crisis are the least expected type of person. So I want
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:37.640]  people to really understand that, that do not. He really gets the key parts here of identifying
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:44.600]  the globalist. When we come back, this is so important. If we identify the globalist, they
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:50.280]  fail and they fall. If we never identify we're in a war, we lose. Everything is identifying
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:55.080]  that it's a globalist cult, a power cult, a behavioral psychologist. We admit that we beat
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:29:01.880]  them. If you're concerned about the power grid and the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:07.800]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:12.280]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator,
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:19.320]  and we are powerful. And the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:26.840]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:33.480]  not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:40.440]  and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:45.240]  in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:49.480]  that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God,
[2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:55.320]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world

[2:31:51.640 --> 2:32:02.680]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:08.520]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[2:32:08.520 --> 2:32:13.800]  before they went operational, but we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:19.880]  caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[2:32:19.880 --> 2:32:24.760]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:28.920]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[2:32:28.920 --> 2:32:33.000]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:36.760]  but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high
[2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:41.080]  quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices

[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:45.880]  Global exclusive. General Michael T. Flynn lays out a plan to save America and the world at
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:56.200]  van.video. The other sites, saveinfowars.com. Check it out and heed the call. You've never
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:33:59.640]  betrayed us before. You've always said, well, this, we know you'll do it again. Thank you so much.
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:06.920]  Saveinfowars.com. You know, this general Flynn interview is very important.
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:17.560]  Even though it's posted right now on the site, I've got so much news I want to hit in the
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:22.600]  time we have, but I'm going to hear it. And then Jason Burmes is in the fourth hour,
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:29.720]  old friend of mine, known him 17 years. He's loaded for bear, as they say, but look at this
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:36.440]  headline of Reuters. I mean, how obvious is this? Schumer recommends Gisling Maxwell's judge for
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:44.680]  second circuit seat. Well, jury selection is happening in the Gisling pedophile network suit.
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:55.480]  The judge, Rachel Maddow's mother, I guess, is now being basically taken out of that to go be a
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:01.800]  federal judge at a higher level. I mean, this is all just a big joke. And these people are jokes
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:05.800]  now. There are still some judges that are decent doing their job, but more and more,
[2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:11.960]  they're just political hacks. And just God helps. That's all I can say.
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:25.960]  And look at the power trip. Look at this, dude. All right, let's go ahead and don't worry. You
[2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:33.000]  keep acting arrogant. God's real. He backed in all powerful big, big boy pants over there.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:41.800]  Let's go back to General Flan. Here it is. And so first of all, courage is a decision,
[2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:49.160]  okay? Courage is not something that is in your DNA. It might be, but at the end of the day,
[2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:58.040]  courage is a decision that you have to make. And people that wouldn't normally step up in
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:04.840]  a time of crisis are the least expected type of person. So I want people to really understand
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:11.880]  that, that do not fear what's in front of them and think about how you're going to demonstrate
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:17.240]  courage because it's a decision and people across this country have to make that decision.
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:22.360]  So I use the phrase local action has a national impact. And there's great examples out there.
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:28.200]  There's examples in Iowa. There's examples. I just was given one from Ohio where people
[2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:33.560]  stepped in to the local level and they overturned their school boards. They overturned the town
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:38.120]  council or the mayors of their cities because these were, these were essentially socialists
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:42.600]  that were running these school boards. I mean, I totally agree with you. Klaus Schwab gave a
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:46.440]  three hour speech yesterday. I think you alluded to that time I had the Davos script meeting right
[2:36:46.440 --> 2:36:50.440]  now. And he kept saying, we've got to go local. We've got to take over there because they know
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:54.440]  that's what we're going to fight back. The other thing is that, you know, look at your local
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:59.960]  newspaper. Okay, look at the local newspaper and look at who owns it. You know, is it owned by,
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:05.080]  by Gannett? Is it owned by NBC? Is it owned by USA Today? And then you take it up a notch,
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:12.040]  a notch. And for decades, for a couple of decades, the, there's been a very, very big shift and
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:17.960]  an intentional move to purchase a lot of these local newspapers around the country. And you kind
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:23.080]  of go, why is there such a lousy article in this newspaper, you know, in whatever Gazette, right?
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:27.480]  And you kind of look at it and you go, what the heck? And it's because there is a concerted effort
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:33.720]  by this elite body of people that have lots of money and they have a desire to take this country
[2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:39.160]  over and shift, completely do an ideological shift in this country. So back to, back to local.
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:45.960]  Why has there been so much visibility about school boards and school board activity around this
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:49.160]  country? You kind of say to yourself, where did these people come from? Why did school boards
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:53.240]  get like this? Part of it is, is that we have taken for granted our freedoms and we have not
[2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:57.480]  gotten involved. We just sort of take it, you know, take it for granted that, oh, you know, Alex,
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:01.320]  this guy, Alex, he's on the school board and you go, well, where'd Alex come from? Well,
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:04.920]  who, and who is he? What is his background? And all of a sudden we're finding out that we have
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:10.680]  these, what I call democratic socialists that are on these school boards because the, the education
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:15.160]  system is the way to change the entire culture of a country. And they brag about that. And they
[2:38:15.160 --> 2:38:19.000]  brag about it. They write about it. They've been talking about it for decades. This is not something
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:24.520]  that happened because of Donald Trump. This has been going on for decades and people need to
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:28.360]  understand. I agree. I think Trump and people like you help draw out the communist, let's call
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:32.440]  them what they are, democratic socialists is a good term, but they're, they're really globalist
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:37.080]  communists and you and others have helped draw them out. What would you call that militarily,
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:42.120]  where we're at right now as a culture and then tie that back into January 6th and the attempt,
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:47.160]  the official U.S. government policies, you know, since June when Biden signed it is no longer is
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:53.400]  China or Russia or radical Islam, the main international or domestic threat. Now we're
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:57.880]  told it's people that question elections and people that question lockdowns. And now they've
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:02.120]  extended it. Just came out two days ago that it was the Justice Department went to the National
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:07.480]  Association of School Boards and said, we actually want you to write this letter calling for the
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:13.560]  feds to come in. So now we know there's a conscious move to declare people going to PTA meetings
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:17.240]  that are upset about critical race theory or their daughter getting raped by a man in a skirt
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:22.280]  literally being branded as terrorist. So from a guy that helped, you know, that ran military
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:27.320]  intelligence, a guy that was the top national security adviser understands how this works in
[2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:32.920]  layman's terms. How big a deal is it to have the entire corporate media system and the Democratic
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:38.040]  party trying to brand the American people in general as terrorists? What does that signify?
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:45.160]  Yeah, I mean, so it basically are creating two big camps. And the larger camp is what they're
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:52.200]  trying to identify those of us like myself, right? We are these domestic terrorists. We're these
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:57.240]  domestic, you know, we're going to whatever we're going to, you know, break out and start fighting
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:02.360]  or something really where we are. And this happened to started on the 3rd of November,
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:06.680]  you know, from a military perspective, the phrase that or the word that I would use is we're in
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:14.040]  kind of a retrograde operation. And in a retrograde operation, you are actually, you're moving
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:19.640]  backwards, you're going backwards a little bit, you still have your footing, but you're looking
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:24.600]  for weaknesses in their armor, because you want to conduct a counterattack or a counteroffensive
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:30.520]  in some cases, right? So we're in this battle between really competing ideologies. And this
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:35.720]  is no kidding. And the competing ideologies is whether we're going to continue on as a democracy
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:42.120]  and a constitutional republic, or whether we're going to go become a communist country. I mean,
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:50.360]  the other camp that you described, the, you know, the big media, the tech titans, the socialists in
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:54.840]  the political spectrum of really, you know, we really haven't said democratic and republican
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:59.800]  parties, right? Because it's really not that it's sort of a large base of conservatives in this
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:06.520]  country, who I would identify, and I would say they are on both sides of the, of the former aisle,
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:10.760]  right? They're both democrats and the republicans because people like mansion, people like me,
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:16.120]  okay? I'm a lifelong democrat, right? I'm registered as a republican now, because I just
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:21.960]  moved, but I'm a lifelong democrat, you know, so, but I'm pro life, I'm pro family, I'm pro
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:28.520]  America, I'm pro business. I mean, so, but I, I, as I watch what's happening, and I've been, and as,
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:33.480]  you know, to your question about my time in the military, I saw this, I certainly saw this
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:39.240]  from a foreign perspective, and I watched as I became more senior in our, in our government,
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:43.720]  in the apparatus, particularly of the intelligence community, I watched internally the kinds of
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:49.160]  things that were happening inside of our country, and they were happening because there are elements
[2:41:49.160 --> 2:41:54.200]  outside of the country that do try to continue to influence the communist ideologues, the Chinese
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:58.440]  communist party, the Russians, I mean, they are infiltrating into our country, they have been for a
[2:41:58.440 --> 2:42:03.320]  long time, and what they do is they get inside of our government, and they, they recruit, and they
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:08.680]  turn people, and they also bring a lot of wealth in, in some cases, and then you get the, the elite
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:13.640]  crowd from the, from like, out of the European Union. Again, for the, for your smart listeners,
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:20.040]  which you have many, pay attention to this Davos stuff, because this is not, this is not conspiracy
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:24.840]  theory. The fact that I say it, they're going to go, oh, Flynn's a right-wing nut. No, this is real
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:29.720]  stuff. Oh, they're now declaring war government. These are real people, and they want total control.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:35.320]  COVID and the tyranny that they are, that they have us under with COVID, because COVID is a real
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:41.080]  thing, it's a real type of sickness, but the, but what they're doing is all about control,
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:45.400]  and in order to control the population, they have to get total control and ought to be able to,
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:49.800]  to do the kinds of things that we're doing. So where are we from a military perspective now
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:54.760]  moving forward, taking that, taking that offensive? And I believe the only way that we're going to
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:43:00.280]  do it, because we're not going to, not. So when I first started taking survival skills, basically,
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:05.720]  I was 275 pounds, I was overweight. I had brain fog, like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding
[2:43:05.720 --> 2:43:10.280]  on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to it. So the first one I got was
[2:43:10.280 --> 2:43:15.000]  the original survival skills, the X1, and it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter,
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:18.440]  you came out with X2, you had, you know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:23.880]  excited about that. So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like, literally,
[2:43:23.880 --> 2:43:29.400]  like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:34.360]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously took
[2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:38.760]  basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:43.480]  recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:48.600]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:52.200]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:43:52.200 --> 2:43:55.480]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:43:57.160 --> 2:44:02.760]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:09.000]  available at InfoWarsStore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:14.520]  world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation
[2:44:14.520 --> 2:44:20.840]  and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god
[2:44:20.840 --> 2:44:26.760]  Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:32.120]  people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:37.720]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:44.120]  Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:51.160]  but not limited to German Kava Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balerian root. We do expect to sell this
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:57.080]  new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:44:57.080 --> 2:45:02.520]  Why do my enemies hate me so much? Why do the globalists take you so much? Why do they hate America
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:09.720]  so much? Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:15.160]  cannot coexist with. It's very, very simple. For their world government, their anti-human,
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:21.560]  post-human eugenics system to flourish, freedom and liberty and new process, injustice, and
[2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:27.960]  god-fearing systems must fail. So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates. You didn't start
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:34.440]  a fight with David Rockefeller. You didn't start a fight with the UN. They started a fight with you,
[2:45:35.160 --> 2:45:39.800]  and they're not going to back down, and they're not going to go away, and they're not going to
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:45.560]  ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them. The average person still
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:50.040]  doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism or about corporate fascism,
[2:45:50.040 --> 2:45:54.840]  and it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:46:02.360]  of beating these people. Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.

[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:23.080]  So I ask viewers and listeners here on The Only Shown Show, have we not proven ourselves
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:28.200]  to be true Americans and to be fighting tyranny? I mean, we don't fall down. I mean, we're perfect
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:35.400]  or from it. But I'm 100% real, folks. Everybody knows it. 100% real. You're 100% real.
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:41.800]  So I thank you for buying products at infowarslife.com and I thank you for going to saveinfowars.com
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:48.680]  to make a donation, whether it's $5 or $1,000, so that we've got legal funds we need to continue
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:54.360]  to battle on as our plan is with these rigged systems to try to shut us down. And so time
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:59.640]  is of the essence to continue to fight and press our case and expose what's happening.
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:06.680]  So it's so critical to go to saveinfowars.com so that you will see the type of groundbreaking
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:12.120]  information that is only presented here to a mass audience. And believe me, my whole mission
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:17.960]  is to become obsolete. My whole mission is to not have the power and to not be under attack,
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:23.320]  but I got to get them off our back first. Okay, and that's why God just keeps giving us all the
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:29.560]  power. We're not looking for it, but we need money in Satan's realm to operate. And so I'm asking you
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:35.720]  render under Caesar, that which is Caesar, render into saveinfowars.com the money we need
[2:48:35.720 --> 2:48:39.160]  to continue on the fight. They want to force us into bankruptcy where they can shut everything
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:43.720]  down. We're not going to let them do that. We can continue on for years if we have the legal
[2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:48.600]  funding, but I do not want to cut our production or our crew. I want to expand it. I want to take
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:52.520]  the money from what we're doing and let these people win. That's their whole plan. So energize
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:57.800]  me. I am true. You will see it. Years from now, you're going to remember this. I mean, I'm going
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:01.720]  to go all the way, folks. I know where this road leads. I'm not stupid. And I'm not looking for
[2:49:01.720 --> 2:49:06.920]  trouble either. I don't look, but my flesh is weak, but my spirit is strong. And my spirit says,
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:16.200]  you will attack these people with everything you've got. And so I need your financial support
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:20.440]  infowarsstore.com. Got the big mega sale going right now. Storewide free shipping has been

[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:31.000]  turbo force back in stock. What else is back in stock? I actually forget what's back in stock.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:37.880]  Something huge is back in stock. Oh, super coral whitening toothpaste. Yes, that's there. And so
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:41.800]  much more. But right now, let's go back. There's like 20 minutes left. I won't get to it all here
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:46.440]  before Jason Burmer takes over. But the full interview is so important. Out of the sea of BS
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:50.920]  out there, it's such truth. It's such a life raft for America and the world. Please share it.
[2:49:50.920 --> 2:49:57.160]  The General Flynn interview, here's more of it. But what they're doing is all about control. And
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:01.320]  in order to control the population, they have to get total control and ought to be able to
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:05.880]  do the kinds of things that we're doing. So where are we from a military perspective now moving
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:10.680]  forward, taking that, taking that offensive? And I believe the only way that we're going to do it,
[2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:15.960]  because we're not going to, not everybody is a Washington DC superstar. Not everybody, I like
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:20.440]  to say is not, not everybody is a Joan of Arc. So what we've got to do is we've got to find these,
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:24.520]  these little flowers around the country. We've got to find these brave people. We've got to find
[2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:29.160]  these people that are willing to, to make that decision about standing up and being courageous
[2:50:29.160 --> 2:50:33.560]  in their local communities. And if people don't get involved in their communities and they give
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:38.040]  up their communities, then you're going to give up this country. And so, you know, you can't,
[2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:44.280]  not everybody can jump into Washington DC. And I'm tired of, of, of, with, with a lot of people.
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:48.520]  You know, the audience, I mean, anybody that says, well, it's those, it's, you know, it's those
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:52.680]  bastards. They're, they're the problem, those people in Washington DC, the politicians, we put
[2:50:52.680 --> 2:50:56.680]  them there. We put them there just like we put people on the school board, on these school boards.
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:01.720]  General Flynn, let me just 100% agree with you that this is not about Democrat or Republican.
[2:51:01.720 --> 2:51:05.640]  This is about Americans that are loyal to the country and want to continue to live in a free
[2:51:05.640 --> 2:51:12.840]  market capitalist nation with our bill of rights, or whether we want to live under globalism that
[2:51:12.840 --> 2:51:17.320]  runs Hollywood and is demonizing the country and trying to divide us to conquer us. And you're
[2:51:17.320 --> 2:51:22.680]  right. It is the Davos group that's bragging Klaus Schwab's own Wikipedia that he, that that has
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:29.080]  links to his own website says he wants to capture countries and cut out the general public from
[2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:34.680]  leadership and only have international corporate and UN stakeholders in control. These are quotes.
[2:51:34.680 --> 2:51:39.480]  Imagine if you published that you wanted to capture the government, you'd be called a want
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:43.560]  to be dictator. Well, they're not just want to be through the great reset through me the Roger
[2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:48.040]  Stone treatment is what David, if I said that they did, I'd have 50 guys with helicopters and
[2:51:48.040 --> 2:51:53.160]  boats, you know, showing up to my hotel room that I'm standing. I mean, the, the, the, well,
[2:51:53.160 --> 2:51:56.600]  exactly. They lie and say that you're saying that you never said anything near that. And meanwhile
[2:51:56.600 --> 2:52:01.320]  Schwab is saying that you're right. I'm saying as a military leader, how do we identify the
[2:52:01.320 --> 2:52:06.120]  globalist? How do we get Congress and people that are good patriots to realize who the enemy is?
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:09.960]  Because in the past, okay, it was the Cold War. Okay. In the past, it was the Nazis. We get it.
[2:52:09.960 --> 2:52:14.520]  We get together. We defeat them. This is multinational corporations bragging that they
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:18.600]  captured America. And I can't get these senators and people to talk about it. I've talked to them
[2:52:18.600 --> 2:52:23.080]  probably go, well, public's not ready for that. We'll be discredited. Well, we're in a war,
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:27.640]  not identifying who's attacking. So like you said earlier, you'll be attacked for identifying that
[2:52:27.640 --> 2:52:31.480]  Schwab says he's capturing the planet. So the American people right now, and I can tell you,
[2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:39.400]  I feel like I have a good sort of fingertip sense of the American sentiment. And the Republican
[2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:46.040]  party, they'd better stand up here quickly because they are missing the point, the Republican
[2:52:46.040 --> 2:52:52.520]  leadership. And there's, and there's very, very, very few of them that actually stand up and say
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:57.080]  something. And you kind of wonder with everything that's going on, why don't, as you're saying,
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:53:02.200]  you know, I mean, I think that these guys like Ted Cruz, we're here in Texas, somebody else,
[2:53:02.200 --> 2:53:06.360]  like a like a Rand Paul, I mean, there's a couple of others, those are senators. And then you have
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:12.040]  a couple of congressmen that still are vocal about certain things. But you, you, I don't hear any of
[2:53:12.040 --> 2:53:17.560]  them, none of them talking about this conversation right here. It's almost as look as they look at
[2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:23.960]  this and they say, this is politics as usual, we're going to get it back in 2022. So I don't know
[2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:27.320]  where I need to look for your audience to look at your audience. But I'm going to tell you,
[2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:32.280]  if you think that Nancy Pelosi is going to give up the leadership to Kevin McCarthy in 2022 after
[2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:39.400]  they stole the presidential election. So that's why, that's why we have to be so active, so active
[2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:45.400]  at our local level. And I mean, get it like I met a woman, I just stood a long line to get
[2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:50.840]  some photos taken with these great Americans. And a woman comes up to me and says, I be, I just
[2:53:50.840 --> 2:53:57.080]  became a precinct volunteer. And I gave her a big hug. I mean, that's the kind of activism. And I
[2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:00.440]  think the numbers, the numbers that I've been given from, from that I've seen from the Republican
[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:05.720]  party and, and you know, you know, get, I mean, tell me I'm wrong. But I think we have somewhere
[2:54:05.720 --> 2:54:13.080]  is in near 200,000 positions that are unfilled. There's somewhere as close to 32,000 precinct
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:17.320]  positions that are unfilled by the Republican party. The Democrats are masters at this.
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:21.720]  They call them volunteers, they're paid. They give and they call them thousands of races where
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:26.200]  Democrats run unopposed. We use the phrase precinct captains, precinct captains, the Democrats
[2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:30.920]  have precinct bosses, and they get in there and they run, they run these precincts. So
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:37.080]  politically, people have to get active. When someone, when somebody says to me or somebody
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:43.400]  says to you in around the Thanksgiving table here coming up, if you could afford the turkeys that
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:49.480]  that are, that might, that might be on the shelves. And they say, well, I don't do that political
[2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:55.320]  thing outside politics is for whatever. Then you know what, then you better not complain because
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:55:01.000]  our entire lives right now, everybody, every American, their lives are wrapped around politics
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:05.160]  right now. If you don't think that something's changing, you don't feel the way I feel right
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:09.720]  now, you don't feel the way these 5,000 people out here feel, then something's wrong. Okay,
[2:55:09.720 --> 2:55:13.560]  you're not paying it, you're not paying close enough attention. You're absolutely right. I think
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:17.960]  you say it better than anybody out there that it's about Americans and our sovereignty and
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:23.560]  controlling our destiny versus multinational corporations take who've taken over the Democratic
[2:55:23.560 --> 2:55:27.640]  Party and the Republican Party is not even challenging them at that level. If we just wake
[2:55:27.640 --> 2:55:32.920]  up America to what's really happening, this globalist takeover, then we can save the country and
[2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:38.280]  turn it around. You know, I tell you what, you know, that's I say like, what's the matter with
[2:55:38.280 --> 2:55:44.120]  saying America first? That's not something from Trump. Trump made America. His thing is make
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:49.480]  America very powerful. There's 11 minutes left. The full interview, global exclusive general
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:55.160]  Michael T. Flynn lays out the plan to save America and the world. It's up to you to carry
[2:55:55.160 --> 2:56:00.200]  the ball now. And I know you will, but just share the video to your whole email list, your whole
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:05.400]  Twitter list, your whole Facebook list, just get it out and say, wow, see what General Flynn said
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:12.600]  about what's happening. You talk about insane. I don't like to go off half cocked. When I was
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:16.680]  younger, you know, I'd go with my gut. I believed I was telling the truth, but sometimes I'd go
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:21.000]  off half cocked and we all do that. We're young and I'd be wrong, but I never did it on purpose.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:27.160]  But as you get older, it almost becomes the opposite problem where you know you're right,
[2:56:27.160 --> 2:56:31.400]  but you hold back because you always want to triple check everything and then triple check and
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:36.120]  triple check and triple check and triple check and then you don't take action. Let God the Holy
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:41.240]  Spirit guide you folks. That's how you know you're taking action. And we come back before Jason
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:47.080]  Burma takes over. I'm going to hit this. Judge Schroeder slams at media's handling of written
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:52.120]  house trial, calls it really quite frightening. Well, of course, tyranny like this is frightening,
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:58.600]  but why is that important? Then there's this judge and the whole Giselaan Maxwell case and Jeffrey
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:06.680]  Epstein and what just happened and what that ties into this little story. Her boot resting on my
[2:57:06.680 --> 2:57:13.240]  brother's thigh. Boris Johnson's sister says he knew Giselaan Maxwell University. Of course,
[2:57:13.240 --> 2:57:18.600]  he did a bunch of sex operatives, a bunch of intelligence operatives all trained
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:25.480]  for the same goal and it's coming out. That's why all these world leaders are pushing lockdowns
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:30.760]  in tyranny and world government and new lockdowns all over the world from Ireland to Germany to
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:40.280]  Australia and Austria to the United Kingdom. Our number four with myself and Jason Burma's

[2:58:49.600 --> 2:58:54.640]  in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new
[2:58:54.640 --> 2:58:59.480]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting
[2:58:59.480 --> 2:59:05.300]  clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function. In the
[2:59:05.300 --> 2:59:10.160]  1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[2:59:10.160 --> 2:59:14.920]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began
[2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:19.480]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:24.240]  of this research a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[2:59:24.240 --> 2:59:28.880]  distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an
[2:59:28.880 --> 2:59:33.040]  antihistamine. In fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[2:59:33.040 --> 2:59:37.480]  blocking the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[2:59:37.480 --> 2:59:41.760]  inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:44.760]  meant to take us out of that fight but we want to fight the child molesters we
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:48.600]  want to stay in the fight but it takes money for the infrastructure the
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:53.080]  satellite uplinks the servers the crew all of this is incredibly expensive
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:56.080]  especially when we're banned off the internet but still reaching more people
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:04:01.960]  than ever the system is in full panic mode they don't know what to do they

[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:54.120]  wars.com all right Jason Burmese takes over the no destroyer
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:58.920]  by now you've heard me talk about the the average person on the face of this
[3:04:58.920 --> 3:05:03.120]  incredible planet is still unaware there's a war between free individuals
[3:05:03.120 --> 3:05:07.800]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:12.400]  literally trying to create a post-human world. From the United States to Brazil
[3:05:12.400 --> 3:05:16.360]  and of course triggered by the bricks at the UK nations were pulling out of the
[3:05:16.360 --> 3:05:20.200]  private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their
[3:05:20.200 --> 3:05:26.240]  great recess and their program after collapsing us of build back better. This
[3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:31.400]  is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:35.280]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:40.120]  left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win they
[3:05:40.120 --> 3:05:45.520]  released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about
[3:05:45.520 --> 3:05:49.760]  about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't be because of our free speech
[3:05:49.760 --> 3:05:54.120]  and our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know
[3:05:54.120 --> 3:05:58.640]  the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win
[3:06:02.640 --> 3:06:08.440]  well look who is back in the saddle hey everybody Jason Bermas here and we've
[3:06:08.440 --> 3:06:15.320]  got a stacked stacked hour for you I'm gonna circle back to what Alex Jones
[3:06:15.320 --> 3:06:20.840]  talked about in the first hour and the two things that I think he focused on
[3:06:20.840 --> 3:06:28.760]  I really want to share with people that may not be aware are 9-11 and then
[3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:36.400]  predictive programming behind this entire globalist agenda predator class
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:44.920]  agenda that wants to make humanity the very enemy enemy of civilization and
[3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:50.080]  what they have planned in the fourth industrial revolution but before we get
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:56.320]  there I want to say this save info wars.com is huge that's something that
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:07:00.120]  needs to be done I want to give a shout out to Alex Jones and say one of the
[3:07:00.120 --> 3:07:06.880]  things we're gonna be talking about later on is Earth 2100 and this was a
[3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:11.440]  propaganda piece that was put out by the mainstream media that Alex and I
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:16.920]  actually discussed all the way back I believe it in 2009 and I think that it
[3:07:16.920 --> 3:07:21.760]  was during the second money bomb we're gonna get into that in a moment but what
[3:07:21.760 --> 3:07:28.480]  we focused on in this piece was the outright showing of geoengineering when
[3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:35.640]  of course quote-unquote chemtrails were a large topic of discussion but now
[3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:41.400]  looking back at this piece and everything in this piece you can see the
[3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:46.840]  predictive programming right from the get-go the masks on people the plagues
[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:52.680]  the internment camps even the tell a learning of youth that we will later be
[3:07:52.680 --> 3:07:57.680]  discussing so we're actually gonna play clips from that we're gonna play a lot
[3:07:57.680 --> 3:08:03.520]  of clips on this that are hardcore that I want you to share with people and I
[3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:11.000]  hope that Alex considers at least doing a couple 24-hour money bomb broadcast to
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:15.840]  bring that two million dollars into fruition because honestly folks this
[3:08:15.840 --> 3:08:22.480]  is not cheap to do and you are literally battling billionaires out there and
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:28.320]  their interests the Washington Post for instance who I was in contact with over
[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:33.720]  the last few weeks just ran another hit piece another narrative pushing piece
[3:08:33.720 --> 3:08:42.120]  where loose change and those that question 9-11 started the viral disinformation
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:46.280]  age you see it wasn't the Washington Post and the New York Times and the
[3:08:46.280 --> 3:08:51.360]  mainstream media outlets that not only lied to you about 9-11 but lied to you
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:55.720]  about the war on terror in general and we're gonna get into that because it's
[3:08:55.720 --> 3:09:04.000]  actually the one-year anniversary today of the foe killing of the supposed mastermind
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:11.800]  and leader of Al Qaeda I'm in Al Zawahi right took him 20 years to say they
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:16.960]  killed him this was put out literally November 17th of last year but guess what
[3:09:16.960 --> 3:09:23.720]  guys oh I'm in decided just a little over a month ago to put out a video on
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:30.640]  9-11 you see how we won that war on terror a man that was in videos with the
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:37.120]  supposed mastermind bin Laden pre 9-11 mission accomplished and then they
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:42.000]  they kind of make it a back-of-the-line story that they got him and then you
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:49.520]  don't hear anything about the fact the guy's putting out videos videos on the
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:54.240]  anniversary and that's why I hope that especially the information we're gonna
[3:09:54.240 --> 3:09:59.960]  get to it in the beginning okay about Joe Biden when he wasn't the poopy pants
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:05.960]  president when he wasn't zombie J when he was in fact Joey B gangster
[3:10:05.960 --> 3:10:11.920]  extraordinaire even before he was vice president he actually met and bragged
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:19.240]  about meeting with one of the money men behind 9-11 now this guy is a guy named
[3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:26.200]  general Mammoud Ahmed and talk about info wars being at the tip of the spear
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:33.120]  folks the very tivity tip the clip we're gonna play right now behind me is from a
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:38.200]  film that Alex Jones produced called fabled enemies and some of the footage
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:42.840]  was actually shot by another gentleman of we are change.org that Alex was
[3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:47.120]  sitting in with at the Tim pool extravaganza last night if you haven't
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:52.880]  seen that I would encourage you to do so where Luke Radowski on tape twice talks
[3:10:52.880 --> 3:10:59.200]  to Joe Biden about him meeting with the money man behind 9-11 who we won't play
[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:04.040]  this clip but Joe Biden acknowledged was either the most powerful person in
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:09.840]  Pakistan at the time he led the ISI their intelligence services or the second
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:15.200]  most powerful person in the entire country okay now Luke confronts him on
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:19.920]  this because the the official narrative doesn't have Pakistani intelligence
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:27.400]  funding funding these people prior so let's let's hit the clip and you decide
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:31.640]  for yourself and remember this is info wars.com produced all the way back in
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:48.640]  2008 prior to Joe Biden even becoming the vice president.
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:17.880]  Oh I'm sorry I apologize guys I thought that we had this hook through I guess
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:21.360]  the that's really weird because it was coming through on my end I'm sorry guys
[3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:25.040]  we have no audio I apologize especially for the radio audience that's gonna put
[3:12:25.040 --> 3:12:29.040]  a damper on this but what you're looking at is Joe Biden hopefully we're gonna be
[3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:34.760]  able to fix that you have Joe Biden literally about to discuss how Pakistan
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:41.280]  better you know pretend stop pretending to be our friends I'm wondering if I do
[3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:46.480]  this guys let me know in the control room if this starts playing it let me see
[3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:55.760]  if this works. Still no audio well that is unfortunate maybe we'll be able to
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:01.400]  fix that during the next break very very unfortunate but again before this
[3:13:01.400 --> 3:13:07.080]  he's advocating that he's meeting with a guy who wires a hundred thousand dollars
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:13.240]  to Muhammad Ata prior to the attacks now the crazy thing is that a surrogate
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:20.080]  okay a surrogate of this person who is Omar Said Sheikh okay and he was
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:25.400]  actually convicted of the murder of Daniel Pearl that initial video where
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:31.520]  somebody was beheaded and we all became so afraid of the terrorists who know the
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:36.600]  big bad terrorists are going to get us think about that for a second that this
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:42.200]  is total and complete insanity all right total incomplete insanity he's now in a
[3:13:42.200 --> 3:13:48.480]  safe house okay someone who facilitated money to Muhammad Ata prior to 9-11 and
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:54.560]  was convicted of the murder of a journalist who was looking into 9-11
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:14:01.680]  and started the viral video sensation of beheadings and terrorizing the people
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:08.840]  this absolutely nuts absolutely nuts but again we act like this isn't happening
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:12.200]  and it is happening it is happening I want to repeat that it is happening and
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:18.160]  this whole war on terror was really aimed at the American people from the
[3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:24.040]  get-go once we put the Patriot Act into place once you had homeland security in
[3:14:24.040 --> 3:14:28.440]  place correct I mean right now it's open that Homeland Security in the
[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:33.360]  Department of Justice are going after parents who want to be involved in their
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:41.600]  children's school lives and through all this intelligence apparatus we got
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:46.840]  signature reduction folks that still no one is talking about an army against the
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:52.480]  people of 60,000 that are completely unaccountable that are in household name
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:15:00.640]  companies that are both virtual as in only online presences right and in real
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:05.040]  life there's never been a hearing there is no one that has talked about this on
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:12.080]  any mainstream channel whatsoever and when you look at other articles about it
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:16.400]  they're basically sourcing this why don't we get the source documents what
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:23.880]  why is it that certain media organizations get a monopoly on basically
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:28.480]  what the government will give us through an FOIA right and then that
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:34.040]  information is then filtered to the people and that's the best we have and
[3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:39.480]  most of that time it's filtered through the lens that the predator class wants
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:42.800]  you to see the world we will be back on the flip side I'm going to try to fix
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:48.760]  this audio issue save info wars calm is where you got to go right now to
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:55.280]  basically help Alex Jones keep telling the truth the people what if you could
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:15:59.760]  cut your heat the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:04.400]  to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:08.480]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:12.840]  afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[3:16:12.840 --> 3:16:17.540]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an
[3:16:17.540 --> 3:16:22.560]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:26.120]  have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:31.080]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:34.760]  continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people
[3:16:34.760 --> 3:16:39.200]  awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:44.240]  will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare
[3:16:44.240 --> 3:16:49.200]  get up to a years worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear
[3:16:49.200 --> 3:16:55.280]  seeds shortwave radios and life-saving knowledge at info or store dot com
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:17:00.760]  cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful
[3:17:00.760 --> 3:17:05.760]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:10.360]  from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[3:17:10.360 --> 3:17:15.520]  from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:20.720]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:25.040]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in
[3:17:25.040 --> 3:17:30.400]  inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system recent studies have
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:36.520]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[3:17:36.520 --> 3:17:41.640]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:47.520]  family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:52.480]  pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or
[3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:57.880]  yourself at info wars store dot com it was almost 15 years ago that I've
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:02.120]  released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement then
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:05.400]  that documentary I predicted the globalist would establish world
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:09.760]  government a releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide
[3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:14.440]  lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now
[3:18:14.440 --> 3:18:18.760]  they've done it how did I know they would do it because they wrote books and
[3:18:18.760 --> 3:18:23.120]  white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:26.360]  you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group whose head at the time
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:30.800]  was Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were
[3:18:30.800 --> 3:18:35.240]  indeed planning to launch this great reset well we're now living in it the
[3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:39.160]  purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world don't attach to
[3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:43.520]  tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship no due process
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:47.560]  destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:52.360]  injections of poison mass-creating as vaccines to poisonous and depopulated
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:56.840]  this is what info wars is fighting we're fighting for the future by now you've
[3:18:56.840 --> 3:19:00.280]  heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing products
[3:19:00.280 --> 3:19:04.680]  they've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:08.800]  remediation products bringing industrial level technology to the everyday
[3:19:08.800 --> 3:19:12.760]  consumer they're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:17.920]  delivery system the bio pros are excited to release bio porta pro a product
[3:19:17.920 --> 3:19:22.640]  specifically designed to establish healthy waste tanks and pits bio porta pro

[3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:49.400]  that simple say goodbye to septic problems gas build-up and odor guarantee
[3:19:49.400 --> 3:19:54.640]  visit the bio pros dot com and see for yourself
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:02.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:02.840 --> 3:20:15.800]  and we are back I am Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones and we're still
[3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:19.000]  working on trying to be able to bring you guys these clips that I do have
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:24.120]  lined up before we get there I do want to revisit some of these plans that I
[3:20:24.120 --> 3:20:28.680]  have been discussing that are out there and I've seen that now Alex is openly
[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:35.760]  talking about NASA and DARPA partnering in what is a very very real and ongoing
[3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:40.800]  transhumanist agenda this document by a man named Dennis Bushnell who hopefully
[3:20:40.800 --> 3:20:45.040]  will be able to play him in his own words is a future strategic warfare
[3:20:45.040 --> 3:20:51.000]  document circa 2025 that he was going around the country and presenting in
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:58.720]  2001 pre 9 11 this is in July and when you talk about technology economic
[3:20:58.720 --> 3:21:04.160]  trends and the future of humankind it literally tells you that the bio
[3:21:04.160 --> 3:21:10.440]  nano era again the bio nano era biological nano technology on a global
[3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:15.480]  scale I want people to understand this because it cannot be emphasized enough
[3:21:15.480 --> 3:21:22.680]  would take place in 2020 so let's type that in right there and as you see you
[3:21:22.680 --> 3:21:29.880]  see it bio nano here and the triple exponential of this revolution okay and
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:36.000]  there it is so somehow these people knew we were going to have biological
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:40.120]  nanotechnology on a large scale well they've injected into a large portion of
[3:21:40.120 --> 3:21:49.560]  humanity with these shots and when we talk about mRNA messenger RNA and the
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:55.560]  vector-based technology that these shots are according to Peter Doshi and many
[3:21:55.560 --> 3:22:00.000]  others like myself Peter Doshi a little smarter than Jason Bermas happens to be
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:04.080]  one of the editors over at the British Medical Journal you know the BMJ no big
[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:09.760]  deal he said you know if we call these things drugs which essentially they
[3:22:09.760 --> 3:22:16.160]  were called all the way up till 2019 until we changed the definition would we
[3:22:16.160 --> 3:22:24.880]  as easily be able to make the public acquiesce to taking mandatory drugs and
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:32.920]  Moderna actually partners with DARPA DARPA DARPA the Defense okay advanced
[3:22:32.920 --> 3:22:40.720]  research projects agency born out of post World War two and the security state
[3:22:40.720 --> 3:22:46.200]  surrounding it I want to make that extremely clear DARPA being part of the
[3:22:46.200 --> 3:22:52.440]  Defense Department is allowed to lie to the public all the time that's what they
[3:22:52.440 --> 3:22:56.280]  do remember the Defense Department is exempt from telling the truth to the
[3:22:56.280 --> 3:23:02.400]  people extremely dangerous okay so they partner with Moderna all the way back in
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:08.400]  2013 and I was actually and this was gonna be one of the clips I play hopefully
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:15.800]  we'll be able to do this I was at a library presentation by a Dr. Katz who
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:21.880]  gave this presentation on these quote-unquote vaccines okay the shots and
[3:23:21.880 --> 3:23:26.040]  he acknowledged that these shots and this is a talking point that they're
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:30.960]  trying to play out as a positive actually have a 30-year history I've been
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:37.440]  telling people this mRNA technology has been around since the 80s however DARPA
[3:23:37.440 --> 3:23:44.840]  partners with Moderna to develop mRNA therapeutics notice you're gonna see in
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:48.520]  these headlines back in the day they never call them vaccines it was drugs
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:53.800]  and therapeutics because they are not by the traditional stance vaccines at all
[3:23:53.800 --> 3:24:00.880]  at all so for $25 million then DARPA partners with these people including
[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:07.520]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation AstraZeneca Merck Vertex etc this is
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:12.800]  the strategic collaborators, collaborators advancing mRNA research to
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:19.480]  treat rare diseases and cancer and notice that the Biden administration has
[3:24:19.480 --> 3:24:24.760]  talked about a DARPA like initiative to end cancer oh really that's how much
[3:24:24.760 --> 3:24:30.320]  they care about us now we're getting a DARPA like initiative to cure cancer
[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:36.800]  well when you look at this again this partnership was for let's hopefully
[3:24:36.800 --> 3:24:42.560]  refresh that hopefully it's still there was for fighting pandemics with are you
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:47.240]  kidding me there we go Moderna snacks 25 million dollar DARPA grant to fight
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:52.560]  pandemics with mRNA drugs all the way back into 2013 and here we are again
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:59.360]  defense department driven drugs of bio nanotechnology that has now been
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:05.800]  injected in people on a global scale it's right there it's right in front of
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:12.640]  us and I know that Alex Jones has been talking about these things going into
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:19.520]  food okay and he's absolutely right they are now announcing it and when you talk
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:27.880]  about this in this document let's go through it biomass food it's a big deal
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:33.400]  and they talk about putting nanotechnology directly into your food
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:40.760]  okay choo choo a flesh plant eating robot that hunts bio digest natural food
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:46.560]  to live off the land and way back in the day and they had to change the headline
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:50.640]  they were talking this is when I was in it at info wars initially they were
[3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:55.760]  talking about robots on the battlefield that would literally eat the biomass in
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:00.600]  other words the opposing soldiers the human beings on the on the thing to what
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:08.880]  to what to work okay so think about that a flesh plant eating robot that hunts
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:12.800]  bio digest and this this was put on paper a decade before Alex and I even
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:20.720]  covered it before we even covered it binary agents distributed via imported
[3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:28.200]  products vitamins clothing food oh but you know what binary means right zeros
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:40.880]  and ones okay do you get that I mean it's right here in your face okay and by
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:44.720]  the way when they talk about sustainability and sustainment hopefully
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:48.720]  we're gonna show you the clips these are code words for people okay he says the
[3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:53.120]  code word is sustainability Dennis Bushnell and what it actually means is
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:27:00.280]  the decline in westernized standards of living lovely again a decade so there it
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:04.280]  is right here and there's so much on this page that is worth discussing but
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:08.960]  they tell you it's inexpensive to put buy and not binary zeros and ones
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:16.280]  biological agents into our food supplies a GMO wasn't enough Monsayton wasn't
[3:27:16.280 --> 3:27:22.680]  enough Bill Gates becoming the world's largest farmer wasn't enough no no no
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:27.200]  and they tell you these are inexpensive things information internet and
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:35.480]  psychological warfare so on one end and this is often done with these people they
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:39.320]  speak out of both ends of their mouth right that's what the code words are for
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:43.400]  that's what the talking points are for that's what the PR is for right for
[3:27:43.400 --> 3:27:48.840]  instance when I'm at this forum last night and hopefully we're going to show
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:54.880]  you just one small clip of an hour plus but when you talked about fully
[3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:59.560]  vaccinated they never volunteer the information that fully vaccinated means
[3:27:59.560 --> 3:28:04.720]  14 days either after your second shot of the double jabs or your single shot and
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:09.840]  even that is suspect and if you get one shot and then sick or two shots and then
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:14.520]  you're hospitalized in 13 days it's not counted but he'll acknowledge it when I
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:18.200]  talked to him and then he'll make up the excuses just because the antibody levels
[3:28:18.200 --> 3:28:24.680]  aren't there yet really is that why it's not because I was actually warned by the
[3:28:24.680 --> 3:28:29.720]  mainstream media and people like Sandra Fryhofer that these shots would be no
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:34.760]  walk in the park and that the side effects were almost exactly like COVID in
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:40.960]  the first place and that Moderna had 80% side effects no matter how minor you
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:46.160]  want to make any of them in the trials that were acknowledged and this guy put
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:50.480]  up some Johnny nonsense numbers of less than 25% we'll see on the flip side
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:54.880]  hopefully with some clips I'm Jason Burmese in for Alex Jones you know
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:29:00.400]  listeners it's time to protect your privacy it's time to come to grips with
[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:04.720]  the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide criminals hackers
[3:29:04.720 --> 3:29:09.560]  corporations big tech government are stealing all of your data and creating a
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:14.040]  map and a database of where you go and what you do so in the future under their
[3:29:14.040 --> 3:29:19.560]  globalist takeover they can shut you down protecting your privacy protecting

[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:18.440]  they've done it how did I know they would do it because they wrote books and
[3:30:18.440 --> 3:30:23.120]  white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked
[3:30:23.120 --> 3:30:26.320]  you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group whose head at the time
[3:30:26.320 --> 3:30:30.760]  was Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were

[3:30:35.200 --> 3:30:39.120]  purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world on its ass is a

[3:32:03.240 --> 3:32:07.160]  dollar I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement it's
[3:32:07.160 --> 3:32:10.680]  basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gas lighting
[3:32:10.680 --> 3:32:14.560]  moralization and absurdity it's like we're living in a twilight zone and
[3:32:14.560 --> 3:32:18.160]  all right Eric's in New Hampshire Eric thanks for calling go ahead hey Alex
[3:32:18.160 --> 3:32:21.240]  thanks for taking my call if I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for
[3:32:21.240 --> 3:32:25.360]  one of the product the X2 does wonders they recommend it to everybody you're
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:28.960]  on the fence about it get off the fence get the product support the info war
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:32.800]  Tyler in Maine you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead hey Alex it's
[3:32:32.800 --> 3:32:37.280]  great to be on with you it's an honor honor talk to you awesome so first thing
[3:32:37.280 --> 3:32:42.400]  I wanted to do was say I love the products alpha power even at 29 if you
[3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:47.040]  ask my better half she loves it and it helps in the bedroom so just number one
[3:32:47.040 --> 3:33:12.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show we are back I am Jason Burma sitting in
[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:16.760]  for Alex Jones I want to remind everybody right here right now go to
[3:33:16.760 --> 3:33:23.960]  save info wars dot com and give what you can because we need more voices that
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:30.160]  question these mainstream media lies these predator class narratives that are
[3:33:30.160 --> 3:33:35.800]  leading us all down a very very dangerous transhumanist path right now I
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:41.600]  of course am kicked off a YouTube for apparently cyberbullying either Epstein
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:48.680]  perhaps glane Maxwell I'm not really sure it was an ask me anything from almost
[3:33:48.680 --> 3:33:55.200]  two years ago and of course all this stuff is selectively enforced and you're
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.280]  seeing it more and more and more and it began with info wars dot com and Alex
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:05.320]  Jones so love him or hate him agree with what he says disagree with what he says
[3:34:05.320 --> 3:34:13.000]  you should agree with the right for him to say it for anybody to express their
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:20.840]  thoughts that is what we are based on in this country and really truth is what
[3:34:20.840 --> 3:34:28.280]  humanity arrives on it enhances love around us lies don't make friends folks
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:35.300]  I can promise you that so unfortunately it does not look like we're gonna get
[3:34:35.300 --> 3:34:40.520]  to many of these clips other than to visually show you some things that I
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:48.800]  think are worth discussing and when I discussed earth 2100 okay at the beginning
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:54.120]  of my segment and how Alex and I actually talked about this on one of those
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:58.520]  money bombs Alex it's time to do a couple money bombs 24-hour broadcast let's do
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:03.280]  it brother let's make that two million we were discussing this because it was
[3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:12.640]  this scenario in which we had somebody born in 2009 and we're taking the world
[3:35:12.640 --> 3:35:17.480]  a hundred years into the future and of course people are causing all these
[3:35:17.480 --> 3:35:24.000]  problems because of climate change and global warming well in the first
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  literally 10 seconds of this and we're gonna play in the background without
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:35.640]  audio New York City is under quarantine people are wearing blue masks okay and
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:40.880]  of course climate change at the end of the day is the culprit of the whole thing
[3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:46.560]  okay so let's watch this as we go and for those there this is a cartoon based
[3:35:46.560 --> 3:35:51.280]  with New York City under quarantine right the Midwest infested and they're
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:55.880]  getting us ready for that plagues there's the blue masks it happened and I
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:36:01.120]  survived it we have to change our ways in a race against time and you know it's
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:06.400]  featured in this thing Anthony Fauci Eric Schmidt of Google Van Jones who
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.720]  took a hundred million dollars recently from Bezos I'm just gonna pause it right
[3:36:11.720 --> 3:36:18.640]  there a hundred million dollars from Bezos James Wolsey of the CIA these are
[3:36:18.640 --> 3:36:22.280]  the talking heads and I'm gonna try to fast forward so we can get to some of
[3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:26.200]  these people but you see all look the viruses and they always talk about natural
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:30.800]  viruses they never talk about their bio warfare programs there's Van Jones right
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:34.400]  here and the thing is this is all predictive programming but it's not for
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:38.520]  a hundred years from now it's actually extremely accelerated probably more like
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:43.840]  on a 20 year pace because they want you to be on some kind of a social credit
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:47.960]  store score because otherwise we won't be able to save the planet oh we need to
[3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:54.240]  acquiesce to all this all right oh gas shortages and they do these fake little
[3:36:54.240 --> 3:37:00.200]  news segments along with it so it's a cartoon telling you about gas shortages
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:07.120]  geoengineering hmm how your standard of living gets worse and worse and you live
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:11.680]  in smaller and smaller areas throughout all this and it's all because we're bad
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:17.560]  as humans this is the main point of this fourth industrial revolution to make it
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:22.800]  so uncomfortable for you through automation through a UBI nation through
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:28.640]  you no longer having a sense that you're even a human being you're so drugged up
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:34.080]  from every shot they mandate you're so brainwashed from every broadcast they
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:39.120]  put out from every social media superstar that you will acquiesce to the
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:43.320]  virtual era there's our friend John Podesta by the way John Podesta big player
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:50.040]  in this one he's lovely everybody loves John a skippy a skipper Reno I mean this
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:54.320]  was one of the biggest pieces of propaganda I actually did a watch along
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:59.720]  with it saying I mean we're not even halfway through this thing how this was
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:06.000]  preparing us again to believe for some reason human beings are evil all right
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:11.960]  and what I wanted to do is I wanted to play this clip of one of their very own
[3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:18.720]  transhumanists here in fact the transhumanist Ray Kurzweil discussing
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:26.480]  how overpopulation is a complete myth and yet it is what Ted Turner says we got
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:32.280]  too many people doing too many things that's why we have climate change all
[3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:40.960]  right and in this discussion he discusses how 95% of the usable land is not
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:45.120]  used by humans and he's discussing it in the sense I believe that he's talking
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:50.680]  to one of the heads of the IMF the International Monetary Funds and he
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:56.400]  basically explains that through the 2020s and into the 2030s renewables and
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:39:01.320]  virtual technology again we don't know when we hit the virtual age but the
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:04.440]  virtual age they want for humanity and the virtual age that would empower
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:08.200]  humanity are two totally different things they're totally different things
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:14.320]  okay when Kurzweil talks about it he talks about it I think rather naively
[3:39:14.320 --> 3:39:18.920]  that this five cents virtual reality that we're all eventually going to
[3:39:18.920 --> 3:39:25.080]  experience if we survive right if we survive all these catastrophes will
[3:39:25.080 --> 3:39:29.360]  allow us to interact with one another as if we're in the same room with one
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:33.520]  another and Dennis Bushnell of NASA in the clip I wanted to play from there
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:38.320]  actually says that the Brits at the time of 2010 have already achieved this
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:43.360]  whether that's true or not I don't know but I have VR headsets and I can tell
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:48.600]  you how far the technology has come on a commercial based level I can also tell
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:54.160]  you that it's really not that much farther than what was around via like
[3:39:54.160 --> 3:39:58.760]  theme parks in the 90s right I remember being at Bush Gardens and you got into
[3:39:58.760 --> 3:40:02.320]  this little headset and I was like whoa yeah the polygons are better but the
[3:40:02.320 --> 3:40:07.900]  idea is still almost the same and that's because DARPA and other black
[3:40:07.900 --> 3:40:13.480]  programs developed this technology over five to ten years sometimes takes a
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:18.720]  bit maybe 15 years to actually produce it and then they inventory it for 30 to
[3:40:18.720 --> 3:40:25.320]  40 years openly openly so Kurzweil again one of the main proponents of
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:31.840]  transhumanism wants us to merge with machines tells you overpopulation is a
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:37.440]  myth you on Musk who I am no fan of who is basically in my opinion a front for
[3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:42.440]  the military industrial complex people need to understand that mr. Musk what
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:47.880]  is he really doing well he's got big old Pentagon contracts delivering cargo
[3:40:47.880 --> 3:40:54.640]  around the world in one hour with his rockets okay why do you think that they
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:41:00.520]  just went past Lockheed Martin one of the biggest defense contractors of all
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:06.560]  time in valuation because we're now hitting the next level where things
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:11.160]  like project Artemis that are going to the moon well are they sending people
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:15.360]  in the moon more than likely not more than likely they're going to send our
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:20.400]  nice little robot friends we have the Valkyrie robot that we covered on my
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:24.760]  program earlier in the week of course the Atlas robot that if you've been
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:32.120]  watching this program on info wars.com or band video or free world TV you've
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:38.080]  seen them running around and that's just publicly what we have there okay so
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:42.160]  even Bushnell admits when we get to something like Mars well we'll send the
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:48.080]  robots to Mars they're gonna take all the data then we'll virtually take that
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:52.840]  data and you as a human being you're not really going to Mars remember they're
[3:41:52.840 --> 3:41:56.320]  hyping it up with people like William Shatner and Branson going to quote-unquote
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:03.920]  space when they're 50 or 60,000 feet up and even the inspiration for rocket was
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:10.000]  only in low Earth orbit all things that have been achieved in the 60s in the
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:17.160]  60s and beyond publicly what we know about you know and by the way space
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:26.080]  exploration and NASA NASA is only 20% invested in that you know that the other
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:33.600]  80% has to do with things like climate change and sustainability look into NOAA
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:38.400]  and so many other aspects of this folks we're gonna be back on the other side
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:43.200]  talking about transhumanism talking about DARPA talking about NASA talking
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:47.240]  about the future of humanity if we don't step up to the plate right now and
[3:42:47.240 --> 3:42:54.600]  fight back go check out saveinfowars.com to be a very big part of that it's time
[3:42:54.600 --> 3:43:00.360]  to show them what a real the CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people
[3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:04.840]  talking bad about the vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:12.600]  FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are they know that
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:17.040]  all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments and
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:21.640]  Madonna's in trouble as well they know that the people are starting to get wise
[3:43:21.640 --> 3:43:26.240]  this depopulation agenda in fact evidence is starting to mount that the
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:30.400]  shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons but they're so deadly they're
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:36.360]  killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking up the weapons
[3:43:36.360 --> 3:43:41.520]  work a little too good they're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars but
[3:43:41.520 --> 3:43:45.920]  instead they're making too big of a noise but it's too late for a return back
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:50.480]  now they're coming after our children so it's up to us to protect our little
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:56.840]  children or God will not look favorably on us remember God is watching
[3:43:56.840 --> 3:44:16.400]  commander here with an important message to humanity and so I need all of you
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:25.880]  to stay indoors for the next 15 days I also need you to wear masks and they
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:33.080]  also need you to only shop at mega corporations that way we can consolidate
[3:44:33.080 --> 3:44:40.000]  control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies the only I own
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:47.680]  profitable you will then be my slaves oh and then you get that special shot of
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:52.680]  freedom from copra will remove your immune system so you'll be depended on
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:59.120]  me for the rest of your miserable lives there is very little contemporary
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:05.280]  study in the world of the planet's ruling class not in communist China not in
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:11.640]  Mexico not in the United States not anywhere is there a real study of the
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:15.840]  planet's ruling class that's done by design the large central banks that
[3:45:15.840 --> 3:45:20.800]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:24.320]  look into say the Anglo-American establishment the sound of the
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:27.400]  Bilderberg group the trilateral commission the United Nations the whole
[3:45:27.400 --> 3:45:33.280]  project of the Rothschilds until 10 years ago the media said the control
[3:45:33.280 --> 3:45:37.000]  corporate media the Bilderberg group didn't exist well now the Bilderberg
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:42.680]  group is public its former head so the string committee is called Schwab and he
[3:45:42.680 --> 3:45:47.120]  has set up the great reset in global government and if as a liberty movement
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:50.800]  worldwide we don't address the globalist head-on about the fact that you're a
[3:45:50.800 --> 3:45:54.720]  worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we don't have a shot you expose
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:45:58.480]  them we should beat them easily by now you've heard me talk about the bio pros
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:02.160]  and how they're creating amazing products they've done it again and have
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:07.160]  just released an entire suite of bio remediation products bringing industrial
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:10.640]  level technology to the everyday consumer they're literally changing the
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:14.920]  industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system the bio pros are
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:20.320]  excited to release bio marine pro a product specifically designed to
[3:46:20.320 --> 3:46:25.720]  create healthy black and or gray water holding tanks bio marine pro digest

[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:55.160]  guarantee visit the bio pros dot com and see for yourself
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:02.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:47:02.880 --> 3:47:17.600]  and we are back I am in for Alex Jones I want to thank everybody for joining me
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:25.200]  on this broadcast where we are exploring the documentation of this fourth
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:30.880]  industrial revolution that we see happening now in real time from over
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:38.680]  two decades ago and going back into this document I cannot emphasize enough on
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:45.440]  the same page where they talk about binary biologics via imported vitamins
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:52.080]  clothing etc and the food supply as in all of the food supplies as in
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:48:01.840]  globally that they actually put underneath terror bio e.g. alpha toxin
[3:48:01.840 --> 3:48:07.360]  aflatoxin I'm sorry so in other words they talk about biologics being used as
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:13.560]  a force of terrorism biological warfare is a real thing it was discussed by the
[3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:18.160]  project for a new American century in their rebuilding defenses document you
[3:48:18.160 --> 3:48:22.440]  know the same one that called for that new Pearl Harbor we saw right where they
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:30.240]  said we could use race specific bio weapons and meanwhile we have to pretend
[3:48:30.240 --> 3:48:35.200]  as a society you know as the mainstream media tells us that biological
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:41.320]  warfare doesn't exist despite in this country just before the COVID-19 84
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:46.640]  nightmare kicked off we have actual officials in our government asking about
[3:48:46.640 --> 3:48:53.000]  Plum Island okay asking about Lyme's disease and whether or not the Pentagon
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:59.720]  had purposely let me repeat this purposely distributed that amongst the
[3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:04.520]  people wow big question to ask can't believe you did it but it is a question
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:08.880]  that needs to be asked because it is a very large reality that these things
[3:49:08.880 --> 3:49:12.880]  have happened and when we talk about DARPA for instance we have to also
[3:49:12.880 --> 3:49:18.880]  acknowledge that they have used nanotechnology to biologically change
[3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:23.560]  insects and we have been warned that they could strike with biological warfare
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:29.400]  through the genetically modified insects that they release now I know it's great
[3:49:29.400 --> 3:49:34.960]  that Bill Gates wants to save us all and he wants to fight malaria by letting
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:40.040]  GMO mosquitoes go in this country and it's already been deployed in Florida and
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:48.920]  Texas once you allow this to happen you open the door for massive massive
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:57.000]  biological warfare programs against the people that they will try to mask as not
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:04.240]  biological warfare but natural as they did with this COVID-19 84 nightmare
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:10.280]  despite the fact you had prominent papers out there saying hey this thing was
[3:50:10.280 --> 3:50:15.720]  clearly made in the lab and it looks like certain aspects of HIV have been
[3:50:15.720 --> 3:50:21.640]  inserted into them you know it's just Luke Monnier a man who won the Nobel
[3:50:21.640 --> 3:50:28.800]  Prize for HIV in 2008 that also pointed this out yet last night when I'm
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:32.120]  talking to this guy I wanted to play this clip oh so bad you can watch the
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:37.640]  whole thing over at my rock bin account that's R-O-K-F-I-N dot com make a free
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:41.960]  account go follow me over there that's where the vast majority of my material
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:46.920]  is as I've been banned on mainstream platforms but you look at this guy and
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:51.160]  he's still saying it's natural he's still saying it's natural he says that the
[3:50:51.160 --> 3:50:56.080]  flu actually disappeared because of COVID mitigation efforts that was what I
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:03.120]  was going to ask him and that the just didn't work against COVID and he
[3:51:03.120 --> 3:51:08.200]  acknowledged that Scientific American and the World Health Organization said
[3:51:08.200 --> 3:51:14.200]  for the first time in human history that the flu disappeared do you believe
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:20.080]  that let's just take into shotty McShots that are considered quote-unquote
[3:51:20.080 --> 3:51:28.240]  vaccines for the flu now if you look to 2019 influenza and the numbers there
[3:51:28.240 --> 3:51:35.200]  influenza A the vaccine they said their own numbers was about 50% effective
[3:51:35.200 --> 3:51:40.440]  okay from keeping you from getting the flu all right and then influenza B which
[3:51:40.440 --> 3:51:46.760]  also happened to be H1N1 that year all right remember old H1N1 it was only
[3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:53.200]  about 33% effective against that so overall ratio you had less than a 50%
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:58.080]  effectiveness from the flu vaccine itself and that's by their own numbers
[3:51:58.080 --> 3:52:02.200]  whether they're cooked or not that's what they're putting out there now you're
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:06.600]  telling me we could have mitigated the flu all together for the first time
[3:52:06.600 --> 3:52:11.680]  without them way way way more effective and one of the things that he
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:16.320]  discussed was apparently the official numbers of children last year that died
[3:52:16.320 --> 3:52:23.120]  from COVID was below 90 I think it was 80 something and the cases of children
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:30.960]  was something like 8300 now I pointed out and you can go watch it that in 2017
[3:52:30.960 --> 3:52:39.240]  2018 we had 172 children in this country died from the flu now that's what I
[3:52:39.240 --> 3:52:45.040]  brought up that the flu disappeared now if the flu disappears and kids less than
[3:52:45.040 --> 3:52:52.560]  half of that number died this year as opposed to 2017 18 it would suggest to
[3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:57.240]  me that there would absolutely be no reason to give them any type of shot
[3:52:57.240 --> 3:53:01.640]  even though he advocated for it but not making it mandatory heard that song and
[3:53:01.640 --> 3:53:05.800]  dance before heard that but he's like well you know certain situations we
[3:53:05.800 --> 3:53:09.480]  might get there and of course he advocated that mandatory mandatory shots
[3:53:09.480 --> 3:53:16.200]  are a okay and they are lawful and they are historical no they're unconstitutional
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:20.360]  and they're completely insane and you may have made that case for a quote-unquote
[3:53:20.360 --> 3:53:25.000]  smallpox vaccine back in the day but again as Peter Doshi and others have
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:29.960]  pointed out these are mRNA and vector-based shots
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:37.880]  therapeutics drugs they in no manner no manner resemble what traditional
[3:53:37.880 --> 3:53:45.640]  vaccinations that's because they wanted to rush in their bio nano era and you
[3:53:45.640 --> 3:53:49.000]  look at that future strategic warfare document they are right on point when I
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:53.600]  say they I'm talking about the bureaucrats in power like Dennis Bushnell
[3:53:53.600 --> 3:53:59.480]  that curate this stuff okay I'm talking about the people at Google like Eric
[3:53:59.480 --> 3:54:07.840]  Schmidt that were basically funded by Incutel the CIA wing and now and now in
[3:54:07.840 --> 3:54:11.480]  league with the government openly and when I say the government you know those
[3:54:11.480 --> 3:54:16.200]  good people at NASA only 20% space exploration exploration folks
[3:54:16.200 --> 3:54:20.760]  working on quantum supremacy which they say they achieved over two years ago
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:25.200]  now not a lot of headlines there not a private company in my opinion okay over
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:31.760]  two years ago achieving quantum supremacy in artificial intelligence that
[3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:34.920]  is not a company all right and you say well it's kind of like that's just a
[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:39.760]  military contract no they have the largest search engine in the world okay
[3:54:39.760 --> 3:54:46.360]  Google they have the largest operating system in the world Android slash Chrome
[3:54:46.360 --> 3:54:51.400]  right you see the Android on Chromebooks on all these phones it's everywhere they
[3:54:51.400 --> 3:54:55.320]  have the largest video platform in the world that is actively censoring
[3:54:55.320 --> 3:55:01.760]  information based on what the World Health Organization and this you know
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:05.680]  vehicle of destruction the United Nations says because the United Nations is
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:11.320]  just a vehicle for the predator class it's not the end goal it's the face of
[3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:16.320]  global governance it's what's allowed these things to happen people used to
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:19.560]  call it a paper tiger oh it's not a government organization Jason it'll
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:25.120]  never change our lives really it literally institutes what they say is
[3:55:25.120 --> 3:55:31.120]  factually correct and at the same time are being caught again and again oh
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:39.680]  that's the wrong one in sex scandals with children with children 2018 to 2020
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:44.520]  just happened the EU pulled funding because of it won't hear a whisper
[3:55:44.520 --> 3:55:52.200]  about a corrupt global organization involved in the rape of children being
[3:55:52.200 --> 3:55:59.360]  the authoritative source on what you can and cannot say on the internet hmm it's
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:05.720]  all here so guys let's wrap up this last couple minutes by saying that freedom
[3:56:05.720 --> 3:56:08.400]  of speech is important it's important that I was able to come on this
[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:13.760]  broadcast and talk about 9-eleven in a true sense that it is an international
[3:56:13.760 --> 3:56:18.520]  intelligence operation with role-players here within our continuity of
[3:56:18.520 --> 3:56:25.120]  government program and beyond with Pakistan with Saudi Arabia with Israel
