[00:00.000 --> 00:16.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is January 17th, 2020 on this live Friday global broadcast.
[00:16.400 --> 00:23.720]  But to be technically accurate, we're going to be live coming up in the next segment.
[00:23.720 --> 00:30.840]  I am taping this right now, right before the show goes live, so that I can make some comments,
[00:30.840 --> 00:31.840]  break down some news.
[00:31.840 --> 00:40.920]  And Paul Joseph Watson is going to be hosting, and we have some other special guests as well
[00:40.920 --> 00:48.320]  joining us in studio in an interview that I taped last night with popular Libertarian
[00:48.320 --> 00:56.080]  conservative comedian Tim Dillon and his cohort, the modern Ed McMahon.
[00:56.080 --> 00:57.080]  That's in the fourth hour.
[00:57.080 --> 00:58.400]  I taped that last night.
[00:58.400 --> 01:07.480]  Great interview, frequent co-host Joe Rogan, a lot of fun inside baseball on that.
[01:07.480 --> 01:13.800]  I really do not have words to describe the quickening that's happening, all the political
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.680]  lines that are converging, how evil and corruption is now right out in the open, and just how
[01:19.680 --> 01:25.600]  crazy things are in Virginia and what's unfolding there and attempts now to block what the governor
[01:25.600 --> 01:31.160]  is doing, moving forward with gun confiscation, and if we go to break Paul Watson takes over.
[01:31.160 --> 01:39.040]  But I have taped several segments at the start of the second hour that get into what's unfolding
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.080]  with the trial starting next Tuesday in the Senate.
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.600]  And then, of course, the dirty tricks they're going to try to pull there on the federal
[01:48.600 --> 01:54.880]  holiday Monday in Charlottesville trying to paint gun owners as KKK.
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.880]  When it was the KKK, they got the first loss passed against guns because they didn't want
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.840]  newly freed black slaves who weren't slaves anymore to not be able to have guns.
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.520]  It's just amazing how these dixie-crats, and I'm not against the South, but I'm against
[02:09.520 --> 02:15.920]  the permanent leftist that run it for a long time and who play racial politics.
[02:15.920 --> 02:21.280]  I mean, I'm just sick of it, absolutely sick of their race-baiting crap, and then we've
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.600]  got to respond back when they do it and it all becomes racial and we're being manipulated
[02:26.600 --> 02:34.080]  like two Chinese fighting fish, remember the old James Bond movie, Dr. No?
[02:34.080 --> 02:36.480]  Oh, look, this is a smart fish, it waits while the others.
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.240]  One kills the other, then it's weak, the third comes in and takes them out.
[02:40.240 --> 02:42.760]  That is how Spectre operates.
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.080]  And so, yeah, we can hate each other and kill each other all day over what color we are,
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.720]  and then they're manipulating as the supposed savior saying, oh, we're going to take your
[02:52.720 --> 02:58.080]  rights and liberties away to stop the racism and the cultural divide that they're stoking.
[02:58.080 --> 03:00.360]  It's disgusting.
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.800]  So we don't need white guilt and we don't need white genocide and we don't need to be
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.480]  told white people are bad and it is okay to be white, it's great to be white, it's great
[03:08.480 --> 03:13.320]  to be black, it's great to be brown, it's great to be human.
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.600]  I don't go down here almost every week and eat at the local soul food place because black
[03:18.600 --> 03:19.600]  people own it.
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.760]  I eat the food because I like it and that's what this gets back to, it's what you stand
[03:23.760 --> 03:26.280]  for, what you produce, that's how you measure things.
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.560]  I said it a thousand times, I listen to Jimi Hendrix, not because he's black, incredible
[03:30.560 --> 03:37.680]  guitarist, an incredible voice, an incredible songwriter.
[03:37.680 --> 03:38.680]  That's the same thing.
[03:38.680 --> 03:41.120]  It's great to be black, it's great to be white, it's great to be everything.
[03:41.120 --> 03:43.760]  They're planning something big in Virginia, everybody knows it, I'm going to be on the
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.760]  ground there.
[03:44.760 --> 03:46.200]  Let me do this, I never do this in the first segment.
[03:46.200 --> 03:50.880]  This is going to cost us a lot of money to go to Virginia and we're going to be in DC
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.240]  and we're going to be at everything.
[03:52.240 --> 03:59.120]  You see our people everywhere, Owen is busting his ass, he is the model of resistance, doing
[03:59.120 --> 04:02.960]  more than I ever did at his age, at the pace he's doing, it's amazing.
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.480]  I hope you can pull the overshadows soon when I've done.
[04:06.480 --> 04:11.400]  The whole team is on fire, it takes a lot of money to put people in the field and do
[04:11.400 --> 04:12.400]  this.
[04:12.400 --> 04:15.880]  We're trying to hire a personal camera person just for Owen right now so we're not rotating
[04:15.880 --> 04:19.760]  camera people so he doesn't just have to hire a local to do it when he does it.
[04:19.760 --> 04:21.920]  Who did a great job?
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.120]  We need financial support, infowarsho.com, fish oil just came back in, it's the ultimate
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.600]  fish oil, super high quality, amazing for your body, it's pretty good to sit on.
[04:32.600 --> 04:38.160]  We have so much more for sale as well but this is how we finance our operation, infowarsho.com,
[04:38.160 --> 04:44.120]  knockout, the amazing sleep aid is on sale, we also have mycozx on sale, next level probiotic
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.880]  and so much more and of course we've got the highest quality sawpaw meadow for your prostate,
[04:49.880 --> 04:54.520]  I would prostaguard, it's now back and that's discounted as well, infowarsho.com.
[04:54.520 --> 04:58.680]  Paul Joseph Watson from London, England coming up and I'll be back, stay with us.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.960]  Hey, you there, we have a problem.
[05:02.960 --> 05:10.120]  You see, there is a baby, the mother of this baby is not sure she's ready, the father of
[05:10.120 --> 05:13.720]  this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[05:13.720 --> 05:22.000]  The mother starts to have regrets, the father considers leaving town but a friend says there's
[05:22.000 --> 05:30.000]  a solution, she says to have an abortion, the mother decides to look into it, the clinic
[05:30.000 --> 05:37.480]  assures her it's safe, she's made her decision, she's going to have an abortion, the problem
[05:37.480 --> 05:43.480]  is that baby is you.
[05:43.480 --> 05:50.960]  Join me, Owen Schreuer at the March for Life, Friday January 24th in Washington DC, noon
[05:50.960 --> 05:55.960]  at the National Mall, I'll see you there, it's time to stand up for the unborn, it's
[05:55.960 --> 06:03.320]  time to speak out for the voiceless.
[06:03.320 --> 06:10.680]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit Dot News.
[06:10.680 --> 06:18.480]  And we are live on this Friday, January 17th edition, you heard there Alex Jones who will
[06:18.480 --> 06:24.240]  of course be coming up in the second hour, returning to you talking about events in Virginia
[06:24.240 --> 06:30.480]  of course this big pro gun rights rally happening on Monday, they had up to 60,000 people I
[06:30.480 --> 06:35.280]  believe sign in or at least agree that they were going to go on Facebook, obviously it
[06:35.280 --> 06:39.440]  never turns out that way, you'll probably get one tenth of that, but even if you get
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.680]  one tenth of that who show up, it's going to be thousands and thousands of people.
[06:43.680 --> 06:49.000]  You also have Swat Armour gear now rolling into place in Virginia, judging from the recent
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.800]  photos that I've just seen on Twitter, so we'll get into that.
[06:52.800 --> 06:57.440]  Also get into of course, Antifa groups have now announced that they will be descending
[06:57.440 --> 07:02.800]  on Virginia on Monday, so basically you're going to have thousands of pro gun protesters
[07:02.800 --> 07:09.160]  who have been told by the governor that they can't carry any arms in this relatively enclosed
[07:09.160 --> 07:15.400]  pen with potentially Swat teams, armed Swat teams surrounding them if these recent pictures
[07:15.400 --> 07:23.720]  are anything to go by and belligerent leftist snarling Antifa thugs who it's funny because
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.440]  they've actually said they're pro gun rights in this instance because they say that disarming
[07:28.440 --> 07:32.760]  people is racist, so they're actually going to Antifa groups are actually going to be
[07:32.760 --> 07:38.400]  joining the pro gun rights march in support of that, but they've also said, oh, by the
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.200]  way, we don't support any of these white supremacists who are going to be there as well.
[07:44.200 --> 07:50.160]  So you've got a cocktail for absolute disaster, hopefully everyone remains safe, but just
[07:50.160 --> 07:56.000]  from some of the ingredients that are going to be in enclosed in that pending area, people
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.560]  are very, very concerned.
[07:57.560 --> 08:02.080]  So I'll get into that in the next segment, but first with Alex covering obviously most
[08:02.080 --> 08:06.800]  of the state side news, I'm going to look at what's happening in Europe and particularly
[08:06.800 --> 08:13.760]  what's happening here in the United Kingdom, because I became jaded to this, we have one
[08:13.760 --> 08:19.680]  of these cases almost every few months at this point, and I saw this story a couple
[08:19.680 --> 08:24.520]  of days ago, just brushed over it, read the headline didn't even read the story, but
[08:24.520 --> 08:29.440]  that's how they get you, they get you jaded by bombarding you with the same stuff over
[08:29.440 --> 08:30.440]  and over again.
[08:30.440 --> 08:34.400]  But we need to be continually outraged about this as a headline.
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.600]  Upon summit dot news, British police fail to stop Muslim grooming gang due to fears
[08:39.600 --> 08:42.640]  over community tensions.
[08:42.640 --> 08:48.000]  Yet again, we have another case, you know, the left always says, well, who could possibly
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.240]  have a problem with political correctness, only bigots and racists, because political
[08:53.240 --> 08:56.680]  correctness is just being nice to people.
[08:56.680 --> 09:02.160]  It's just being nice to people really, but why in every single instance that we see one
[09:02.160 --> 09:08.320]  of these mass rape grooming gang scandals is the issue of political correctness at
[09:08.320 --> 09:15.640]  the fulcrum of why these rapists and pedophiles were not stopped from abusing women and in
[09:15.640 --> 09:21.200]  some cases, children, in fact, in all cases, children in this case, because again, concerns
[09:21.200 --> 09:26.520]  over being portrayed as racist or politically incorrect to the point to the extent where
[09:26.520 --> 09:32.880]  they actually cover up these cases and ignore the pleas of the victims, British police fail
[09:32.880 --> 09:37.560]  to stop Muslim grooming gang due to fears over community tensions.
[09:37.560 --> 09:43.640]  This is another case that has only just come to light, which happened 15 years ago.
[09:43.640 --> 09:48.520]  And it's only just come to light, British police in Manchester failed to stop dozens
[09:48.520 --> 09:55.040]  of girls being sexually abused by a network of Pakistani men, despite knowing it was happening
[09:55.040 --> 10:01.560]  due to fears over creating community tensions that was actually in the report.
[10:01.560 --> 10:08.640]  And again, you remember the reason why Tommy Robinson was eventually banned by Twitter,
[10:08.640 --> 10:15.440]  because he accurately stated the statistics that 84 percent of convicted groomers, these
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.480]  people who abduct and traffic children in the UK, are Muslim men.
[10:20.480 --> 10:22.240]  That's from Quillian Foundation.
[10:22.240 --> 10:29.480]  That's not from an extreme right wing source, 84 percent are either Pakistani or Bangladeshi.
[10:29.480 --> 10:30.480]  They're Muslims.
[10:30.480 --> 10:31.480]  This is a Muslim problem.
[10:31.480 --> 10:35.880]  But in all the reporting about this, they dare not mention that fact.
[10:35.880 --> 10:42.640]  And in the investigation of this, they deliberately hide the fact to the extent in this case, where
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.600]  the police were told that they, in order to prosecute this case thoroughly, which it never
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.120]  got prosecuted, there were a handful of people who did.
[10:50.120 --> 10:52.000]  The vast majority got away with it.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.800]  They would need to go out and find people who were non-white to try and prosecute so
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.920]  that they can then justify this and bust the case wide open.
[11:01.920 --> 11:05.520]  They were literally told, we're not going to do anything unless you find some white
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.040]  people who are involved.
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.040]  Article continues.
[11:10.040 --> 11:14.360]  And yet another grooming scandal involving predominantly Pakistani men sexually abusing
[11:14.360 --> 11:15.360]  white girls.
[11:15.360 --> 11:17.920]  Again, their white privilege didn't come to their aid.
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.200]  A new report reveals that Greater Manchester Police failed to take appropriate action more
[11:22.200 --> 11:28.640]  than 15 years ago, despite getting details of nearly 100 persons of interest who were
[11:28.640 --> 11:34.320]  using takeout restaurants as a base to rape and abuse children in care between the ages
[11:34.320 --> 11:41.680]  of 11 and 17, despite the fact that the culprits were operating, quote, in plain sight.
[11:41.680 --> 11:44.840]  That's a quote from the report.
[11:44.840 --> 11:50.800]  All of the victims were young white females aged 11 to 17, while all the perpetrators
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.040]  were almost exclusively Asian adult males.
[11:54.040 --> 11:59.080]  And again, Asian is the politically correct term in the UK for Muslims.
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.280]  I imagine that South Koreans, Japanese and Chinese were quite offended by that term being
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.320]  used over and over again, but we can't say the word Muslims, because that's politically
[12:08.320 --> 12:09.320]  incorrect.
[12:09.320 --> 12:12.040]  And that's why this case didn't even get sold.
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.040]  Even though it was out in the open, it was in plain sight.
[12:16.040 --> 12:23.320]  The police operation identified 57 girls who had been exploited, including one who died
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.400]  after being injected with heroin by her abuser.
[12:27.400 --> 12:33.040]  Literally just injecting them with heroin, then sexually abusing them, passing them around.
[12:33.040 --> 12:36.480]  We've got a clip from the BBC, which we're going to play in the next segment, which talks
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.120]  about that girl who was injected with heroin.
[12:40.120 --> 12:47.360]  But the case was shut down in 2005, and quote, very few offenders were brought to justice.
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.600]  Now to digress before I get back into this, we have to remember that this has happened
[12:51.600 --> 12:58.360]  across the United Kingdom time and time again, Rotherham, Telford, Oxford, Rochdale, in all
[12:58.360 --> 13:00.360]  these different towns and cities.
[13:00.360 --> 13:03.080]  The exact same thing is happening.
[13:03.080 --> 13:07.880]  Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslim men are abducting young white girls, sex trafficking
[13:07.880 --> 13:14.200]  them, abusing them, bullying them, beating them, intimidating them, in some cases, killing
[13:14.200 --> 13:15.200]  them.
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.280]  And in almost every single case, only a handful of people get prosecuted.
[13:20.280 --> 13:23.920]  The big case, of course, was in Rotherham that came out in 2014.
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.880]  That's when this story really started to come to the fore.
[13:27.880 --> 13:33.240]  And at the same time in Rotherham, when these Muslim men were trafficking young girls, they
[13:33.240 --> 13:39.520]  always targeted young white girls, the council that helped cover it up, the same council
[13:39.520 --> 13:46.560]  was telling foster couples was removing children from foster couples because of their politics.
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.040]  So the council was concerned about kids being radicalized by right-wing foster parents.
[13:52.040 --> 13:54.720]  There's a headline here out of the BBC.
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.880]  UKIP couple have foster children removed from care.
[13:58.880 --> 14:03.640]  Now this couple, I think they were Polish, they weren't even British, and an absolutely
[14:03.640 --> 14:10.160]  exemplary record for foster care, but because they expressed support for UKIP at the time,
[14:10.160 --> 14:17.400]  which in 2014, or in 2012, was basically almost the third largest political party in the UK.
[14:17.400 --> 14:21.000]  It became that in 2015 with the election.
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.680]  Because they expressed support for a mainstream UK political party that was not left-wing,
[14:27.680 --> 14:30.440]  they had children removed from foster care.
[14:30.440 --> 14:37.640]  Meanwhile, 1,400 girls in the same town are being kidnapped, abused and trafficked by
[14:37.640 --> 14:39.600]  this Muslim grooming gang.
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.040]  Not only did they do nothing about it, they helped cover it up.
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.680]  This is the extent to the industrial scale abduction and grooming of children that's
[14:48.680 --> 14:51.880]  been happening in the United Kingdom.
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.440]  And again, I go back to the staff, 84% of these grooming gang members Pakistani Bangladeshi
[14:57.440 --> 14:58.440]  men.
[14:58.440 --> 15:04.320]  But at the same time, even to this day, there's a tweet here where a council is sending out
[15:04.320 --> 15:10.360]  a test for employees to join the council, to be employed by the council, where they
[15:10.360 --> 15:16.720]  ask the question, well, perpetrators of child sexual exploitation can be men or women from
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.440]  all walks of life, cultures, ethnic backgrounds and of any age.
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.160]  Media reporting has tended to be skewed towards the gang being made up of Pakistani or Asian
[15:26.160 --> 15:27.160]  origin.
[15:27.160 --> 15:31.680]  And if you answer true on that question, that they're mainly Pakistani or Asian origin,
[15:31.680 --> 15:37.320]  you fail, you don't get the job that are actually using it to apply for council jobs.
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.480]  And if you actually tell the truth in that instance, you don't get the job.
[15:41.480 --> 15:44.720]  These are some of the same councils who helped cover this up.
[15:44.720 --> 15:51.040]  And now we have a giant new case in Manchester, which was happening 15 years ago, and it only
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.040]  just came out.
[15:52.040 --> 15:54.600]  We're going to get into more details about it on the other side.
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.920]  This is Alex Jones Show live breaking news at infowars.com.

[16:27.320 --> 16:28.320]  Guess what?

[20:02.600 --> 20:14.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You're listening to the summit dot news radio hour
[20:14.760 --> 20:26.280]  with Paul Joseph Watson. Well, they say diversity is a strength. We've seen this across Europe,
[20:26.280 --> 20:32.480]  but we've seen it particularly in the UK. The industrial scale sex trafficking of children
[20:32.480 --> 20:37.560]  basically, they always talk about them in the media as being, you know, girls know their
[20:37.560 --> 20:44.320]  children are as young as 11 years older. We've had another case in Manchester where 57 girls
[20:44.320 --> 20:51.040]  were abducted sex traffics in some cases injected with heroin in one case injected with heroin
[20:51.040 --> 20:57.640]  by their abusers and killed. And this has only come to light 15 years later. Why? Well,
[20:57.640 --> 21:02.160]  in the report, it tells you why. And it's the same case as we saw in rather and Rochdale
[21:02.160 --> 21:07.440]  Telford and in all these other cases. From the article, British police failed to stop
[21:07.440 --> 21:12.720]  Muslim grooming gang dues fears over community tensions. One of the reasons why police failed
[21:12.720 --> 21:19.560]  to take adequate action despite knowing this was happening in plain sight was due to concerns
[21:19.560 --> 21:25.440]  over quote sensitive community issues. We see this again, even with terrorist cases
[21:25.440 --> 21:29.800]  where they refused to arrest terrorists or refused to keep tabs on them because it might
[21:29.800 --> 21:36.400]  upset the Muslim community. There was a refugee who was eventually given asylum in Canada.
[21:36.400 --> 21:41.680]  I think it was coming back from Egypt or Saudi Arabia or Middle Eastern country. And again,
[21:41.680 --> 21:45.960]  the same reason they gave the government is we can't take her in as refugee despite being
[21:45.960 --> 21:51.360]  under threat of being murdered because it might inflame community tensions. In other words,
[21:51.360 --> 21:57.760]  it might upset the Muslims. And now even though these men were known to police, they knew
[21:57.760 --> 22:02.240]  the locations where this was operating out of the new. They knew the culprits involved.
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.640]  They didn't intervene because of political correctness. There was another case named
[22:06.640 --> 22:12.680]  in this report involving Kurdish people. When the police got involved, that also created
[22:12.680 --> 22:18.080]  quote community tensions. The report says these factors clearly had to be considered
[22:18.080 --> 22:23.920]  by the gold command group, which was the police outfit investigating the crimes which were
[22:23.920 --> 22:29.480]  never properly prosecuted. Police were even ordered to try to find culprits who were white
[22:29.480 --> 22:34.000]  to hide the fact that the grooming gang issue is a Muslim Pakistani problem. Quote, we were
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.720]  told to try and get other ethnicities. So the only way they could bust this case was
[22:39.720 --> 22:45.280]  to try to fudge it and make it not look like a Muslim Pakistani issue. I'm going to come
[22:45.280 --> 22:48.920]  back and talk about this, but here's a clip from the BBC talking about how one of the
[22:48.920 --> 22:54.560]  victims trafficked by this gang covered up by police was treated. Here's the clip.
[22:54.560 --> 23:04.520]  It told me it was a beautiful young girl. Why did she have to die? I just want this
[23:04.520 --> 23:10.800]  to be here with me now and just be close.
[23:10.800 --> 23:17.320]  Jonah Gawley lost her granddaughter, Victoria, in 2003 and has been demanding answers ever
[23:17.320 --> 23:24.760]  since. But Victoria's death should not have come as a shock to the authorities at the
[23:24.760 --> 23:30.040]  time. Today in central Manchester, John was at the front row of a press conference held
[23:30.040 --> 23:35.640]  by Mayor Andy Burnham, which laid bare the extent to which they knew about the terrible
[23:35.640 --> 23:41.720]  abuse she was subjected to and how little they did to protect her. Although Victoria
[23:41.720 --> 23:48.040]  was cared for by Manchester City Council, a man who had been previously identified as
[23:48.040 --> 23:54.920]  sexually exploiting her was given permission to visit her in her accommodation three times
[23:54.920 --> 24:03.400]  a week. Only weeks before her death, Victoria disclosed to her social workers that she was
[24:03.400 --> 24:12.120]  being injected with heroin by an older Asian man for favours. No formal action was taken
[24:12.120 --> 24:17.520]  to investigate this matter or prevent it occurring again.
[24:17.520 --> 24:22.720]  John heard pledges from the panel that the wrongs of the past would at last be put right
[24:22.720 --> 24:26.480]  with new investigations. But will they deliver justice?
[24:26.480 --> 24:33.480]  I've heard this time and time again. I'm just hoping this time, after all these years, I've
[24:33.480 --> 24:42.000]  been hoping and praying and had interviews and everything. They will keep the promises
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.560]  and get this sorted out. My granddaughter can't go to heaven yet.
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.840]  But it wasn't just Victoria. In the wake of her death, Greater Manchester Police set up
[24:53.840 --> 25:00.440]  Operation Augusta with the aim of tackling widespread and serious sexual exploitation
[25:00.440 --> 25:09.400]  of children in care in the city. The operation identified 57 children as potential victims
[25:09.400 --> 25:16.880]  and up to 97 persons of interest involved in the crimes against them. But the investigation
[25:16.880 --> 25:23.600]  was shut down before it got started, a decision the report found driven by resources rather
[25:23.600 --> 25:29.680]  than all lines of inquiry being successfully completed or exhausted. The men identified
[25:29.680 --> 25:37.160]  by detectives were never investigated. Their abuse went unchecked. The review concluded
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.920]  that most of the children they considered were failed by police and children services.
[25:42.920 --> 25:48.560]  That authorities knew that many were being subjected to the most profound abuse and exploitation
[25:48.560 --> 25:54.680]  but did not protect them from the perpetrators. We now know that eight of the men originally
[25:54.680 --> 26:01.640]  identified by police went on to commit serious sexual offences after the operation ended,
[26:01.640 --> 26:09.720]  including the rape of girls aged both over and under the age of 16.
[26:09.720 --> 26:15.960]  This is something Ruby knows a lot about. From the age of 12, she was groomed, plied
[26:15.960 --> 26:23.120]  with alcohol and sexually abused by groups of older Asian men in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.
[26:23.120 --> 26:32.040]  I was raped by a lot of men. It started when I was around 12. It ended around 15, I think.
[26:32.040 --> 26:36.680]  We were playing in a takeaway. We'd go and have drinks and then it escalated from there.
[26:36.680 --> 26:43.240]  It started taking us to houses and stuff. There was a lot of alcohol, a lot of alcohol.
[26:43.240 --> 26:47.600]  To be fair, most of the time you couldn't even remember the sex or the rapes because
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.760]  I was that intoxicated. It was that bad then.
[26:51.760 --> 26:59.880]  Ruby isn't her real name. You're going with him. You're going with him.
[26:59.880 --> 27:04.840]  It's the name she was given when her story was made public in the BBC drama series Three
[27:04.840 --> 27:13.120]  Girls. Today's news of a previous failed investigation, five years before her abuse began, is a
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.800]  especially difficult to hear. They should have saved Victoria. They could
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.960]  have saved her, but they didn't. I feel like if they would have done something then, then
[27:23.960 --> 27:29.080]  it would have saved me from going through all the abuse as a child as well.
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.360]  The next step of Andy Burnham's review will be a detailed reassessment of the investigations
[27:34.360 --> 27:40.640]  into the abuse she and others endured in Rochdale. She told us she gave police details of at
[27:40.640 --> 27:47.840]  least 10 men who abused her, but only one was prosecuted. Ruby thinks, for her, the
[27:47.840 --> 27:52.880]  review has come too late. If you knew then what you know now, do you
[27:52.880 --> 27:56.760]  think you would have taken part in the police investigation?
[27:56.760 --> 28:03.720]  No, absolutely not. Because they didn't do the jobs properly to be fair. The outcome
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.040]  wasn't what they said it would be. The police, they're there to keep me safe and they didn't.
[28:09.040 --> 28:17.040]  There was only a child as well. Manchester City Council said today, we
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.040]  recognise that some of the social work practice and management oversight around 15 years ago
[28:22.040 --> 28:26.840]  fell far below the high standards we now expect. We're deeply sorry that not enough was done
[28:26.840 --> 28:32.000]  to protect our children at the time. And Greater Manchester Police said in a statement, following
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.880]  our internal review, a multi-agency team was established under Operation Green Jacket.
[28:37.880 --> 28:42.880]  To date, Operation Green Jacket has identified 53 potential victims. We will continue to
[28:42.880 --> 28:47.000]  do all that we can to safeguard children within our communities.
[28:47.000 --> 28:55.000]  They have it and they don't mention the real reason why it was covered up because of concerns
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.560]  about political correctness. They don't tell you that. Don't go away, little...

[30:59.000 --> 31:05.880]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate. But everybody around the office, especially folks
[31:05.880 --> 31:11.520]  that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick. Now, again,
[31:11.520 --> 31:15.960]  I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll
[31:15.960 --> 31:19.920]  say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that. I'm very thankful
[31:19.920 --> 31:25.400]  to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given. But up until about eight, nine
[31:25.400 --> 31:31.680]  years ago when I started taking X2 in the product's InfoWars life, I still got sick
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.480]  every couple of years. And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things
[31:36.480 --> 31:43.480]  like that. But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWars life, the highest
[31:43.480 --> 31:49.160]  quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[31:49.160 --> 31:56.200]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk
[31:56.200 --> 32:02.880]  it up to genetics and the great products. I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars
[32:02.880 --> 32:08.480]  to family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air. And I spend a
[32:08.480 --> 32:12.960]  lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on
[32:12.960 --> 32:16.760]  the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern
[32:16.760 --> 32:22.800]  Paul Revere's. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these
[32:22.800 --> 32:27.160]  products are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third
[32:27.160 --> 32:31.440]  party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration. The supplements are
[32:31.440 --> 32:36.600]  all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere

[33:23.560 --> 33:29.320]  describing their involvement, their victims, or their abusive hands of networks of Pakistani
[33:29.320 --> 33:34.240]  Muslim men. Again, the entire case covered up by the police or at least they were told
[33:34.240 --> 33:38.960]  not to investigate it. In many instances, told not to bust the case until they could
[33:38.960 --> 33:45.440]  find people from different ethnicities. So then they could produce the case or present
[33:45.440 --> 33:51.800]  the case in the eyes of the public as something that was not Pakistani slash Muslim related,
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.120]  even though it is in almost every instance, because people bring over certain aspects
[33:56.120 --> 34:02.080]  of their cultures from their home countries that don't always mesh with us. But the governments,
[34:02.080 --> 34:05.920]  the councils do nothing about it. In many cases, they directly cover it up because God
[34:05.920 --> 34:11.920]  forbid they would be called racist by coming to the aid of these dozens and dozens of children
[34:11.920 --> 34:17.580]  being abused. And tying into that, actually, there was a story which I saw immediately
[34:17.580 --> 34:22.840]  before coming on air, which is out of a Swedish publication. Of course, Sweden is having gigantic
[34:22.840 --> 34:29.760]  problems with their own cultural enrichment. They've had record explosions, grenade attacks,
[34:29.760 --> 34:34.520]  sexual assault statistics through the roof over the past few years, as they've accepted
[34:34.520 --> 34:41.320]  more migrants, more asylum seekers. And there's a story here out of a Swedish news source,
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.840]  which I believe is the mainstream Swedish newspaper, translated. So the language is
[34:45.840 --> 34:51.120]  not exactly easy to follow. But the headline is authorities plan to deploy military against
[34:51.120 --> 34:57.960]  the Swedish people. Now, as far as I can understand from this rough machine translation, police
[34:57.960 --> 35:04.040]  chiefs in Sweden have asked the government to have the power to implement basically martial
[35:04.040 --> 35:10.440]  law scenario where they could employ military assets against the people in times of, you
[35:10.440 --> 35:17.160]  know, emergency in terms of crisis, which they describe as the gray zone. It says, among
[35:17.160 --> 35:22.480]  the tools you fear can be used in the gray zone are, among other things, dissemination
[35:22.480 --> 35:28.920]  of disinformation and, quote, impact operations. And they asked the authorities in this case
[35:28.920 --> 35:36.000]  be given the power and the opportunity to plan and practice, quote, gray zone problems.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.560]  So they're requesting support from the quote, armed forces in a gray zone situation, which
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.040]  means that police and military can be deployed against the population in case the country
[35:46.040 --> 35:53.280]  is deemed to be in a war like state. But as part of this request, according to this article,
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.960]  again, this needs to be fleshed out. So I'm going to do more research about it and probably
[35:57.960 --> 36:04.880]  do my own story on it. Within this memo, they describe the alternative media as being part
[36:04.880 --> 36:11.520]  of this threat that would require armed forces to support the police in times of civil emergency.
[36:11.520 --> 36:18.960]  They directly mentioned, quote, this is from F O I memo 6338. And again, this is a rough
[36:18.960 --> 36:24.080]  translation. So I'm doing the best I can with this translation, but it says these are the
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.120]  people who they're looking at in terms of needing armed forces support on the streets
[36:29.120 --> 36:35.800]  against the Swedish people. It says the dissemination of propaganda via internet activists and
[36:35.800 --> 36:42.280]  alternative media, which is sometimes unreflected spread further in Swedish traditional media
[36:42.280 --> 36:48.000]  conveys a distorted picture of Sweden. The Swedish public is exposed to ambiguous facts
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.880]  and sometimes pure disinformation on issues that concern, among other things, order and
[36:51.880 --> 36:58.800]  security, migration and integration. Now, you remember a couple of years ago, the Swedish
[36:58.800 --> 37:04.200]  government basically put out an enemy's list. The Swedish government, by the way, is completely
[37:04.200 --> 37:10.720]  beholden to these SPLC type groups in Sweden who designate lists of enemies, which is basically
[37:10.720 --> 37:16.400]  anyone who's vocal, who has criticized mass migration. In some places, these lists are
[37:16.400 --> 37:22.000]  leaked to newspapers. And then journalists go out, they find the addresses of people
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.560]  who've left mean comments about mass migration on Facebook. They knock on their door and
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.800]  try to publicly shame them. That's concerning enough. Now it's being mentioned in the context
[37:32.800 --> 37:41.000]  of sending troops onto the streets to deal with this kind of dissent. Continues. Again,
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.840]  they're talking about the Swedish public being exposed to disinformation via internet activists.
[37:45.840 --> 37:49.680]  Who do you think they're talking about there? They're talking about someone like the angry
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.000]  foreigner who is a YouTuber, a Bosnian immigrant himself who has been on this show several
[37:55.000 --> 38:01.440]  times, made numerous viral videos about the problems that mass migration and soaring crime
[38:01.440 --> 38:07.000]  in migrant communities has had on Sweden. He was put on the enemy's list too. So was
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.440]  PewDiePie, by the way. And he did a pretty humorous video about it at the time, I remember.
[38:13.440 --> 38:19.200]  But now they're saying, quote, these information operations, which primarily utilize the information
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.680]  infrastructure of our open society in terms of the internet, social media and blogs have
[38:25.680 --> 38:31.840]  a certain negative impact on public confidence in authorities and politicians. The article
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.520]  goes on to say the documents dealing how to, the document details how to eliminate the
[38:36.520 --> 38:42.920]  threat from alternative media. Memo 6338 addresses the crisis in healthcare energy supply. And
[38:42.920 --> 38:48.280]  it also addresses other things, including failed payment systems. But the point is one
[38:48.280 --> 38:54.000]  of the targets in this, what they call gray zone scenario, where they have civil unrest
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.720]  in Sweden, where the people no longer trust the government, one of their enemies who they're
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.320]  looking to use the military against under this scenario, which they're trying to claim
[39:04.320 --> 39:11.880]  new powers to enact, or at least have on standby, is quote, internet activists putting out disinformation
[39:11.880 --> 39:17.440]  during this gray zone situation. Those are the targets, which is basically anyone who's
[39:17.440 --> 39:22.760]  criticized mass migration on the internet. I mean, we have stories routinely out of Sweden
[39:22.760 --> 39:30.600]  where 75 year old pensioners have received police interrogations for, you know, talking
[39:30.600 --> 39:36.240]  mean about Muslims on Facebook, things like that, so many cases. And now they're asking
[39:36.240 --> 39:42.400]  the government to give them the power to use the armed forces against those kind of people.
[39:42.400 --> 39:47.360]  Sounds very progressive, doesn't it? But again, that story literally just came out and it's
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.480]  a direct translation, so I'm going to try and flesh it out even more. But of course,
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.440]  we were talking before the break about the massive problem in the UK with Muslim grooming
[39:56.440 --> 40:00.440]  gangs, the fact that the media won't call them Muslim grooming gangs, they call them
[40:00.440 --> 40:08.840]  Asian gangs. And again, they primarily target white working class, young women and children.
[40:08.840 --> 40:12.120]  The white privilege doesn't really help them out in those cases, does it? And it didn't
[40:12.120 --> 40:19.400]  help them out in this case, which was the most prolific legal rape case in the UK headline
[40:19.400 --> 40:26.880]  era of Sky News. Reinhard Srinagar, prolific rapist should never be released, says Attorney
[40:26.880 --> 40:34.280]  General as he reviews sentence. This is a guy who I think he's from Thailand originally,
[40:34.280 --> 40:41.600]  who was found guilty of 136 counts of raping and sexually assaulting 48 men. But there
[40:41.600 --> 40:51.600]  could be 190 victims. They're calling it the most prolific rapist in British legal history.
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.920]  What he basically did was he rented an apartment in Manchester near where all the bars and
[40:56.920 --> 41:04.080]  clubs are. He lowered back men to his apartment and said, do you want to drink? Do you want
[41:04.080 --> 41:08.560]  to charge your phone? Then he slipped them a date rate drug and raped them and he literally
[41:08.560 --> 41:15.000]  raped dozens and dozens. This is the most prolific rapist in British history. And buried
[41:15.000 --> 41:22.640]  deep down in the article here is the fact that, quote, all but a few of Srinagar's victims
[41:22.640 --> 41:29.840]  were white heterosexual men with an average age of 21. So that, yet again, is another
[41:29.840 --> 41:35.720]  migrant to the UK who has now become the most prolific rapist in the UK targeting white
[41:35.720 --> 41:40.840]  heterosexual men to be raped. Another example of how their white privilege did not come
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.400]  to their aid. Even though that's an integral part of the story, again, like with the Rotherham
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.280]  case with the Manchester case where they deliberately target white people, that is buried or not
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.960]  even mentioned by the mainstream media who will crow on all day about white privilege.
[41:55.960 --> 42:02.280]  Of course, we just had a week-long scandal which is still running about Meghan Markle
[42:02.280 --> 42:07.680]  basically forcing Prince Harry to resign from the royal family. And then all criticism
[42:07.680 --> 42:15.240]  of her privileged, whiny, devil-like behavior is denounced as misogyny, is denounced as racism
[42:15.240 --> 42:21.080]  by feminists who, by the way, have absolutely nothing whatsoever to say about the industrial
[42:21.080 --> 42:27.560]  abuse of dozens and dozens of girls and young women by Muslim, by Pakistani grooming gangs.
[42:27.560 --> 42:33.880]  We're going to come back in the next segment. We're going to talk about what's happening
[42:33.880 --> 42:41.800]  in Virginia. They are now rolling in SWAT equipment. They're rolling in caterpillar arms to keep
[42:41.800 --> 42:46.520]  surveillance. It's all armored. They're rolling in SWAT teams according to some reports. And
[42:46.520 --> 42:51.200]  that looks like a really big confrontation that we do not want to happen. All the ingredients
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.000]  for it happening are going to be there in place. Breaking news at infowars.com. Don't
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.680]  go away. We'll be right back.

[44:29.400 --> 44:33.320]  fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[44:33.320 --> 44:38.840]  110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack,
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.160]  attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists and just believe me,
[44:43.160 --> 44:46.200]  ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight
[44:46.200 --> 44:49.640]  for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm
[44:49.640 --> 44:54.280]  going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself, my family, your family,
[44:54.280 --> 44:59.560]  because we're in this together in four store.com.
[44:59.560 --> 45:06.320]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone, you know, everybody
[45:06.320 --> 45:12.320]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the
[45:12.320 --> 45:19.520]  flu vaccine right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[45:19.520 --> 45:26.160]  But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and
[45:26.160 --> 45:31.040]  clinics to get the injections. It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.200]  in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of
[45:36.200 --> 45:41.480]  getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity. It goes on and on. Or the fact
[45:41.480 --> 45:47.120]  that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has
[45:47.120 --> 45:53.800]  never, ever even worked. But how do you prop up a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going.
[45:53.800 --> 45:58.000]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.800]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infall awards, it's
[46:03.800 --> 46:11.280]  because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up. That's why it's
[46:11.280 --> 46:16.480]  critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.200]  when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should
[46:21.200 --> 46:27.000]  expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.120]  to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally
[46:32.120 --> 46:38.120]  driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are
[46:38.120 --> 46:45.000]  awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.600]  wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are
[46:50.600 --> 46:57.040]  alive. They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that
[46:57.040 --> 47:24.840]  God is in charge.
[47:24.840 --> 47:32.320]  Back live on the Alex Jones show. I want to tell you about some of the great deals available
[47:32.320 --> 47:37.640]  at infowarstore.com. You've seen the massive de-platforming campaign, not just against
[47:37.640 --> 47:42.960]  us, but against basically everyone who helped Donald Trump achieve election in 2016. Everyone
[47:42.960 --> 47:48.600]  was punished in some way. The latest example, of course, being Stefan Molyneux, who because
[47:48.600 --> 47:56.720]  one person from Sleeping Giants tweeted a little complaint to MailChimp. His MailChimp database
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.800]  was immediately removed because they did the same thing to us months and months ago. If
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.240]  you want to have a mailing list which you actually trust and won't be yanked away from
[48:06.240 --> 48:10.080]  you within a moment's notice because one's screeching more on complaints about it on
[48:10.080 --> 48:16.200]  Twitter, don't use MailChimp. In fact, a lot of people did immediately pull their support
[48:16.200 --> 48:20.840]  and service from MailChimp in the aftermath of that. Of course, we've been completely
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.840]  de-platformed. They expected us to be completely destroyed at this point. We're not. We're
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.280]  still here fighting purely because of you getting the products at infowarstore.com.
[48:31.280 --> 48:37.880]  I cannot overestimate the crucial nature of your continued support for this network's
[48:37.880 --> 48:45.240]  continued survival. We have Alexa Breese air purifier now available at 30% off with free

[49:02.880 --> 49:06.960]  units, and this is the same with our storable food, which by the way, if you try to get
[49:06.960 --> 49:12.120]  storable food in Europe, it's like 10 times more expensive. Comparable units for the Alexa
[49:12.120 --> 49:19.120]  Pure Breeze cost as much as $800. We're bringing it to you for just $195.97. That special is

[49:34.880 --> 49:38.600]  important than ever to make sure you're getting the vitamins you need. Wintersun can help
[49:38.600 --> 49:42.800]  you get all the vitamin D your body needs without the uncomfortable sunburn created

[50:15.640 --> 50:22.520]  accord. We really appreciate those donations. Of course, we used to take donations via PayPal
[50:22.520 --> 50:27.320]  but they banned us. We got around it and now you can donate anything you like or a preset
[50:27.320 --> 50:33.360]  amount right there at infowarstore.com. It's absolutely crucial that you continue to do
[50:33.360 --> 50:40.520]  so we really appreciate your support. Now, of course, Virginia is potentially going to
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.520]  be a flash point on Monday. You have 60,000 people saying that they're going to attend
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.520]  this pro-gun rally on Facebook. Of course, not that many will show up, but even if one
[50:49.520 --> 50:55.160]  10th show up, there's going to be a large amount of people. You also have Antifa who've
[50:55.160 --> 50:58.640]  announced that they're going to be on the scene too just to make things that little bit
[50:58.640 --> 51:03.840]  more spicy. Headline out of Daily Caller, Antifa Group plans to march alongside pro-gun
[51:03.840 --> 51:08.640]  protesters in Virginia. Diverse gathering pro-gun protesters are set to descend upon
[51:08.640 --> 51:14.920]  Virginia's capital on Monday. It could include an unlikely ally, a local Antifa Group. What
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.840]  vice called a bizarre meeting of the mines Richmond based Antifa Seven Hills also strongly
[51:19.840 --> 51:24.840]  opposes the gun measures now likely to become law since Democrats won control of both Virginia
[51:24.840 --> 51:29.480]  Houses last year and they too want Democratic leaders in Richmond to know. So they're basically
[51:29.480 --> 51:36.520]  saying that gun control in America has a legacy of racist enforcement. That's why Antifa
[51:36.520 --> 51:40.480]  now are literally going to be out on the streets protesting in favor of the Second Amendment,
[51:40.480 --> 51:46.240]  but they've also said that they're not going to be supporting far-right militias or white
[51:46.240 --> 51:51.840]  supremacists who are also expected to show up to the event. Now, this is going to be
[51:51.840 --> 51:57.360]  a big flash point because of course the Mr. Blackface himself, the governor of Virginia
[51:57.360 --> 52:03.360]  has said that he will ban all guns. He's passed an executive order to ban all guns.
[52:03.360 --> 52:08.160]  Some people have said they're going to bring the guns anyway. And now it looks like authorities
[52:08.160 --> 52:13.800]  are preparing for a flash point. They've got a armored vehicle, which I think is called
[52:13.800 --> 52:19.960]  the Rook. People have identified this on Twitter. There are photos circulating of this black
[52:19.960 --> 52:25.480]  armored vehicle device with a big arm, which they use as both surveillance. And here's
[52:25.480 --> 52:30.000]  an article about it actually. I can describe exactly what its function is. It's out of
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.600]  Business Insider. There you see right there the photo of the vehicle that's in station
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.560]  in Virginia right now. Business Insider describes exactly what it does. It says, take a look
[52:39.560 --> 52:46.080]  inside the Rook. An armored vehicle SWAT teams use to tear through vehicles, block an active
[52:46.080 --> 52:51.880]  shooter or bust through a riot. The Rook designed by Ring Power Corporation,
[52:51.880 --> 52:57.000]  heavy equipment company that modifies vehicles, is essentially an armored caterpillar vehicle
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.120]  that has been modified for SWAT and other police units. It can be used for all kinds
[53:01.120 --> 53:07.360]  of scenarios including hostage rescue, barricaded suspects, riots and natural disasters. At
[53:07.360 --> 53:12.080]  least 25 different police departments across the US have purchased one. And now, as you
[53:12.080 --> 53:17.280]  can see from those pictures, there is one onsite in Virginia where you're going to have
[53:17.280 --> 53:24.520]  armed police and potentially SWAT teams alongside pro-gun protesters who have been told they
[53:24.520 --> 53:30.560]  can't bring guns, but many of them have said they will anyway, and antifa radicals who
[53:30.560 --> 53:35.240]  often get into fights with those same pro-gun protesters, even though they said that they
[53:35.240 --> 53:40.840]  are marching alongside them in this instance. So to put it bluntly, it's a recipe for absolute
[53:40.840 --> 53:45.320]  disaster, but of course that was worsened by this executive order which said they couldn't
[53:45.320 --> 53:51.680]  carry guns. If they hadn't passed that order, if they'd allowed everyone to carry firearms,
[53:51.680 --> 53:56.040]  it probably would have passed off without much comment, but now it's become a flash
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.640]  point situation and everybody's worried about potential violence, which of course we don't
[54:00.640 --> 54:06.720]  want to see happen. Meanwhile, National File Report Sheriff's
[54:06.720 --> 54:13.960]  Deputy vows to defy unconstitutional gun control. Tripp Kester, a Sheriff's Deputy in North
[54:13.960 --> 54:17.920]  Carolina's Davidson County, channeled the civic sentiment of many American patriots
[54:17.920 --> 54:22.640]  this week, and a meeting of his County Board of Commissioners which voted unanimously to
[54:22.640 --> 54:28.000]  adopt Second Amendment Sanctuary County status. And in fact, we have a clip of the sheriff
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.360]  getting up and giving a speech, and here is that clip right now. Let's roll it.
[54:33.360 --> 54:37.760]  My name's Tripp Kester. As you can see, I'm here. I just want to personally, could you
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.480]  pull that mic up a little bit? Is that better? Okay. I just want to personally and publicly
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.400]  go on record supporting this resolution before this evening. You know, guys, it's simple
[54:48.400 --> 54:53.640]  like a lot of them have said, the Constitution needs no explanation. It's been in force for
[54:53.640 --> 54:59.520]  several hundred years now. It's easy to understand. It says what it means. It means what it says.
[54:59.520 --> 55:04.400]  And last time I read the Declaration of Independence, it specifically reminds all of us that we're
[55:04.400 --> 55:10.480]  endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, which means God-given, among these
[55:10.480 --> 55:16.320]  life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, and that governments were instituted among men
[55:16.320 --> 55:23.360]  specifically to secure our God-given rights. And it says when government becomes destructive
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.800]  to these lands, meaning when they go above and beyond trying to secure our liberties
[55:27.800 --> 55:32.680]  and trying to take them, it's the right of the people to alter or abolish that government,
[55:32.680 --> 55:37.600]  either by voting or ultimately God forbid to use our Second Amendment rights to protect
[55:37.600 --> 55:43.000]  ourselves from tyranny. And I'm just asking all of y'all to unanimously join our sister
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.600]  counties of Wilkes, Surrey, Stokes, Lincoln, and Cherokee, and get on board with this thing
[55:49.600 --> 55:55.360]  and publicly demonstrate to us that you're willing to uphold and honor the same oath
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.480]  I took when I put my hand on God's word and held my other hand up to Him and swore that
[56:00.480 --> 56:05.680]  I'd give my life to defend that Constitution. And I hate and I'm not trying to be disrespectful,
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.920]  but regardless of what y'all do or don't do, I'm not going to enforce an unconstitutional
[56:09.920 --> 56:19.160]  law. I'm going to be fair.
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.480]  They have a sheriff's deputy in one of the name-breeding areas there talking about refusing
[56:23.480 --> 56:28.280]  to enforce unconstitutional laws. This is the flashpoint in Virginia, in fact, reading
[56:28.280 --> 56:36.240]  more about this armored vehicle, the Rock, which cost $315,000. They actually used it
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.680]  to take down Said Rizwan Farooq and Tashfi Malik, the married couple who carried out
[56:41.680 --> 56:48.600]  a San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015. So this is literally a device, a vehicle
[56:48.600 --> 56:56.520]  used to take out mass shooters and terrorists, and they've moved it into position reportedly.
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.840]  These photos are circulating on Twitter. Again, this has not been confirmed, but reportedly
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.400]  they've moved this vehicle into location in Virginia where they're going to have the
[57:04.400 --> 57:10.360]  big pro-rights march on Monday. The governor, Ralph Northam, Mr. Blackface, has said that
[57:10.360 --> 57:14.880]  no guns will be allowed. Looks like you're going to have a tight perimeter in there in
[57:14.880 --> 57:21.040]  the central plaza where they're having this protest with up to 60,000, of course, people
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.960]  who say they're going to go to an event on Facebook. Even if a tenth of those people,
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.560]  and it's usually like a third who sign up for Facebook, it's usually get a third who
[57:29.560 --> 57:35.080]  go. But even if it's 10%, you've got thousands of people. You've got Antifa. You've got people
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.560]  frustrated that they can't bring guns, some who will bring guns anyway. And you've got
[57:39.560 --> 57:45.680]  essentially vehicles, SWAT vehicles that have used to be used in the past to take out terrorists.
[57:45.680 --> 57:47.880]  This does not look good.
[57:47.880 --> 57:53.640]  Infoorstore.com, we have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're
[57:53.640 --> 57:57.160]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank the listeners
[57:57.160 --> 58:03.720]  for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super
[58:03.720 --> 58:08.240]  Blue that's four to five o'cloid silver and iodine in fluoride-free, the adult or the
[58:08.240 --> 58:13.080]  children's. These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People
[58:13.080 --> 58:18.640]  love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above-sea, coral calcium that
[58:18.640 --> 58:25.640]  also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver salt, silver
[58:25.640 --> 58:29.200]  in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis. This is all proven. You can make
[58:29.200 --> 58:34.480]  claims with this. But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking
[58:34.480 --> 58:40.240]  out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip
[58:40.240 --> 58:45.760]  away the enamel. So, we're really proud of it. It funds the operation. Infoorstore.com,
[58:45.760 --> 58:48.160]  that's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[58:48.160 --> 58:57.600]  Hey, you there. We have a problem. You see, there is a baby. The mother of this baby is
[58:57.600 --> 59:04.280]  not sure she's ready. The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother
[59:04.280 --> 59:12.320]  starts to have regrets. The father considers leaving town. But a friend says there's a
[59:12.320 --> 59:20.220]  solution. She says to have an abortion. The mother decides to look into it. The clinic
[59:20.220 --> 59:27.720]  assures her it's safe. She's made her decision. She's going to have an abortion. The problem
[59:27.720 --> 59:38.880]  is that baby is you join me. Oh, and Shroyer at the March for life Friday, January 24th
[59:38.880 --> 59:44.400]  in Washington D. C. Noon at the National Mall. I'll see you there. It's time to stand
[59:44.400 --> 59:52.080]  up for the unborn. It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[59:52.080 --> 1:00:04.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'm really quite close to very close to the cutting
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:12.520]  edge in AI, and it scares the hell out of me. It's capable of vastly more than almost
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:17.120]  anyone knows. And the rate of improvement is exponential.
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:23.280]  Our corporate media, the entire Hollywood Combine, the Communist Chinese, the EU are
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:29.560]  all promoting a post human world and that the family is bad, that there is no God, but
[1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:34.080]  that gods are coming and they're going to be AI gods and they're going to replace us.
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:39.280]  They say the same thing over and over again. We're obsolete. We're dead. We're gone. We
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:43.760]  should all just give up and take some high powered prescription drugs and just fade out.
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:48.560]  The CDC reporting the overdose death rate among middle aged women has risen more than
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:56.440]  260% since 1999. Drug related fatalities often involve a mixture of medications. And when
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:02.440]  researchers looked closer, they found overdoses that included prescription opioid painkillers
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:07.280]  rose 485%. A lot of people nihilistically are deciding
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:10.800]  to do that. You're seeing record suicide, not just here, but across the world because
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:14.920]  we're being told humans suck. We're bad. The world without humans is going to be a great
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:17.920]  thing. That's what young people are being taught. Record suicide there.
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.520]  The first 10 years, 2000 to 2010, suicide attempts were relatively flat according to
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:30.720]  the study. But in 2011, they went up in every age group, especially in girls age 10 to 12
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:35.480]  with a frightening 338% increase in attempted suicide.
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:41.640]  That's the prosperity that's killing us. Victor Hugo said adversity makes men, prosperity
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:48.240]  makes monsters. And we really are becoming monsters, aren't we? Slovenly, weak, stupid,
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:53.760]  no attention spans, myself included. Because we're not involved in the animating contest
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:59.320]  of liberty. We're not pushing ourselves. We're drowned in all this buzz of information,
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:08.120]  most of it false. But here on this broadcast, when I'm focused and I'm really putting my
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:13.800]  nose to the grindstone, there is no better analysis of what's really happening on this
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:17.840]  planet and what the different countervailing forces are, nowhere.
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:23.320]  What is his name? Mitchell Stewart. The conspiracy theorist? That's the celebrity now? The guy
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:30.440]  who thinks 9-11 was an inside job? He's an ass. He's an ass to me to deliver surgery.
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:37.400]  You make many statements that have been proven wrong. Do you really believe them?
[1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:39.840]  You want to untangle what's real and what's for show?
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:44.960]  Well, you got it from Alex Jones. And that's like, whoa, it's over. Person that gets called
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:51.080]  Alex Jones is an idiot. And everybody has to laugh at him. And it's tailored for women
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:56.200]  and kind of the younger pop generation. But I know what's happening with the younger
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:01.680]  generation. Even millennials are waking up, but particularly Generation Z, and they all
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:07.280]  see right through this. Why are they doing it if it's not working like it used to? Because
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:10.760]  it's all they've got and it used to work in the past.
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:16.200]  Well, that's a group that's got to be met with resistance. We've got to fight as hard
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:24.920]  as we can now while we still have some communities that are able to communicate on the Internet
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:28.840]  before they incrementally close the door, which is happening right now. And Trump, I
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:35.960]  have to say, has been presiding over America losing control of the Internet and losing
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:44.240]  control of our freedoms. And the little bitty things he's done, like the new trade negotiation
[1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:49.400]  to say that EU and others can't shut down our tech companies and don't have monopoly
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:56.840]  control over them. Does it mean anything if Trump lets then the big tech companies operate
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:00.160]  above the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the political system and the American
[1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:05.240]  people? Hi, Mr. Zuckerberg. How did the meeting go today? What was your message to lawmakers,
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:11.440]  Mr. Zuckerberg? Can you assure lawmakers that your platform will not be manipulated ahead
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:20.320]  of the next election? Did you talk about possibly breaking out Facebook? Did you talk about
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:23.320]  privacy legislation? Are you hopeful that it will come to the floor before the end of
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:29.440]  the year? Are you ready to deal with California's privacy legislation? Well, we've seen a few
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:36.400]  good things from Trump, but on a scale of one to ten, I mean, I'll give Trump a one
[1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:40.240]  and we need a ten out of him on First Amendment free speech. This is racketeering. This is
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:43.280]  a private company. You can do whatever it wants. This is private companies in real time
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:51.080]  with AI and real time censorship with people watching with the AI flags and controlling
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:59.400]  what we can say and do online. I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info
[1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:04.040]  War, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the
[1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:07.840]  globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back
[1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:11.880]  and off your children's back. You know what? I'm the same way and that's why we're on
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:17.320]  the same damn team and it's why M4s has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:23.520]  time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:30.240]  to a future for humanity and I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:33.800]  with us because you are the Info War and I want to thank you for committing to stand
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:38.640]  with us in 2020 however you can. For the bottom of my heart, for my family and for the great
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:43.120]  crew at Info Wars, I want to thank you all because you are the Info War and you know
[1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:48.320]  that's not just words, that's reality. You have made history. We have made history
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:06:06.320]  together. InfoWars.com only has power because of you and I suggest you use it.
[1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:21.760]  Fishing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:36.240]  Now I taped a really great interview with an extremely politically incorrect comedian
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:42.720]  thought criminal Tim Dillon. He is going to be in studio with us in the fourth hour because
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:47.840]  he was right here last night and we taped it. I have always been going well. We've had planes
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:54.760]  sliding off runways in Missouri and all sorts of crazy weather but I'll be in DC this afternoon
[1:06:54.760 --> 1:07:01.600]  co-hosting with Savannah Hernandez, Owen Troyer and others with the war room today.
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:06.600]  So that's from 3 to 6 p.m. and that's important because you have the historic attempt to impeach
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:10.320]  the president that has been successful. That's the indictment now. They're in the Senate with
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:14.640]  the trial. We're going to be there all next week covering it live and we're going to be
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:19.200]  there on the federal holiday. We're going to be in Virginia just 30-something miles south
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:24.200]  or the Virginia where the left is openly trying to cause martial law and trying to paint gun
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:29.880]  owners KKK and all this insane garbage. I mean this is America fight for its life.
[1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:34.280]  Now this is a football game. We're about seven points ahead in the third quarter going on
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:39.400]  to the fourth. I mean it's ours to lose. It's ours to lose here and this isn't a football
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:45.400]  game. This is the whole future of humanity being fought out in America right now. Because
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:49.160]  you seize control of America you can take down the planet in a period. They couldn't
[1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:54.920]  get full control so they set up China as the model to dominate and now I've got reports
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:57.840]  on that I'm going to be getting to in a moment. But let me just do this up front again in
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:03.280]  this hour because I always tend to plug at the end of things and do it like I'm apologizing
[1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:11.840]  for plugging. This dog doesn't hunt. This dog doesn't win unless you buy the products
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:20.120]  and I'm not saying it's some laborious thing. I'm happier than a pig and you know what when
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:25.360]  I take the ultimate fish oil that's back at stock when I take the X2 and X3 when I take
[1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:31.320]  the gut fusion. I can't wait. It's been sold out for three months now. I can't work four
[1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:35.880]  months because it takes forever to make this stuff organic. If you have stuff all the time
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:39.920]  not sold out if it's not organic they got plenty of that. Get the stuff sort of organic
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:44.440]  the testing of it. Everything has to be tested by third party the test about the labs again.
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:47.880]  You know they're testing all our stuff at the you know the both Democrats admit they
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:52.880]  do that as all of the news trying to find something. And so we're at above California
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:57.360]  standards with almost all of our products which is almost impossible. That is where the cost
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:06.040]  comes in. The triple testing. And these products are amazing. And so a lot of stuff that has
[1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:11.360]  been sold out will be back soon. But I was going to get a living defense. I mean people
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:17.800]  are just blown away by that. It's been sold out for three months. Three months. And I
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:22.240]  was talking to the factory just two days ago and I said listen it's supposed to take twelve
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:28.880]  weeks for this when we put the order. And they said yes but we continue to get and test
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:35.480]  and it's not passing California standards. Just can't go to production. So everybody
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:40.320]  else just slaps a label on saying this doesn't pass California standards which is like you
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:46.520]  know one part per billion. The air has more toxic stuff than this does. But they let California
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:50.240]  dump toxic waste right into the water calling it the fluoride but it's a bunch of other
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:56.200]  stuff as well. But there's a waiver for that around the clean water rack. There's a waiver
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:10:05.240]  for that ladies and gentlemen. So you know that's what this comes down to. And when you
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:11.440]  look at every angle of it and how they operate and the scams they're running it's just ridiculous
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:16.960]  that we ever put up with this stuff. Yeah I remember David Hogg said we're bad. We tell
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:22.840]  you the water is poisonous. The water tables are poisoned by the industrial revolution
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:26.720]  and so many other things and they add more poison into it. And I started to realize why
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:31.960]  they did that after World War II. The water was so toxic that they put fluoride but that
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:37.480]  meant hundreds of chemicals from the mining industries and phosphate industries and from
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:41.280]  the aluminum industries. And then they just put poison back in the water and that was
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:45.720]  the waiver to put the poison in to cover up the poison that was already in the water.
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  But I didn't mean to go into a huge plug or rant here. What I'm getting at is this. We
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:58.160]  go out to the top labs in the country the very best that are out there and we say we
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:03.080]  want the best you've ever made. And they go yeah this is this product we'll probably
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:10.840]  label it for you. We're ready right now. I'm like no excuse me. You don't understand.
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:21.560]  I want it better. And that's what we've done. In fact somebody took my ultimate fish oil
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:26.040]  when I had opened one I was eating. Took it away but here's one that's not been open
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:37.360]  yet. I just stole my fish oil. Now folks there it is. Please do overhead shot. Has anybody
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:43.080]  ever seen horse pills that big and maybe that's not a good sales tactic like these are the
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:49.160]  biggest horse pills ever. They go down OK with some water. I mean I'll tell you. I mean
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:58.240]  Monica Lewinsky would have no problem with these. But I call these little Clintons. But
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:03.560]  the point is is that it's crass it's out of control. I don't care anymore. But they have
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:09.000]  civil war. We're trying to stop it. Look at these babies. I mean those are big. Well they're
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:15.440]  small. Look at it. But here it is. Like that's a fish oil. That's a big fish oil. Now that's
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:20.120]  Bill Clinton's tallywacker. It's really little. But the point is that's not what we're talking
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:24.400]  about. It's a family show. And I apologize. I told you the filters gone folks. It's gone
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:29.000]  doesn't exist anymore. Sorry. I can't even put a filter on. That's always been the joke
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:34.080]  to like. Jones can't sell out because he can't control himself. I don't want to sell out.
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:39.080]  I want to absolutely crush the enemy. And that means I get blown up the process and
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:45.080]  ice picks brand through my eyeballs. That's fine. Because see I don't like pain. But I
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:50.920]  do like destroying love was even more than I do like. So I'm going to stop. I'm out of
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:55.360]  control. I apologize for those jokes. I'm not going to do it. I've been being much more
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:59.160]  family friendly. But it doesn't matter. I mean hell they're teaching five year olds
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:05.240]  most public schools to sit on big fat pedophiles laps. So you know when I suppose that TV stations
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:09.560]  are like you can't show this. This is a fat dude shaking his ass in front of a five year
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:15.000]  old. I'm like if they're doing it in schools. Yeah I understand. I remember when we first
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.960]  started exposing the pedophile drag queen story time like five years ago and people are
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:23.000]  like Alex it's not that big a deal. They're like whoa. It's it's at my library. It's
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.480]  at my school. What what the hell. They're like parachuting in fat dudes and clown outfits
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:34.680]  right now. Okay. I mean hell next segment the star witness of Robert Muller against
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:41.480]  Trump is that just got busted for you know what but like not everybody that looks like
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:48.640]  Ryan Stelter is a pedophile. Most of them are. Okay I'm going to stop. You know I am
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:53.880]  I am the energy level on the planet. It's really up right down. So you know that's happening
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:59.720]  and I just can't even cover news right now. That's what this comes down to. But the main
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:06.840]  reason I'm here is to tell you that I need funding just like a missile needs fuel and
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:13.480]  I will hit the enemy and I will destroy them with your help. But you got the best hunting
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:17.560]  dog around like I said. Sorry the segment. But if you got him in a kennel and you don't
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:24.120]  feed him and you don't give him water and you don't deflee him. He's just going to he's
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:28.800]  going to roll over and die. He's tough. He'll just go after one more and he'll be dead. Now
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:34.160]  now. Well frankly I'm not like a hunting dog. It's in really great shape. I'm getting a
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:37.440]  little bit better. You start to see a little bit of my ribs. And that's made us more lean
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:40.680]  and mean as fighting as a globalist even physically. I mean it's stronger under the
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:47.320]  attack. His spirit is so strong as the flesh is is is also willing but just not as strong
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:52.120]  as the spirit. And I'll just go back to it again. When you make the decision to spread
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.760]  the word about the broadcast and when you make the decision to pray for us and when
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:59.920]  you make the decision to buy the products it changes the whole world. We've already
[1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:06.160]  done it. You've already done it. And I say this every day because it's not patronization.
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:15.480]  It's not patting you on the head and you're employed. You you did this. And it's you the
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:19.600]  globalist. Hey they just don't like this focal point. So there's a sounding board of somebody
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:23.720]  saying what you're already thinking and saying what you're already wanting because we're
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:29.640]  in the same spirit. I mean we're we're jacked in. We are tied together. You could be black.
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:33.720]  You could be white. You could be old. You could be young. You love liberty. We're brothers.
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.560]  We're brothers in Christ. That's what the enemy hates. And that's why I'm not going
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:40.320]  to be a hypocrite. If I want to make a stupid joke about Bill Clinton I'm going to make
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:45.120]  it because I'm not a hypocrite. I'll go protest them killing babies and stop them killing
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:48.720]  babies. All those fake preachers tell you not to make a Bill Clinton monocle linsky
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:52.400]  joke. They're not going to be out there doing that because they're a bunch of Pharisees.
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:59.520]  The same type of people Christ beat with webs. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But soon
[1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:04.640]  you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground
[1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:10.040]  gopher. You need survivalist camps. The ultimate fully functional off the grid mobile survival

[1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:31.080]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:36.160]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:42.920]  Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken. Its former colony the U.S.
[1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:48.600]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:56.120]  with World War one. The United States of Empire by James Dunn available at Amazon books.

[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:02.600]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love all the other shows we do here. But I'll be
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:07.680]  honest with you. We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:12.200]  hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad.
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:16.960]  But here's the bottom line. We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face

[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:03.040]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times. I will never
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:10.400]  give in. I will never give up. But I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:16.280]  to see them committing all their crimes against humanity. To see evil running rampant like
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:23.080]  this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace. That most Americans
[1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:29.000]  have already been shadow banned by big tech. And to know that most Americans feel powerless
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:36.200]  and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about NewsWars.com,
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:41.200]  Infowars.com and Band.Video. And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:46.640]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at Infowars.com
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.880]  forward slash show and Band.Video. So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody
[1:19:51.880 --> 1:19:59.520]  to shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:08.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:08.520 --> 1:20:15.680]  The pedophile star witness of the Russell Grove has been arrested. We're going to play
[1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:21.440]  that special report here in just a few minutes. And then we've got some other really important
[1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:30.880]  special reports on the U.N. Caught. Caught. On video. Not just the low, low person at
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:37.640]  the head admitted that the vaccines are killing people, aren't tested and are deadly dangerous
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:43.640]  and that the majority of doctors are saying we don't buy this anymore. I've told you I've
[1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:50.560]  had four children. I've had them. My wife's have. But I've been there at the hospital.
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:55.400]  I've been to that experience and the doctors try to push it. The nurses don't take a damn
[1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:59.840]  thing. You know, we give these kids shots in the back and they freaking down us. And
[1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:04.880]  we got to get, we got to get the razor machines ready. The respirators on these premies when
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:08.560]  we get ordered by the bioethics border. Don't quote me. I'm like, no, I already know about
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:17.840]  it. I know, but the babies die. We get into them. You got to check into that.
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:24.120]  But that's going to a high end private hospital. I mean, it's not like caviar or something,
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:28.320]  but it's a big high end one of the biggest in the state is North Austin. And I was smarter
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:36.400]  to find a doctor for the first three that was a listener. He's retired now. But when
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:40.200]  you're with the doctor and they go to a Willie Nelson concert with you, they just start talking
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:45.280]  about all the stuff they've seen. So I mean, it's not like I'm just here to go, I'm making
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:51.440]  this stuff up. I go to Willie Nelson concerts and dump Shiner bought beers down the female
[1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:58.720]  doctor. And after about five beers, well, they start singing like a commanding. But
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:10.480]  I already know all that. My son had to go in the NICU. He was big. He was like 12 pounds.
[1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:15.840]  He was born about two weeks late. And of course, they didn't let him get mama's milk right
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:21.240]  away. They did their thing. And so his blood sugar went way down. And so they put him in
[1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:26.440]  the NICU. And so he's in the NICU about three days. I'm in there hoving around like a pop
[1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:31.200]  of eagle constantly. I mean, you talk about just the instincts kicking in your first
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:37.200]  born and they got all these wires and I was like, I wasn't thinking about how I was going
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:40.520]  to raid or rip people's heads off. I was just like on edge. And of course, they all know
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:44.920]  that they're used to parents dealing with that. But they're like, yeah, you're right to refuse
[1:22:44.920 --> 1:22:49.720]  the vaccine. So none of us take them. You know, when we give the babies the vaccines,
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:52.560]  when they're in the NICU, most of them are premies. I'm looking at little bitty babies,
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:23:00.040]  you know, we're like three pounds. They die. But we save them. We follow the orders. And
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:03.880]  then we and then I actually had the nurses on saying their names. They've been on the
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:08.320]  show with David Knight and Rob doing myself. I've interviewed whole groups of people in
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:17.720]  Ohio and Texas and Florida and Canada. NICU head nurses say their names and say they'll
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:23.240]  get the order to give 30, 40, 50 kids shots that are in the NICU and they'll die right
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:32.480]  there. And then I'm just supposed to sit here and take this crap as a human and not be pissed.
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:39.560]  The system is testing to see what they can get away with. It's not the doctors and nurses
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:43.760]  that are bad. It's testing. What will they do? How can we kill people right in front
[1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:47.240]  of them and convince the doctors to be covered up? It's like the Catholic Church, how they
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:50.600]  infiltrate it with pedophiles. They get one pedophile, they go, those will hurt the whole
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:54.480]  church, just shift them away. And then once they do that, well, if you if you try to stop
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.920]  us and don't do what we say politically, we'll expose you to that pedophile. It's the same
[1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:04.320]  thing. Once the doctors go, well, the vaccines are hurting people, but it's a greater good.
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:08.360]  So we have to cover up the bad, but it's not a greater good. And that's always evil to
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:15.480]  say, oh, it's the injustice. The means, man, that's how you spell Adolf Hitler. I mean,
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:22.840]  you know, once you start that, oh boy, it's just right down the fricking drain right there.
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:28.920]  So here's that report. And it's it's all coming up info wars.com news wars.com. It's a total
[1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:32.200]  act of revolution against the globalists even do it. Please pray for us by the time you're
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:36.520]  watching this all begin DC live coverage info wars.com. It's going to be totally insane.
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:40.760]  Oh, it's Reuters, Van Hernandez, myself. We're all about to get on a big jet airplane. We
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:44.760]  fly to Hollywood. We're flying to the swamp in Northern Virginia, where they hope to kick
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:48.200]  off the third revolution. We already had the revolution with Trump. We're already taking
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.360]  the world back with information. We don't want violence. We want peace. We want justice.
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:25:02.320]  We want Jesus Christ. In 1985, George Nader was charged with receiving child porn. The
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:08.640]  case was dismissed due to an invalid search warrant. And just a few years later, he was
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:16.320]  caught again. In 1991, he was convicted and given a six month sentence on a felony charge
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:23.360]  for transporting child pornography. Despite the earlier charge and later conviction, George
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:29.520]  Nader worked closely for the US government. He helped the George H W Bush administration
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.800]  free Americans who were being held hostage in Lebanon after the Iran contra affair.
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:42.560]  He unsuccessfully tried brokering an Israeli Syrian peace agreement for the Clinton administration.
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:50.800]  And since then, he has continued to volunteer for US politicians acting as a middleman,
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:54.640]  connecting American interests to his many Middle Eastern contexts.
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:02.080]  In 2003, he was convicted in the Czech Republic for sexually abusing 10 boys,
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:09.360]  for which he only served one year in prison before being expelled from the country.
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:16.320]  None of this seemed to affect his professional reputation with the US government.
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:25.600]  In May of 2016, George Nader, along with Andy Koadja and six others, began funneling money
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:31.200]  from the UAE and Saudi Arabia into the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:38.720]  Nader and his associates sent over 3.5 million to organizations supporting Hillary Clinton's
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:47.200]  2016 campaign for president. And after Clinton lost to Trump, they donated a million dollars
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:54.800]  to the Trump inauguration. Court documents reveal that Nader was continually reporting to an
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:01.680]  unnamed foreign nation. George Nader was considered a key witness in the Mueller investigation.
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:08.240]  And while being questioned by the FBI on behalf of special counsel Robert Mueller in January of
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:16.880]  2018, child pornography was incidentally found on one of his mobile phones. But it wasn't until
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:23.600]  June of 2019 when Nader was finally arrested. The charge was for possession and transportation
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:31.920]  of child pornography and images of bestiality. He was also charged with transporting a 14-year-old
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:41.040]  boy from Europe to his Washington home for sex. In January of 2020, Nader reached a plea deal
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:47.920]  with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of possession of child pornography and transportation
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:57.040]  of a minor. Prosecutors recommend the minimum penalty of 10 years and sentencing is scheduled
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:06.480]  for April of 2020. George Nader is not an anomaly. Let us not forget that in the past 20 years,
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:14.240]  more than $17 million of taxpayer money has been paid out in 260 settlements involving sexual
[1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:22.720]  assault committed by members of the U.S. Congress. Let us not forget Jeffrey Epstein, Bohemian Grove,
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:30.400]  and the Podesta emails. There are wolves among us, and whatever we decide to do about it,
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:46.320]  we'll get what we deserve. For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.

[1:29:56.400 --> 1:30:00.400]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it,
[1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:05.280]  except for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex. I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:08.400]  I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got
[1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:14.320]  to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people, Super Silver whitening toothpaste
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:19.520]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:24.640]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference, the game changer in
[1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:29.840]  this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the
[1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:34.480]  toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels
[1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:41.040]  so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:46.800]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way
[1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:47.440]  it feels.
[1:30:56.480 --> 1:31:01.840]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[1:31:01.840 --> 1:31:07.200]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:13.200]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:19.840]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experience
[1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:25.280]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:31.280]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:37.040]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:42.240]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:47.440]  activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:53.680]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a
[1:31:53.680 --> 1:31:58.960]  pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:05.920]  from InfoWars. Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist
[1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:10.800]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:17.360]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing
[1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:22.880]  as well. He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some
[1:32:22.880 --> 1:32:27.440]  other areas. But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China,
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:32.880]  Trump's been doing an amazing job. But now more than ever, we really have to realize that
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:39.520]  we're being targeted because we are effective. And the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:44.160]  against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:50.000]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:33:06.480]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:24.960]  This is Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News. I'm on the streets of Austin today to talk about
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:30.880]  this breaking story from infowars.com. Top U.N. scientists admits vaccines killing people during
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:36.480]  a vaccine safety summit. Now, this is a global summit that happened last month in Geneva, Switzerland
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:41.120]  where world leaders came forward to discuss vaccine safety and what vaccines really do
[1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:46.240]  within our bodies. Now, this is the chief scientist of the World Health Organization,
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:51.520]  and she even came forward and talked about how they can't talk to us about why vaccines are
[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:56.000]  killing people. They can't give people a specific answer. Now, we know that the anti-vax movement
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.360]  is one that was really stifled. Big tech silences them, and they're even silenced in the 3D world
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:05.360]  when they question vaccines, when they question their safety. So we're on the streets today to
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:10.240]  talk to people about that, show them this breaking video, and ask them if they think that the
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:14.800]  government should be forcing people to have vaccines all over our country, regardless of
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:18.640]  religious exemption, because we know that is something that has been pushed. So I'm asking
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:22.400]  people today what their opinion on vaccines are, if they have any comments on them.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:31.840]  I mean, I was always vaccinated growing up. I'm Mexican, so my mom's super hardcore on medication
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:36.560]  and stuff, so I was always vaccinated. I think it's kind of dumb when parents don't do it.
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:43.520]  You know, I, there's, those, now in age, those parents that like being, that vaccines are
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:47.120]  bad, but I think it's, I think it's putting your child at risk more.
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:50.400]  Oh, do you think that flu shots and vaccines are a good thing? Do you think that there's
[1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:54.560]  something that every American should get? Well, me, I ain't American. I'm a hypocrisy.
[1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:58.400]  Like, I come from the tribe of Judah. Like, America is really another slave trade, like
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:04.240]  Africa, and, and when we was in Africa, when Moses came in Frieders, but me, I just stay healthy,
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:09.040]  mentally, physically, spiritually, and healthy. I don't know. I just eat good. And you know,
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:14.160]  that said, but flu shots, I really don't even care about that because I live my life off of nature.
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:21.520]  Big fan of vaccines would not be here without them. I have not gotten my flu shot, actually. So
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:26.720]  I don't know. Maybe I'll get around to that, hopefully. I don't like vaccines because,
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:31.520]  because of what I hear, really, I hear that they're not healthy for us. So
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:37.040]  that's one of my reasons why I don't do vaccines. I am not an anti-vaxxer. I think those people are
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:44.240]  so ill informed. And I think a lot of it, they were listening to some actress that was positive
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:50.800]  of vaccines caused autism and that space on faulty research. I don't believe that vaccines are
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:54.880]  safe for us. Honestly, any natural herb that the God put on this land is the most safest
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:59.280]  and the most natural thing for us. I was reading this news article. It's a UN scientist. I actually
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.600]  have the video if you'd like to watch it. It's 50 seconds long, but she comes forward and says that
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:07.520]  there are deaths related to vaccines. There are long term effects that haven't been researched
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:12.640]  just yet, which I see the video. I guess you could say I'm kind of not very educated on
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:20.160]  the vaccines and what they do. So this is good. Let's watch this. Vaccines are very safe. If someone
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:27.440]  gets sick after vaccination, it is usually either a coincidence, an error in administering the
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:41.200]  vaccine or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself. We really don't have very good safety
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:47.360]  monitoring systems in many countries. And this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:52.400]  because we're not able to give clear cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:57.600]  have occurred due to particular vaccine. And this always gets blown up in the media. One should be
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:02.240]  able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:07.200]  deaths are. But in most cases, there's some obfuscation at that level. She's confirming
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:13.280]  what I just said, you know, that are not healthy for us. And I really don't do vaccines. I would
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:18.080]  take the echinacea, whatever you call it, that herb, you know, but that's about the best I can
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:23.440]  say about the vaccines. I just grew up thinking vaccines were a good thing. And obviously I'm
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:29.360]  not going to base anything off of that. But that just like that now is leading me to do more research.
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:35.440]  And now that intrigues me a little bit more about like research related to, research on deaths
[1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:42.000]  related to vaccines where, you know, a lot of people just, that's what they have grown up knowing
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:47.840]  best. So she just said to herself, oh, it's miscommunication that these vaccines aren't
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:51.600]  the best. We still have opening questions. So they let you know right now, she's just feeding you
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:56.480]  what she wants you to believe. It's not necessarily true. So I don't believe in vaccines. I'm all
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:02.400]  natural here. And I've raised my niece on my own the same way. So that's all I have to say for that.
[1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:06.880]  I'll be third out of living. I'll be doing that too. That's why I watch out what I eat,
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:11.280]  what I drink, you know what I'm saying? Because they putting a lot of stuff in the foods too.
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:16.960]  That's why you see the like the chicken wing, they be big and you see like young girls be too like
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:21.680]  oversized and they look like they're grown women, but they young. And that's because they be
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:28.560]  like parking like the food, they be shooting it up with stuff. They always, they've been doing that.
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:32.640]  That's just the system, the government system. Can I show you this video before you leave and
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:39.040]  get your response to it? No. I mean, if it has anything to do with everybody should be allowed
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:46.240]  to, to reject vaccines, I'm not interested because I am more educated than that. I have, I have seen
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:56.560]  what, what vaccinations can prevent. I was lucky enough that when my older sister and I and my
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:05.520]  brother all contracted polio, it happened before the sock vaccines came out in I think 1953-1954.
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:14.480]  We were lucky enough that my sister had a very mild case. I had a more profound case that
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:19.360]  week in my right side and my brother was in an iron line for nine months because he couldn't breathe.
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:27.840]  There, there may be a tiny minority that have negative results from vaccines, but the vast
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:34.320]  majority of vaccines save people. We oftentimes see vaccines in a very positive light. What about
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:39.040]  the times that scientists do come out? This is at the UN summit last month in
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.880]  Geneva, Switzerland. What do you think about these types of comments in terms of vaccine? Well, so I
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:49.760]  can't really say for sure because like I haven't done my research on vaccines or science as a whole
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:54.400]  and I think it's really a matter of like, are these people doing the same thing? So really,
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:58.880]  I can't give you like a straightforward answer on like what I think. I mean, like vaccines have
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:03.520]  worked for me. I mean, there's, you know, I, I can't cite anything for sure, but like I know
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.520]  there are vaccines that have worked, but as far as this, I don't know for sure. So the government
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:11.520]  is trying to get rid of religious exemptions for vaccines. What do you think about that?
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:19.520]  If you start exempting people, then you, you have this invisible community of people walking
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  around that, that can spread diseases. And this is really serious. This is basically trying to say
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:30.080]  that you're, you have to vaccinate yourself. That's not necessary to. Why would you vaccinate
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:34.400]  yourself if it's something like I stated earlier, if it's not something that you whole-heartedly
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:38.720]  believe in and you don't know the research behind it? I can tell you that jumping over the moon is
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:42.400]  the safest thing to do, but if you haven't done your research on something, don't follow up with
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:50.080]  what I'm saying. And that's what I have to say. That's only if, if, if it's going to benefit us,
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:54.960]  if it ain't, then you know. So the government says it's going to benefit us, but this science
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.360]  is saying that there's long-term health effects to vaccines, that there's some deaths related to
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:09.120]  vaccines. Well, me, I'm not taking nothing. Like I told you, if, if it's not nature. Do you think
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.960]  the government should force people to vaccinate themselves? No, I don't. How come? Because,
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:20.000]  I mean, it's up to you to teach his own, really, you know, but then I don't know. Some people
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.440]  have low immune system. So I don't know how that thing works, you know? I mean, I guess it's just
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:30.080]  a double-edged sword, you know, because a lot of times if you don't vaccinate yourself, you are more
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:39.120]  prone to whatever illness that you're trying to prevent, but there's also deaths related to vaccines.
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:43.520]  So I don't know. I guess you just never really know unless you try it.
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:50.320]  Well, folks, I would say today was a success. We got to show several people our video and
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.040]  not only that, but someone who has vaccinated their whole lives is now interested in looking
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:59.760]  up and researching vaccine-related deaths on their own time. It's so important that we get
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.000]  this information out because we all know that the mainstream media only feeds us positive
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.480]  information about vaccines. But what about when World Health Organization scientists come forward
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:14.240]  and say there's, there's long-term effects with vaccines, that there are deaths related to vaccines?
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.400]  We're not shown that in the mainstream media. So it's so important that we get this word out.
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:23.120]  So go to band.video to share this message, to share all the other exclusive reports
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.880]  about this. My name is Savannah Hernandez and this is Action7News.
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:55.600]  Don't forget to go to band.video and share this report.
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:00.240]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:07.760]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up. That's why
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:13.200]  it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:18.880]  they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should expect because
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:24.560]  we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:29.600]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:36.000]  suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:43.680]  not the wolves, but the sheet dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:51.200]  fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:58.560]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge. Hey, you there, we have a problem.
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:06.800]  You see, there is a baby. The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready. The father of
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:15.200]  this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother starts to have regrets. The father considers
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:23.280]  leaving town, but a friend says there's a solution. She says to have an abortion.
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:30.400]  The mother decides to look into it. The clinic assures her it's safe. She's made her decision.
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:36.960]  She's going to have an abortion. The problem is that baby is you.
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:46.960]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C.,

[1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:13.920]  Vaccines are very safe. If someone gets sick after vaccination it is usually either a coincidence
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:20.240]  or an error in administering the vaccine or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself.
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:27.680]  Please listen to me carefully. Millions of people have already had their lives ruined
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:35.120]  and many of them have died because of the information about the layout. And still millions
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:42.240]  more are facing that same fate. This information that I'm about to lay out that is just broken
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:51.040]  and this directly from the UN department running the operation admits that they are knowingly
[1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:59.680]  forcing vaccines worldwide when they are killing and maiming people en masse, when they are untested,
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:07.520]  unproven and known to be dangerous, and that the majority of doctors know they're dangerous
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:14.880]  and are about to go public. What you're about to witness is the beginning of them going public.
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.120]  They know what they're saying here and they're saying it because they know nothing can stop
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:26.720]  this information coming out now and it's far worse than they even say. You're about to see
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:33.360]  the head scientist at the World Health Organization admit that vaccines are killing people and that
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:39.760]  there's a cover-up. Then we're going to show you the directors of all the major programs at the UN
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:44.960]  admitting that the front line of doctors is wobbly and they don't think they're safe because
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:50.560]  they see what's happening, that people are being hurt and that they've been covering it up. There's
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:57.600]  a global crisis in confidence in vaccines because they've done it. So they need to start testing
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:03.840]  and find out if they're safe. Safe, effective, tested, none of that's true. It's being done by
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:11.600]  design. So I'll tell you the rest of the story after we play these clips. We really don't have very
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:18.320]  good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miscommunication and the
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:23.520]  misapprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:27.920]  the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media.
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:34.000]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:40.560]  of deaths are but in most cases there's some obfuscation at that level. The first accusation is
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:45.600]  it is the adjuvant and yet without adjuvants we are not going to have the next generation of
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:50.560]  vaccines and many of the vaccines that we do have, ranging from tetanus through to HPV,
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:57.120]  require adjuvants in order for them to work. I give courses every year on how do you develop
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:03.120]  vaccines, how do you make vaccines and the first lesson is while you're making your vaccine if you
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:10.400]  can avoid using an adjuvant please do so. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity in many
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:20.000]  instances and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidents
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:27.040]  of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen but may not have been detected through
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:32.320]  lack of statistical power in the original study. The major health concern which we are seeing
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:39.920]  are accusations of long-term effects and again as you mentioned pre-licensure clinical trials
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:45.760]  may not be powered enough. It's also the subject population that you administer the
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:54.080]  adjuvant to because we've seen data presented to us where an adjuvant, a particular adjuvant,
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:51:00.240]  added to a vaccine and the adjunct did really nothing when administered to a certain population
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:07.600]  and it's usually the elderly compared to administering the same formulation to younger
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:14.160]  age strata. So these are things which need to be considered as well and further complicate
[1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:18.800]  safety and effectiveness evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens.
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:25.360]  Where at six weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks a child is being given different antigens from different
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:31.360]  companies and these vaccines have different adjuvants, different preservatives and so on.
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:38.320]  Something crosses my mind. Is there a possibility of these adjuvants, preservatives, cross-reacting
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:45.840]  amongst themselves? Have they ever been a study on the possibility of cross-reactions
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:48.720]  from the panel members that you can share the experience with us?
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:56.400]  We have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:03.600]  and the safety of vaccines. When the frontline professionals are starting to question or they
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:12.000]  don't feel like they have enough confidence about the safety to stand up to it to the person asking
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:18.080]  them the questions. I mean most medical school curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:22.080]  in medical school you're lucky if you have a half day on vaccines.
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:28.960]  What you just saw is only a small sampling of the historic meeting with the UN convened
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:34.400]  an emergency summit in Switzerland with their top scientists to try to figure out what's
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:40.240]  happening and how to respond to the public's awakening to what's happening. And then of
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:44.960]  course Big Pharma with its horrible history of corruption is given liability protection
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:50.160]  for the damage caused with the vaccines and they go on the news and tell us vaccines never hurt
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:56.320]  anybody. It's a conspiracy theory. Arrest everybody that criticizes it. Take the children away from
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:53:01.840]  them. I've had hundreds of scientists on medical doctors, you name it, exposing all of this over
[1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:08.080]  the years. So we're not learning anything new here but it's the UN admitting that there's a loss of
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:13.760]  confidence globally by the medical community and that there's been a cover-up and they don't know
[1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:21.840]  what to do. They say they haven't studied what they have. Big Pharma uses the UN and other governments
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:28.400]  as the enforcers of this but as you heard the UN say they've never done a study and they don't
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:33.440]  have a study on the effects of adjuvants but they clearly see what they're doing and top scientists
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:38.640]  say you shouldn't even use adjuvants. We know they're causing autoimmune responses. We know
[1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:43.680]  they're causing autoimmune diseases. He uses fancy terms for allergic responses and autoimmune disease
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:48.800]  but that's what he's saying but not in words that you know or that I know in general that will
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:54.720]  scare us. So they're up there talking in code because they're there trying to cover their ass
[1:53:54.720 --> 1:54:00.000]  but those that are really guilty are big pharma because the adjuvants are only one part of this.
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:07.600]  When you have a live anthrax vaccine and they say well it's genetically engineered to be not
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:10.880]  as harmful and then it kills a bunch of people that are administered it. That's what happened
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:16.960]  where you have the new approved Ebola vaccine. That's live Ebola but it's been genetically
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:22.800]  engineered they say to not harm you. Should we go over all the problems there or what trojan
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:27.360]  horses have been loaded in on purpose or by accident? It just goes on and on from there.
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:33.520]  So vaccines we think of just learning immunity to something. That's a real technology. It has
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:38.480]  risk but it's done a lot of amazing things. We're talking about all these other sciences rolled in
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:44.640]  to vaccines. Genetic engineering you name it being put into us via these vaccines that big pharma is
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:52.080]  is testing us like guinea pigs with and we see the response. Massive deaths massive neurological
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:59.120]  problems incredible levels of cancer increases and the inserts admit that but there is a sickening
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:04.640]  silver lining to this giant black cloud of evil and that's that the damage and the death and the
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:12.080]  carnage is so huge from vaccines and vaccine related technologies that they can't cover it
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:18.320]  up anymore and people are pissed and they know what's going on and the dam is breaking. Dr Wakefield
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:22.880]  did those studies more than 20 years ago proving that antibodies from the MMR shot were in the
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:28.240]  intestines of these autistic children. Since then a whole bunch of other studies have been done
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:34.480]  confirming his research but the media targeted him and said that he was a fraud when he was never
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:40.080]  proven to be a fraud and those that made up the fraud have since been exposed but that's what
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:47.920]  they do to trailblazers that try to warn the people. The big takeaway here is back in the mid-80s
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:52.320]  the United States passed a multi-billion dollar act to put billions of dollars a year into a
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:59.040]  secret fund to pay people who are damaged by vaccines but they believe that only about one
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:04.320]  percent of those damaged even know about the fund and ever get to the fund through the reporting
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:11.120]  agency and then jump through the hoops to get the aid they need. Think about that. They set up
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:16.080]  giant vaccine damage funds that operate in secret but they tell you they're safe and effective and
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:22.160]  then it's a conspiracy that anybody ever got hurt and the very same UN head scientist puts out a video
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:27.760]  last year saying vaccines are totally safe and effective never hurt anybody but then she's in
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:32.320]  a meeting with her colleagues admitting they've covered everything up. This is scandal beyond
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:37.680]  scandal. This is all of our lives we're talking about and only you can make sure the story gets
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:44.400]  out and is forced to break worldwide and really bring down this giant hoax that is medical tyranny
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:49.600]  through Big Pharma being given total liability protection to operate however they want and
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:54.080]  do whatever they want a recipe for absolute medical Armageddon.
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:57:03.760]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:08.480]  maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:11.840]  tried. He's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:18.640]  and tell me. So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:23.680]  toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:28.720]  and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:34.080]  because after I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:39.840]  like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:48.320]  like good things are happening in my mouth. With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our

[1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:52.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:56.480 --> 2:00:02.960]  future historians will look back and try to come up with a name for this epoch in which we live this
[2:00:02.960 --> 2:00:10.640]  era and I think the name may be the era of treason we now live in a time when every major
[2:00:10.640 --> 2:00:16.240]  institution that runs our culture runs our news that runs our technology infrastructure that runs
[2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:23.200]  our government every institution is engaged in treason and by that I mean a deliberate attempt
[2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:29.680]  to overrule and overthrow the will of the people even in a society where government is supposed to
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:37.600]  be an extension of the people by the people and for the people it's the people the body politic
[2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:44.640]  from which all government power is supposed to spring and yet today we are now living as
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:52.240]  subjects ruled over by these institutions engaged in treason it's big tech with the
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:58.320]  politically motivated censorship shutting off all the channels and all the voices that love america
[2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:04.720]  that want to defend due process and the constitution and even our duly elected president it's the
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:10.880]  treason in the media that is complicit in covering up the heinous crimes of jeffrey abstein involving
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:18.880]  the clintons the pedophilia rings the child rape and sex trafficking the news is admittedly covered
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:27.920]  up by abc news anchor amy robach and others cnn is not just fake news cnn is treason the new york
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:34.480]  times the washington post fabricating fake anonymous sources to try to smear president trump with a
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:41.600]  false narrative of russia collusion or ukraine collusion or anything they want to nitpick it
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:47.280]  is treason and it's not just the media and it's not just big tech it's well the government itself
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:54.800]  the deep state the embedded bureaucrats in the regulators in the administration the bureaucracy
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:02:02.640]  itself has become engaged in treason fighting just for their survival at the expense of liberty
[2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:09.120]  and freedom and truth and justice now we see the bureaucracy focuses entirely on just protecting
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:15.920]  itself even if it means violating the laws the rules the spirit of the law violating the will
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:21.600]  of the people violating the constitution whatever it takes they are now willing to do it the very
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:27.840]  people that have been put into power are now abusing that power and destroying our nation
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:34.400]  from within and when there's an uprising as happened at the ballot box in 2016 with the
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:42.480]  election of donald trump the uprising is attacked the people are called deplorables and your choice
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:49.680]  of a president is viciously smeared daily even hourly with a coordinated narrative rollout
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:56.640]  from adam schiff with his fake transcripts and selectively edited words from secret testimony
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:02.400]  held in underground bunkers with zero transparency and zero due process it's all a coordinated
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:08.160]  smear campaign to destroy the president that the people elected to the highest office in our nation
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:15.120]  so we now live in a system where we the people have a gun to our heads figuratively speaking
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:21.520]  by the government to take our money so that they can continue to fund their treason against us we
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:28.320]  the people and the nation that we built and they now through their actions openly admit that they
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:35.040]  do not believe voters should ever be allowed to decide who gets to run america that is offensive
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:40.720]  to them that the people have a voice at all and if they have any say in these matters they're going
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:47.520]  to do everything within their power to nullify the voice of the people to crush independent thinking
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:53.520]  and independent voices voices of dissent which are the most important voices for establishing
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:04:01.440]  and protecting liberty those voices will be ostracized to make sure that no one listens to
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:06.880]  the most important voices of our time the voices that reflect the very ethics and morality of the
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:12.800]  founding fathers of this nation that's who gets censored by google and the tech giants have become
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:18.960]  so arrogant that they've decided they not only no longer want your input they don't want your voice
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:25.680]  they despise it and they're going to do everything in their power to veto your voice to silence your
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:32.400]  ideas and to make sure that you never have a say again in any election if they have their way the
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:38.400]  elitists they will make sure that every future president is appointed by the deep state to cover
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:45.440]  up all of their crimes to cover up their shortcomings to cover up their conspiracies to make sure
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:51.840]  that the deep state gets to choose who runs the country that is the age of treason under which we

[2:06:14.160 --> 2:06:18.800]  senator john de camp was cited even by his enemies at the world herald it's one of the most effective

[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:43.760]  the way to washington dc and a 40 million was missing and they found out satanism child abuse
[2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:50.160]  mind control and it dovetails with bohemian grove senator de camp thank you for joining us today
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:55.120]  you'll also be on the nighttime show wednesday from nine to midnight can you uh break it down for
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:07:01.040]  folks this this wild story that's so that's so documented and so shocking uh huh break it down
[2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:06.480]  yeah i'll uh try to touch on uh some of the important things let you just ask your your
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:11.840]  questions i did and it's what you were saying just before uh before we hooked up here you were talking
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:17.760]  about the second amendment some of the things there i'm working on uh maybe we'll get into it later
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:24.080]  in the show uh what may or may not be kind of a ashley and internationally significant uh
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:31.200]  a case involving uh students killed at columbine uh some of those there in terms of filing a
[2:07:31.840 --> 2:07:37.120]  really no new approach on the action you know there were more guns by far back when i was a
[2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:41.920]  kid we used to all all go to school with a rifle in the back of our pickup and nobody was shooting
[2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:46.720]  anybody so there's got to be another factor and uh it's called mind control we've proven that at
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:51.600]  columbine yeah i've got an interesting interesting approach on that and i'll i'll talk to you about
[2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:55.520]  that maybe later if we have time but you're talking about franklin the franklin credit union
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:08:01.760]  on election day 1988 it was closed down it was the little minority credit union in north uh
[2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:07.280]  oboha that serves the minority community was run by man named larry king larry king out the one
[2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:13.360]  on tv and radio today but a uh black man named larry king larry was uh god he was a big guy about
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:20.080]  300 he was 350 pounds but he was big and uh he was one other thing he was uh officially listed in
[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:26.160]  the part pages of the new york times washington post all those things as the fastest rising
[2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:33.760]  black star in the republican party in fact uh here at houston i was at the dallas republican
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:39.440]  national convention in 1984 i believe it was i was number one vote-gitter republican pledge to
[2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:46.800]  whoever we had at that time honey regan or somebody anyway and uh then i was at the 1988
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:50.720]  convention uh once again i was number one vote-gitter pledge to uh i think it was
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:57.360]  um gorge bush at that time but anyway at both of those conventions larry king of the black man
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:01.200]  i'm talking about was the man who opened the conventions believe it or not he opened by
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:08.160]  singing the national anthem uh know how they have somebody sing he was the one selected to sing it
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:14.800]  that's there anyway larry on election day his credit union in oma honda brasska was rated
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:20.000]  senator uh continuing break it down what you discovered what happened this larry king fellow
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:24.480]  this fast-growing rising black star in the republican party uh and what exactly developed
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:28.560]  and what you found out from there well so comes election day they raid the credit union stories
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:32.800]  start filtering out you know mike always happens in one of these deals where there's a secret set
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:37.600]  of books and blah blah blah but that wasn't that wasn't the problem hell every other credit union was
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:44.720]  s and l back then in the late 80s uh was having trouble remember and we ended up spending billions
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:54.160]  for one in uh arizona and enver and all over what next happened was strange stories started
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:58.400]  filtering out onto the street from from young kids they were that well yeah they knew larry king
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:04.960]  uh they wrote on larry's private jet washington and and uh i had this great party and they were at
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:11.200]  these parties uh no wonder he was so popular yeah anyway and and then the stories turned a little
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:15.600]  more sinister and they were that these kids were there to provide sex for an important
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:20.640]  businessman or politicians and i'm not talking about mature kids i'm talking about from anywhere
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:25.760]  from seven or eight or nine up to about 12 13 14 young boys particularly uh some young girls but
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:30.880]  well barney frank's been caught with 13 and 14 year old boys well these kids identified barney
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:34.320]  is one of the people at the parties by the way he's mentioned in my book among others but anyway
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:39.520]  and that was before your book came out before he got caught a few years ago uh when did he get caught
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:46.320]  about five years ago yeah well my book came out named him way back then and the book first came
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:53.600]  out the first edition was 1991 there's been a completely revised edition twice second uh
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:57.920]  they're all part of the book almost a double book because you have the first book that was printed
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:01.840]  and the second one which i call kind of the mini miracles the events that have occurred since
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:06.400]  then that prove one after another the things in the first book i can give you some examples but
[2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:12.240]  just to get quickly that's the book i read your part two go ahead okay anyway so uh stories come
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:17.040]  out that these kids are doing these things and uh i was fairly prominent at that time
[2:11:17.840 --> 2:11:22.240]  so i'm kind of controversial more than a little but i i was one of the first ones that came out
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:27.680]  and stated that that this all had to be nonsense but these had to be fantasy stories that somebody
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.720]  was making them up that that uh you couldn't believe that somebody like so-and-so or so-and-so
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:39.440]  without having sex with kids and blah blah blah and i said uh i just don't believe it and if i
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:43.040]  really believed it i'd be the first one to try to do something about it well i have you were
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:48.160]  quoted in the paper saying oh yeah yeah because i was one of the ones that said you know this is
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:55.520]  nonsense so i got a letter from a kidney locked up in an Omaha jail and he said look i know you
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:59.680]  don't believe any of this but if you just come talk to me at least let me show you some things i'd
[2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:04.000]  i sure like to do it well i thought what the heck so i went over there to the jail there was a kid
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:09.520]  named paul binas locked up in jail there his terrible crime he was 17 or 18 at the time had
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:14.080]  been that he had touched his cousin on the outside of his pants supposedly and i thought well that's
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:21.760]  a little strange to be locked up in jail and go on because of that but uh i listened to his story
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:27.680]  and he started providing me details of specific times and places and events and i hate to stop you
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:32.480]  senator didn't he mention uh need to put this in in the first edition but later editions a bizarre
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:37.520]  place in northern california big redwoods and a large stone owl oh bohemian grove he not only
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:41.760]  mentioned but he's been there and they've participated in all kinds of unbelievable i've
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:46.320]  seen hard things there yes what did he say without getting too lurid uh developed there i mean when
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:50.320]  he told you that story well i know this is going to sound unbelievable so i didn't even want to
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:56.560]  touch on it but uh one of the claims was uh he'd actually uh participated or been forced to kind of
[2:12:56.560 --> 2:13:05.120]  participate in an incident where uh three young boys including himself were forced to have sex and
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:10.720]  then in front of a group of people and then uh one of the boys was actually literally killed there
[2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:18.480]  and how was he killed in this particular case i believe uh i recall i don't think i even have
[2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:22.640]  this in the book i'm giving you this maybe it isn't the book i can't remember everything but uh
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:26.640]  this particular case after he was forced to do various things i think they they
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:33.920]  simply went up and held a gun to his head or something and he described a large stone owl oh
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:39.680]  yeah yeah sir did you know that i snuck in there uh with maps and the hidden sources uh with the
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:44.720]  help of the national british media and that they have all the footage of it no i did not know that
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:50.640]  i do know that uh he's described it in some detail he was there more than once he was taken
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:54.960]  there and some of the people there whose names if i mentioned some of them you'd instantly
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:00.000]  recognize some of our most prominent people in this country were strange event there but
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:06.480]  if the fairly you probably know that if you were there it's a fairly fairly well known uh
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:16.160]  very well guarded uh very private secret place uh with access only by those who are permitted to go
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:22.480]  there it's a 2700 acre redwood grove and a gorge with one entrance with big cliffs on each side
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:26.720]  backed up on the russian river with the cliffs up high above it and they have surveillance cameras
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.400]  everywhere secret service sheriff's department they had murder investigations with dead children
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:34.560]  they found in 83 the sonoma county sheriff's department investigation and didn't find anything
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:38.560]  of course they were running security when i was there and i snuck right through their first two
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:42.720]  checkpoints got on one of the buses and got brought into the third main checkpoint was there for
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:48.000]  four hours it goes on for 14 days i saw priest in red and black robes worshiping a mohawk of the
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:52.480]  old testament yep that's exactly what the boy describes they brought in a bound a bound human
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:58.000]  sacrifice and burned it on the altar telling the crowd it was an effigy and i i have been into the
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  equivalent of eyes wide shut sir and i had video of it good and uh the boy uh boy who provided me
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:08.720]  all this information wasn't crazy huh pretty big been crazy but it was the information was acting
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:14.480]  yes that's just how he describes it he was there so paul bonacci uh now grown up this is in the
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:18.800]  early 90s or late 80s he's telling you these stories uh what was compelling about it i mean
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:22.320]  you've been in the paper saying this stuff wasn't real and then you go investigate what happened
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:27.440]  no i'll shut up here here was the trick first of all the psychiatrist they they had brought in
[2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:31.120]  a psychiatrist to check him out because they needed to say he was crazy they needed to say
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:36.640]  it was crazy because of the stories he was telling that involved specific names specific places
[2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:42.400]  so on and so forth uh the psychiatrist to examine him came up with the conclusion he's
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:47.440]  multiple personality but the one characteristic about multiple personalities is that they
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:51.840]  generally are telling the truth because all they have to do is switch personalities they
[2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:56.960]  don't have to lie they simply move attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've ever

[2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:24.160]  time the last six months on the radical muslim celebrating not just in new jersey but new york
[2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:29.280]  palestine all over what do you have to say they're still attacking you though we've got dan rather
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:34.560]  on video we've got new york post we've got washington post what's going on here well i took a lot of
[2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:39.360]  heat and i was very strong on it and i held my line and then all of a sudden you know hundreds of
[2:23:39.360 --> 2:23:44.080]  people were calling up my office i was the other day in sarasota florida and people are online and
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:49.440]  we had 12 000 people which is fantastic and the people were saying many of the people from new
[2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:54.960]  jersey four or five people said mr trump i sought myself i was there they talked about patterson
[2:23:54.960 --> 2:23:59.840]  but they said i sought myself mr trump i was there so i knew it happened and i held my line and
[2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:05.280]  people wanted me to apologize and uh we can't do that people like you and i can't do that so easily
[2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:09.840]  now we can do it if we're wrong alex you apologize i'd apologize if i was wrong but
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:14.160]  they were celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the world trade center i think that's
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:19.520]  disgraceful it is and that same week you were reporting on that fact we had two different
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:24.800]  international football games soccer games with the turkish fans and others during the moment
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:32.160]  of silence for the dead people in in paris chanting a la oct bar and booing so did that not happen too
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:36.400]  well that happened and everybody saw it that was a week ago and the players were out on the field
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:39.520]  and they couldn't believe it they were embarrassed they didn't know what to do the coach and the
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:44.320]  managers they all apologized but it happened look we have to deal with reality and you know it all
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:48.960]  started because they said we need surveillance we need proper surveillance we have people that
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:54.480]  truly are evil and they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from at
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:58.880]  least the vicinity and i said we need proper surveillance because we're not going to have a
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:03.120]  country anymore between the weak borders that we have the pathetic and weak borders where
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:07.120]  politicians are afraid to do anything about it and our number one problem is what's going on
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:10.880]  where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country that's our number one
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:16.480]  problem it's now in mainstream news associated press and others are reporting that it's a secret
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:23.600]  deal with turkey with the germans with merkel the admitted socialist to bring in millions
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:29.200]  of radical islamists they admit almost all of them are sunni that basically invaded syria
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:33.440]  they're getting their butt kicked by the russians so now they want to flee up to the north into
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:39.040]  turkey you said months ago bomb the oil of isis and the in the mainstream media laugh because
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:44.160]  you said the sky was blue again now the pentagon says that's the right thing to do and now you've
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:51.280]  come out saying quote uh it looks like uh that turkey's on the side of isis closed quote well
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:57.280]  that the next day the russians released satellite photos documenting that there are literally thousands
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.640]  of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals connected to eargun the president's
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:09.200]  son making billions of dollars total off of this again you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:13.520]  well i was right about that i was right in saying in a book that i wrote you covered it really nicely
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:19.040]  i appreciate it but i wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000 the america we deserve
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:23.760]  and i said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named osama bin lad and i mean i
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:27.920]  really study this stuff i really find it very interesting and i wrote in the book 2000 two
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:31.360]  years before the world trade center came down i talked about osama bin lad and you better take
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:36.480]  him out i said he's going to crawl under a rock you better take him out and now people are seeing
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.600]  that the saying you know trump predicted osama bin lad which actually is true and then two years
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:45.600]  later a year and a half later he knocked down the world trade center with the oil and i'm glad you
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:49.280]  brought it up but as you know for three years i've been saying you better take out the oil because
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:54.080]  if you don't take the oil it's going to be a problem so we shouldn't have been in iraq but once we
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:27:00.800]  got there the way osama the way we came out was was horrible and i said take the oil then we didn't
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:05.040]  take the oil so isis got the oil and as you know iran is getting the oil because iran is going to
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:10.000]  take over all of iraq you know we we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:16.080]  when we gave them 150 billion dollars and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons the more i
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:22.160]  research what you've actually said and done it's amazing you were the only leading american figure
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:28.960]  who openly said do not go to war in iraq they had almost what 90 votes in congress for it bipartisan
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:34.240]  you said don't do it iran will take over uh you said i mean look you can say that today and everybody
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:40.720]  can say that but you said that in 2001 2002 2003 when it was very unpopular because you've done
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:45.600]  your research and had good advisors how did you know that when almost no one else did i have to
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:48.960]  tell you have to know if you're gonna go to war you have to do it properly and you have to know
[2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:54.800]  what to do i viewed it as this iran and iraq were the same in terms of strength and they'd had they
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:59.360]  constantly fighting that's all they do is they fight right they go to war all the time and they'd
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:04.160]  move 10 feet left 10 feet right 10 feet left then they'd rest and then they've started again four years
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:11.040]  like this has been gone on for forever forever and this is the way it is i said if you take out iran
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:15.920]  or if you take out iraq either one you're gonna destabilize the middle east well we took out iraq
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:21.440]  and by the way iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world people don't even know that
[2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:26.160]  and i said and you'll know this and you know this and i appreciate what you just said uh
[2:28:26.160 --> 2:28:31.760]  then iran is going to come in and iran is going to take over iraq and they they're just taking it
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:36.960]  over right now as we speak they're taking it over iran is running iraq and very soon we'll be virtually
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:42.800]  going to be totally running iraq so i said keep the oil and i said if you're gonna leave you
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:46.320]  shouldn't have gone in but they shouldn't have they should have left soldiers behind like 20
[2:28:46.320 --> 2:28:57.280]  thousand or certain number of soldiers attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted

[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:11.680]  huge sale with historically low prices on our ppx microgrid system that's going to let you produce
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:16.560]  an endless supply of electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the history
[2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:20.560]  flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding we've
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:25.120]  had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:29.920]  warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:34.640]  know the floodwaters backstory so here's what you should do right now check out the ppx microgrid
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:41.200]  system at my own power grid dot com that's my own power grid dot com over a thousand dollars in great
[2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:46.240]  off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too and the best part you're not going to pay 750 or 500

[2:29:55.040 --> 2:30:02.000]  it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:08.960]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:17.440]  right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still by concentration
[2:30:17.440 --> 2:30:24.000]  camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections it
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:28.720]  doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada in europe show that when you
[2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:34.160]  take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your
[2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:40.240]  immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's
[2:30:40.240 --> 2:30:47.600]  mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the
[2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:53.040]  giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now
[2:30:53.040 --> 2:30:59.040]  you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush some skulls politically you want to

[2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:34.640]  you see we have to make the effort 110 god will finish the move and i know i need to stay in the

[2:32:37.120 --> 2:32:43.120]  but i had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses
[2:32:43.120 --> 2:32:49.440]  uh and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud

[2:32:57.040 --> 2:32:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:04.640 --> 2:33:09.040]  if you're going to leave take the oil and i've said it then they left they didn't take the oil
[2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:14.080]  so ice has got the oil iran is getting the oil everybody's getting everything but us so we lost
[2:33:14.080 --> 2:33:18.720]  thousands of soldiers we spent two trillion dollars in iraq we have wounded warriors who i
[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:23.120]  love all over the place and what do we get out of it else we had nothing we had nothing so the
[2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:26.720]  french and the germans are getting the oil and the iranians are getting the oil and you know who
[2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:32.400]  the number one customer for the oil is guess what china right smart is china they are smart
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:38.000]  us on every level militarily they are smart us on trade you're a top business guy you know on your
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:45.280]  own from nothing how did china get 97 percent of rare earth in uh uh minerals in the world how is
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:48.720]  the united states or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what goes
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:53.920]  to the smartphones the computers trillions is made a year how did we just give them the global market
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:58.320]  in that that's crazy well what a lot of people don't know afghanistan now afghanistan is a place
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:02.080]  we can go in because you know you have pakistan and you have nuclear weapons and a lot of things
[2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:08.160]  going on there but we go into afghanistan we're fighting you know tremendous mountains and ridges
[2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:13.120]  we're fighting on one side and you know who's got their excavators on the other side china looking
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:18.240]  out all the minerals you know afghanistan nobody knew this afghanistan is rich with minerals not
[2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:24.160]  oil but minerals everything and china is taking out all the minerals and here we are fighting we
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:28.720]  have trillions we're about like a trillion dollars in afghanistan and we get nothing out of it and
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:32.960]  we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that we
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:38.720]  get nothing china is taking out the minerals they're the they're the buyers the big buyers at very
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:44.720]  very low prices of as you know of the oil in iraq and probably in syria but china is a big buyer
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:49.360]  of the oil but one thing with the oil it's sort of because you've covered it for three years i've
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:54.240]  been saying hit the oil because isis is getting strong and they're no jv as the president said
[2:34:54.240 --> 2:35:00.080]  and they're certainly not contained but i said hit the oil and hit them hard and they left at me
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:04.800]  and they would put generals on television saying no that strategy wouldn't work well after paris
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:09.680]  they started hitting the oil and it does work the problem is we've given them a two-year edge
[2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:13.840]  they have billions of dollars the russians started hitting the oil for one month and isis is already
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:19.360]  rolling over so putin is following your your strategy you know that i'm a pretty well two years
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:24.240]  ago alex that's the only problem donald trump joined us live can you speak to as president what
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:29.120]  your relationship would be with foreign leaders and and and what you know about uh vladimir putin
[2:35:29.120 --> 2:35:33.600]  because all i know is why are we starting a fight with russia when they're not doing anything to us
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:37.520]  i think i get along great with people i mean i will probably get along well with him and if i
[2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:42.480]  don't somebody else will and who knows you know he's a difficult cookie he's tough and he's smart
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:47.600]  i think i'd get along very well with him i think it's too fine look here's the thing we lose with
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:52.080]  every country and yet we don't get along with any countries china is killing us everybody's killing
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:57.600]  us china is just beating us to a pulp and trade japan mexico is killing us and yet we don't get
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:01.680]  along with anybody with me they're not going to get so rich believe me they're not going to get so
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.760]  rich at all we're going to take back our jobs we're going to take back our manufacture we take
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:12.880]  back our base but they'll like us more than they do now sort of amazing you definitely have have
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:17.600]  shown your knowledge of geo political systems hillary and others have been demonizing you for
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:23.520]  saying radical muslim celebrated on 9 11 but she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got
[2:36:23.520 --> 2:36:29.200]  shot at in bosnia in the air on the ground they have video that all none of it happened she admits
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:33.440]  she lied if you did that you'd be done but you wouldn't do something like that you don't steal
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:38.880]  glory from our veterans but they demonize you for made-up scandals every day trying to see what'll
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:44.240]  stick and he got hillary involved in Benghazi you've got him involved in everything and people
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:48.720]  love you for tough talk is it not time for impeachment hearings against obama i mean what
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:54.000]  do we do politically to really try to prosecute hillary clinton well you remember this the the
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:58.880]  best thing that we have going with obama is he's got a year left okay because you know by the time
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:03.680]  you do the hearings and everything i i don't make him a martyr in a way you'll make him a martyr
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:07.840]  but i don't even say that you know one of the things i'm the most disappointed in republicans
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:10.960]  because they go to washington they're going to do all this stuff they're going to impeach obama
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:15.120]  they're going to end obama care which has to be ended it's a desire i don't know if you've seen
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:19.840]  the premiums they're going to it's killing everything five 55 percent it's it's it you know
[2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:26.720]  it's going to implode anyway in 17 2017 obama care blows up it's over i mean it's over and everybody
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:31.120]  knows it and they're doing big stories even the ones that were for it are saying uh-oh this
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:36.080]  isn't working well the premiums are a disaster and if you look at anything having to do with
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:41.360]  obama care right now it's over but the problem with the republicans is they'll try and fix it
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:46.640]  they'll try instead of get rid of it and we can come up with a phenomenal plan that's much better
[2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:51.920]  for the people the people are getting killed with that so there's so many things to do alex we will
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:57.680]  do such a good job there's so many fronts a number will will win on trade we're going to strengthen
[2:37:57.680 --> 2:38:01.440]  our military we're going to take care of our vets we're going to get rid of obama care we're going
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:05.840]  to do so many things there's so many things that can be done but we have to use our good people
[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:10.960]  you know everybody running against me in terms of even the republican side and hillary certainly
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:15.040]  they're all controlled by their donors and their special interests and the lobbyists sir
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:18.640]  i'm putting up my own money i'm funding my own campaign nobody's going to control me
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:23.360]  i'm going to do what's right for you and for the american people listen i get it i mean you are a
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:28.080]  true maverick i understand you know you've made tens of millions of dollars you've hired tens of
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:32.240]  thousands of people i mean i would imagine that as you've gotten older correct me if i'm wrong
[2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:36.480]  because i know you talked about wanting to serve america decades ago really all it comes down to
[2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:40.240]  is wanting to have a free country for your children and grandchildren and that's where i want to come
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:44.880]  to this point next because i know you're smart sir and i know that you also though you don't
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:49.600]  dumb your message down but you keep it at a mid level so the general public and the establishment
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:56.960]  as well can get it but let's get down to brass tacks i routinely talk to the top generals special
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:39:03.120]  forces pentagon currently out of the pentagon cia as i know you do and we'll just leave it at that
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:08.240]  there are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country
[2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:12.160]  they really know that we've reached the crossroads where the country's done is the third world nation
[2:39:12.160 --> 2:39:16.800]  within a few more years forget donald trump in four years if this happens we're done i mean we're
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:21.040]  talking about resurrecting the dead here we could turn it around right now as you've said properly
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:25.040]  you're dead on sir you're right we could turn it around all the actuaries all the numbers show it
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:28.880]  but it's got to happen the next few years or we're done right and there are globalists that
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:34.000]  want to have a world government a system run by select crony capitalist using socialism at the
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:38.400]  grassroots to make people dependent and i've talked to not just high-level folks that have been in
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:43.120]  government that are on your team but separately high-level people in government currently that
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:48.160]  say there's an internal war going on and that you're a manifestation of that i know now from
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:52.960]  top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:57.840]  what you're doing is epic it's george washington level and you understand that office you speak
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:01.200]  about the war for the soul of this country that's happening right now and really tell people what's
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:06.640]  happening and commit to people that you won't ross perot under death threats and step down
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:12.320]  when you're in the lead uh two months from the election okay so let me just tell you elx as you
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:17.200]  know i'm leading in every poll nationally in every poll state i'm leading an i would new hampshire
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:23.680]  south carolina the scc texas i'm leading in texas which i love i love texas you know we were there
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:27.360]  mark cuban called up he said do you want to use the arena user we filled it up in three or four
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:35.600]  days 20 000 people in mobil alabama we had 35 000 people we had 20 000 in oklahoma i'm so into this
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:39.920]  and i'm not into a far you know i could do other things that i would enjoy doing to be honest with
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:44.480]  no you're doing a dangerous mission we understand that it's not an easy thing but the key is make
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:48.880]  america great again we can make america great again but if you have to suffer through four more or
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:53.360]  eight more years of what's gone on in the past and you know what's going on it's just we're being
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:41:00.560]  eaten away it's just eat it's eating away at our country and we can make in my opinion we can make
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:06.000]  america greater than ever before but we have to get going it has to happen we have to get going
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:12.320]  and you know when you look at the vision i said iraq you agreed with me on iraq i said hit the oil
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:17.840]  i said a lot of things that turned out to be true 100 true and i'm giving credit i'm giving credit
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:22.080]  by some people some people refuse to acknowledge it you know they refuse to say no you've been you've
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:26.160]  been you've been absolutely on target so what i'm asking is though speak to the crossroads
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:30.080]  we're at right now though because you've talked about it are we at a crossroads to decide whether
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:34.720]  this country's done or whether we go to the next level well i think this i think that it's sadly i
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:38.320]  think that if we don't get it right this time i think this is going to be the most important
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:42.480]  election our country's ever had i mean you'd have to say george washington was right there you know
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:46.640]  the couple of pretty important elections right but this is certainly in the last in the modern era
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:52.080]  this is the most important election election our country's ever had if we don't get it right if we
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:58.720]  put another one of these people in like hillary i mean she she's so corrupt she is so corrupt
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:03.680]  and she shouldn't even be allowed to run and frankly her greatest legacy she was a horrible
[2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:09.440]  secretary of state if she's if she runs i think her greatest legacy will be that she got out of
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:13.840]  the email scandal that's what i think it'll be one of the greatest jobs i've ever seen of getting
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:19.520]  out of a scandal because general patreus and many others i mean their lives have been destroyed for
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:23.680]  doing five percent of what she did that's right she shouldn't be allowed to run but you know the
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:27.840]  recent fox poll that just came down two days ago has been beating her head to head which is very
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:34.640]  interesting and very good and beating her soundly head to head but we have to get it right our country
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:40.080]  can be absolutely we can turn it around but i would agree with you if we don't get it right this time
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:45.440]  i'm not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the stupidity of
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:48.960]  these leaders i'm not sure you're going to be able to turn it around anymore i think it could be
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:56.640]  for sure i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:03.920]  your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:09.520]  tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide and president trump's
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:14.800]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:20.400]  he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:25.040]  trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:31.360]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:37.520]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:42.080]  in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:48.080]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to moralize us
[2:43:48.080 --> 2:43:56.080]  we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy hey you there we have a problem
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:04.880]  you see there is a baby the mother of this baby is not sure she's ready the father of this baby
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:12.640]  doesn't want to settle down the mother starts to have regrets the father considers leaving town
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:22.320]  but a friend says there's a solution she says to have an abortion the mother decides to look into
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:29.680]  it the clinic assures her it's safe she's made her decision she's going to have an abortion
[2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:39.680]  the problem is that baby is you join me oh and shroyer at the march for life friday january

[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  that's reality you have made history we have made history together info wars dot com only
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:53.760]  has power because of you and i suggest you use it
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:00.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:00.720 --> 2:47:15.760]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:23.840]  i understand that you really do want to save this country where your children and grandchildren
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:29.600]  live but let's expand on this there are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with
[2:47:29.600 --> 2:47:35.600]  bill clinton and so you know you've you had to do business in new york so you said nice things
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:40.000]  about hillary i get keeping your enemies closer when you're not you know in politics i get it i
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:46.400]  understand i think that's what you did but promise us that you're not gonna drop out at the key moment
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:51.600]  keeping all the other republicans out of you and then hillary races to the head or or jeb bush
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:56.160]  does because as you know folks are claiming you're a clinton operative you know i've never heard that
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:48:00.880]  i've i've i heard it actually a few months ago but i've hit her harder than anybody times 10
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:05.040]  if you look at that you have you have just here i was a businessman yet i've only been a politician
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.840]  for five months i hate to use the term because you know to all your stations but i've just been
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:14.480]  doing this for a very short period of time i was establishment you know i was like a guy like you
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:19.680]  would say trump is total establishment and i was a big donor to a lot of different republicans
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:23.360]  but over the years i've given to democrats i've given to republic i've given everybody
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:27.680]  because i had an obligation i was a businessman one of the magazines recently called me a world
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:33.040]  class businessman the truth is i did i built an unbelievable company the tremendous assets
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:37.920]  tremendous not only that iconic assets very little debt tremendous cash flow it's a great
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:41.760]  company and by the way people now see how good when i did the filing everyone said oh i'll never
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:47.440]  file i'll never file it's almost a hundred pages long and it's an unbelievable company so i built
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:52.400]  which by the way the reason i say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs but i got a
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:57.200]  long great with clinton i got a long great with harry reid i get along great with everybody
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:01.920]  because when i needed them i didn't want to have argument i didn't want to have somebody say well
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:05.600]  clinton doesn't want to have you're not a loser you don't get in mindless fights you move forward
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:10.720]  with your agenda but now you see america in trouble and you're hey that's all sideline now
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:15.120]  donald trump's not working for donald trump he wants to work for america yeah as a businessman
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:19.040]  you couldn't have even functioned if you don't get along no i know yeah example in new york city
[2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:24.160]  is 95 democrat i mean if i didn't get along with the democrats i wouldn't have one i'll tell you i
[2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:28.480]  mean you did want the vice president you know a position it's come out decades ago behind the
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:33.280]  scenes i mean i know you're a republican what about libertarianism what's your view of libertarianism
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:37.200]  and then i want to ask you who's your favorite president and who do you think your running
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:42.000]  mate might be folks think it's ted cruse well i think that libertarianism sort of interesting
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:46.560]  there are certain things that i really like about it but you know keeping government out as much as
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:50.800]  possible we need government for protection we have to protect when you look at these maniacs in
[2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:56.000]  the middle east that want to destroy us and you know the problem we have today alex is the weaponry
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.440]  if this were a hundred years ago i'd say forget about them let them keep fighting they've been
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:04.880]  fighting all their lives let them keep fighting each other who cares but the weaponry is so powerful
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:10.560]  and they hate us so much that we have to now protect so that's a big part of government so there's
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:14.720]  a certain common sense to certain elements that i do very well with the libertarians frankly you
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:20.080]  know because they sort of get it and they they get me but we need bigger strength that i think the
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:25.280]  libertarians really want and we need it and we have to have it we have to have it if we don't
[2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:28.880]  have it we're not going to have a country if we don't have borders we're not going to have a country
[2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:33.440]  as far as running mates it's too soon to say i i actually respect a couple of people that are on
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:37.520]  the stage some of them have absolutely no respect for their i mean i think they're not very good at
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:42.400]  all at what they do you look at what's going on but i have respect for a number of people that
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:48.080]  are on the stage with me i have respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country you
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:52.880]  know political people i'll pick somebody i think that can really be a great vice president ultimately
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:57.120]  has to be a great president because that's you know 90 percent of that function is you know if
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:01.440]  something bad happens they got to be a good president you have to view it from that standpoint
[2:51:01.440 --> 2:51:05.760]  and my favorite president in the more or less modern era would be ronald reagan i've always
[2:51:05.760 --> 2:51:10.320]  liked him i helped him and by the way he was a democrat a lot of people don't know he was some
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:15.280]  of a liberal democrat alex as you know and he became a somewhat conservative i wouldn't say
[2:51:15.280 --> 2:51:19.360]  the most conservative but a somewhat conservative republic but he wanted to make america great
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:24.480]  and he really did he wanted to make he had actually let's make america great that was his
[2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:29.760]  and mine is make america great again so there's a little bit of a difference but my son my son
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:33.760]  you know finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours i mean i liked you love americana
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:37.440]  your pure americana but i'm still you know was researched but but my 13 year old son's really
[2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:40.960]  smart there's a lot of research he watches all the debates and he just really loves you
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:46.800]  he is on cloud nine that you're here rex jones and it was his question you know which president
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:53.120]  was your favorite but but all time all time who's your favorite well all time i'd say ronald reagan
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:57.840]  shorter term i would say well you know you look at lincoln you look at washington you have to go
[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:02.480]  with they were they're the classics right alex you know you think in terms of the great classics
[2:52:02.480 --> 2:52:06.560]  you have to go with the lincoln's and the washington's i agree as a man's man george washington
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:12.160]  was badass yeah that's what they say i mean that's what they said he said they say he never told a lie
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:16.720]  let's hope that's true okay but george washington was pretty good but we had some look we had some
[2:52:16.720 --> 2:52:21.600]  great presidents and we had some good presidents on the other side too in all fairness but uh we
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:26.320]  will hopefully be right at the top of that list we're going to make the country so strong and
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:30.800]  we're going to make it financially secure we can't owe 21 trillion dollars because it's going to be
[2:52:30.800 --> 2:52:35.760]  that last my final question what type of an elite wants a cloward and piven bankrupt the country so
[2:52:35.760 --> 2:52:40.240]  shillers can run in and we all get handouts what type of an elite is that i mean you've been around
[2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:44.560]  these people are they mentally ill donald trump well we have to make our country richigan you
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:49.920]  know the other day i said to a woman to her she came up to mr trump at a big rally where we had
[2:52:49.920 --> 2:52:55.280]  14 000 people and at the end she just sees me and i'm you're signing autographs and stuff and
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:53:00.560]  she said mr trump i'm voting for you 100 but are you this whole concept of making it richard
[2:53:00.560 --> 2:53:05.120]  sounds so crisp i said you know what it might sound crisp but if we don't make our nation richigan if
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:09.280]  we don't take back our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us and if we don't take
[2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:15.440]  back our money and if we don't you know balance up our budget at least get it damn close and soon
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:19.600]  we're not going to have a nation anymore you gotta want to be on the top you gotta want to be free
[2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:26.240]  or you're going to be slaves i don't trust me to stay a few more minutes with us uh and he brought
[2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:29.920]  up you know somebody that he wanted to thank on air that i want to thank on air he came in here a
[2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:34.960]  month ago he's been on all these big shows just an incredible guy i was aware of who he was a patriot
[2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:40.320]  fighting communism all over the world tell us mr trump about mr stone who helped get this interview
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:47.280]  set up well roger's a good guy and he is a patriot and believes strongly in a strong nation a lot of
[2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:52.800]  the things that uh that i believe in and he you know i see him all over television people like
[2:53:52.800 --> 2:53:57.040]  roger he's a tough cookie i will tell you that but people like him but he's been so loyal and so
[2:53:57.040 --> 2:54:02.640]  wonderful and he is the one he really wanted me to do this interview and i'm doing it and so
[2:54:02.640 --> 2:54:07.600]  we appreciate it roger well i knew who he was but then i did war research on him this guy
[2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:13.280]  literally fought communist all over the world ran big elections against the soviet union uh
[2:54:13.280 --> 2:54:18.480]  in in latin america and africa and asia i mean it uh and i know he's been friends with you for a
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:23.200]  long time and advising you so i give my respect level one up even more knowing that you're talking
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:28.560]  to real political operatives not not fake pundits that are on tv and that brings me to mainstream
[2:54:28.560 --> 2:54:34.400]  media i love the fact when i first saw it a few days ago they misrepresented they said trump
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:38.960]  wants five million dollars then i read deeper you said give five million dollars to wounded warriors
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:44.240]  before i go make singing in fifty million that's what you make these shows but you know they took
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:47.840]  that statement i said give five million i'm gonna want five million dollars that we're gonna give to
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:52.000]  the wounded warriors or the vets right which is the same thing as far as i'm concerned we split it up
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:57.040]  because they're making a fortune on these debates which never had anybody you know fox had 24 million
[2:54:57.040 --> 2:55:02.480]  people they used to get like a million and uh cnn had the biggest ratings in the history of cnn
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:08.160]  and i won't take full credit but i'll take 99.9 credit so i said give me five million dollars i
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:12.800]  want to give it to the wounded warriors i want to give it to the vets and but a lot of people said
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:16.480]  trump wants five million dollars and i said it right in the same sentence alex i didn't say it
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:21.680]  like that's how they deceive i said i want five million dollars that will go to the wounded
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:25.440]  warriors and they would play it they even took the tape you know the tape is worse than the pen
[2:55:25.440 --> 2:55:30.080]  they can cut it so they say give me five million dollars and then they cut it nobody knows what
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:35.200]  am i doing i'm asking for money to be on a debate it's ridiculous so i wanted five million dollars
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:41.120]  to go to the wounded warriors in particular and uh let's see what happens i don't know you know the
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:45.600]  one problem alex if i didn't go to the debate then you know what would happen they'd say he's
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:50.240]  chicken i mean i think i won every debate and i saw one channel made like 40 million dollars

[2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:53.040]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:58.960]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:06.080]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate
[2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:11.680]  certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[2:59:11.680 --> 2:59:16.480]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this
[2:59:16.480 --> 2:59:22.800]  research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block
[2:59:22.800 --> 2:59:29.040]  is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[2:59:29.040 --> 2:59:34.800]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:31.840]  you we've got tim delin and ben ever here ben ever the sun no i'm serious of the former co-host of
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:38.800]  johnny karsten he's here i know that's satar they'll have like a they'll have like a fact check at

[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:59.200]  yeah i love you guys yeah hey you're gonna be on you just popped in you're about to tape some stuff
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:03.920]  we're here on this friday edition right now a lot of the show is live paul watson's coming up
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:08.400]  next segment but we're taping this part you're gonna be on the fourth hour so what are you
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:12.880]  guys going to be covering i mean it's a big deal like how did you get johnny karsten yeah that was
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:17.920]  huge uh blackmail of course we learned from the best but uh we'll be covered comedy and we're
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:22.800]  going to play some videos and and and what uh you know what this comedy what's the responsibility
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:27.840]  of comedians in a in a time when everybody wants to take away everybody's right to speak which i know
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:33.280]  you don't know much about but i well i mean you know these americans talk i mean yeah it's a free
[3:01:33.280 --> 3:01:36.880]  company yeah but i think people are starting to push back and the comics are starting to push back
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:41.680]  uh ricky gervais had a really funny speech at uh golden globes and you know chappell's the greatest
[3:01:41.680 --> 3:01:46.080]  comic ever was like listen the art form is is true maybe not what we're saying is true but the art
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:50.560]  form is true freedom of speech being able to say that was beautifully said yeah not saying what
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:55.680]  they're saying is truth freedom of speech is true yeah the outlet the ability to do it so i think
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:00.320]  that people are pushing back a powerful way to say it yeah well he's the best yeah and we're not
[3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:04.640]  saying what they say is true freedom is true well if there's anybody who's gonna say it in the best
[3:02:04.640 --> 3:02:09.840]  way he's gonna say it but yeah i mean so i think people are now i think you're and the other thing
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:15.760]  is like go woke go broke like nobody wants this woke unfunny comedy nobody wants that to be lectured
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:20.080]  about nobody wants the new thing like michelle wolf's like i've murdered my baby and felt powerful
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:27.040]  she's i know michelle i do like michelle but i don't know if she murdered her baby uh well she might
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:32.240]  that she probably did i don't know if it's true she said yeah she like squatted down and yeah well
[3:02:32.240 --> 3:02:36.000]  i mean she does have a you know i don't know she's a high-pitched voice the baby might have killed
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:42.880]  himself uh i do i i do like i do like i do like michelle i don't see from her baby and i don't
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:51.440]  i'm open for michelle you know she'll love that you know but no it's listen it's and that's why i
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:55.200]  think when when we saw what happened to you i think more people should have been like you know
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:03:01.120]  listen this is a little wild that you can just take all of somebody's outlets without any any you
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:06.160]  know and then push lie about whatever you want and then just kind of that's the next part of it yeah
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:10.560]  oh you're gonna be like no didn't they say whatever they want but seriously we've got them trying to
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:15.520]  start a civil war in virginia yeah we've got the impeachment um that they already happened and now the
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:22.800]  trial uh in the senate what does that big man think uh i looks like i said i'm kind of retarded
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:29.680]  who wrote that that is that is a comedic genius you gotta you gotta start giving him residuals
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:34.480]  you know i mean this is hey but listen listen you speak of Dave Chabelle he admitted he was gay at
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:41.200]  the golden gloves or right it was the some awards show yeah he was jucky he was he did it the uh it

[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:56.960]  just can't lie about him or jill rogan and i're getting married next week you have to be trans
[3:03:56.960 --> 3:04:02.400]  it did as much as you're hated he's my best guy you have to come out as a woman no i am

[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:15.280]  husband is your brother and i just admitted a fun reality show we've got in the world all right
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:19.520]  i've learned yeah i was literally this is not joke i was talking to god the other day and i said
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:24.000]  gotta have more fun yeah and it can't all be on me or i'm gonna go crazy that part yeah so you
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:27.680]  know what i'm gonna have fun that's the way it is ladies gentlemen and i know it's hardcore stuff
[3:04:27.680 --> 3:04:33.120]  but we deserve it well um eddie man was here also has been avery and we've got tim dillon
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:38.160]  but the serious part of the transmission starts right now on the other side so we just crank this
[3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:51.680]  up right now amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:56.680]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[3:04:56.680 --> 3:04:59.680]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:02.680]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[3:05:02.680 --> 3:05:08.680]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[3:05:08.680 --> 3:05:11.680]  to see evil running rampant like this,
[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:16.680]  and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace,
[3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:21.680]  that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:27.680]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:33.680]  by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and banned.video,
[3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:36.680]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever,
[3:05:36.680 --> 3:05:40.680]  and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have
[3:05:40.680 --> 3:05:44.680]  is at infowords.com forward slash show and banned.video.
[3:05:44.680 --> 3:05:48.680]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down
[3:05:48.680 --> 3:05:52.680]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[3:05:52.680 --> 3:06:14.680]  Music playing
[3:06:22.680 --> 3:06:29.980]  power cars are badass. There's only one way to rock and it's called America. And
[3:06:29.980 --> 3:06:33.680]  folks want to take it down. They can't compete with it. They're gonna fail.
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:38.800]  Well, name dropping. I got a call from Joe Rogan today and he said, you know,
[3:06:38.800 --> 3:06:42.080]  Tim Dillon's coming into town. You ought to have him on. I'm like, oh, Tim Dillon.
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:45.760]  There's a million comics out there, but I actually like this guy's comedy and he
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:51.560]  has the courage to say that Hollywood movie stars have a right to shake
[3:06:51.560 --> 3:06:56.000]  Donald Trump's hand. Yeah. Wow. That's amazing courage. But you know what?
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:00.440]  It is true. George Orwell said the ability to say two plus two equals four is
[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:04.080]  a revolutionary act and is the symbol of freedom. So things are so screwed up now.
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:08.520]  You saying that Vince Vaughn has a right to shake the president's hand at a
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:12.320]  sporting event and then people are getting fired from their dental
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:15.840]  assistant jobs because they say make America great again in 2020. And you've
[3:07:15.840 --> 3:07:18.800]  got your opening guy here. Very interesting fellow, Ben Avery as well.
[3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:22.400]  He's got a big lineup for us here. And I don't lie. The listeners, I'm in an
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:27.120]  airplane right now flying to DC for the removal of the president, the trial, the
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:30.320]  president and the left trying to cause a civil war with gun confiscation of
[3:07:30.320 --> 3:07:35.360]  Virginia. So as we're speaking of the plane, as it crashed, hopefully 99.99
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:38.160]  percent chance that won't happen. We're gonna have live coverage there, but we're
[3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:40.960]  here in the fourth hour right now. So I want to say to Ben Avery, Ben, good to
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:44.800]  have you here. Oh, thank you. Huge fan. Huge fan of you guys. Thanks for having us
[3:07:44.800 --> 3:07:49.600]  here. All BD platformers at the Siberia. This is the end of our career. But I told
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:52.560]  Ben, I said, this is his wedding present. I just attached his fiancee picture of
[3:07:52.560 --> 3:07:55.680]  him here. We were talking. I mean, the guys like 80 years ago hit the beaches
[3:07:55.680 --> 3:07:58.960]  of Normandy. Yeah, like half the boats got machined by Nazis by the time they
[3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:02.040]  got off. So, you know, the new heroism is just saying,
[3:08:02.040 --> 3:08:05.440]  Happy Free Speech. Yeah. Yeah. If my grandfather can fight World War Two, I
[3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:08.960]  can make a YouTube sketch and I can tweet that Vince Vaughn could shake the
[3:08:08.960 --> 3:08:13.600]  president's hand. And I just said, when I tweeted that, I said, can you find all
[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:18.320]  the celebrities that shook Bill Clinton's hand? Because, you know, this is a guy
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:22.400]  that spent his post presidency jet-setting with human traffickers. I love your
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:26.000]  tweet. This is not even a, I mean, it's not what happened. Joe called me and I
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:29.440]  looked at your Twitter because I'd see, I kind of orgasm. Yeah. Just the common
[3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:33.360]  sense like Clinton's hang around pedophiles constantly. Right. And meanwhile,
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:36.480]  Trump's bad. Yeah. I mean, listen, you could criticize Trump. You cannot like
[3:08:36.480 --> 3:08:39.440]  Trump. But this is a, this is a guy meeting the president of the United
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:44.320]  States shaking his hand and there's outrage and there's no outrage for
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:47.440]  people that have, have had dinner with the Clintons and have hung out with the
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.120]  Clintons and flown on airplanes. And we know for a fact, a lot of the things
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:58.560]  that Bill Clinton's done has, he's been credibly accused of rape. He's, he's
[3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:02.000]  been involved in criminal dealings for his entire public life and the whole
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.080]  Epstein stuff. Are you saying Bill Clinton is dirty? A little bit. A little bit. Just
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  a little bit. You know, you're saying that's dirty. That might be. It's not
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:14.400]  good. It's not good. Yes. Not good. But and that's my whole thing. I think
[3:09:14.400 --> 3:09:17.920]  comics and comedy shouldn't roll over. Well, that's what I want to start with
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:24.320]  you. And I'm glad you brought that up. Dave Chappelle and others at the
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:26.960]  Golden Globes come out and say, you're a bunch of pedophiles. You're a bunch of
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:30.640]  perverts. You're a bunch of degenerates. America hates you. Comics go out and
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:34.400]  face the American people. They're real. Yeah. But you guys come up with your own
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:38.480]  information that resonates with the populace. True Americana as the, as the,
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:41.440]  as the, you know, standard comedian is an American genre. Another one of our great
[3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:47.600]  inventions. But meanwhile, these, these stars aren't stars. They just read off
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:53.040]  a teleprompter or a script and then people are rejecting them. So our
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:56.560]  comics going to save the first amendment. I hope so. I mean, I hope so. I think
[3:09:56.560 --> 3:10:00.400]  comics are in a unique position because we, with, with the way technology is we
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:03.680]  make our own living. We're able to podcast. We talk directly to our fans.
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:09.120]  They buy tickets to come see us live. We don't have, you know, manage like people
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:12.960]  that manage our public image. We're just, you're truly grassroots populace.
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:19.040]  What we want to do. Yeah. Living and dying on our own skill. And that's the whole
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:22.880]  thing. And it disappointed me when you were de-platformed that there weren't
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:27.520]  more people that were comedians that are saying, wait a minute, I may not agree
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:31.520]  with that guy or I may not agree with anybody that's being de-platformed. But
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:35.280]  if we lose the right, I do not even agree with what the media says that person
[3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:37.920]  stands for. Right. Right. Sure. Because de-platforming isn't just that you don't get
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:42.240]  a voice outside your own little audience. It's that they can then say what you
[3:10:42.240 --> 3:10:46.720]  said. Right. Imagine that. That's because I always knew about censorship, but I
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:50.480]  thought I knew. I didn't. Once it happens, you're like, they can say I said that.
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:53.920]  Yeah. And then you can't fight back. And I had Gavin McGinnis on my show and he
[3:10:53.920 --> 3:10:57.920]  said the same thing. He goes, I just have to read about myself now. I have no
[3:10:57.920 --> 3:11:02.560]  outlet to fight back. You know, and it's just very, very
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:07.680]  disempowering. Yeah. And it won't end with like the people that are the most
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:11.680]  controversial. It's going to eventually, especially as well, these big corporations
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:14.960]  going after everybody. Going after everybody. You say, I support the president,
[3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:18.320]  you're banned off Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. You're banned off Facebook. You're
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:23.520]  fired from your job. Yeah. It's crazy. So, so, I mean, what is, so, so why are you
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:27.840]  guys then, you know, because I mean, I think you get it. Like people need to just bite
[3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:30.800]  the bullet and not worry about the censorship. Yeah. I think people need to,
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:33.760]  people need to, number one, the reason that, that, that I've success is at
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:36.560]  comedians. I talk about things that are real, that are actually happening.
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:39.840]  I don't have to answer to corporations. I don't have to answer to lawyers. I don't
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:43.280]  have to answer to censors. I have to only be accountable to my fans. People either
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:45.760]  think it's funny or don't think it's funny. I think it's interesting or don't
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:48.720]  think it's interesting. So I'm in that unique position. Joe Rogan is in that
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:52.800]  position. And how electric is that? It's amazing because that's what comedy
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:56.000]  should be and is. And like Dave Chappelle is the best comedian that's ever lived
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:00.240]  when he gets out and says, listen, the true form of the art is people speaking
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:03.600]  their truth. It doesn't mean it's right. But he said, this is truth. It doesn't
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:06.720]  mean they're right or wrong. Correct. The truth of freedom of speech is
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:10.880]  true. Yes. The art form. Speech is true. 100%. Getting out there, being able.
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:13.600]  Truth is having a speech. Yeah. Being able to be heard to say what you want to
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:18.240]  say. That's 100%. We live and die on that. And the fact that there aren't more
[3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:24.320]  people in my business standing up for that terrifies me because it shows me
[3:12:24.320 --> 3:12:27.600]  that if we're not going to stand up for it, I can't expect a guy in an office
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:32.960]  to stand up for it who's got, you know, all these people that are, you know,
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:35.040]  standing between him and feeding his family. That's exactly right. That's
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:38.400]  exactly right. Yeah. And there's like a capitulation. There's a running scared
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:42.960]  to wicked flea with none pursue. Yeah. That is just this this woman I had on
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:46.800]  the show yesterday. She got it's in the news. They admit it. They fired her
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:50.480]  from an dental assistant job. She said make America great again on Facebook.
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:52.720]  And somebody complained. They said we can't have one complaint. That's crazy.
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:56.880]  Is that my aunt? My aunt has a Facebook feed that's all make America great.
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:12:59.680]  I love it. By the way, we got this guy over here. Who was the guy that was on
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:03.680]  with Johnny Carson? Never talked? Ed McMahon. Ed McMahon. Yeah.
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:09.760]  Ed McMahon is on. What do you say, Ed? But Ben knows too. I mean, you've
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:12.640]  watched the whole thing. You've watched comics and what's happened.
[3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:17.040]  Yeah. Shame on a lot of people for just rolling over and not not standing up
[3:13:17.040 --> 3:13:21.040]  or you know, Shane Gillett's really funny comic gets fired from SNL.
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:25.120]  He's hired on SNL. They pulled up a podcast. He made a joke.
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:29.920]  He used to slur in the joke. He was trying to be funny. He loses his job.
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:33.200]  A lot of comics don't say anything. They just watch him get fed to the wolves.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:36.800]  People are on Twitter every day telling him, you know, they're gonna come kill
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:40.000]  him. He's getting death threats. His family is getting contacted. The media is
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:42.880]  now trying to ruin his life. This is just bullying. Yeah, it's bullying.
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:45.200]  It's trying to ruin people's lives. Well, I mean, take, take, like,
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:49.120]  Tropic Thunder came out 15 years ago or whatever it was 12 years ago.
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:52.400]  I mean, it's not meant mean that the guy's in blackface. Right.
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:55.680]  He's making a joke. Everybody gets it. But again, he's allowed to do it,
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:13:59.040]  but nobody else can. Yeah. I think there's this double standard where
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:04.480]  people are, are when somebody has enough money or they're powerful enough,
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:08.640]  they, they are able to kind of write their own ticket. But you, everybody needs that
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:12.640]  freedom, whether you have a mansion or you're a nobody who's living in a public
[3:14:12.640 --> 3:14:15.520]  that goes back to your home is your castle. Absolutely. Your speech is your
[3:14:15.520 --> 3:14:19.920]  cast. Yeah, absolutely. And we're just giving up on something that since the
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:26.080]  Magna Carta in 1215, 800 years of war for free. Yeah. And they've made you the,
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:29.920]  the, the boogeyman, which is interesting because I have seen, by the way, you on
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:33.200]  your show do a lot to put, and this is going to get me in trouble when I say
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:38.320]  this, uh, but you pushed back against racism. I've watched you do it.
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:42.320]  I've watched you push back against identity politics on the right and the
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:47.360]  left. And for some reason you're the, the boogeyman. When I go this, and I'm
[3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:50.720]  going to, now this is going to be the clip that people use, but I sometimes,
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:54.320]  this may, maybe I'm nuts. Sometimes I hear you was like a voice of moderation.
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:14:59.200]  I know that this is going to be, it's going to be played back. But sometimes I
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:02.000]  hear you when I go, you definitely have a point of view. We don't agree on
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:05.360]  everything. But I hear you when I go, you don't want identity politics. You
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:07.600]  don't want a country for white people. You don't want any of that.
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:10.640]  Well, you just hit it. Yeah. They've done focus groups because we're not
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:13.920]  calculating. Those were just regular people. Like, yeah, they know we unify
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:16.080]  people. Right. I mean, I statistically, because we get the
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:18.720]  Google analytics, I never do this on purpose. Yeah. We have bigger Hispanic
[3:15:18.720 --> 3:15:23.040]  and black audiences for segment wise and whites. Right. I just try to target
[3:15:23.040 --> 3:15:26.400]  those people. They legitimately hear me. Yeah. They know I want everybody
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:29.280]  at freedom. Right. I don't like go, Oh, those black people got a nice house
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:33.040]  and car. I'm losing out. No, the better everybody does, the better. Right.
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:38.000]  Right. All right. We're going to talk to a ethnic man when we come back. We got
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:41.760]  Tim Dillon here and we got Ben Avery. Stay with us. We'll be right back. Ben
[3:15:41.760 --> 3:15:46.720]  Avery is it Ben Avery is good. Everybody's good. Nobody's bad.
[3:15:46.720 --> 3:15:50.000]  And we got the Tim Dylan, Tim J. Dylan on Twitter while he's still there.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:53.040]  I'll probably bambo something. Most of you know that heart disease is the
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:57.600]  number one silent killer in the U. S. What if I told you for just $54.95 a
[3:15:57.600 --> 3:16:01.200]  month, you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body

[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:57.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:27.360]  I'm glad my Putin's calling you by. I'm carrying his baby right now. No, seriously,
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:30.960]  we're having some great discussions. Yeah. Joe Rogan is your buddy's with. Yeah.
[3:20:30.960 --> 3:20:35.600]  Intro song of his shows. Ed McMahon. Yeah, let's talk about this. Well, you know, when you went
[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:39.840]  back on his show, because your first appearance on Rogan, we had why. I mean, it was the most
[3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:43.200]  a lot of reason to commentate you is because you're funnier than a lot of time. That's the
[3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:48.560]  reality. It's just what it is. It's true. It's true. I'm kind of retarded. It's probably the
[3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:52.800]  most entertaining person in the country. No, you're nice. I mean, that's what it is. It doesn't
[3:20:52.800 --> 3:20:58.480]  mean that, you know, but so the second time you went on, I get a call from a friend of mine. It's
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:04.240]  me, him, his fiance and his brother were coming back from breakfast. He goes, Alex is on Rogan
[3:21:04.240 --> 3:21:09.360]  right now. I just look at him. I go, Alex is on roving. He swerves the car. Let's go. What
[3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:14.880]  the hell's going on? We go, shut up. We drive to his house. We sit on the deck. We have 15 people.
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:19.360]  The whole neighborhood comes over and we're watching you and Rogan for like four hours.
[3:21:19.360 --> 3:21:24.640]  People calling out of work. People hit their 10 million. Is it 10 million that day? Then like
[3:21:24.640 --> 3:21:28.720]  60 million later, but they just cut the feed though. It was like the number go up. Yeah,
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:34.320]  it was the most it was wild. Yeah, it was unified the neighborhood like like the bombing of Pearl
[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:38.960]  Harbor. That was how crazy people were. It's crazy enough about me. It's just, it's just crazy that
[3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:44.000]  people want unfiltered. Yeah. YouTube didn't even allow that video to trend and everyone was still
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:47.360]  watching. There were still like millions of people. Oh, yeah. The real word is just a moment.
[3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:50.800]  I'm not exaggerating. I'm going to talk to Google inside or leak stuff to us. They're going to be
[3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:54.240]  probably mail on the show soon. We can fly them here. But they said that that I don't want you
[3:21:54.240 --> 3:21:58.960]  want to tell me what the video is. But it's like 100 million. Yeah. And so it's like they can't.
[3:21:58.960 --> 3:22:02.960]  Well, it's like when our, our, our app hit number one, we already had an app like for like three
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:06.720]  months. We had a few other apps, but we did this app like three months before I got shadow banned
[3:22:06.720 --> 3:22:10.960]  a year and a half ago and it went to number one in news because of that. It was already like
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:15.680]  at the top 20 and they just said, your app's gone. Right. So it's not that I'm that good. It's the
[3:22:15.680 --> 3:22:19.360]  guest I have on. I'm serious. It's the whole thing we're doing unscripted. Like, do we talk about
[3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:22.080]  what you're going to talk about before you got here? People want an edit man. I entered after
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:26.240]  you. Go ahead. Oh, no, that was my, that was my point. It was just people still seek you out.
[3:22:26.240 --> 3:22:30.240]  Even though they try to suppress you, people still, they want to find you. They want to listen
[3:22:30.240 --> 3:22:33.520]  to you because you're when you, people hear what you're saying. They go, oh, this is more reasonable
[3:22:33.520 --> 3:22:38.400]  than I had heard because they're introduced to you through people to hate you. It's like KKK
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:42.080]  Grand World. They go, this guy's funny. He's entertaining. He's informative. I hate my friend's
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:46.800]  wife and I say, listen, she's the worst person in the world. She's ruining his life. She should
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:49.920]  get hit by a car. When you meet her, you're going to be like, what the hell is her problem?
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:55.280]  So they're skeptical, but then you hear you and you go, you know, this isn't as crazy. And then
[3:22:55.280 --> 3:23:00.160]  you have like Epstein's thing happening. You know, this guy's killed in his prison. So every
[3:23:00.160 --> 3:23:05.040]  that event was seismic because now everybody's sitting there going, wait a minute, Alex, I think
[3:23:05.040 --> 3:23:08.640]  when that happened, I tweeted, are we going to give Alex Jones a congressional metaphor, the
[3:23:08.640 --> 3:23:13.200]  congressional metaphor? People got angry about that. People are not happy about that. Seriously,
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:18.560]  let's talk about you guys. Yeah. So we're trying to, but what's going to happen is everything
[3:23:18.560 --> 3:23:22.000]  that they've been suppressing, because I'd love to give myself credit for the Epstein that was well
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:26.400]  known. Yeah. Saying the sun came up, Jones said at first. Of course. Yeah. What's going to happen
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:32.400]  as the credibility of a system keeps falling. I mean, CNN has to pay beyond at bus stations
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:39.120]  and train stations and hotel bars and the ruling class is losing power. It's kind of a terrifying
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:44.560]  thing. It's wild to watch a system that has been in place for hundreds of years, begin to crumble.
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:47.920]  And whether you like Trump or don't like Trump, whatever you feel about Trump, his election,
[3:23:47.920 --> 3:23:53.600]  he ran against the two biggest political enemies. I want to say this. Yeah. I don't want our financial
[3:23:53.600 --> 3:23:58.080]  system or what's left of Americana to crumble. Nobody. I don't see that as the enemy. The corrupt,
[3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:03.200]  weird corporations f-ing us over. I want to see that crumble. I mean, Trump ran against two political
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:08.720]  dynasties and destroyed both of them. That means that people are really angry. I'm going to kiss
[3:24:08.720 --> 3:24:13.680]  both your asses. Yeah. Man and Tim Dillon here, but talk about, because you're like, okay, in a world
[3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:18.320]  of universal deceit, tell the truth, Revolutionary Act. No, George Rowan quote, because you don't
[3:24:18.320 --> 3:24:23.680]  want to say you're a hero or you're a hero, but you guys are on the big devil show. So speak to
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:29.440]  Trump. What woke you up and what, what made you grow giant basketball side? Well, I think we just
[3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:35.360]  have to, number one, you, you, as a comedian to me, I value freedom over money, right? So I realize
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:39.760]  that. Hell yeah. I value freedom over money. Yep. So the reality is the freedom to make fun of the
[3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:43.600]  things I want to make fun of it and, and connect with the people I want to connect to means more
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:48.160]  to me than having a lot of money. And once you realize that, you know, it's just like no amount
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:52.320]  of money. Yeah. You got it to sell somebody else worth it. A hundred percent. But money, you freaking
[3:24:52.320 --> 3:24:56.640]  earn me in real. That's good. You know, the people that didn't speak up for Shane or the people that
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:25:00.160]  didn't speak up and went to bed every night when one of their friends was getting trashed on the
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:04.960]  internet. You're like, they live with that. They sleep with that. Good for them. That's who they
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:08.640]  are. There are ancestors knew that was America. Yeah. Even if you disagree with somebody, you
[3:25:08.640 --> 3:25:13.200]  don't silence them because you're mad enough to hear their speech. And once you give up,
[3:25:13.200 --> 3:25:17.360]  it all falls like dominoes. Yeah. And so, so, and, and by the way, once you do the real stuff and
[3:25:17.360 --> 3:25:21.680]  you say things that are real people respond to it and you know, people are out there, people
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:26.640]  want to have fun, you know, that the sketches we make, the stand up I do, everything that we do is
[3:25:26.640 --> 3:25:33.120]  about trying to connect with people in a real authentic way and making people angry. We want
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:36.800]  to make people a little upset. We, you know, the people in the corporate media that would never
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:40.960]  just the brain. Yeah. That would never upset your dad. Right. So like if you're never upset,
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:45.040]  you're dead. A hundred percent. So the corporate media, people that don't want, and we make fun
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:50.560]  of dark stuff. And it's we laugh at the absurdity of a world where nobody's punished, where
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:55.040]  Epstein gets, everybody gets away with everything that matters and nobody's punished. So it's like
[3:25:55.040 --> 3:25:57.920]  some people say to me, oh, you're making fun of something that's really dark or whatever. He said,
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:03.360]  what I'm making fun of is the absurdity of a world where this goes on. You're not making fun of the
[3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:06.720]  death or anything. No, no. You're making fun of the fraud. The fraud. And they always turn it around
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:10.400]  how we're bad. We're the problem. I'm like, go to your government. Why do they fear, why do they
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:15.200]  fear comedy so much? Because it's the last bastion, I think, of people saying, because you can't,
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:19.040]  here's the real thing about comedy. You can't control when you laugh. Laughing is like an
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:23.840]  involuntary. And it's a human interaction. It's a currency. Yeah, it's a currency. It brings
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:27.520]  people together. And they don't like grassroots currency. They don't like anything that's,
[3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:32.080]  that's like, you know, that can't be managed and can't be controlled because I think they want the
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:36.960]  total goal I think they want is just for you. They want your money and your, and your free. I'll
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:41.040]  say this. I was mad at Joe for not staying up for free speech for a while. But then when he did,
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:45.600]  yeah, he even chewed up the head of Twitter and chewed up their lawyer. Well, you know what it is.
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:50.080]  I don't think it wasn't, he wasn't standing up for free speech. No, of course, he was like,
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:52.480]  I want to stay out of this. He wants to, yeah. And I think he wants to get it right,
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:26:56.240]  whatever he does, he wants to get right. So it's like, he's methodical. I'm not methodical,
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:01.600]  right? I'm sloppy. I'm reckless. Me too. It's what we do. That's what we do. So the reality.
[3:27:01.600 --> 3:27:05.760]  No, of course, of course, it's very methodical. But there needs to be guys who are methodical,
[3:27:05.760 --> 3:27:08.960]  but there also needs to be guys that aren't methodical, that just throw it against the wall
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:12.800]  and say, you know what? Yeah. What I was saying is when he did go public, yeah, he went big,
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:16.560]  he did a great job. Yeah, he went big. Yeah. Because he was methodical. He got the big cheese
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:20.240]  when he finally did it. Yeah. And people are going to start to ask us the joke. Yeah. He freaking
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:23.920]  did stuff nobody else did. He was able to, I mean, watching, watching the head of Twitter and that
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:28.640]  lawyer squirm, man, that was, that was the most watchable. And then orgasm. And here's the other
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:32.800]  thing. Twitter's the best. Like Twitter's the number, like they leave most stuff up, even though
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:36.400]  they haven't been kind enough. No, no, no. You're right. Facebook and Google are horrible. Much
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:40.160]  worse. They're much worse than Twitter. I mean, they're better at hiding it though. We've had
[3:27:40.160 --> 3:27:46.480]  things taken, yeah. Twitter's like much more of a meritocracy. Twitter seems to be more of a
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:50.640]  meritocracy when it comes to the people get to choose what is seen. Our videos get sometimes,
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:55.840]  you know, 300, 400,000 views on Twitter or millions or millions. Instagram will just bury
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:27:59.760]  our stuff and beneath algorithms. They won't show them. It's shadow, man. It's like nobody
[3:27:59.760 --> 3:28:06.080]  censoring you. You can't search. You can't find his account. Yeah, they're trying to sell bathing
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:11.440]  suits. Right. And they don't want anybody to be upset by the fact in the metrics. It's killing
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:15.760]  Google. It's killing Facebook. Right. But they just don't care. They don't care. They don't care
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:19.040]  because they're monopolies. Remember like five years ago, it was all still free for all. Yeah.
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:23.200]  How awesome the internet was. Yeah. Now it's being controlled at every level. So for us,
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:26.320]  for us, as comedians, our whole thing is like, let's just make something that's really funny.
[3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:30.000]  It's going to, that's going to maybe push the envelope a little bit. And if people like it,
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:35.200]  they like it. If not, who cares? Like when they're all right, Tim Dillon and Ben Avery, the reincarnation
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:40.160]  of Ed McMahon. People don't know this. Bill Castro's clone works in this office. Yeah. And Ed

[3:30:51.920 --> 3:30:59.040]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office, especially folks
[3:30:59.040 --> 3:31:04.640]  that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick. Now, again,
[3:31:04.640 --> 3:31:09.520]  I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that
[3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:13.600]  again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that. I'm very thankful to the good Lord
[3:31:13.600 --> 3:31:19.600]  for the Constitution I've been given, but up until about eight, nine years ago when I started
[3:31:19.600 --> 3:31:25.680]  taking X2 and the products in for life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[3:31:26.640 --> 3:31:30.160]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that,
[3:31:30.880 --> 3:31:36.960]  but now that I religiously take the products to them for worse life or the highest quality
[3:31:36.960 --> 3:31:43.440]  supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore. It's probably been
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:50.400]  three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the
[3:31:50.400 --> 3:32:00.240]  great products. Hey, you there. We have a problem. You see, there is a baby. The mother of this baby
[3:32:00.240 --> 3:32:07.840]  is not sure she's ready. The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother starts
[3:32:07.840 --> 3:32:15.680]  to have regrets. The father considers leaving town, but a friend says there's a solution.
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:24.640]  She says to have an abortion. The mother decides to look into it. The clinic assures her it's safe.
[3:32:25.600 --> 3:32:33.200]  She's made her decision. She's going to have an abortion. The problem is that baby is you.
[3:32:33.200 --> 3:32:43.200]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th in Washington, D.C.,
[3:32:43.200 --> 3:32:49.120]  noon at the National Mall. I'll see you there. It's time to stand up for the unborn. It's time
[3:32:49.120 --> 3:33:03.040]  to speak out for the voiceless. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:03.040 --> 3:33:27.920]  I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire through that old flame.
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:33.840]  All the first amendment burns inside of me to be able to say what I want, not be penalized for it.
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:44.720]  We are back live. We've got a very successful entertaining comedian, Tim Dillon, and literally
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:51.200]  the reincarnation of Johnny Carson's co-host was here, Ben Avery. No, I'm just trying to repeat
[3:33:51.200 --> 3:33:58.640]  that stupid joke. My attempt at humor. Tim Dillon's here. Tell me about doing some
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:05.040]  plugging here. A place where I'm banned. I feel bad about that. When I was Bill Hicks,
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:13.280]  I was there performing as Bill Hicks. You're going to be at the cap city Friday night,
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:17.760]  Saturday night, two shows each night. The owner is actually my wife. Bill Hicks' wife.
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:24.640]  Yeah, I'll be there. Great club. Sorry your ban. That sucks. I hate that. I'm Bill Hicks.
[3:34:24.640 --> 3:34:27.600]  Sorry. You know, I mean, you did have enough. I mean, you performed there enough when you were
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:32.640]  Bill Hicks, I guess. But yeah, I'll be there. And it's crazy that comedy clubs were banning you.
[3:34:33.280 --> 3:34:37.040]  That was wild. Like it's unfortunate. Yeah, I was with Joe last time. They were going to
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:40.080]  have me come and speak at the comic. They go, no, you're just banned. I'm like, okay, well,
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:43.520]  okay, great. Yeah, it's unfortunate. Tommy's all about, we're free speech, 100 million.
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:49.520]  Yeah. Yeah, you could have sat in the back quietly. You weren't going to do anything.
[3:34:49.520 --> 3:34:52.880]  You know, you were enough about me. Yeah, let's talk about
[3:34:54.240 --> 3:34:58.480]  Let's play this clip. This is a clip. This next clip. The clip is fun. It's a, you know,
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:01.920]  after the Greta Thunberg thing came out, what we started thinking about is like,
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:07.440]  you know, these kids turns out, you know, her dad spoofed himself or docked himself. It's him
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:14.160]  riding. We already knew that. Yeah. Well, who knows, like, whether you think, how dare you have a line you're out, mind-shitter.
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:19.280]  Yeah, it's a little creepy. She has a little creepy cadence. But, you know, we thought about these
[3:35:19.280 --> 3:35:22.560]  kids, whether you agree with them or not, whether they have valid points or not, they're being managed
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.560]  to a degree, right? We all know that. They're obviously like using it. It's a Hollywood production,
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:30.080]  right? So we thought about who the hell's behind this. We came up with this character of this guy
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:35.840]  who just signs kids in crisis is and, and, and tries to make them into stars. That's the next
[3:35:35.840 --> 3:35:41.760]  clip. Here it is. Child activists. I do hang around tragedies looking for kids who have it.
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:47.280]  Greta, baby, you killed it at the f***ing UN. You're an animal. Why are you crying, honey?
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:52.160]  Oh, okay. No, are the cameras on you? Keep crying. Throw yourself on the floor.
[3:35:52.720 --> 3:35:57.120]  Throw yourself on the floor right now. Malala left me for a competitor and you haven't
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:36:02.480]  heard her f***ing name in two years. And you never will again. David Hobb won't take a f***ing
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:08.160]  meeting. I sent 30 pairs of sneakers to his dorm. Jesus Christ. Tell Malala she's got to come out
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:14.400]  as non-binary. She wants heat now. That's the way it is. Nobody gives a s*** about landmines anymore.
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:21.200]  It's all climate. Climate is sexy. Climate and guns. Clean water. That hasn't been hot since
[3:36:21.200 --> 3:36:27.200]  the f***ing late 90s. Do people even f***ing drink water? Wake the f*** up. I got the Covington kids
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:32.800]  and Nathan Phillips on a reconciliation tour opening for Lizzo. Who is it? Emma Gonzalez?
[3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:39.280]  Don't put her through. She s***ed me for the last time. I had her booked at Davos. She got sick.
[3:36:39.280 --> 3:36:45.280]  You get sick at Davos? We got a new version of the Pole Brothers from Syria. They're f***ing
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:50.000]  hilarious. They do pranks. One of them's missing an arm and they have fun with that. It's great.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:55.600]  We got a kid with a cleft lip, but he's cute. I want hog at Madison Square Garden. People are
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:37:00.640]  turning in their guns and crying to him. They're handing their guns over to him and they're crying.
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:05.280]  Yeah, this is just Jason. I got to call him for David. Yeah, just let him know that I called. We
[3:37:05.280 --> 3:37:09.600]  actually sent some stuff in the mail over if he could take a look at it. Just a few sneakers and
[3:37:10.160 --> 3:37:20.560]  okay, sure. Yeah. We got a kid right now. He has no limbs. He is f***ing hilarious.
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:29.040]  And he does a whole bit about the refugee crisis. You have no idea how hard this kid is gonna hit
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:36.400]  when he hits. Do you understand? No limbs. We walk him out. We put him in a seat and he just f***ing
[3:37:36.400 --> 3:37:42.960]  goes, man. He just goes. These kids will own you one day. I will make sure of it. They will f***ing
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:48.320]  own you. I got a three-year-old from Iceland in Gunnar. He loves economics. He's talking about
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:54.000]  debt peonage. I got him at the World Bank in three weeks. F*** you. And this is a real guy.
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:58.400]  That's an A. I mean, this is a guy like these kids are representing. You're reading my mind.
[3:37:58.400 --> 3:38:02.480]  Yeah. Because we didn't pre-talk. We're here on air. We're taping air, but it's like live. We're
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:07.920]  not. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've not been in Hollywood much, but that's how these people act. Yeah.
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:12.800]  And they literally are drumming up the PR. This is like real. Yeah. So it's not even comedy. You're
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:16.720]  just showing people, stylize what's happening. So explain that. Well, yeah. I mean, it's funny,
[3:38:16.720 --> 3:38:20.400]  but it's absolutely true. I mean, people have said to me in the, you know, in agencies in
[3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:23.920]  Hollywood, they're like, that gets passed around because people go, yeah, like that guy exit.
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:28.320]  Like, why is, why do they all act like that? I mean, it's just the way they act. And I take
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:32.480]  authoritarian. They just got to say this opportunity. They got to find opportunities. So these kids
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:36.000]  that have been through horrible tragedies, if they think there's some political juice in them,
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:38.800]  or if there's money there, they're just trying to sniff out money. And it's crazy
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:44.400]  that there are people that represent those kids. I mean, it's the way you act is just
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:50.000]  some corrupt producers in general. Yeah. I mean, it's just a wild town. It's a wild town,
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:54.320]  Hollywood. They're just trying to sniff out money, man. They're monetizing tragedy.
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:59.120]  There's no one around it. Yeah. They're trying to get behind these, you know, these political
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:02.320]  points. And then there's things where it's like they'll lose money sometimes to make a point.
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:08.640]  Roseanne had a lot of, you know, and yeah, and they didn't, you know, so they were,
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:12.400]  they kind of dropped Roseanne and they're like, well, it's interesting. So there's ideology
[3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:15.920]  play as well as money. Well, there's an exercise of power. Yeah. And I mean, obviously, George
[3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:22.000]  Soros isn't was a Nazi. He said, happy making best time of his life. Oh, really? Oh, I show
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:28.640]  the clip is boy, that's that's not good. Is that what he said? He said, uh, was a was exhilarating.
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:33.600]  Okay, that's a few up soros to me that the master club, we like five clips of him, but
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:38.000]  he said it was happy making best time of his life exhilarating and powering up. God,
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:42.960]  really odd. Yeah. And he's like trying to take me off air as a Nazi. I'm like, yeah. Last time
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:47.120]  I checked, you know, everybody goes, my grandfather's world, but both were in the army. Yeah. Yeah.
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:51.920]  Yeah. Well, you know, war heroes. So I mean, it's just been to drop. Well, they made you into
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:39:55.600]  the they've made you into the boogeyman. They've made you into the guy that has to be gotten rid
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:40:00.240]  of, you know, and then yeah, then they get obsessed. It doesn't happen. Yeah. Yeah. And you know,
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:07.200]  listen, it's not credit to me. Right. But the fact that it's made the listeners support more. Right.
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:15.200]  I mean, like, yeah, yeah, it's wild to me that, you know, you know, positions that people held
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:20.160]  10 years ago, they're being called a Nazi for holding today. You know, Trump has echoed Obama
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:25.440]  and Clinton statements on immigration. You know, he said like a border should exist. Yeah, right.
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:28.720]  Right. It was should be a country. And that doesn't mean I agree with everything Trump does. But
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:33.760]  like, when did that become a position of a fascist? Yeah, that's kind of why I just read a lot of
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:38.400]  what Trump does. Yeah. And almost resent having to back him because their attacks on him are so
[3:40:38.400 --> 3:40:41.600]  authoritarian. I'm kind of like, man, I don't like what Trump's doing. But you know what? You
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:45.680]  saying he's a Nazi and shouldn't exist. And lying about him, I had to defend him. It's really
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:50.080]  irritating. And it's also like they're, I'm sure there's real Nazis. I don't think they're a sizeable
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:55.120]  contingent. And I don't think they have any political power. Yeah, a New York liberal, a freaking
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:59.680]  Nazi. Yeah, yeah, kind of crazy. Yeah. Yeah. And all these old fashioned liberal, well, he's like
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:05.200]  blue collar, like we're gonna get jobs back. We're gonna. Yeah. Oh my God. Right. Right. And I think
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:08.880]  the reality is a lot of people truly hate him because he came out of the Hollywood system.
[3:41:08.880 --> 3:41:13.040]  They feel like maybe he turned on them. And they feel like, you know, these people want to be 100%.
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:17.120]  A lot of these people, he chumped them. Yeah, a lot of you look at a Twitter feed and you go, oh,
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:21.040]  you want to be Hitler, like you'll see some of these people that are authoritarian. You're like,
[3:41:21.040 --> 3:41:25.840]  you're a man of Trump because you want to be Trump. And that's what the problem is. Like they
[3:41:25.840 --> 3:41:31.120]  want to be Hitler invaded countries. Of course, trying to get out of countries. Right. And here's
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:36.160]  the deal. People go, Alex, you sold out, you support Trump. He's totally anti establishment.
[3:41:36.160 --> 3:41:41.760]  I'm anti establishment. This is a wet dream. He goes sideways. I'm a lot of stuff. I'm pissed at
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:46.080]  Trump. I mean, I'm like, man, I was 90% there a few years ago. Now I'm like, you know, I'm on the
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:51.280]  cult, man. He's really irritating me on the right stuff. Right. But he ain't Hillary Clinton. Yeah.
[3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:56.240]  Yeah. And so I'm not going to buy their BS about Trump. If they had legitimate attacks on him,
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:00.560]  that would be effective. Yeah. But they have nothing to offer. Like Tulsi Gabbard or something.
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:04.480]  I would like, I like her. Yeah. Tulsi's great. But they notice they suppress her. They don't want
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:09.680]  a real opposition. Yeah. She doesn't want, she doesn't come up like a day of the dead. They live
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:13.120]  zombie. Yeah. They don't want to say, I mean, they try to stand back Sanders like anyone with a
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:17.280]  critique of the establishment, they don't want. Yeah. They don't want their stuff. So we finally,
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:22.320]  the way to sneak up was not some left winger, but was a right-winger. Right. And he got in,
[3:42:22.320 --> 3:42:27.440]  and it's beautiful. Yeah. And unfortunately, what you've seen happen is instead of people saying,
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:31.520]  we need more speech, more debate, more argument, people have said, let's not, we're not going to
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:34.800]  argue, we're not going to debate. And it's like, to me, it's fun. It's fun to talk to people disagree
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:40.000]  with. Well, you should come back, especially after the platform. Yeah. After on the platform,
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.640]  I'll be living outside, by the way. I appreciate it. Just throw me a spare rib as you come in here.
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:50.800]  And folks, we've got Ed McMahon, Johnny Carson's former co-host. This is incredible. Ed McMahon,

[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:16.720]  something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really
[3:43:16.720 --> 3:43:20.880]  amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there,

[3:44:47.920 --> 3:44:56.320]  of the fight. InfoWars brought to you by you. It's a total war. The globalists know they're
[3:44:56.320 --> 3:45:02.320]  losing politically so they want to start a violent confrontation where they can cast gun owners as
[3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:08.960]  KKK operatives and try to then project that false image on Trump and try to remove him
[3:45:08.960 --> 3:45:14.480]  via the 25th Amendment or during the impeachment trial. Not for the charges they've brought
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:21.440]  forward of obstructing Congress and abuse of power. So it's that backdrop of a mass shooting,
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:26.560]  the backdrop of a race war that they want to project onto America and onto Trump. But the
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:32.560]  good news is we have an independent, real American media. We have the Paul Revere system that is
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:37.280]  InfoWars. We have you, the audience that are activists in the arena. So I salute you and I
[3:45:37.280 --> 3:45:42.480]  thank you and I encourage you to share the live links of our coverage of Virginia and the impeachment
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:47.280]  trial and to get the great products at inforwarsstore.com because without you, we could shut down
[3:45:47.280 --> 3:45:50.560]  great products right now, new sales, inforwarsstore.com.
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:56.560]  I want to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:01.200]  maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:04.400]  ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get
[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:10.480]  up there and tell me. And so here I am telling people Super Silver whitening toothpaste is by
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:15.520]  far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different
[3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:20.800]  toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the
[3:46:20.800 --> 3:46:26.400]  coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that
[3:46:26.400 --> 3:46:31.040]  I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good.
[3:46:31.040 --> 3:46:36.800]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[3:46:36.800 --> 3:46:42.560]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way
[3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:46.640]  it feels.
[3:46:54.880 --> 3:46:58.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:46:58.640 --> 3:47:06.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:10.400]  Back from the gray,
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:12.720]  the Lazarus effect.
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:17.600]  This year, been able to leave home.
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:21.360]  Yeah, there's a co-host of Johnny Carson
[3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:26.880]  is here with us. Now, seriously, we got a few more clubs to play here.
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:30.800]  You guys direct these, but I like Ben.
[3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:34.960]  He's good. He's the producer. Thank you. This is he's very excited to be here.
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:38.560]  He's like the Russians that are behind us. Yeah, Ben is pulling all the strings.
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:45.920]  Everything I say is just, yeah. Listen, I'm obviously, what's that guy's name?
[3:47:45.920 --> 3:47:48.880]  Who am I supposed to be? The comedian? Bill Hicks. Yeah.
[3:47:48.880 --> 3:47:52.800]  You want to interview Bill Hicks? Go ahead.
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:57.360]  I'm going to stop right there. Yeah. Tell us, Ed McMahon, what we should do.
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:00.160]  What is the secret of the universe? Kind of like in Caddy Shaggy goes,
[3:48:00.160 --> 3:48:04.080]  you know, he didn't give me a tip, but he told me the secret of the universe is
[3:48:04.080 --> 3:48:08.000]  unga ga bonka blunga. Unga ga blunga.
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:10.960]  Do you want me to tell you the secret to the universe? Is that what you want me to
[3:48:10.960 --> 3:48:13.520]  tell you? Yeah. Well, let me tell you something, Alex.
[3:48:13.520 --> 3:48:16.880]  I'm also a bottle of Jack Daniels, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a chili dog.
[3:48:16.880 --> 3:48:20.720]  No, sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say I'm also kind of retarded.
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:26.160]  I am too. Brother. No, I said like sometimes I'm kind of retarded.
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:31.680]  Yeah. And I think that's the best way to be. I think that's the goal for many of us.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:34.800]  The next clip we're doing, we did for, we did a sketch where I dressed up as
[3:48:34.800 --> 3:48:39.280]  Jeffrey Epstein's temple and I walked around LA. Oh, truly disturbed people.
[3:48:39.280 --> 3:48:42.720]  That's the sex slave base in the Caribbean. Yeah. By the way, the thing is the media
[3:48:42.720 --> 3:48:45.920]  has no interest in figuring out what the hell it is. We almost win a month ago.
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:47.440]  Yeah. We were always going to go to the island.
[3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:51.040]  Hey, was it true that he was like really depressed by all the things?
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:55.520]  Oh, oh, yeah. I just can't believe that every man's here.
[3:48:55.520 --> 3:48:59.520]  Yeah. It's an honor. And this video was like, we dressed up as Epstein's temple.
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:02.800]  We walked around LA. I was pretending I was, you know, Epstein's temple.
[3:49:02.800 --> 3:49:05.600]  And I'm like, where's it, you know, a sacrifice temple going to find work?
[3:49:05.600 --> 3:49:08.720]  LA, you know, because now he's out of work as his owner's dad.
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:12.560]  And then we just, you know, we walked around at Los Angeles, did a bunch of crazy things.
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:13.040]  Here it is.
[3:49:13.040 --> 3:49:17.280]  Newsfeed presents.
[3:49:18.560 --> 3:49:20.960]  Yeah, that's a hot body. It's my dad.
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:24.240]  It's hot either.
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:27.280]  As a sacrifice temple, there's not a lot of cities you can work.
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:29.520]  This is one of the only cities.
[3:49:30.960 --> 3:49:35.440]  You know, the problem is a lot of these people already have sacrifice temples they've been
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:39.040]  using for years. So to break into it at this point is very hard.
[3:49:39.040 --> 3:49:45.200]  Jack, like you don't remember me. I remember you. Last July, we had a lot of fun. Come on.
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:50.960]  Wow. That outfit. He knows. I gotta get into entertainment. I'm trying to do that.
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:54.800]  Has anybody else's boss also killed himself?
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:00.560]  He's like, weird. You know, listen, the other thing is his eyeballs
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:01.840]  have broken below his capillaries.
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:06.720]  I thought I would work until retirement, but now I'm fucking, you know,
[3:50:06.720 --> 3:50:10.720]  now you're in LA trying to break an entertainment. This is my dream.
[3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:18.240]  I was one of his kind of comedian, even when Hillary Clinton was slicing the
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:21.120]  throat of children, I said, I just want to make people laugh.
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:25.200]  Wow. My owner is dead-ish, wherever he is.
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:30.240]  Cronk should have you host the next press, press, what's that called, the press briefing,
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:31.920]  the press. Yeah, I mean, here we go. We're gonna get killed.
[3:50:31.920 --> 3:50:34.000]  The press awards. I mean, this is the video you watch and go,
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:35.520]  this will be the one that gets me killed.
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:37.760]  This will be the one that, you know,
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:44.160]  He fucking loud and everything we're both
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:50.800]  pervs and weirdos. Okay. Everybody's like, it wasn't always sacrifice.
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:52.240]  Sometimes it was music night.
[3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:55.600]  Yeah. I love the cost.
[3:50:55.600 --> 3:50:57.520]  I get hired for job like everybody else.
[3:50:58.240 --> 3:51:00.320]  People do what they're gonna fucking do.
[3:51:00.320 --> 3:51:08.480]  Yeah. I'm like a bouncy castle for satanic pedophiles. You know, that's not all I want to be.
[3:51:08.480 --> 3:51:13.440]  Finally just got headshots, meeting with a manager, don't know how it's going to work,
[3:51:13.440 --> 3:51:17.840]  don't expect anything. Somebody told me to start a podcast.
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:20.320]  I mean, I guess I love how you make fun of the Hollywood system.
[3:51:20.320 --> 3:51:22.400]  That's the relief. You've got to do it.
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:24.240]  This is where it's at now, you know.
[3:51:24.240 --> 3:51:41.840]  You know, it's easy to hide their whole networks and their decline, but I don't want to overstate it.
[3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:44.640]  You guys are out in LA a lot more than I am probably.
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:46.800]  What is happening to Hollywood and the whole power structure?
[3:51:46.800 --> 3:51:50.800]  Like it seems like the shine is off, the mystique is gone.
[3:51:50.800 --> 3:51:54.800]  Yeah. I think, listen, there's good people in Hollywood, there's good people in the CIA,
[3:51:54.800 --> 3:51:57.440]  there are patriots and those are good, but there are bad people.
[3:51:57.440 --> 3:51:59.360]  There are bad people that have done a lot of things that have abused them.
[3:51:59.360 --> 3:52:00.720]  And they get together and do worse stuff.
[3:52:00.720 --> 3:52:04.400]  I mean, they get together. I mean, they've abused women and children and we're only starting.
[3:52:04.400 --> 3:52:07.120]  I think they're gonna be hung up on their fricking.
[3:52:07.120 --> 3:52:13.040]  Yeah. 100% and I think those people now because of technology, I think those people are
[3:52:13.600 --> 3:52:17.200]  starting to see their power base being challenged for the first time.
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:19.760]  And I think maybe they made the exact wrong response.
[3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:24.160]  Yeah. And I think they took the bait. You're dead.
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:27.280]  Yeah. So I think there is a little bit of, you know, people, because there's a lot of people
[3:52:27.280 --> 3:52:30.400]  out there that are good people that want to make funny stuff, good stuff, good movies.
[3:52:30.960 --> 3:52:33.840]  But then there are bad people. There's the evil oppressors on top.
[3:52:33.840 --> 3:52:35.360]  Well, it's like DC. It's like, you know,
[3:52:35.360 --> 3:52:38.800]  because once people gave in to intimidation, the worst spiders got in control.
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:40.400]  I mean, you said back to DC. LA.
[3:52:40.400 --> 3:52:41.280]  Ed McMahon's here.
[3:52:43.120 --> 3:52:46.880]  No, seriously, folks, if you're a radio listener, Ed McMahon, that's what's happening.
[3:52:46.880 --> 3:52:47.680]  He sees amazing.
[3:52:47.680 --> 3:52:48.560]  But get back to that. You're right.
[3:52:48.560 --> 3:52:52.400]  You see an LA. So what happens once that the shine is off, the collapse happens?
[3:52:52.400 --> 3:52:56.480]  I just think what's going to happen is you're going to have, and it's going to take a while,
[3:52:56.480 --> 3:53:02.480]  but I think you're just going to have people caring less and less about these institutions.
[3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:04.240]  And people are going to have to build.
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:05.680]  Yeah, they'll still watch it, but they're not authoritative.
[3:53:05.680 --> 3:53:08.240]  I think you have to, yeah. I think you have to build new institutions.
[3:53:08.240 --> 3:53:10.160]  I think that's the whole thing. You know, Bill Hicks did that joke.
[3:53:10.160 --> 3:53:13.360]  You did that joke where you said all these institutions are failing because they're irrelevant.
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:13.840]  I did.
[3:53:13.840 --> 3:53:16.640]  So I think a lot of these institutions are irrelevant because they've sheltered a lot
[3:53:16.640 --> 3:53:20.080]  of abusers and bad people. And, you know, it will take a while,
[3:53:20.080 --> 3:53:23.040]  but I do think a lot of that stuff will in Hollywood.
[3:53:23.040 --> 3:53:25.840]  There are gifts to like destroy anybody that's up and coming.
[3:53:25.840 --> 3:53:29.040]  It's not going to work because the people have a desire to make more lives.
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:29.040]  Yeah.
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:29.040]  Yeah.
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:31.680]  It's like, you can people are just going to keep making stuff.
[3:53:31.680 --> 3:53:34.000]  And I think people are just going to keep being independent.
[3:53:34.000 --> 3:53:34.880]  That's all I want.
[3:53:34.880 --> 3:53:36.400]  Yeah. And that's what we want either.
[3:53:36.400 --> 3:53:37.120]  It's just connected.
[3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:40.480]  Hey, you're a cap city comedy club and I could be there on band.
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:41.200]  I wish you could.
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:44.320]  I would get you a comp tickets and be fun, but then, you know,
[3:53:44.320 --> 3:53:46.880]  we're both going to kill myself if they don't let me in. It's a joke.
[3:53:46.880 --> 3:53:47.680]  It's a joke.
[3:53:47.680 --> 3:53:48.560]  Like a recipe tomorrow.
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:49.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[3:53:49.840 --> 3:53:51.200]  I'd bring you up on stage.
[3:53:51.200 --> 3:53:53.200]  If I was bombing, I'd be like, Alex is here.
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:54.160]  I need that.
[3:53:54.160 --> 3:53:55.440]  I need that break.
[3:53:55.440 --> 3:53:56.400]  I need that break.
[3:53:56.400 --> 3:53:56.960]  Yeah.
[3:53:56.960 --> 3:53:58.640]  Please cap city comedy club, please.
[3:53:58.640 --> 3:53:59.120]  Yeah.
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:00.240]  Please come and go.
[3:54:00.880 --> 3:54:01.840]  Anytime.
[3:54:01.840 --> 3:54:03.120]  Please have me up.
[3:54:03.120 --> 3:54:06.560]  Hey, it's that that pediness of the authoritarian though.
[3:54:06.560 --> 3:54:06.720]  Yeah.
[3:54:06.720 --> 3:54:09.040]  They've made their whole fortune off comedy and free speech.
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:10.160]  But now they don't like it.
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:10.480]  Yeah.
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:12.880]  I can't stop me trying to get on your goddamn stage.
[3:54:12.880 --> 3:54:15.360]  No, yes, I don't want to go up there and do it.
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:17.360]  It's the fact that you're such a chicken.
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:18.000]  You know what?
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:19.520]  It just it's it's disgusting.
[3:54:19.520 --> 3:54:19.760]  Right.
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:21.520]  And then live in America's bosom.
[3:54:21.520 --> 3:54:21.840]  Yes.
[3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:23.600]  America's big juicy milky.
[3:54:23.600 --> 3:54:23.920]  Right.
[3:54:23.920 --> 3:54:25.040]  Big pink toppers.
[3:54:25.040 --> 3:54:26.400]  Also, thanks for booking me.
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:26.960]  But thanks.
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:28.160]  He does have a little point.
[3:54:28.160 --> 3:54:28.320]  We do.
[3:54:28.320 --> 3:54:29.520]  He does have a point.
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:32.240]  Hey, I do enjoy the club, but you do have a point.
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:32.960]  No, you're right.
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:33.680]  You're right.
[3:54:33.680 --> 3:54:34.320]  No, whatever.
[3:54:34.320 --> 3:54:35.680]  No, I'm out of them as well.
[3:54:35.680 --> 3:54:36.080]  Oh, God.
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:36.320]  Yeah.
[3:54:36.320 --> 3:54:36.560]  Yeah.
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:37.520]  But no, it's listening.
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:38.960]  It's crazy.
[3:54:38.960 --> 3:54:40.640]  Hey, Mr. Sir, we got this last clip.
[3:54:40.640 --> 3:54:41.040]  Yeah.
[3:54:41.040 --> 3:54:43.200]  What is this last clip? What is this? J'vay, sir?
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:45.440]  No, this is Epstein's security guard.
[3:54:45.440 --> 3:54:46.080]  Oh, is it?
[3:54:46.080 --> 3:54:46.400]  Yeah.
[3:54:46.400 --> 3:54:46.720]  OK.
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:47.280]  Yeah, this is the phone line.
[3:54:47.280 --> 3:54:48.240]  That's the data out of the place.
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:50.880]  This was this was this was the guy that we imagined
[3:54:50.880 --> 3:54:51.840]  guarding Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:54:51.840 --> 3:54:52.320]  Here it is.
[3:54:52.320 --> 3:54:54.000]  This is Jeffrey Epstein's security guard.
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:56.960]  Hey, my name is Tommy Del Vecchio de Benedetto,
[3:54:56.960 --> 3:55:01.200]  and I was Jerry Epstein's security guard at the Metropolitan Detention Center.
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:05.520]  A lot of people online are trying to pin this on the Clinton's.
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:07.840]  Let me tell you, man, they're good people.
[3:55:07.840 --> 3:55:08.880]  They love this guy.
[3:55:08.880 --> 3:55:12.080]  They visited him three times this week in the middle of the fucking night
[3:55:12.080 --> 3:55:14.080]  because they didn't want to make a big deal out of it
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:15.440]  because they're fucking humble.
[3:55:15.440 --> 3:55:18.160]  You should have seen Hillary Clinton when she saw him.
[3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:20.640]  It was like a fucking dog that it just, you know,
[3:55:20.640 --> 3:55:22.720]  when their owners in Iraq and he comes back,
[3:55:22.720 --> 3:55:24.480]  she just fucking lunged at him.
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:25.680]  She went right for him.
[3:55:25.680 --> 3:55:27.200]  I had to pull her off him.
[3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:28.720]  She was so fucking excited.
[3:55:28.720 --> 3:55:30.400]  They fucking loved each other.
[3:55:30.400 --> 3:55:32.560]  Sometimes that's what happens on Suicide Watch.
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:33.600]  People come in suicide.
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:35.280]  That's why they call it Suicide Watch.
[3:55:35.280 --> 3:55:38.800]  The Clinton's, man, they gave a fuck about this guy.
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:40.400]  They're like a fucking family.
[3:55:40.400 --> 3:55:42.800]  I mean, the night he died, they were here praying with him.
[3:55:42.800 --> 3:55:45.120]  They looked like they were drinking like wine
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:47.200]  or some dark red liquid in a chalice,
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:49.760]  and they were all fucking chanting in the cell together.
[3:55:49.760 --> 3:55:51.120]  It was fucking beautiful.
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:52.960]  I didn't even know why it was fucking in here.
[3:55:52.960 --> 3:55:54.800]  I thought it was like he hired some illegals,
[3:55:54.800 --> 3:55:57.120]  you know, because he's got like an all-inclusive in the Bahamas,
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:55:59.600]  but my friend said he had underage girls in there.
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:02.320]  And I said, you know, my cousin had that fucking problem,
[3:56:02.320 --> 3:56:03.120]  but you know what he did?
[3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:05.280]  He found a girl that looked young,
[3:56:05.280 --> 3:56:07.040]  but was really old as shit.
[3:56:07.040 --> 3:56:10.480]  You know those girls that like look 14, but they're 40?
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:11.680]  You go and see their face.
[3:56:11.680 --> 3:56:12.800]  It's like real rough.
[3:56:12.800 --> 3:56:15.600]  The skin by the creases of their mouth is like raw.
[3:56:15.600 --> 3:56:17.520]  But you know, you know what I'm fucking with you, Donna?
[3:56:17.520 --> 3:56:19.120]  You know I fucking love you.
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:20.320]  You saved that man's life.
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:24.000]  It wasn't a bad dude, Jerry Epstein.
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:25.520]  You know, he's not a bad fucking dude.
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:27.920]  A lot of beliefs there.
[3:56:27.920 --> 3:56:29.600]  A lot of beliefs, but it's a lot of beliefs.
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:33.200]  Now his three bones broken in his neck, broken eyeballs.
[3:56:33.200 --> 3:56:34.160]  This is not good.
[3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:34.720]  Yeah.
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:38.560]  Well, you know, there was no way that trial could have ever happened.
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:40.720]  I mean, aren't you glad you're not that...
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:41.920]  Put his face back up, please.
[3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:43.840]  That selfish, sure look.
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:46.320]  The only guy that looks like a bigger pedophile is Brian Stelter.
[3:56:46.320 --> 3:56:47.360]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:49.840]  I'm saying the only guy, like if you bred,
[3:56:49.840 --> 3:56:52.240]  if you bred Brian Stelter, which every Epstein,
[3:56:52.240 --> 3:56:57.040]  you would have the pedicure 100% anti-Christ of pedophiles.
[3:56:57.040 --> 3:56:58.400]  Do you think there's any chance he's alive?
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:00.000]  No, we don't know.
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:02.960]  You know, I had this CIA guy on his head that, but I don't know.
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:03.920]  There's this info.
[3:57:03.920 --> 3:57:05.440]  We can't... But now it's gotten crazy.
[3:57:05.440 --> 3:57:06.800]  We're above the CIA.
[3:57:06.800 --> 3:57:08.400]  You realize right now, you're like above.
[3:57:08.400 --> 3:57:09.360]  You're like...
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:10.560]  Yeah, we're above the CIA.
[3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:12.480]  Well, I'm not bragging, but you're kind of a top thing, man.
[3:57:12.480 --> 3:57:13.680]  Well, I mean, thank you.
[3:57:13.680 --> 3:57:15.520]  The orders come down for me.
[3:57:15.520 --> 3:57:16.560]  Good, good.
[3:57:16.560 --> 3:57:17.360]  I appreciate it.
[3:57:17.360 --> 3:57:18.480]  I get my orders from Putin.
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:19.360]  We get the jokes from Putin.
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:20.240]  Oh, hell yeah.
[3:57:20.240 --> 3:57:21.440]  We get the emails from Putin.
[3:57:21.440 --> 3:57:22.720]  Let me give you the big secret.
[3:57:22.720 --> 3:57:26.720]  Vladimir Putin takes his orders from Alexander Joplin.
[3:57:26.720 --> 3:57:28.480]  He gets dressed up.
[3:57:28.480 --> 3:57:30.800]  He gets down on his knees every night.
[3:57:30.800 --> 3:57:32.560]  He prays for me.
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:34.320]  He says, Daddy Jones, get down.
[3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:35.840]  Oh, and I say, putty.
[3:57:35.840 --> 3:57:37.520]  My little putty pooch.
[3:57:37.520 --> 3:57:57.200]  You get your putty pooch right now.
