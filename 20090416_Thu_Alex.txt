[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:39.920]  Texas Alex Jones on CNN on CBS Fox News every radio show I tuned into this
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.080]  morning and I listened to radio in the background for hours this morning and
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.920]  then I was on man cow Muller syndicated show on talk radio network he was
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.280]  talking about it and then I was driving into the office I heard judge
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.760]  Napolitano with his syndicated radio show talking about it and saying both
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.640]  the left and right are controlled the Republican supported the Patriot Act in
[01:03.640 --> 01:07.360]  the New World Order and now it's just continuing under Obama that was the
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.120]  only place I heard that the only place I heard truth and he is the best guy over
[01:13.120 --> 01:16.520]  at Fox and I guess that's why they keep him in the basement you know people
[01:16.520 --> 01:21.040]  think that when I go on his show I'm on Fox News that's Fox internet they're
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.000]  there kind of doing what we've been doing the last year they just started
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.840]  this last few months doing a internet show internet TV but judge Napolitano
[01:34.840 --> 01:47.160]  will be joining us coming up in the last hour of the show today we will also of
[01:47.160 --> 01:54.120]  course have a Stuart Rhodes of oath keepers with the big meeting coming up

[01:57.760 --> 02:02.760]  Revolutionary War with all these police and military and famous Navy Seal
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.880]  Captain people that head up rolling thunder just I mean a big mainline move
[02:08.880 --> 02:15.000]  by mainline conservatives to say no to the New World Order so a big awakening
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.440]  taking place there he'll be popping in with another update on that we're gonna
[02:18.440 --> 02:24.760]  have open phones though for the entirety of this transmission in fact I'm gonna be

[02:30.320 --> 02:40.440]  and I did Jason Bermas's show last night I sat in for the full three hours to be
[02:40.440 --> 02:49.480]  technical two hours and 50 minutes into the last segment by himself and we did
[02:49.480 --> 02:52.280]  pretty good we took about 20 30 phone calls I don't know we're gonna do the
[02:52.280 --> 03:00.800]  same thing I want to hear what happened at the Tea Party events we've confirmed
[03:00.800 --> 03:05.720]  reports of socialists showing up and screaming and yelling and pushing people
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.480]  and throwing a backpack into the crowd and saying it was a bomb and running off
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.760]  and police doing nothing this is confirming that the establishment is
[03:13.760 --> 03:19.440]  trying to start riots I saw the CNN clip this morning where the reporter was
[03:19.440 --> 03:21.960]  coming up yelling and screaming at people and getting in their faces and
[03:21.960 --> 03:27.680]  shoving on them I mean they're really trying to start a fight here so we want

[03:41.320 --> 03:45.040]  takes me a week or so to analyze something before I really can break down
[03:45.040 --> 03:50.880]  exactly what's happening and I know exactly what's going on with the Tea
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.560]  Parties with the in the Fed with Rick Perry saying Texas may secede yesterday

[04:14.000 --> 04:16.840]  handing over all the major roads in Texas to foreign companies even when the
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.720]  legislature votes against it the guy that said it's the law you got to take
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.640]  HPV vaccines that kill the girls that take it many of them and he turns out he
[04:25.640 --> 04:32.040]  did that knowingly with Merck financing because by ordering the state health
[04:32.040 --> 04:36.400]  departments to make it quote mandatory which is another fraud that kicks in
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.120]  liability protection and federal funds so they knew they had a deadly drug they
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.920]  knew that something that was going to be worthless so they dumped it just like
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.640]  Bayer did with the AIDS filled vaccines HIV filled remember that they just
[04:49.640 --> 04:55.240]  knowingly dumped it on the market and and are selling it for 800 bucks for

[08:23.080 --> 08:27.480]  Republicans are pretty much in disarray they would the one thing they agree on
[08:27.480 --> 08:31.040]  is that they were really warning about the deficits that there's too much
[08:31.040 --> 08:34.440]  spending and I think they will I think they will be dragged kicking and
[08:34.440 --> 08:37.520]  screaming to any more intervention of the canal he's talking about but they
[08:37.520 --> 08:42.520]  have not yet come up with a compelling alternative one that has gained popular
[08:42.520 --> 08:48.240]  recognition so well they get the tea bagging but there was an interesting
[08:48.240 --> 08:51.800]  political survey was out today that said that you know the president's the
[08:51.800 --> 08:57.360]  trust level in the president on economic issues is extremely high and you
[08:57.360 --> 09:00.880]  know then everybody else the administration is well below him but
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.320]  the Republicans are a little below that so Republicans have got away they still
[09:04.320 --> 09:07.560]  haven't found their voice Anderson they're still there this happens to a
[09:07.560 --> 09:10.720]  minority party after it's lost a couple of bad elections but they're searching
[09:10.720 --> 09:15.120]  for their voice it's hard to talk in your TV again David Gergen appreciate it very
[09:15.120 --> 09:22.760]  much Ali Delcey as well thanks very much now you know it is not my job to
[09:22.760 --> 09:36.280]  teach people the vocabulary the nomenclature of high school jokes but
[09:36.280 --> 09:43.400]  teabagging and since CNN and MSNBC and every other channel are making fun of
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.480]  Americans protesting against out-of-control government and the
[09:48.480 --> 09:57.600]  police state we need to tell you what it means it it means that the people that
[09:57.600 --> 10:07.400]  are out protesting and demonstrating are repeatedly engaging basically in oral
[10:07.400 --> 10:15.800]  sex on the testicles that's what teabagging is and you know we don't
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.240]  this is in the Howard Stern show we don't get into these things I'm not hung
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.240]  up on it I mean I don't you know one way or the other my mind isn't even on
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.600]  those subjects I heard Bill O'Reilly last night freaking out and hyperventilating
[10:28.600 --> 10:32.600]  course it turns out he's engaged in all this bizarre really twisted phone sex
[10:32.600 --> 10:38.440]  the recording transcripts are out there of some really creepy perverts sounding
[10:38.440 --> 10:47.360]  stuff calling up one of his female colleagues but the issue here is this
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.960]  is unprecedented to have Anderson Cooper the heir to the Astor fortune people
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.240]  say who is the new world order it's Anderson Cooper this guy is the heir to
[10:58.240 --> 11:03.760]  foundations valued in excess of three billion different federal reports have
[11:03.760 --> 11:12.840]  stated so he doesn't pay taxes Anderson Cooper he has tax-free money and family
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.480]  estates all over the country in the world and helicopters and you know the
[11:17.480 --> 11:26.160]  real money is tax-free they run the show so to have the heir to the Astor's
[11:26.160 --> 11:33.960]  fortune who brags he was in the CIA still is and it was the east coast
[11:33.960 --> 11:40.480]  aristocracy that set up the CIA they brag about it Princeton and Yale and this
[11:40.480 --> 11:43.920]  is the ruling class this is how they carry out their crimes and he sits up
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.520]  there giggling with David Gergen the Carl rove to at least four
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.480]  administrations who blew up at me and got in my face when I asked about some
[11:52.480 --> 11:56.920]  of the secret homosexual meetings they have and they're all up there having a
[11:56.920 --> 12:03.480]  big fun frolic with themselves teabagging is generally associated as being
[12:03.480 --> 12:09.320]  more popular in gay sex and you can watch when I bring up the gay sex to
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.520]  Gergen he won't deny he says it's none of your business and starts freaking out
[12:13.520 --> 12:21.000]  on me and in my whole issue is if these guys like to teabag that is their own
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.880]  issue I mean I'm sorry don't call all these families and all of these good
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.760]  Americans and people that are out there losing their jobs most people that I've
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.160]  talked to were at the event said it was working class people who drove in from
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.240]  little towns and cities all across the country to these big events in major
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.120]  cities in Atlanta and New York City and Houston Texas and San Antonio and
[12:49.120 --> 12:57.000]  Los Angeles and Detroit black white old young Hispanic Asian liberal
[12:57.000 --> 13:05.560]  conservative they were all there and let me lay out the basic facts now and I've
[13:05.560 --> 13:09.200]  asked Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to both do articles with their own perspectives
[13:09.200 --> 13:15.360]  on this but somebody has got to decode this and get the information out to
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.880]  people so they understand what's happening by the way man Cal Mueller joins
[13:20.880 --> 13:28.200]  us in 15 minutes to give us a quick report he ran a tea party with 10,000
[13:28.200 --> 13:37.920]  plus people in attendance and the media put Democratic Council people and
[13:37.920 --> 13:42.720]  others on TV in Chicago saying these are right-wing hate monger racist and
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.320]  that's what the myack reports and the new federal reports say you don't like
[13:47.320 --> 13:54.200]  your taxes you're racist and don't like the black president Barack Obama this is
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.320]  what it's boiled down to the time I caught bribery going on with a white
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.600]  guy paying off black guys to give anti-gun testimony they were really
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.400]  playing the race card there he was pimping the black guys out to scare
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.960]  whitey into banning guns in Texas and I just walk out he's paying them off and
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.320]  it came out in the newspaper it was illegal but it said but as Alex Jones
[14:11.320 --> 14:18.720]  racist these are black people they literally was in the newspaper so this
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.000]  this is the Soviet political correctness where I don't want to be a slave
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.880]  oh you don't like black people excuse me I didn't say anything about black
[14:28.880 --> 14:38.440]  people oh sure you didn't let me state this very very simply and succinctly
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.960]  exactly what's going on
[14:43.920 --> 14:53.480]  9-11 truth started having five years ago tea parties from Boston, Massachusetts
[14:53.480 --> 14:59.560]  to Austin, Texas from San Diego to Kansas City they're on record documented
[14:59.560 --> 15:05.560]  video of all of the web then the Ron Paul revolution didn't want to just go
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.960]  away when Ron Paul lost they were mad about the bailout six months ago and
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.240]  they had tea parties in DC Austin, Texas I got invited to the one in Austin was
[15:14.240 --> 15:17.320]  too busy to go but I was told there was like 500 people out there remember
[15:17.320 --> 15:22.240]  seeing video online I know the cops were threatening people saying don't throw
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.600]  your tea over you know all of this is going on and then we walk into the
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.240]  break room last night during a break and there's Fox saying the Ron Paul people
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.520]  are trying to hijack the tea parties
[15:38.720 --> 15:47.000]  yeah that's what the usurpers do they come in and they accuse you of what
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.080]  they're doing that's rules for radicals and that's what they followed now
[15:55.080 --> 16:01.800]  simply and succinctly don't think of the Republicans and Democrats being
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.760]  opposed to each other they're part of the ruling elite they share power in a
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.200]  revolving door just like the corporate chiefs go into government in one
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.240]  administration and then out of government in the next administration but
[16:12.240 --> 16:15.560]  back into the think tanks in the corporate system and then they all just
[16:15.560 --> 16:20.680]  symbol symbiotically pay each other off one group of CFR trial lateralist
[16:20.680 --> 16:27.120]  leaves when bush goes another group comes in same crowd in or Mary you'll
[16:27.120 --> 16:30.840]  have one brother that's a Democrat one brother that's the Republican you'll
[16:30.840 --> 16:33.680]  have Mary Madeline that's the Republican you'll have her husband that's the
[16:33.680 --> 16:36.080]  Democrat
[16:36.360 --> 16:41.240]  you know what's the old saying one person could eat no fat one could eat no
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.560]  lean so in between the two they lick the platter clean I forget the exact
[16:45.560 --> 16:54.320]  nursery rhyme so that's that's the philosophy the system the elites in
[16:54.320 --> 16:57.800]  control because they're smart they're slick they've studied statecraft in
[16:57.800 --> 17:07.280]  history and so it's simple you have a real grassroots movement of what people
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.160]  that formerly called themselves conservative libertarian liberal
[17:10.160 --> 17:16.600]  breaking the left-right paradigm who coined that term so I realized going
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.000]  back 12 years ago I said we got a break this left-right paradigm we've got to
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.200]  get past the puppets that they keep interchanging changing horses every time
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.480]  one of them gets tired the tag team wrestling the WWF I've always made that
[17:29.480 --> 17:37.640]  point now it's popularized because it's common sense and that's what's going on
[17:37.640 --> 17:41.320]  here and I'm tired of watching the sideshow I'm tired of looking at the
[17:41.320 --> 17:47.000]  ponds as one caller said I'm focusing on the major head pieces I'm focusing on
[17:47.000 --> 17:56.920]  the the back line the king the queen the rooks the knights the bishops so the
[17:56.920 --> 18:02.800]  rooks are the castles for those don't know so what's happening they divide up
[18:02.800 --> 18:08.200]  and go out and occupy the grassroots but they can't have one monolithic party
[18:08.200 --> 18:13.000]  that does that folks would then say well we're the other group so the other group
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.920]  is whichever parties out of power right now the republicans and the
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.320]  republicans are in power warrantless wiretapping secret arrest tripling the
[18:20.320 --> 18:24.840]  size of government trying to reauthorize his soul up its bill trying to pass
[18:24.840 --> 18:30.120]  amnesty warrantless checkpoints federalization of police Obama comes
[18:30.120 --> 18:34.560]  in everything stays the same but goes into high gear not because he's a
[18:34.560 --> 18:40.800]  democrat or republican but because he's fresh so they always move fast when they
[18:40.800 --> 18:44.400]  first get in before opposition forms when everybody's kind of dumbfounded
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.920]  hoping for change hoping above hope that everything's okay when the same elite

[22:25.600 --> 22:29.760]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is

[24:02.600 --> 24:06.640]  I know I told you we're going to your calls and we are Brian Bill Joe Kurt
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.160]  Matthew we just got man cow baller we have this report from the tea party they
[24:11.160 --> 24:15.240]  had in Chicago coming up for about 10 minutes in the next segment and then
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.280]  straight through your calls right into the third hour of the show that we have
[24:19.280 --> 24:26.640]  several guests like Judge Napolitano joining us but we are back live okay
[24:26.640 --> 24:32.160]  breaking this down simply think of it as a block and that block is split into two
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.160]  Republican and Democrat they're bought and paid for by the New World Order
[24:35.160 --> 24:39.840]  totally and that's why the mainstream media whether it's Fox or CNN always
[24:39.840 --> 24:45.040]  tries to frame it like a left-wing or a right-wing issue liberal versus
[24:45.040 --> 24:51.320]  conservative because then they control both of those phony ideologies that is
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.080]  the politicians may claim their liberal or claim their conservative but really
[24:55.080 --> 25:01.000]  it's just corporate expansion of globalist power and so CNN is just
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.280]  desperate to keep what you call progressives or liberals or anti-bush
[25:07.280 --> 25:11.880]  people those that voted for Obama trying to reject war and tyranny and
[25:11.880 --> 25:16.520]  warrantless wiretapping and spying they're desperate to keep them this is the
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.120]  key away from the rest of the American people and vice versa Fox News is
[25:21.120 --> 25:27.440]  saying oh look the liberals don't want don't want us to have these tea parties
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.040]  the liberals the liberals when you go to these tea parties it's filled with
[25:31.040 --> 25:33.440]  people that would call themselves liberals who are against the banker
[25:33.440 --> 25:41.160]  takeover so it makes it it it cast the roles where if you're not a Republican
[25:41.160 --> 25:44.760]  well then you must be for the bailouts in the banker takeover but if you're a
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.040]  Republican you're against the banker takeover in the bailout and see that's
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.840]  perfect because it has to be the party out of power that doesn't have the house
[25:52.840 --> 25:58.840]  the Senate or the executive it has to be the party out of power that claims its
[25:58.840 --> 26:02.560]  anti-New World Order because they can't be in power and be anti-New World Order
[26:02.560 --> 26:05.320]  like they were a few years ago because then they'd have to actually get us out
[26:05.320 --> 26:08.680]  of the New World Order which is constitutional and popular see how
[26:08.680 --> 26:12.640]  simple that is but how complex it is for the public to get it the Democrats
[26:12.640 --> 26:17.760]  were anti-wiretapping anti-war anti-police state when they were out of
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.240]  power now they're in power they're all for it Republicans are out of power now
[26:22.240 --> 26:25.800]  they're anti-police state anti-fascism they're not just calling the liberals
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.200]  communists now they're calling them fascists which is more properly you know
[26:29.200 --> 26:32.160]  address because they're not liberals they're they're command and control
[26:32.160 --> 26:40.120]  corporates and so because the Republicans are out of power they are now
[26:40.120 --> 26:45.360]  trying to rehabilitate themselves off claiming their populist patriots against
[26:45.360 --> 26:52.840]  the establishment so now how ridiculous knowing that the CNN look saying we've
[26:52.840 --> 27:00.200]  got dangerous extremists I've got a CBS news report we're gonna play it later
[27:00.200 --> 27:04.240]  where they got more ST's on saying yeah you know basically these tea parties all
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.960]  these people all these groups right-wing extremists they're very very dangerous
[27:09.960 --> 27:20.080]  basically they're cop killers so remember there were polls out in October that
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.640]  showed 98 99% Congress including Republicans and Democrats were saying
[27:24.640 --> 27:29.800]  they were getting thousand to one Barbara Boxer and others she said well I'm
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.200]  getting thousand to one but I still gotta vote for it thousand to one phone
[27:34.200 --> 27:45.400]  calls that didn't want out of a hundred that's one out of 999 now of course they
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.880]  want to divide us along liberal conservative that's the name of the
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.600]  game divide and conquer and so people that identify themselves as Democrats go
[27:53.600 --> 27:56.960]  well I don't like what the bankers are doing but of the Republicans are against
[27:56.960 --> 28:03.200]  the bailout I guess I'm for it just like well I voted for George Bush people say
[28:03.200 --> 28:07.280]  I I'm not really for torture and secret arrest all these wars but I'm not gonna
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.400]  let the liberals win see they get you in like a sports team mentality where you're
[28:12.400 --> 28:15.960]  raw wrying for your team you get committed to that and then oh you have a
[28:15.960 --> 28:20.200]  political fight and you go to rallies and then your candidate wins and you're
[28:20.200 --> 28:23.880]  not gonna take that victory away from me you're not gonna bash Barack Obama you
[28:23.880 --> 28:29.320]  hardcore right winger Alex Jones I get their emails every hour and they say
[28:29.320 --> 28:32.960]  you right wing operative you're going down you're just mad Obama won and you're
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.480]  a racist and you click on their handle on YouTube or whatever and then it's a
[28:37.480 --> 28:42.400]  white person calling you a racist yeah actually most the black folks that are
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.280]  commenting are going yeah I know what you're saying he is a liar he's bought
[28:46.280 --> 28:51.720]  and paid for by the man but but it's these white yuppies committed to this
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.800]  false reality just like they were committed to Bush they had associated
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.000]  their personal power they had psychologically invested in George W. Bush
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.800]  so it didn't matter what he did for eight years as he advanced the new orders
[29:03.800 --> 29:09.160]  cause they were for him and now Obama's in so they switch sides because now it's
[29:09.160 --> 29:17.640]  kosher because they are the party out of power they are the party out of power
[29:17.640 --> 29:20.480]  so they can play the part of the good guys you know Rick Perry got 39% of the
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.520]  vote in a three-way race he's probably gonna lose his gubernatorial run against
[29:24.520 --> 29:28.280]  Cabley Hutchinson so now he's talking about secession in Texas fighting
[29:28.280 --> 29:33.480]  federal tyranny and then as soon as he gets popular support enough to win he
[29:33.480 --> 29:39.440]  will stab you in the back like he always does see same thing same thing so they're
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.320]  desperate to keep the American people away from each other instead of uniting
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.760]  against the globalist when 99% of us are against the maker takeover they want
[29:47.760 --> 29:52.560]  to make it a left-right issue that's it in total we're on the march the
[29:52.560 --> 30:02.000]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network did you know that the
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.760]  new energy czar wants to control how much power your electrical company allows

[31:10.920 --> 31:15.200]  order that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely

[34:00.560 --> 34:03.840]  exactly what I was thinking so I thought we need to get this guy on because he
[34:03.840 --> 34:07.720]  sees it clearly I tuned into Fox seeing in all of them they're making it a left

[34:20.320 --> 34:24.520]  bipartisan scam then of course the establishment wants to make it left
[34:24.520 --> 34:29.120]  right to divide everybody instead of us getting past these politicians to the

[34:49.040 --> 34:54.760]  teabagging and and and people on MSNBC and people on CNN and the air of the

[35:27.120 --> 35:32.080]  sickening claiming everybody's having an orgy for those that don't know they
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.560]  were showing children on their father's shoulders saying this on CNN very
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.680]  perverted you led 10,000 people in Chicago you're not a Republican or a
[35:39.680 --> 35:43.320]  Democrat but they came after you didn't they well they did come against me and
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.280]  by the way Anderson Cooper who I saw I guess it was his boyfriend holding
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.960]  hands in New York to make this comment and I look I don't care that the guys
[35:51.960 --> 35:55.640]  gay I'm a freedom-loving guy I don't care but for these kind of comments and
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.720]  you know you remember the million-man March how CNN covered it for months we
[35:59.720 --> 36:03.760]  got to see people leaving their houses the you know Calypso Louis Farrakhan he
[36:03.760 --> 36:08.000]  was a Calypso artist now he's this this race-baiting hater but we got to know
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.200]  him we got to know all these people we saw the people on their buses this this
[36:12.200 --> 36:17.240]  huge deal yesterday got no coverage and then of course they had to I was just
[36:17.240 --> 36:22.280]  just on TV like well well Alex was uh introducing me you know focus in on the
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.960]  one guy that had the gun show the picture of Obama with a with a Hitler
[36:26.960 --> 36:30.880]  mustache and what they're trying to do here look you understand something Alex
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.720]  you're in Texas and I dedicated my show today to Texas I think Texas hit it out
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.080]  of the park and your governor threatening to uh to step out of the
[36:39.080 --> 36:42.880]  union and everything else to get away from this ridiculousness is is awesome
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.640]  but but here in in Chicago it's big business to race-bait and we got the
[36:48.640 --> 36:52.720]  rear end Jesse jackass you know he's made a career of race-baiting
[36:52.720 --> 36:56.480]  everything is based on skin color so that's what they tried to do here in
[36:56.480 --> 36:59.800]  Chicago is they try to make it a black white issue why didn't you people do
[36:59.800 --> 37:03.320]  this during bush well we did do it during bush but now that we're in you
[37:03.320 --> 37:08.640]  know tarp 15 the jobs are disappearing stores are being boarded up that's why
[37:08.640 --> 37:12.840]  it's just it's just come to uh come to a head now but they're trying well you
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.520]  didn't protest bush because he was white that was how the media played it and
[37:16.520 --> 37:21.120]  then if you're a Christian or you're anti-abortion or you want uh you know you
[37:21.120 --> 37:25.520]  want you want a border to be in force or you have a Ron Paul bumper sticker or
[37:25.520 --> 37:30.480]  you listen to rush or or savage or whatever you're on the list baby you're
[37:30.480 --> 37:35.160]  on the list and Obama's acorn brown shirts are coming for you it's really
[37:35.160 --> 37:40.280]  frightening the way the media covered this by the way man Cal they I'm sure
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.200]  you know this they actually have a national group you can't make this
[37:43.200 --> 37:47.960]  stuff up called brown coats and they have a chapter in Austin they actually
[37:47.960 --> 37:54.400]  wear brown shirts no no I'm not kidding so the Obama people this is not a
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.320]  cliche folks this is not satire I'm not kidding they actually wear brown
[37:59.320 --> 38:04.760]  shirts now I was I look I do not want to say what they said but they were
[38:04.760 --> 38:07.400]  talking about doing harm to the president and I won't even joke about
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.200]  that on the radio but I believe some of these people were were plants by acorn
[38:13.200 --> 38:17.160]  that were yelling some of the more violent things about Obama now look I
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.400]  had a crowd of 10,000 and we didn't hear any of that these were freedom loving
[38:21.400 --> 38:24.200]  people that want to get back to the Constitution they were holding up
[38:24.200 --> 38:28.680]  pictures of I and Rand pictures of a blown-up pictures of the cover the book
[38:28.680 --> 38:32.920]  you know Atlas shrugged and fountain had this this these were great kids were
[38:32.920 --> 38:36.640]  taken out of school I'm hoping that we have some future leaders some world
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.240]  changes that were there and I mean this was a great wholesome event and then to
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.800]  see the way the mainstream media covered it by the way CBS okay shame on
[38:44.800 --> 38:49.800]  CBS five seconds of footage of this of this 10,000 strong crowd they took the
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.200]  photograph of street level from three blocks away to diminish it and then at
[38:54.200 --> 38:58.400]  five seconds and then they went to an unnamed city councilwoman who said oh
[38:58.400 --> 39:02.900]  this is this is just the right-wing agenda and then the next shot Alex was
[39:02.900 --> 39:07.000]  a was a young African-American woman at the post office screaming because she's
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.640]  getting money she's happy she's getting money back from the government and then
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.280]  the next guy a white guy now says yes I have to pay money but you know what I
[39:15.280 --> 39:21.120]  feel good about it it's my civic duty the brainwashing the propaganda if you
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.400]  were at the tea party anybody listening to Alex Jones show right now if you were
[39:24.400 --> 39:29.240]  at the tea party and then you saw the coverage and you're going to yourself
[39:29.240 --> 39:34.200]  women this doesn't think up that cowboy logic that's Texas logic that's common
[39:34.200 --> 39:38.360]  sense and if you've never seen behind the curtain of how the media works and I
[39:38.360 --> 39:41.720]  think there was a million people strong that saw it yesterday I think a lot of
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.320]  eyes were opened yesterday because what we were part of and the way the media
[39:46.320 --> 39:51.960]  covered it are two different things you got a read between the headlines folks
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.200]  to really get to the truth and you're not going to get it from the mainstream
[39:55.200 --> 40:00.520]  media and that's the bottom line well man cow you know that my show especially
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.480]  I don't get a little sexual stuff and topless dancers and things I mean we
[40:04.480 --> 40:10.080]  don't obsess on sex because we see it as a diversion but I mean still I can't
[40:10.080 --> 40:17.920]  get over the spectacle of Rachel Maddow and MSNBC and Anderson Cooper on show
[40:17.920 --> 40:24.520]  after show laughing and giggling with former presidential advisors about all
[40:24.520 --> 40:29.800]  these families and children cramming sexual genitalia in their mouths
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.720]  oh come on well I mean no I mean this is really getting insane I mean how are
[40:34.720 --> 40:37.720]  they getting away with this well they're getting away with it because they're
[40:37.720 --> 40:41.720]  CNN it's the same way that Oprah Winfrey a couple of blocks of your Harpo's
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.040]  studios and I look I like Oprah but she can say the most vile things listen to
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.840]  Jamie Foxx and your producer can get you the clip listen to Jamie Foxx talking
[40:51.840 --> 40:57.360]  about 16-year-old Miley Cyrus I'm not a fan but 16-year-old Miley Cyrus you know
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.880]  being raped by her father on film as as urban radio laughs at it again there's a
[41:02.880 --> 41:07.320]  double standard if you move votes and if you make a difference you're gonna be
[41:07.320 --> 41:11.120]  attacked in America so it's kind of an honor that I get attacked if you're
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.480]  doing the simpleton stuff or if you're on the left you're protected does that
[41:15.480 --> 41:18.720]  make sense well that's like Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl like you were
[41:18.720 --> 41:22.960]  saying today stages that that wardrobe malfunction and they come after talk
[41:22.960 --> 41:28.000]  radio it makes no sense look Hillary Clinton yesterday and again I mean you
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.280]  just have to take people listening to the radio if they haven't read the paper
[41:31.280 --> 41:34.680]  seen TV or heard it on another show they're gonna think that you and I are
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.960]  insane Hillary Clinton's answer to the Pirates is not shoot them when he's
[41:39.960 --> 41:44.760]  when these scumbags drive up on their little wraps don't shoot them don't kill
[41:44.760 --> 41:50.240]  them no no she says we have to send money to rebuild Somalia that if they had a
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.480]  nicer place to live we wouldn't have fun I mean it's just there's no common sense
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.640]  there's no there's no rhyme or reason to it unless unless you look at the big
[41:59.640 --> 42:05.680]  picture right I went to the to the Louvre in in Paris and if you're if
[42:05.680 --> 42:08.240]  you're up close to the Mona Lisa you can't really see it and you got to pull
[42:08.240 --> 42:10.760]  back and you see the whole picture and then you go to the back room and you see
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.240]  more art and and I think sometimes we're so close to we don't see what's going on
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.400]  if you really see what's going on in America it's frightful the government is
[42:18.400 --> 42:21.640]  gonna own every company they're gonna own they're gonna hire and fire us we're
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.560]  gonna have to petition the government to get a job we're really headed into
[42:25.560 --> 42:31.040]  dangerous territory here Alex man Cal fire websites oh it's it's man Cal.com
[42:31.040 --> 42:36.640]  Twitter me man Cal Muller it's one word man COW MUL LER put him together and
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.600]  it would look gorgeous I'm not important but I'm hoping that we will inspire
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.200]  someone that somebody listening to my voice right now on your show or my show
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.000]  or whatever show will will be the world changer and bring some common sense and
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.440]  some freedom back to this country well I agree with you now man Cal going back
[42:57.440 --> 43:00.800]  to the type of things that you witnessed and I was just scanning through
[43:00.800 --> 43:04.400]  television radio and seeing what's happening at other tea party events
[43:04.400 --> 43:11.080]  around the nation CBS did a report with Morris D's demonizing the tea parties
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.520]  and connecting them to white supremacist and killers and the rise of
[43:14.520 --> 43:19.680]  extremism yeah and now this new federal report on the heels of the mic report
[43:19.680 --> 43:23.400]  saying returning veterans of the biggest threat gun owners buying guns and ammo
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.520]  are the terror threat people that are against abortion or a terror threat
[43:27.520 --> 43:31.840]  well this this seems to have struck a nerve finally this is what I've been
[43:31.840 --> 43:35.440]  screaming for decades these reports have been coming out no matter what
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.080]  administration it is finally I think people are understanding this whole
[43:39.080 --> 43:43.320]  anti-terror system that's been built is not for little brown men in caves in
[43:43.320 --> 43:46.840]  Central Asia this is for the American people what are you hearing from your
[43:46.840 --> 43:51.360]  huge audience well I mean it is I'm not gonna say little little people like you
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.440]  said but but it is amazing to me that they can do the two-finger swipe to my
[43:55.440 --> 44:00.520]  wife I had a guy that was was making a path that me the way he was grabbing my
[44:00.520 --> 44:08.400]  my my private area you know we can be half of the airport but you can't
[44:08.400 --> 44:12.920]  racially profiled you can't if you see somebody from Saudi Arabia oh no they
[44:12.920 --> 44:16.720]  can't stop them but you know because my wife is attractive they're all over her
[44:16.720 --> 44:20.120]  they're like Italian waiters and mascot you ever notice people in mascot
[44:20.120 --> 44:26.440]  costumes feel like they can touch your wife yes I mean anyway but you can't
[44:26.440 --> 44:30.040]  you can't profile at the airport no we can't do that you can't go into a bet
[44:30.040 --> 44:33.120]  you can't go into a bad neighborhood and profile bad people because you're a
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.480]  racist you know regardless of if it's a Latino neighborhood or a white
[44:37.480 --> 44:40.760]  neighborhood or a black neighborhood you're only arresting white people yeah
[44:40.760 --> 44:46.080]  because it's a white neighborhood idiot but but you can profile returning
[44:46.080 --> 44:49.120]  servicemen because they could be dangerous and they know how to use guns
[44:49.120 --> 44:53.640]  if you're a Christian if you're anti if you're anti-death if you're anti-
[44:53.640 --> 44:58.360]  abortion if you're pro border security you're on the list so you can profile
[44:58.360 --> 45:02.760]  everyone at anyone if they're not Obama supporters if you don't want a big
[45:02.760 --> 45:05.840]  federal government if you believe in the state's right that's another thing I
[45:05.840 --> 45:09.080]  know you know this Alex if you're a believer in states right and I believe
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.360]  we had a civil war about this if you're a believer in states right you can be
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.680]  put on the new list oh no the new apartment security the report criticizes
[45:17.680 --> 45:21.400]  just the state sovereignty movement calling for the 10th amendment and it
[45:21.400 --> 45:26.000]  attacks the tea party groups as well it's just incredible I think this is
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.040]  going to backfire big time but again that's what the establishment wants they
[45:29.040 --> 45:32.520]  want us republicans and democrats fighting with each other but I don't see
[45:32.520 --> 45:38.800]  this working Eric I don't see this unfolding like they want because people
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.440]  losing their jobs people you know having their their businesses boarded up
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.320]  but I'm turning exactly turning people are waking up and and you know they
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.480]  tried to poo poo it is a as a box event as this event is that event look Michael
[45:52.480 --> 45:56.120]  steel do you know Michael steel is the head of republicans Michael steel was
[45:56.120 --> 46:01.840]  in attendance at my rally yesterday and they wouldn't I didn't see him but this
[46:01.840 --> 46:05.680]  is this is what I was told by many people they would not let him speak
[46:05.680 --> 46:10.320]  all right we were not going to let the republicans take this over we were not
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.760]  gonna let the democrats take this over this is not about left right and it
[46:14.760 --> 46:19.600]  reminds me of a basic when I was a kid I got a little cheap but you know black
[46:19.600 --> 46:23.560]  stone I think that was his name magician kid it's slight of hand hey look up
[46:23.560 --> 46:27.840]  here republican democrat look up here look look look look look look in the
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.360]  meantime as you're looking up the real deal is happening so democrat
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.080]  republican that's all smokescreen we need to get away from that this was not
[46:36.080 --> 46:40.840]  about democrat and republican everybody is sick of paying and paying and paying
[46:40.840 --> 46:45.360]  well Stevie Wonder sings at the White House Michelle Obama got a new jade
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.360]  cruise sweater look at their dog by the way did anyone find any irony in it was
[46:49.360 --> 46:54.280]  I love the only one that found irony in the fact that little Malia cute little
[46:54.280 --> 47:01.040]  girl Obama's daughter said he can't swim they know but it's funny because it was
[47:01.040 --> 47:07.960]  a gift from Ted Kennedy Ted Kennedy who I believe murdered that girl Ted Kennedy
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.400]  bought the Obama's a water dog that can't swim hilarious but that's the stuff
[47:12.400 --> 47:16.840]  you know we're talking about Obama's dog and left and right and isn't Michelle
[47:16.840 --> 47:20.840]  Obama great dresser in the meantime yeah our people are hurting people are
[47:20.840 --> 47:25.840]  losing jobs businesses are getting boarded up it's all smokescreen and
[47:25.840 --> 47:30.320]  then of you yeah and then if you try to go out and protest it they have to make
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.440]  it a little right wing event right and they have to now I've confirmed
[47:35.440 --> 47:39.440]  reports all over the country that democrats were running in pushing hitting
[47:39.440 --> 47:43.120]  people starting fights the first they tried to deny that they were sending the
[47:43.120 --> 47:46.800]  White House funded acorn in then later Ariana Huffington with the George
[47:46.800 --> 47:50.800]  Soros money admitted that they were sending their people in and so they've
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.080]  been caught red-handed trying to start fights and trying to make this
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.800]  political because again they want to keep the American people separated along
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.560]  the lines of race and religion and political party instead of going after
[48:03.560 --> 48:06.800]  these bankers that have committed all these crimes you know you know something
[48:06.800 --> 48:10.720]  Alex keep the dogs fighting throw some raw meat on the floor and let them fight
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.000]  meanwhile these people they sit at the big table and they have a feast and you
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.720]  and I I mean I remember Thanksgiving for years I was at the kids table it was
[48:19.720 --> 48:24.520]  awful you know we ate with plastic and and and styrofoam and they had beautiful
[48:24.520 --> 48:30.120]  dishes look Obama and and and the people that control him are sitting at the big
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.320]  table and they have to keep us fighting on the ground like dogs black white all
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.640]  that I don't care about anybody skin color and and and nobody does really
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.920]  unless they bought into this lie what I care about is it really is us versus
[48:44.920 --> 48:49.240]  them it's the Patriots it's people that believe in freedom let's protect our
[48:49.240 --> 48:52.880]  borders but you know all of these jobs we're losing and and we're letting in a
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.800]  hundred and thirty four some odd thousand a month legally legally a hundred
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.480]  thirty four thousand a month come in here now I'm all about legal immigration
[49:01.480 --> 49:06.600]  you're in Texas but Mexico and Latin America are collapsing there's six
[49:06.600 --> 49:10.680]  billion there's six billion there's six billion people want to come here the
[49:10.680 --> 49:14.360]  lifeboat can't hold that many not with the socialist system because it'll
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.440]  further bankrupt the states we were free market made made a war could come I just
[49:18.440 --> 49:21.280]  find it funny that we don't have any jobs yet we have space for everybody else
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.080]  from everywhere else and how dare the head of Mexico yesterday the president
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.920]  of Mexico blaming America on their violence Mexico has resources and
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.200]  beauty and manpower and how dare they blame us it is a corrupt government and
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.720]  the people have not done their job the people should have risen up and taken
[49:39.720 --> 49:45.240]  out that corrupt lousy government you you know they're so corrupt and now the

[54:32.320 --> 54:41.320]  talking to Eric Muller better known as a man Cal Muller Eric there are times in
[54:41.320 --> 54:44.360]  history when more happens in just a few years and happen in the previous 100
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.040]  politically that's what the sociologist and political scientists say in history
[54:48.040 --> 54:53.680]  certainly shows that all of this is converging towards a head what is I mean
[54:53.680 --> 54:56.440]  I knew Obama was gonna be new world order he was bought and paid for by his
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.200]  handlers and I knew that especially the white liberals black folks and others
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.840]  who really believed in him and were rightfully thought they were rejecting
[55:04.840 --> 55:09.280]  the bad policies of Bush I was worried that once they got betrayed they would
[55:09.280 --> 55:14.200]  just commit to him no matter what he did because they personally invested you
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.120]  know their identity with him and then that would actually create a massive
[55:18.120 --> 55:21.680]  racial divide not because there was a racial divide on the side of people
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.760]  didn't vote for Obama but because the other side is gonna make it that way
[55:26.760 --> 55:31.360]  and you have government coming after the people clearly trying to set up a police
[55:31.360 --> 55:36.880]  state where do you see this going how do you see this unfolding well look I was
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.320]  I was there when he was elected president Grant Park Chicago a lot of a lot of
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.160]  mouth breathers I will tell you that 1.5 million people were at the inauguration
[55:45.160 --> 55:49.920]  only 14 people missed work his followers really believe they never have to work
[55:49.920 --> 55:53.640]  again where we headed God is going to be removed from our money we're gonna see
[55:53.640 --> 55:57.200]  more attacks on God and when I say God I'm talking about Christians government
[55:57.200 --> 56:00.760]  insured bonds are gonna be gone gold is gonna skyrocket if you can get it we're
[56:00.760 --> 56:04.720]  gonna see more mass killings because it serves their purpose they encourage it
[56:04.720 --> 56:08.200]  because they want to take our guns you'll see Israel nuked that'll give us
[56:08.200 --> 56:11.720]  more reason to go back into the Middle East even stronger runaway inflation is
[56:11.720 --> 56:14.760]  coming you can't keep printing money like they're printing it it has to happen
[56:14.760 --> 56:19.280]  you're gonna see a six-day week a an 11 month year for kids because Obama wants
[56:19.280 --> 56:22.880]  to brainwash them into Obama's army the government in general wants to be good
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.600]  little followers you're gonna see complete control of the internet they're
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.240]  gonna do this under the guise of the children the children the children but
[56:30.240 --> 56:34.200]  I want to say this times are gonna get tough but people are waking up and I
[56:34.200 --> 56:37.440]  want people to remember this no matter what I've said and no matter what Alex
[56:37.440 --> 56:41.640]  said this is me speaking my opinion we may have a thousand years of tribulation
[56:41.640 --> 56:48.120]  but you must always remember good wins good wins don't give up the fight you
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.880]  may be messed up from the floor up right now but your best days are ahead of you
[56:51.880 --> 56:55.320]  and I still believe the best days are ahead for America this this is gonna
[56:55.320 --> 56:59.080]  wake us up we're going through a pruning we're going through a tough time but I
[56:59.080 --> 57:03.920]  believe freedom wins and good wins and folks keep up the good fight well I
[57:03.920 --> 57:09.440]  agree with you and I see the left-right paradigm finally dying and the people
[57:09.440 --> 57:13.960]  coming together and I do see a lot of obamanoids waking up a lot quicker than
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.320]  some of the bush zombies were and so I don't see things going well for the
[57:18.320 --> 57:21.920]  globalist but it's kind of like the immovable object meets the unstoppable
[57:21.920 --> 57:26.240]  force it's like two freight trains going a hundred miles an hour apiece head on
[57:26.240 --> 57:31.120]  on the same rail line when do you see that collision really hitting its
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.200]  flashpoint well it is happening isn't it I mean are the trains rushing towards
[57:35.200 --> 57:39.160]  each other right now yes aren't aren't we are we having a big party as the train
[57:39.160 --> 57:44.560]  goes off the cliff look you know you're a married man as your wife had a
[57:44.560 --> 57:47.240]  problem I mean a lot of my friends or wives have problems with with credit
[57:47.240 --> 57:53.320]  cards yeah yeah I look how do I say this if you go crazy with your credit
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.120]  card is the answer to spend more money here honey spend more money it doesn't
[57:58.120 --> 58:03.680]  work it has to give this house of cards something has to give now those of us
[58:03.680 --> 58:08.840]  who who do not define ourselves by money who do not define ourselves by the
[58:08.840 --> 58:11.920]  product jacket or the Starbucks coffee cup in our hands look at me I got
[58:11.920 --> 58:18.640]  Starbucks those of us who know the truth these are good times for us and I if
[58:18.640 --> 58:22.440]  you're defined by your quality of character these are good days so I think

[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:40.840]  the military and they don't want to put in the reports but I've confirmed in some
[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:45.520]  of the secret reports police that's right they don't you won't take the guns

[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:31.640]  uh... Gerald Salete he's about ready to get another feather in his cap I don't
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:35.920]  know if you're aware of it but it says that general growth files bankruptcy
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:41.400]  they uh... they have 200 more than 200 malls in the u.s. files for chapter 11
[1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:45.160]  today yeah I know he said you're gonna start having uh... we've been saying
[1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:49.200]  that for two years all the big real estate companies going bankrupt and then
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:53.160]  it's just gonna get worse and worse all by design
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:58.320]  um... the other thing was I've been calling Glenn Beck because he's a shill
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:03.840]  and uh... I'm saying you know I basically tried to bait him to come out
[1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:07.760]  uh... why don't you mention the uh... illegal federal reserve
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.440]  uh...
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:12.920]  so uh... yet that the whole
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:15.320]  fox news you know mad cow's right
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:16.200]  there's no
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:19.280]  we all got to come together
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.680]  no republican no democrat just americans
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:25.080]  well that's the key you know the the republicans are out of power right now
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:27.720]  we got an article on this to explain it's very simple but folks don't seem to
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:28.880]  understand
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:31.400]  republicans are out of power right now so they can act like they're the
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:32.280]  opposition
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:35.360]  then they absorb all the real grassroots opposition
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:38.200]  so it never actually changes the status quo
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.720]  the status quo is imploding economy new world order police state
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:44.240]  takeover attacks on the family
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:48.440]  endless war is everything else that's happening uh... so
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:53.400]  absolutely we have got to shatter the left-right paradigm and do it do it now
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:56.480]  thing that the other thing i was uh... the people
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:58.080]  uh... the meaning of the ones
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:02:59.480]  the american people
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:02.480]  we're basically animal farm
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.200]  i don't know if you remember the book about the dogs
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:07.280]  that they took his puppies and they trained them
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:10.400]  you know the pigs train the dogs now that's the children that's the police
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:11.520]  state thugs
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:14.880]  uh... enforcers you know that's that i mean the whole thing is based on a
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:16.800]  Stalinistic system
[1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:19.480]  the way we're growing up into now i mean the people are
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:22.600]  we can't read the uh... commandments on the wall because we're getting dumbed
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:23.240]  down
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.040]  and there's another one
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:28.040]  uh... you notice there's a big giant powerful
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:30.560]  uh... clidesdale stallion
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:33.400]  and he does all the work he supports the pigs
[1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:36.200]  and he and and and they're demanding more more more they've moved into the
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:39.040]  house because the humans have left first they said
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.440]  four legs good two legs bad and they said i'll have the uh...
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:46.640]  stood to four legs good uh... two legs good to the pigs are now walking up
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:47.440]  right
[1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:49.840]  and then the stallion pulls a muscle
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.760]  and they load him up and selling to a glue truck
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:54.400]  to take him away

[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:50.480]  whatever the new pig says
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:54.000]  because if the new pig will claim he's he's fighting the old pig when they're
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.240]  all pigs they came out of the same cells

[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:22.960]  while obama is already fudging
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:25.480]  yeah fudged since day one in this election
[1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:29.800]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists

[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:13.240]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:18.800]  ladies and gentlemen if we attack marocco from a fake republican right wing
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:20.800]  perspective
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:25.320]  all we do is drive people back into that false paradigm back into the support
[1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:29.080]  of the other control party that is out of power right now
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:31.400]  that is posing as the opposition
[1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:35.000]  then in forty years they will springboard right back into power
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.720]  and this
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:41.720]  bait and switch will continue on and on and on like groundhog day
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:45.920]  that's why the obama deception my new film is so important
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:49.160]  in the first five minutes it shatters the left-right paradigm
[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:51.920]  and shows you who the real elites are
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:55.600]  and what their real policies agendas and goals are
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:57.920]  and then when you have that information you're awake
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:08:59.920]  the film is designed to wake
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:01.120]  people up
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:05.160]  it's designed to create a renaissance of understanding the back to real issues
[1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:09.160]  of liberty versus tyranny
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:14.160]  i cannot stress enough how important it is to show it to obama supporters and
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:17.640]  republican supporters it will deprogram them them all
[1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:20.760]  it's made for everybody
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:24.200]  that's what the media loves to reaffirm the left-right paradigm they just over
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:25.080]  and over again
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:29.200]  fox says we're right wing around here at the tea parties it's right wing
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:32.760]  cnn msnbc says it's a bunch of right wingers
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:34.760]  they want to hurt the liberals
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:37.040]  again just dumbing it down
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.520]  dividing the american people against each other when offshore private banks
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:42.880]  are looting us
[1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:44.400]  the lack of pirates
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:46.480]  had taken over our ship
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.040]  and you got five or six pirates on deck with a ship of a hundred people
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.960]  and they've got a promise two different groups of uh... people
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:54.280]  different things
[1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:56.240]  uh... if they'll go along with the pirates
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:59.720]  and the pirates always play the massive people off against each other
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.640]  the you know the hundred people that they're holding captive
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:05.880]  while i throw the pirates overboard
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:09.560]  now but see the pirates know how to turn into a big theater a big pageant of
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:13.480]  you know which pirate leader do you like and all this pirate leader cares more
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:15.080]  about you in this group of
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:18.440]  people on deck are against them because they want to get more of the grog and
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:19.280]  more of the
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:22.440]  hard tack and more of the gold
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:26.140]  and just goes on and on and on how they play games with us
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:33.640]  uh... let's uh... go ahead and go to bill in australia bill you're on the air
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:39.280]  okay alex i'm calling up because of some information that i came into contact
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:40.560]  with basically
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:42.320]  better fortnight ago
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.000]  and if i could just run through a few articles which leads up to this
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.800]  information and what it's uh...
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:48.880]  in regards to
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:51.680]  that's a deal with the uh... pan-vax vaccine
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:55.360]  which is only to be used in the event of a uh... pandemic uh...
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:59.160]  h5n1 avian flu virus
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:02.480]  this goes back to two thousand five that an article called
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:05.240]  the bird flu pandemic threat being ignored
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:10.320]  and in this article the important thing is kevin rudd is speaking
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:14.960]  basically of the risks of a pandemic virus and that it's a national security
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:17.320]  risk and the public needs to do more
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:19.560]  and this is in two thousand five
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:20.280]  and then
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:24.880]  going to two thousand five in november there are egg producers in aspirants
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:28.080]  and aspirants is along western australian uh... down the southern end of
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:29.680]  australia basically
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:34.080]  and they're talking about the risk of migratory birds possibly i'm carrying
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.200]  the avian flu
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.960]  and they're saying that they're prepared and they're not too worried about it
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:41.000]  and this is in two thousand five
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.120]  and then you come to two thousand and seven in january and see if they'll
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:46.040]  release is
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:47.680]  a um...
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:48.640]  media
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:53.240]  media release and it's in regards to the announcement for the um...

[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:02.480]  and so right as the vaccines ready they say it's about to break out and you
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:03.520]  gotta take it
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:06.640]  and they're doing vaccine trials all over the world killing people and it's
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:08.240]  admitted they're dying
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.000]  and they're now admitting baxter admits a peak contaminated seasonal flu
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.480]  product contained live
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:15.040]  bird flu virus

[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:20.240]  and i'll let you get to the punchline
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:22.560]  i'm sitting there pumping gas
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:25.400]  and i see this father next to me in a truck
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:26.640]  and he's uh...
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:29.640]  pumping gas and he's got his little baby daughter
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:33.280]  uh... in the backseat of the truck it's a it's a
[1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:34.760]  double cab
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:37.760]  and i'm sitting there pumping gas looking at his little
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:38.880]  probably
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:41.840]  nine-month-old daughter giggling and smiling at him
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:45.840]  uh... and he kept giggling and you know looking back at the gas he was pumping
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:47.880]  looking back at her playing pick-a-boo
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:49.800]  and i said is that your first baby
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:53.840]  i said i can sure tell you're excited he goes yeah it's my first i said well
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:56.640]  you notice how the media implied it was horrible having children but isn't it
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:57.440]  wonderful
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:01.160]  he said yeah the media really does say that but it's the best thing in my life
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:02.680]  and i said yeah well
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:05.640]  look into not giving her vaccines
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:07.400]  and he just looks at me and he goes
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:10.800]  real arrogantly well my wife's a pediatrician she really thinks they're
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:12.120]  great
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:15.120]  and you can tell this guy kind of done where the pants
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:19.080]  and i said uh... i was thinking oh she's she's the high priest she's the new
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:20.920]  priest class i understand i'm just a
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:22.720]  unwashed person down here
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:25.000]  uh... but i said to him nicely i said you know
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.720]  few decades ago it was five vaccines they push now it's over fifty and
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:31.060]  they say in two years it can be over a hundred
[1:13:31.060 --> 1:13:34.560]  i said uh... a lot of these are hurting people as you need to think about that
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:35.600]  and he said yeah
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:37.320]  i guess you got a point there but
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:39.280]  you know most of them are good
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:40.360]  and i said okay
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:43.120]  i said well you know in your heart that it's wrong
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:47.040]  and i said so i just think about your daughter and i got my car and drove off
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:47.880]  and
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:51.000]  you know i i i didn't want to talk to that guy i didn't want to try to put him in
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.600]  his place i didn't want to try to act up to him
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.680]  i didn't want to actually talk to him i'm a private person but i had a
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:58.160]  responsibility
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:00.120]  as i know he loves his daughter
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:01.920]  to try to warn him
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:04.920]  and to protect that innocent from that by a weapon attack
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:09.000]  but his wife is this compartmentalized lower gild priest
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.440]  whose brainwashed
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:13.520]  doesn't know about the ski didn't know about atomic soldiers don't know about
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:15.200]  them radiating foster kids
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.840]  doesn't know about everybody dropping dead from the vaccines or if they do
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:19.520]  they rationalize it
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.960]  and uh...
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:23.920]  there's a good chance it can end up messing his daughter up you know wonder
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:26.680]  why she dies at thirty five a cancer they'll wonder
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:29.360]  why she ends up being mildly retarded a little wonder
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:31.120]  you know and and and and then
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:33.320]  they're so committed to their life though
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:36.560]  that the and that mother who's on a power trip that she's a high-price you
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:37.280]  know she's a
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:39.560]  she's a priest class doctor
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:43.560]  she won't even care they'll stick their daughter in a grave before they care
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:46.440]  before they admit they're wrong probably and i've tried my best to reach
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:48.760]  out to him but sorry go ahead
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:53.200]  now you're exactly right and just on that issue i have two very good friends
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.320]  uh...
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:55.320]  and they've both
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:59.640]  both recently had uh... children for the first time and one decided to get the
[1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:03.000]  back scenes and one has refused to get the back scenes
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.160]  and the one that refused to get the back scenes
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:08.000]  still had to uh...
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.080]  authorize administration
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:13.320]  for one back to you know it's called the k-backing
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:16.840]  now that k-backing was basically forced onto that child
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:19.480]  but had no choice and had to get this back scene
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:22.280]  but the other ones apparently he has a choice in the matter
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:25.280]  that is another issue i'd like to bring up with you on another day actually
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:26.000]  because
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.960]  that's something i'm monitoring and doing research on that actually that's
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:32.480]  vitamin k and that's not the law either that's a blood clotting
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:37.240]  agent uh... and uh... you know as if you met as if our design is the way we're
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:38.520]  supposed to be designed
[1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:40.800]  that's when they prick them and stick them in jab them
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:43.800]  you know they don't get it the child doesn't bleed to death
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:46.240]  uh... but uh... it's just a nightmare
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:48.560]  we finish up your bird flu situation
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:51.720]  uh... yeah well basically then um...
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:55.200]  two thousand seven august there was a horse flu outbreak which basically shut
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:57.240]  down the horse in horse industry
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:00.680]  and i have to quarantine the state so they set up uh...
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:03.800]  checkpoints and everything and i run in drills on basically how to get the
[1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:06.080]  people ready for the real thing
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.920]  i think it was a dry run for it
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:10.400]  and considering the outbreak actually
[1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:14.160]  arose from the quarantine center where it was supposed to be under control
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:17.720]  it always does only i saw that about the horse flu again
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:20.440]  in england that the government released a foot in mouth
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:24.800]  they are the terrorist that they don't change their m o folks
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:28.120]  and i did see that how the government accidentally released to the
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:32.040]  horse fluid accidentally released a foot in mouth and they accidentally
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:35.840]  the white house is accidentally was all on cipro three and a half weeks for the
[1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:37.760]  anthrax got uh... delivered
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:42.960]  and they just care about you know i mean come on to the government
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:46.760]  now it's here's another key article and this is very important because it's
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:50.400]  titled anyone can search these articles that i have mentioned online and you'll
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:51.200]  find them
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:55.360]  this one's called the vaccine tag set to help minimize bird flu toll
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:56.920]  and it's stated to uh...
[1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:59.200]  september fifteenth two thousand and seven
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:02.320]  and it's basically uh... they're talking about a bio marker which is going to be
[1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:03.440]  in the vaccine
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:05.440]  and this is quoting the doctors it says
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:09.400]  if a bird is vaccinated or infected the antibodies are going to be very similar
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:13.120]  so you can't really differentiate a vaccinated bird from an infected bird
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:16.600]  we're adding a biological tag into the vaccine so that you'll know that your
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:17.880]  bird to vaccinate it
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:22.040]  that's very important to be able to do because we want to be able to monitor
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:25.520]  the presence of the virus and how it is spreading through the flock
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:28.720]  and exactly in these biological tags they're trying to put in a human
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:29.920]  vaccines to
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:32.800]  are associated with all sorts of cancer and things you got a finish though i
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:34.440]  gotta go to other calls
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:39.160]  i came in well then basically all that leads up to the csl then releasing their
[1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:41.360]  arm and that's uh...
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:45.480]  media release where it's ready to go it's been approved and the virus uh...
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:48.520]  uh... the vaccine is going to be used in the event of a pandemic
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:51.620]  that's a week ago i received uh...
[1:17:51.620 --> 1:17:54.960]  notice from a friend of mine that uh... family member of his who works at
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:55.940]  csl
[1:17:55.940 --> 1:17:58.600]  holding that they're very busy and they're taking delivery of our three
[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:02.040]  hundred thousand eggs a day
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:05.320]  and that means they're using eggs to incubate the virus
[1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:08.280]  when i heard that for a hundred thousand eggs a day i thought that they
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:10.560]  obviously this is only to be
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:14.440]  ramp up and the manufacturers only to be in process when the pandemic is
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:15.960]  actually released
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:21.320]  so that's normally how it works i don't know i mean they train the police that
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:24.720]  are returning armies about to come back and bomb every city and then magically
[1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:27.920]  the bomb start i mean this is how they do it i appreciate your call
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:31.320]  yeah it's it's there but the globalist are making their move announcing world
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.360]  government right now
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:36.280]  that means they're going to play a bunch of tricks stage terror bird flu

[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:51.960]  you are talking about as far as who is
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:53.780]  for no strength
[1:25:53.780 --> 1:25:58.920]  and as far as i'm concerned is uh... what glenn beckon john hannity says
[1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:01.040]  they need to go see a shrink
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:03.080]  then he has decided that
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:06.400]  the billy bird group needs to go see a shrink because they have problems they
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.200]  have psychological issues
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:10.920]  well their control freaks will take them back
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:14.680]  he said that patriots should basically have the army used against them or
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:15.800]  mcvay is
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:19.760]  back when ron paul actually had a chance of winning the presidency back in the
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:22.760]  now and he was literally reading off their script
[1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:25.320]  the other such big news now today
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:28.560]  and uh... the business ongoing for decades at least fifteen years that we
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.000]  know of
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.480]  and then now he's supposedly our leader that's what's so suspicious about all
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:34.120]  this
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:36.440]  yeah well you know it
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.280]  it's kind of like what you've been talking about this virginia fusion
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:40.720]  center
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:42.080]  i live right on the
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:45.200]  right on the slope right on the borderline of uh... west virginia
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:46.640]  and you know
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:50.640]  with the virginia fusion center doing what they're doing that is outrageous
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:52.480]  it's completely outrageous
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:56.760]  and they need to interpret and what's what's constitutional or don't legislation
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:26:57.960]  and
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:02.040]  legislation and and basically uh... these people are just carrying it out
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:03.320]  enforcement
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:07.440]  what's happening is is it's the federalization of all local police
[1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:10.400]  now they're sucking the firemen in for this brainwashing
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.480]  yet it's a database and it's political correctness brainwashing
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:19.200]  it's a commissariat it's a political secret police force political
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:20.440]  secret police
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:24.920]  that is literally the opposite of what this country was founded on
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:28.680]  yeah and basically you know i just want to let you know that i'm outraged
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:29.920]  with this
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:33.480]  and i have uh...
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:37.880]  looked into this as far as the skimming through as far as on y'all website and
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:41.520]  eight hundred number i think i got here i think it's eight oh four six seven
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:44.840]  four two one nine six i think it's their number
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:46.120]  anyhow
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.200]  uh... there's a bunch of phone numbers there's a bunch of documents yeah uh...
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:54.480]  it's it's outrageous i would ask him through it and it's outrageous uh... it's
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:56.240]  purely legislation
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:59.660]  and there's all are doing is legislating not interpreting
[1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:02.280]  they're not even doing anything that's constitutional
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:04.840]  they just they just completely just go
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:08.840]  he walled on this uh... they're turning into secret police i appreciate your

[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:21.560]  i'm calling because uh... yesterday i got
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:22.960]  information
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:25.360]  that i found very disturbing
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:27.560]  uh... okay tell me
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:30.280]  basically uh...
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:31.640]  the person that
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:35.680]  i kind of directly got that uh... information from is an agent of
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:38.400]  certain branch of homeland security
[1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:40.500]  and uh... they're legion
[1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:42.800]  and information on this and he
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:44.400]  called up a uh...
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:47.440]  or pastor of myself and his and told
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.120]  and to be quote careful not to show up the tea parties with uh... negative
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:55.040]  obama signs are bumper stickers because
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:56.240]  those people
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:58.960]  would be quote targeted and put on
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:01.480]  those things for example like the no fly list
[1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:03.360]  well that's that's true to extend
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:07.120]  and they're announcing this that's why they've leaked the mic reports
[1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:09.960]  uh... one i've been so much like this new federal one
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:13.280]  and the two thousand and nine virginia terrorism threat assessment
[1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:15.560]  that's why the media is more than happy
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:16.600]  to cover
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.560]  the leaks we know that for a fact
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:20.840]  uh... and to hype it up is to create
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:22.720]  a chilling effect
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:25.400]  and uh... is there anything else you want to add on that come back and tell us
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:27.400]  more about
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:29.840]  person was telling this pastor specifically
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:31.920]  uh... but that's what this is all about

[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:37.160]  we got ninety eight percent of americans nine nine percent depending on the poll
[1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:39.080]  against what we're doing what we do
[1:29:39.080 --> 1:29:41.280]  and we associate with terrorists
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:43.240]  and tell more watching them
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:45.200]  and then associated with cop killers
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:46.600]  and we hyped that up
[1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:48.360]  and then the sheep will be scared
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:51.080]  uh... to stand up with them but that's not going to work

[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:08.360]  national ID cards about we have to rebel against that and say no if we give
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:13.680]  into it and just shut up you know this is criminal this is fraud this is wrong
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:18.480]  and I kept telling people this whole police state system is being designed
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:22.760]  and set up for the American people I told you it was being set up we have the
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:28.520]  training manuals under Bush all the same stuff about right-wing extremist they
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:32.160]  were just preparing the public though and selling conservatives on it was for
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:38.800]  al-Qaeda and the lila Polly's from you know somewhere on the other side of the
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:45.800]  world the far side of the planet going back to who was the particular caller I
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:51.560]  was talking to just now that's right Kevin in Texas was saying specifically
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:55.920]  recap your story because you got interrupted by the by the break yeah
[1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:03.160]  this um federal agent that works for a certain branch of online security was
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:10.280]  trying to form a pastor that well I'll be a little bit more specific with how
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:13.960]  this information came to me this wasn't like after like it can be like a
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:17.360]  message or something talking about this like I believe this was a personal
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:22.760]  warning because I know the agent personally also and he's a good guy and
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:26.920]  it seemed like he was warning him because his wife was gonna be going to
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:34.200]  these tea parties and he told his wife who is veterans of my mother and I had
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:40.040]  showed my mother the Obama deception a few weeks ago and so when she heard about
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:44.200]  this because she was gonna go to the parties with this house's wife she told
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:49.320]  me because you was pretty disturbed about that information and it just he
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:53.800]  basically said the agent told him to be careful and not show up to these tea
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:57.960]  parties with make it the Obama signs of bumper stickers because those people
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:06.680]  would be targeted and on such things as like the no-fly list and let's be clear
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:14.080]  let's be clear did she then not go to the tea party well my mom didn't know
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:20.720]  okay well I want to be specific about this when we give in to this they've
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:26.120]  won and that's what alexander siltz needs a hey guys will you google alexander
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:29.200]  siltz needs so how we burned in the camps and give me the full quote I want
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:34.320]  to read it I could paraphrase it this is how tyrants and bullies operate they
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:40.120]  always set up a police state and a secret police intelligence grid in the name
[1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:44.480]  of a foreign enemy in Germany they'd say well France has agents and so does
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:49.480]  Poland so we've got a spy on all your neighbors and then a decade later it's
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:54.920]  by the way there's Germans who were bad we've got a spy on them and don't go to
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:59.760]  that meeting against Hitler you know in 1932 because he's gonna come to power
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:04.000]  and if you do he'll get you and then in 33 don't talk about about Hitler or he'll
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.720]  get you he's now the chancellor and this is how it's done and if we buckle
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:19.960]  under if we get buffaloed if we panic if we have that chilling effect if we go
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:23.320]  oh my gosh you know if the tyranny is real I better shut up if that's why
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:27.880]  they've announced the NSA is spying that's why the media now gives these
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:31.200]  whistleblowers attention there were whistleblowers 30 years ago that wrote
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:36.680]  books and came to unseemly you know ends and were murdered who went out and said
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:40.480]  I work at the NSA we're spying all the phone calls in America and that's not
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:43.720]  been declassified but see now they're more but back then the mainstream media
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:47.520]  wouldn't covered it now they're more than happy to admit you're being listened
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:51.200]  to because they want you to be scared and self-censored hey I know the NSA
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:54.240]  listens to me and it's a crime every time they do it by the way it's in the
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:58.600]  New York Times today that they are unlimited spying and Obama has expanded
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:03.760]  what Bush did of course he's owned by the same people but that doesn't stop me
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:08.440]  from doing what I do they are the criminals they are the bad people you
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:15.200]  know they are we can't give in to this terrorism and I just saw a YouTube clip
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:19.120]  of a pastor at a checkpoint a hundred miles over the border they wanted to
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:22.960]  search his car and he said we gotta have a you know a fourth amendment reason to
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:27.040]  do that so they pulled him out beat him up and you know and then that's how
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:31.800]  America works now but that's gonna happen to more and more people and the
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:34.560]  police are starting to wake up and realize how they've been manipulated and
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.800]  what they're part of so so all of this craziness is going on and you tell your
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:44.040]  mother you can grab this in the rebroadcaster or the podcast that's on
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:48.400]  the listen page info wars or the mp3 we post on the main page and play this for
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:52.960]  your mother and for the pastor and are you saying the pastor's your father no
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:56.760]  no no okay well how was a pastor involved in this your mother was going with the
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:40:02.880]  pastor's wife yeah yeah okay well I mean you know look look you might as well
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:07.200]  not even live in America and I appreciate your call I can't tell you how
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:13.400]  many people I've talked to some of them high-powered going Alex there's no new
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:17.440]  world order but still you better watch what you're saying the government's
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:27.760]  dangerous so there is this rationale there is this denial going on about what's
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:34.120]  happening in the world and look tyranny is the norm 99% of the time
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:38.440]  literally there have been thousands of governments in hundreds and hundreds of
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:46.240]  nations and hundreds of empires and I would say it's one out of probably two
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:59.560]  or three thousand so that's more than 99.9 so get ready and understand that we
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:03.240]  became the most wealthy nation on earth because we had the freest country in
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:07.800]  history at least with property rights for a short time and it was an engine of
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:11.200]  milk and honey so of course the parasites all came here took over our
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:14.840]  government have uses an engine to set up their world government and now they're
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:20.160]  done with us now they are done with us we have been sucked dry and we're just
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:23.840]  going to be a police state colony that they take basically mercenary soldiers
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:29.840]  out of their new world order and they want to do a hot purge here and you can
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:34.400]  laugh and snicker and giggle and you know out there people that don't know
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:40.120]  but they're planning a Stalinistic Hitlerian slash Maoist purge and I
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:42.520]  want to tell the police and military something a lot of you I know we're on
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:46.720]  our side when I say this is it isn't an empty statement in fact I'm very upset
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.720]  about it because your destruction is part of the plan they are going to play
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:55.360]  their two biggest enemies the American people and the police and military off
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:59.480]  against each other for several years of carnage if they have their way and then
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:03.720]  the people will beg for i4 international NATO troops afterwards and that's the
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:14.480]  stated public government plan everywhere so that is just some of the news and
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:20.560]  information and you can see how they're setting this up and my new obama film is
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:23.680]  going to be super hardcore you know this this first one's about shattering a
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:27.640]  left-right paradigm and is the most important thing we can be doing right
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:31.760]  now but the second one is going into the agenda we were right in the obama
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:36.120]  deception but we said the agenda would be now we see the agenda and that's what
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:39.160]  it's going to be about is is is I'm gonna make predictions I'm gonna lay out
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:44.920]  their battle plan and ways to counter them but I'm gonna go back to them the
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:52.080]  blitz through calls in a moment Jim Gloria Dave Steve many others before I do

[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:38.720]  to get into this big breaking news on the keep calling a myack reports the
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:42.120]  myack report was just out of Missouri but federally written that's kind of a
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:45.400]  catch all now everybody I hear everybody doing it this new Virginia report
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:49.840]  this new federal report there's so many of these reports they just seems to get
[1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:52.760]  big when we kind of break it because the show's big enough to push it out there
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:56.880]  to the mainstream I just said this morning I said Google some other ones
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:04.680]  proving that they're very similar to this new one from 2005 6 7 8 that it was
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:07.840]  Bush doing it too because that's going to really freak out the phony
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:11.080]  conservatives when they realize Bush was setting this up too and sure enough the
[1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:16.080]  guys in five minutes of searching found a bunch of them and so that's the new
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:21.360]  report we need Paul Watson or Kurt to do or Steve or Aaron Dyches is showing how
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:25.000]  they're all making a left-wing right-wing man they're saying everybody's a
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:29.600]  terrorist liberal conservative gun owners environmentalists you're all
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.040]  terrorist I mean if you know how to spell your name you know how to read it's
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:36.880]  like pole pot that they brag the US government funded if you could wave you
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:41.400]  wore glasses and can read they killed you okay and so that's the system they're
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:46.040]  setting up right now in America they plan a purge just you just watch you know
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:51.000]  if we don't turn this around and fix it they are planning a hot purge you guys
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.640]  find my Schultz and eats and quote oh you did speak of the devil here it is
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:46:01.120]  Alexander Schultz and eats and and how we burned in the camps later thinking what
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:06.160]  what things have been like if every security operative who had went out at
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:09.200]  night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:13.720]  and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrest as for
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:18.040]  example in Leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:24.640]  not simply sat there in their layers paling and terror at every bang of the
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:29.640]  downstairs door and at every step on the staircase but had understood they had
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:34.240]  nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:38.600]  half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers whenever else they had the
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:43.160]  organs of the state bureaucracy would have very quickly suffered a shortage of
[1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:47.560]  officers in transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst the
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:52.120]  cursive machine would have ground to a halt Nobel Prize winner Alexander
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:59.760]  Schultz and eats in the gulag acapella go now look I'm not macho I'm not
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:08.120]  running around with a heart on as they say to kill cops and military I know
[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:11.880]  you are you're going to the bowling alley you're going to the bar you go to the
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:15.600]  shooting range you take your kids out riding jet skis you're looking forward
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:19.840]  to deer hunting I know you're not bad people let me tell you something because
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:23.960]  other people aren't going to tell you this you're deader than a hammer if you
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:28.560]  start this war with the American people and so are a bunch of us you
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:33.160]  understand that you are meant to be consumed and I hate to use the Star
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:38.080]  Wars analogy but I said when revenge of the Sith came out I said this film is
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:41.000]  an analogy of what's really happening and then George Lucas a month later came
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.880]  out and said yes this is a parallel to what the government's doing now people
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:49.520]  can never seem to grasp things in the political historical example like I just
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:53.560]  gave you with Alexander Schultz and eats him so I'll give it to you in a
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:48:00.640]  children's movie scenario how does the evil force of the Illuminati of you
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:05.400]  will the archetype how does the Emperor become the Emperor he's the Sith Lord
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:11.080]  who's killed his master he's learned the powers and over decades he becomes a
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:15.760]  senator of a little backworld planet then he stages an attack with terrorists
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:20.440]  against his own planet so he can then be the savior and we get elected head of
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:26.920]  the Senate he then by staging attacks on the police and military the Jedi builds
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:33.480]  up a huge force to fight the outside forces gets the Constitution suspended
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:38.840]  then basically has an attack on himself to further declare a total takeover then
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:43.600]  he wipes out the military and put the police now that happened under Lenin
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:53.040]  Stalin Mao Fidel Castro Pol Pot Hitler it happens over and over and over again
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:57.840]  police Google Night of the Long Knives but in this new order plan their masters
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:02.400]  at playing grips off against each other they plan to have you march off against
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:09.640]  the American people and in a conflagration of complete societal breakdown and
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:13.120]  then after everybody's done killing each other and the smoke settles just like
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:19.160]  we had that Argentine Argentinian economist on who wrote about this in
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:23.400]  95 and then it happened as he predicted in 2000 2001 how they imploded it by

[2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:05.480]  information and by the way this is kind of off the subject i'm not going to talk
[2:01:05.480 --> 2:01:13.320]  about obama or anything but i recently listened to a two-hour interview on
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:19.400]  another network of a man named ralph winter route
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:27.400]  that's spelled w-i-n-t-e-r-r-o-w-d and he has discovered the most amazing
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:32.280]  information my mouth was opened the entire two hours that i was listening to
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:34.440]  him
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:40.440]  um he the um to quickly go through the background
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:44.840]  he was a successful businessman in alaska we've
[2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:48.760]  we've had ralph on them you've had ralph went went around on
[2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:54.440]  uh yeah of course oh okay he worked until he he worked until
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:57.000]  communications and he found out about all the big
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.200]  a bid rigging about how to get a bid in alaska or anywhere else
[2:02:00.200 --> 2:02:03.320]  uh government contract you got to pay the government off the government is a
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:08.200]  giant criminal enterprise mafia run the federal reserve is a private mafia
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:12.520]  and it's uh a lot of his info is uh quite accurate
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:16.920]  oh okay i i'm i'm amazed that i haven't heard him because i listen to you
[2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:20.760]  daily he's been on a couple times also i wanted
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:25.800]  to um i'm glad you're putting out a a dvd on chemtrails
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:29.160]  and um i hope you include something in there about
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:33.160]  more gallant disease because it seems like
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:37.720]  uh this disease it's pretty much agreed on by the people have it that it well
[2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:41.240]  they've even had major medical universities say it's real
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:43.720]  of course with anything though you're going to have some hypochondriacs that
[2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:47.320]  are crazy who don't have it and then the media focuses on them
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:51.160]  who discredited uh but chemtrails have now been announced by the government
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:53.640]  i mean they're doing it they don't call it chemtrails they admit they're
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:58.200]  spraying the atmosphere to alter it uh and so yes that's why

[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:55.160]  as they come i've talked to him privately he's totally
[2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:59.080]  into a new world order he he says what he can say
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:03.560]  uh and uh the only thing i can think of better be george norrie with more
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:07.240]  courage than man cal and but yeah he's still you know has to operate on these
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:10.440]  neocon radio stations and so you know i mean
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:14.680]  for every 10 times he has me on or 50 times probably more like it every week
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:18.440]  you know i have him on because he was at the tea party
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:21.720]  and uh could report that it was on a left-wing or right-wing event but the
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:25.080]  media wants to make it left-wing and right-wing to divide us
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:28.680]  yeah but i i think he's kind of a shill in a way because
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:33.720]  i uh he he went with the scripting that i've heard from
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:40.280]  all other mainstream media in my area and he followed suit with it being about
[2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:43.880]  us not wanting to pay the bankers which is true but
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:50.520]  he didn't acknowledge any of the real points at all not even touching on them
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:54.840]  well you know what he has me on his show millions of listeners and i go on all

[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:53.560]  military people trying to expose this tyranny but the media is hyping it
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:56.760]  using it these leaks to their own ends to create a chilling

[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:16.120]  number one uh did you see the article uh the germany bandomano
[2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:20.760]  810 corn from monsanto they want to allow it i have their spiegel here
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:24.760]  germany bands cultivation of gm corn because the studies we covered three
[2:09:24.760 --> 2:09:28.440]  years ago from china japan india germany
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:32.200]  uh... the uk the the bt corn grows its own
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:36.440]  uh... pesticide inside the corn at thousands of times
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:39.000]  what the chemical normally occurs in the corn
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:42.840]  the bees unlike other species of insect will still eat it
[2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:46.840]  and then it's killing them much less what's happening to the humans
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:52.280]  and so that is some good news right and uh... the other thing is well
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:55.960]  governor bulgoy of it you might be uh willing to come on your show
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:00.680]  um that reason why i called up was about moron d's and mark popo tuck at the
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:03.640]  screwball uh poverty law center you know they
[2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:07.480]  they don't talk anything about the four dead cops that uh preceded in san
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:11.400]  francis well oakland actually that preceded these three deaths of the
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:15.560]  policemen in in uh... new york uh... it seems to me that
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:20.280]  anybody to find is like a a terrorist who can't be there somebody like mad
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:24.840]  bomber harris billy airs while coupled with uh... all rick of minehall
[2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:28.520]  uh... burnardine doran red army faction the symphonies libya
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:32.360]  liberation army no no that's right when when the left and and and then other
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:37.560]  groups uh... shoot police they do not ever put the race in the news
[2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:41.240]  you have to read court filings uh... about that but god forbid
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:45.560]  uh... white guy shoot cops they don't just hype it up they then try to connect
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.000]  it to me when the white supremacist was attacking me
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:52.920]  on websites uh... morris d's within hours fed that
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:55.640]  to the local papers the police gave him access to
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:59.960]  the the the the alleged cop killers uh internet searches hundreds of sites
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:04.440]  cnn fox it's all been released now he goes to my site attacks me
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:07.240]  and morris d's wanted to then come out and say that
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:11.560]  basically i had him kill the cop uh... and now that's been of course repudiated
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:14.840]  and retracted and raw story daily cost
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:19.480]  uh... the pittsburgh post-cousette uh... but is this not an example
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:22.440]  of how these people operate
[2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:25.160]  yes and you know they had the unmedicated go out
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:28.760]  into uh... oakland to have an old who movement
[2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:32.440]  uh... it's some kind of black liberation movement and after this guy had killed
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:36.360]  the four cops they went out and they honored this uh... this gangster
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:40.040]  that uh... mowed down the four policemen trying to solve that
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:44.200]  i said can you imagine if the scumbag white supremacist
[2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:47.480]  uh... would have gone out and honored this guy that shot the three cops at what
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:50.920]  big news that would be but then in oakland they honor the cop killer and
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:53.080]  the news is mom thank you so much
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:56.760]  for the call it's it's it's it's incredible folks
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:00.280]  uh... you know what's happening in the society
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:04.360]  uh... let's go ahead and take another call here
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:09.160]  uh... let's talk to john in michigan john you're on the air
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:14.200]  hi alex all my respect to who you are what you do and how you do it in my book
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:18.120]  you're ten out of ten great thank you sir i appreciate that what's on your mind
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:21.720]  uh... well you guys mentioned you touched a little bit on the vitamin k
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:26.600]  shot and i recently had a baby girl uh... born here in michigan so i did
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:30.520]  quite extensive research if it's good or bad because i knew about the vaccine
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:34.120]  but my wife she was like well vaccine is one thing vitamin is a
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:37.080]  different thing so i would like to share that information which is very
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:40.200]  interesting first of all the vitamin k shot that is
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:46.280]  state mandate here in michigan uh... has three cancer-causing ingredients and
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:49.800]  even if you read the manufacturer explanation
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:54.360]  they do clarify that sudden death is a normal consequence of taking the
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:58.680]  vitamin k shot no it doesn't it's a huge shot of a
[2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:02.200]  vitamin uh... claiming it helps the baby's blood clot
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:04.920]  and i mean the baby's born the way it's supposed to be
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:08.680]  and it is associated with killing them but i mean look they had five vaccines
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:11.720]  they tried to mandate twenty years ago now it's over fifty
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:15.080]  these companies come out with a new drug they lobby the government to say it's
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:18.360]  mandatory when it's really not even law they just intimidate you into it
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:22.440]  and then now they admit h pv human papillomavirus is killing all these
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:24.760]  women all over the world admittedly killing them
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:28.440]  and they just go that's the way it is you know some women are going to die
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:32.920]  i'll go ahead now it is already has been prohibited in western europe the
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:38.520]  particular injection of vitamin k shot because it has aluminum it has permachloride
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:43.080]  and it has uh... uh... uh... antifreeze antifreeze is the third
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:46.440]  preservative in the book is that it is a totally
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:51.640]  that toxic substance that that's a really john john a q-up cbs news saying
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:53.480]  that mercury is good for children's brains
[2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:56.680]  because we have a crew here i want them to i hear this audio now understand
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:14:00.600]  we have other clips where they say lead toys are good for children i'm not
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:04.440]  kidding this is the new world war ladies and gentlemen
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:09.720]  and yes um... that's why the icu's have dropped by 20 points on average
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:13.560]  uh... they admit sodium fluoride brain damages you the uh... aluminum
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:17.880]  the mercury and this is what the u n wrote about is is how they would with
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:22.280]  injections give us chemical lobotomies and so you give your children a a series
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:25.480]  of chemical lobotomies and that's why all they can do is watch television and
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:28.280]  hail government is because they're brain damaged
[2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:32.680]  and uh... the gmo foods killing most the animals they tested on and as lab rats
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:36.200]  they don't care they feed it to us the human growth hormone in the milk it's
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:39.960]  just all part of hell and this is part of the eugenics operation of the new
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:41.720]  world order and people can't believe it
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:44.520]  can you believe they gave black men over 50 years syphilis can you believe they
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:47.720]  took 4 000 plus u s children foster children and
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:51.240]  radiated into the death declassifying can you believe it to 500 000 women
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:54.360]  enforceable sterilized them up until the 1980s
[2:14:54.360 --> 2:14:57.800]  can you believe the u n's funded the forced sterilization worldwide
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:02.600]  this is who they are uh... here is cbs news saying mercury is good for
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:06.680]  children's brains mercury containing vaccines may have on kids
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:10.600]  a life-saving device wins over the counter approval by the fda
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:14.600]  and sick of your glasses and contact lenses and your corrective eye surgery
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:18.040]  is approved today is tonight's medical headlines with medical watcher
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:24.120]  reporters seem to matter mercury containing vaccines may help not
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:26.920]  harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:30.600]  pediatrics there have been whites by concerns that mercury based
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:34.040]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of
[2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:37.480]  children these new studies suggest that the opposite that the
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:40.840]  preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior
[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:45.240]  and mental performance and those were government paid for studies
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:48.040]  in conjunction with the vaccine company so
[2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:53.480]  i'm called the conspiracy theorist because i say mercury is bad for you
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:58.360]  when it's the most deadly heavy metal in the body
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:02.120]  uh... in every case other heavy metals just create plaques and kill the cells
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:06.280]  they touch the neurons you can you can google this at major
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:10.120]  universities have electron microscope videos of mercury
[2:16:10.120 --> 2:16:14.280]  uh... in uh... monkey brain similar to humans
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:17.640]  and what it does other heavy metals just kill the cells they touch
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:22.760]  mercury causes an electrochemical storm and just blasted with with literal
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:26.600]  explosions electrochemical explosions just keeps killing and killing and
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:29.800]  killing so it's again a perfect chemical lobotomy
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:32.920]  here you won't be able to understand the police state in the government
[2:16:32.920 --> 2:16:37.560]  it's just like in the children's movie i'll use another analogy the black hole
[2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:40.440]  they know they land on the big government research space station
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:44.120]  they say everybody evacuated they're not here and they notice there's these people
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:47.880]  walking around these black suits and those all those are robots no they're
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:52.120]  lobotomized android human android slaves they're the crew
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:55.320]  and that's the general public you can't talk to them because they've been hit
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:16:59.400]  with chemical weapons and now they tell the chemical
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:03.560]  weapon victims oh the poison's good mercury good for you
[2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:06.840]  in fact john the other club where they say lead toys are good for kids
[2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:12.040]  from msnbc now we could pull that up for folks i mean this is
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:15.960]  see but but the horror of it is so huge
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:20.280]  that people can't believe it you see
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:24.440]  uh here is mainstream news telling you poison is good for your children
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:28.040]  but inflation that's another interesting point because a lot of people like to
[2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:31.800]  say uh scare monger about china right a lot of politicians and i know you
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:34.520]  talk about that issue all the time i think people should be careful what
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:38.360]  they wish for on china you know if china were to revalue its currency or china
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:41.640]  is to start making say toys that don't have lead in them or food that isn't
[2:17:41.640 --> 2:17:44.120]  poisonous their costs of production are going to go
[2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:47.560]  up and that means prices at walmart here in the united states are going to go up
[2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:50.920]  too so i would say china is our greatest friend right now they're keeping
[2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:54.600]  prices low and they're keeping prices for mortgages low too what
[2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:58.200]  oh yes need that lead in the baby's toys okay
[2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:01.640]  anything else steve i mean uh john in michigan
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:04.520]  i think the answer is you need more mercury shots
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:08.200]  you know how to you know how to you know how to read drug inserts
[2:18:08.200 --> 2:18:11.720]  you care about your newborn daughter in shots she's going to get
[2:18:11.720 --> 2:18:15.640]  are you some kind of crazy terrorist i mean you actually ask when you ask a
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:19.560]  question sir the answer you get always a state mandate and that's the answer you
[2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:23.800]  get in the hospital and then there is not a law mandate is not a law
[2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:28.440]  it's it's i'm a fluoride head who's had a lot of injections i can't think i'm
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:31.400]  going to call the cops on you if you say no what's the law
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:34.920]  i'm going to call people with guns all right very interesting about the
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:38.200]  fluoride i came from europe like 15 years ago and back in the
[2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:42.840]  times 1988 1989 when the communism collapsed and
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:45.960]  basically there wasn't any infrastructure any economy
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:50.280]  there wasn't any food in the stores the only thing that was
[2:18:50.280 --> 2:18:54.040]  that was being readily available to all the children
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:19:00.040]  in the high schools and the primary schools was milk with strawberry flavor
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:04.040]  and fluoride in a very luxury batch packaging
[2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:08.840]  very very fancy it was already available that i mean back then you know
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:14.040]  obviously i you know i was confused significantly younger but still
[2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:18.280]  remember that i was surprised i mean how could you not have food normal food in
[2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:22.920]  the stores there were coupons to go get some bread and some some meat
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:27.560]  but there was so much milk with fluoride back then i don't listen listen
[2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:30.520]  uh... it's a Pulitzer prize winning book on world war two
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:35.000]  and sure and interviews uh... uh... wrote about as well rise and fall third
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:37.240]  right but not in that book and papers he wrote
[2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:40.840]  the germans pick it up from the soviets to put fluoride in the water
[2:19:40.840 --> 2:19:43.480]  to make you passive that's university studies that they did that back in the
[2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:46.520]  20s and yeah you walk into the
[2:19:46.520 --> 2:19:49.480]  babies are us it's big things of fluoride water
[2:19:49.480 --> 2:19:53.480]  your baby needs fluoride it's way above the normal levels
[2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:56.760]  and then they admit it gives the kids bone cancer and brain damages them
[2:19:56.760 --> 2:20:00.360]  i mean literally they gotta savage the brains while they're growing
[2:20:00.360 --> 2:20:03.720]  so they'll be football fans you worry you see the signs and worry about the

[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:17.160]  i've never been with anything less than a nine
[2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:24.040]  so fine i've been on fire with sally field gone fast with a girl named bow
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:28.040]  but somehow they just yeah i remember going to margaret's
[2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:33.160]  singer kenda garden in dallas they had her statue
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:37.080]  out front she called black people subhuman
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:41.320]  weeds she got awards from hitler gave awards to hitler she's worshiped as a
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:45.560]  liberal feminist smear a real nazi you get worshiped by the
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:48.600]  media like sportsmen you know he says he admires hitler and rolling stone well
[2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:52.840]  hell 80l gives you awards you fight nazis well you're called a nazi
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:56.760]  uh... that's how it works but uh... remember being at margaret's singer
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:24:59.800]  kenda garden government training camp and i remember they would come in with a
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:03.000]  couple days out of the year with the red pills the fluoride pills and tell
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:06.120]  you to take them and i remember taking it and all the kids heads hitting the
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:10.040]  desk and the headaches and stumbling out my mom would pick me up at her school
[2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:13.240]  and everything in a daze and my dad's a dentist i remember
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:16.200]  a couple times a year i'd go get my fluoride treatment i'm like no no i
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:18.600]  don't want to do these all it's good for you and i do it and
[2:25:18.600 --> 2:25:21.400]  kind of act like i didn't spit it all out i still get a terrible headache
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:24.680]  the dallas water smelled like toxic waste and
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:27.240]  my whole life i was like i really don't like water every time i drink it and
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:29.160]  brush my teeth in the morning i get a headache
[2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:32.840]  all eugenics all chemical weapons savaging me
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:36.840]  reducing my q by at least 20 points and this is a little gift the government
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:39.480]  gives you and then i discovered the un documents and government documents how
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:43.480]  they're doing it and they made a liberal joke out of it and dr strange loved
[2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:46.760]  general jack t ripper laughs about it but but it's real
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:50.040]  and then you said you were you grew up in eastern europe what country specifically
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:53.080]  because i know the soviet especially in the blocks they controlled
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:56.600]  did put out the free government foods with fluoride
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:00.600]  fortified to help you i did you enjoy the strawberry milk and obviously didn't
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:02.920]  brain damage you enough though
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:07.160]  well it probably did brain damage me a little bit but not enough i guess they
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:10.920]  didn't complete their purpose now i did grew up in bogie area bogie area was the
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:15.240]  main satellite of as you know it was the main satellite of the soviet union so
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:19.240]  we were handling some hardcore influence from the soviet union about
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:23.400]  everything now people didn't question why they were giving the children
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:28.440]  delicious strawberry fluoride milk at that time everybody believed that that's
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:32.280]  definitely a good thing for your teeth and the government is taking care of you
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:36.280]  and i was surprised even back then i was probably like a 15 year
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:39.960]  probably 12 or 13 years old and i was surprised how could
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:44.280]  could you not have food foods in the stores and then you have those fancy
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:49.400]  fluoride strawberry flavored milks that were very tasty actually i mean if you
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:52.520]  don't you know if you don't know what you're drinking is actually well let me
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:56.360]  expand on that you know they've now proposed putting fluoride and statins
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.280]  in the water supply forced medicating and for people rolling their eyes out there
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:03.960]  i mean you can read mainstream university reports
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:07.960]  from the 20s 30s and 40s and in Pulitzer prize winning books about world war
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:11.960]  two about amusing fluoride and soviet union in germany to pacify people
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:15.000]  i mean folks i know this is quite a revelation for you but since the
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:20.040]  caller brings it up this is real but i mean they just told you on the news
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:25.080]  that mercury is good for you it's not good mercury and fluoride are not good
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:29.160]  for you i promise you look into it now soon they're rewriting the history
[2:27:29.160 --> 2:27:32.840]  books right now to say mercury is good but don't listen to them if you were a
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:37.480]  drink of even a thimble of it would kill you please don't try it it's not good i
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:41.000]  promise if you give your child a thimble of mercury it will kill them
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:45.720]  they will die a horrible death it is not good for you i believe i know the
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:49.720]  media says it's nutritious but it's not i can't believe i've got to explain to
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:53.160]  the public i got i get emails saying mercury is good for me
[2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:57.880]  i mean no they don't sell it at the at Whole Foods folks it's not good
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:28:00.920]  and and we're a conspiracy theorist because we're saying mercury isn't
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:04.040]  nutritious okay can i make a little resemblance
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:08.040]  between a totally two different worlds vulgaria in
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:12.120]  europe under communism and the united states under
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:16.600]  democracy supposedly obviously it was absolutely the same thing
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:20.760]  because what you're saying i can absolutely resemble to it and i remember
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:25.160]  that i was probably in second grade and they were explaining that in the future
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:29.960]  there is going to be pills that you can take and your teeth will never go bad
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:34.040]  so what you're telling me what you remember from your childhood is the
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:37.560]  same thing that i remember in my childhood which means that pretty much
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:40.520]  as you were saying sometimes previously it is
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:45.480]  all a masquerade all a theater and basically it is the same agenda just
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:49.240]  carries a little bit of different way uh... you know as far as
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:55.080]  the uh... eugenics and the uh... fluoride and the mercury and all that
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:59.160]  uh... i don't know i hear you and i appreciate your call good to hear from
[2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:02.840]  you my friend that was a very interesting and very informative call
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:06.280]  right there i've got one minute so i'm gonna come back
[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:11.480]  and we're gonna race through uh... frank dino paul i'm gonna get a quick pop in
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:15.800]  from the founder of oathkeepers and this is a very radical thing
[2:29:15.800 --> 2:29:19.320]  just like i'm saying mercury is not good for your brain very radical
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:22.600]  government disagrees and i'm not being sarcastic this is the insane level
[2:29:22.600 --> 2:29:26.360]  we've now reached uh...
[2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:30.280]  there they get the police and military to say they'll upkeep their oaths
[2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:33.800]  and not violate their oaths to confiscate guns put us in FEMA camps
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:37.080]  make us do force labor which is being proposed by the government
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:41.800]  now again this is being called very radical though very radical
[2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:45.320]  uh... to have the military police keep their oath i mean this is this is
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:48.360]  what they swear in oath to it's it's very hardcore so

[2:33:10.920 --> 2:33:14.120]  right back to your phone calls and judge
[2:33:14.120 --> 2:33:17.720]  napolitano is going to be popping in on the transmission talk about the tea
[2:33:17.720 --> 2:33:20.840]  parties and on the media trying to balkanize it into left
[2:33:20.840 --> 2:33:24.760]  and right to divide and conquer the people see the republicans are playing
[2:33:24.760 --> 2:33:28.600]  the out-of-party power right now so they can act all revolutionary and against
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:31.720]  the bailout and the bankers when they helped engineer and architect the
[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:35.160]  entire system along with obama's handler geithner
[2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:37.960]  and then obama can play the part of the establishment guy and then four to eight
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:41.240]  years they'll give us the republicans again the democrats will play the part
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:45.000]  of the anti-establishment and so the cycle goes on and on
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  suckering generation after generation into greater tyranny and slavery
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:53.320]  or we can wake up and go wait there's a puppet on the left a puppet on the right
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:57.160]  wait it's one guy holding both puppets i don't like that guy i want to talk
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:34:01.640]  about the franchise owner the shareholder of the power system
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:04.840]  i want to talk about how the corporate welfare is 30 to 1
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:08.360]  but the media all makes it about welfare moms and then that's bad because it
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:12.360]  brings government control you know i'm against a government health care
[2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:16.120]  because the government's run by eugenicist and then they'll make you take
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:18.360]  the treatment they want the history of government
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:22.200]  nazi germany had government health care so the union did they arrest you for
[2:34:22.200 --> 2:34:25.560]  criticizing them say you were lunatic they're now trying to pass laws i got
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:28.440]  articles here where they're saying all mothers are mentally ill when they have
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:32.040]  babies need to be put on prozac they're trying to claim half the school kids
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:35.960]  are mentally only to be on drugs this is about drugging and controlling and not
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:39.320]  only do they get social control out of it they then they then get to micromanage
[2:34:39.320 --> 2:34:43.720]  your life now this is very exciting old keepers has started a few months ago
[2:34:43.720 --> 2:34:48.040]  uh... steward rhodes former airborne rangers in the army
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:50.920]  worked with ron paul campaign at the highest levels got upset about what was
[2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:53.560]  happening with the new world order after the campaign ended
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:56.280]  knew that things were intensifying and he understood that
[2:34:56.280 --> 2:35:00.200]  tyranny will come to your door in a uniform
[2:35:00.200 --> 2:35:04.440]  throughout history and so we could get to the police and military and show them
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:07.400]  how the bill of rights and constitutions being violated how the globalist are
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:10.520]  criminals and how they're manipulating things and that they should
[2:35:10.520 --> 2:35:15.320]  commit to follow their oath with these ten ten principles
[2:35:15.320 --> 2:35:18.920]  that this would hamstring the new world order on the new world order of the
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:22.600]  global corporate crime syndicate this overall planetary system where they can
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:24.360]  commit their crimes and get away with it
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:27.960]  as they control the courts in the systems they understand that's their big
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:31.000]  threat that's why in these myack reports
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:34.280]  that's why in these federal reports demonizing
[2:35:34.280 --> 2:35:37.960]  christians conservative gun owners the media is paying attention to those
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:40.600]  reports but they also have reports that's what's coming up later
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:43.560]  that go after environmental activists that go after
[2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:48.200]  the quote left wing and so you can understand this was all being issued
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:51.720]  under bush as well and that's the big report i'm gonna get into later
[2:35:51.720 --> 2:35:55.800]  uh... so uh... this is so important because
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:58.520]  when they say the number one threat to the government the criminal government
[2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:02.440]  the hijacked government the counterfeit government
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:07.480]  is returning troops gun owners people buying guns and ammo saying we're
[2:36:07.480 --> 2:36:10.840]  terrorist and this is finally gotten the people's attention
[2:36:10.840 --> 2:36:14.840]  so a perfect timing with the first big uh...
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:18.200]  oath keepers meeting coming up on the green and lexington
[2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:21.320]  where it all started in seventeen seventy five april nineteen
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:25.640]  seventeen seventy five so uh... steward roads great to have you back my friend
[2:36:25.640 --> 2:36:30.520]  i'll be back again thank you very much you bet uh... steward uh...
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:34.760]  give us your take i mean this is the biggest new story out there right now
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:38.600]  and around the tea parties is the media saying the tea parties are evil
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:41.160]  terrorist who are basically cop killers
[2:36:41.160 --> 2:36:43.560]  is what they're trying to say and they're a bunch of right wingers when it's an
[2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:47.000]  about left or right they're desperate to divide the american people
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.520]  can you explain to folks what that military tactic is
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:54.200]  well sure divided conquer well it was well they wanted to correct those i was
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:57.800]  never a ranger i was a long-range uh... reconstant scout
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:00.840]  so i just want to make sure so it's not accusing me of a lot of false
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:04.680]  okay records but you were in the army in special forces right
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:08.440]  that's what i was i was i was in the army i was a paratrooper
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:13.320]  and i did a long-range reconstant scouting okay so you're in the airborne
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:16.360]  yes i was airborne right okay good airborne units you're rangers of
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:20.200]  special forces are just are just specialized uh... versions of paratroopers
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:23.080]  well i understand that but they're they're all paratroopers with a
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:26.120]  different unit so you're in the army and jumped out of
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:29.320]  airplanes you were jumping out of airplanes okay there we go
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:33.560]  until i hit a big tree one night that was it
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:37.400]  so well yeah i was i was at a uh... the noxville
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:40.200]  rally yesterday i was a guest speaker there and
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:43.480]  and i can tell you that you know it's not left and right
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:46.920]  like you said it's too popular for your analogy too popular being held by the
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:50.360]  same master and so whether whether they're from the far left or the far
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:52.840]  right or whatever they're whatever they're you know label you want to put on
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:54.600]  fascist or communist or whatever it is
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:57.960]  it's about the talent area versus freedom and so like you said we get back
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:38:01.960]  to the very basics of our of our republic uh... back to core americanism
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:05.080]  special independence the bill of rights constitution
[2:38:05.080 --> 2:38:09.000]  and and being consistent now i've been very consistent i criticize bush
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.640]  everything he did people go to my personal blog and
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:14.840]  and i'll put a link of mine on the uh... oath keepersite they can go there
[2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:18.280]  i mean tired of hearing people email and say where were you and bush was doing
[2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:20.840]  this when bush was doing that while i was criticizing him
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:24.280]  um publicly in multiple places writing articles all the time
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:26.440]  and so you know just just as any other people
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:29.480]  but but but there's a massive pair of americans are waking up
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:32.680]  and understand left by paradigms of all paradigm
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:36.200]  and they are consistently uh... posing whoever they are
[2:38:36.200 --> 2:38:39.800]  is with the bipartisan assault on our rights and that worries the system and
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:43.800]  just interrupt two weeks ago it's in the local newspaper they're going to run
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:47.880]  regular army checkpoints and air force mps in tennessee
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:51.560]  uh... the governor gets called he goes out and does a press release saying i
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:54.200]  didn't hear about this but now i'm canceling it
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:59.160]  and then it came out in newspapers at the army with the state police in the feds
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:03.480]  and the air force shot down major highways this is in the news
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:07.800]  with photos of the cars backed up with troops searching vehicles
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:10.520]  and the military just said you know what we're going to do it
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:13.320]  so and this has gotten hardly any attention
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:17.160]  uh... you say you're in tennessee uh... steward this is amazing we've got to
[2:39:17.160 --> 2:39:18.840]  make a big deal out of this
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:19.800]  absolutely
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:22.360]  you know that's what that's one thing that happens all the time and hitler did
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:25.560]  the same thing he destroyed the independence of the provinces
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:28.600]  he solidified power at the national level and he made
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:32.200]  each province just a puppet and that's it that's the pattern that every
[2:39:32.200 --> 2:39:35.960]  every tyrannical government goes through destroying any separation of powers
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:39.240]  to the national government local government and so what they got to
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:42.760]  want to announce is that for for our April 19th rally in lexicon green and
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:46.440]  in lexicon massachusetts the sunday we have uh... added
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:49.080]  richard back is going to be one of our guest speakers
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:53.240]  and also guy cunning amp who was the author of the twenty nine palms
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:57.080]  survey where they asked marines whether or not they would fire americans
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:01.640]  who resisting the confiscation uh... he's the patriot and he wrote that
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:04.840]  because he was concerned about the uh... the pattern he thought
[2:40:04.840 --> 2:40:09.080]  of troops not understanding the constitution and being uh...
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:12.760]  condition to step you into man and and those things that he found disturbing
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:15.960]  it and uh... contrary to our constitution and steward do me a favor

[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:50.520]  there correctly uh... and uh... a lot of other folks tell people about that
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:53.720]  well we're going to have a little ceremony there on the green to renew all
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:56.360]  of us who uh... took it out to defend the constitution
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:00.120]  will renew our oath right there lexington grain on April 19th
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:04.840]  uh... and so very uh... can be very historic and very emotional experience
[2:41:04.840 --> 2:41:08.120]  i'm sure we've got activity military flying in from all over the country
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:11.640]  active police we've got high-ranking military officers coming there they're
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:15.240]  going to be there in their dress uniform and then also as veterans
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:18.600]  and and uh... we also invite this average citizens who've never taken an oath
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:22.280]  before but they want to come and and take the oath for the first time they can
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:25.880]  raise their right hand i did that yesterday at noxial with an exciting
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:29.400]  versus a wonderful experience a crowd of about two thousand people raise their
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:31.480]  hands for
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:34.600]  excuse me for note to defend the constitution but it was fantastic
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:37.000]  and the video for that is up on our website
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:41.880]  uh... dash keepers dot blotspot dot com of hyphen keepers
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:45.320]  dot blotspot dot com you folks can go there and i watch that video
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:48.440]  so we're going to do the same thing again on lexington grain to me it's it's
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:51.480]  really the first public meeting both keepers though because yesterday these
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:53.720]  these are folks who didn't even know who we were
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:56.360]  and i just showed up there the guest speaker and and uh...
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:59.880]  kind of caught him off guard but uh... got them all stand up and raise their
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:03.080]  right hand and reconfirmed reaffirm their oath or take the oath for the first
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:06.920]  time and this is gonna this is gonna spread like wildfire
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:11.000]  because we've got the state police training manuals of the feds put out
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:14.120]  uh... and then we have the footage of squad car video in my film road to
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:16.680]  tyranny at a warrantless checkpoint they find a pocket
[2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:19.480]  constitution in the woman's car and flip out and
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:22.200]  arrest her for it and it's them on video going
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:25.640]  i can't believe she's got one of these she's one of them deadly ones i saw that
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:28.920]  i was saying that and that's why we gotta stand up and that's why it has to be
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:31.080]  done i think the tip of the spear
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:34.680]  this isn't warfare needs to be the you know the hardcore troops
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:38.200]  but the guys who've been there and the police to stand up and say you know what
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:42.200]  we are constitutionalists you want to make them as constitutionalists and
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:45.320]  separate us from them well guess what we are constitutionalists
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:48.280]  which is exactly why you saw that department of security
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:51.800]  uh... the latest report they call it a report it's just just propaganda
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:55.320]  well labeling returning veterans of the potential terrorist threat it's just
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:58.520]  amazing well that's what it is frankly it is
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:03.160]  it is well yeah in fact comment on that it is a secret police commissariat
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:07.160]  political police report like the soviet union or nazi germany or malice
[2:43:07.160 --> 2:43:10.600]  china i mean out of the textbook it says the number one threat
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:14.440]  is returning troops gun owners people by all these guns and ammo
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:17.720]  this is the number one terror threat that is a quote
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:22.520]  and they have really upset people and it can't the police put two together
[2:43:22.520 --> 2:43:25.880]  most of police are former military they're saying you're the threat and
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:28.600]  what's the first thing hitler wiped out when he got power
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:32.200]  when he was going to betray everybody to the opposite of what he said he killed
[2:43:32.200 --> 2:43:35.560]  the police and military in the night of the long knives
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:39.880]  so explain to folks how big a deal this is and i agree they screwed up by doing
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:42.680]  this break it down it's so absolutely i mean what they're
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:46.360]  trying to do is a is a is a purge and and um and
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:49.880]  until your speech they want returning veterans to be concerned and worried
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:52.600]  that they're going to be label a terrorist they you know they
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:56.120]  um they mean apparently they think they can take they see anybody who took an
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:43:58.280]  oath to defend the constitution i'm starting to think this
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:01.640]  uh... they must think that we are a threat because they know
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:04.680]  we mean it and they know we're going to keep our oath and so
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:08.440]  this is their this is their preemptive way of starting to label that returning
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:12.200]  veterans is crazy and kooky and and potential terrorist threats and all
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:15.080]  McVeigh's you know that kind of thing when i
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:17.720]  maybe to get them to children's speech and not become politically active or
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:21.080]  not become active in in organizations like oath keepers so
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:24.600]  but the way to fight that is just just uh with light shine a light on it like
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:27.480]  you've been doing you shine a light on a cockroach as they scurry away
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:30.920]  shine a light but you know what i think i think uh the demonstration of
[2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:33.560]  these disastrous mistakes
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:35.880]  talking about having better to pay for their own medical care
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:39.000]  to the ticked off every veteran of the current serving military there is
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:42.360]  and then now this the american leaders picked up about this also
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:46.280]  they've sent another letter to uh to an apolitano the bad apolitano i'm not
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:50.120]  a good one it's a letter to her um making it very clear that that she
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:53.480]  should go better this is ridiculous and by the way
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:58.680]  she has now come out and says uh that she doesn't apologize for these reports
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:02.040]  it's right yeah she said i have to look at every every possible threat
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:05.160]  so once again if you're a constitutionalist you're a possible
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:09.080]  threat and you know what we are quite frankly but we're not affected
[2:45:09.080 --> 2:45:12.120]  american people we're not terrorists but we are a threat to their attempt to
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:14.840]  destroy our republic by god we better be
[2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:18.440]  everyone's worn out the defending constitution of course we're not gonna
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:22.120]  to stand by what that happened so you know but they're coming right out
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:25.720]  exactly we have the bill of rights constitution declaration of independence
[2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:30.040]  common law common sense organic law on our side you have these foreign bankers
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:34.200]  usurping our country through the executive both parties stealing
[2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:38.280]  uh 12.8 trillion dollars in six months the gdp in half a year
[2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:41.880]  they're totally taking over uh they're violating our rights and liberties at
[2:45:41.880 --> 2:45:44.600]  every level uh they're butchering a you know every basic
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:48.200]  canon of a free society we are in the right of the declaration of
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:51.320]  independence to arrest all these people through the grand juries through
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:55.640]  indictments so they've got to declare us the enemy and us the terrorist
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:58.120]  because they are the ones terrorizing our liberty
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:01.240]  they are the criminals they are the ones that must be brought to justice
[2:46:01.240 --> 2:46:05.160]  it's so simple they have to indict us accuse us
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:08.840]  demonize us because what they're doing is so outrageous and criminal
[2:46:08.840 --> 2:46:12.520]  they know the people ever get control of this country again they're all going to
[2:46:12.520 --> 2:46:15.720]  prison and so this is a very bold action i keep telling people
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:20.600]  the elite are going for broke the level of crimes and looting and corruption
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:24.920]  they have engaged means they are going all the way to the wall folks
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:28.360]  this is not a drill or not an exercise they plan
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:32.280]  a hot revolution in this country of power and tyranny
[2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:35.080]  they are the revolutionaries we are the restorationist
[2:46:35.080 --> 2:46:38.520]  we just want our bill of rights and constitution and liberty
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:43.320]  not their old time religion of tyranny they claim they're doing a new world
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:46.280]  order everything with them is a lie it's the old world order
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:50.840]  the you know roman tyranny go ahead but that's actually correct i mean they're
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:54.120]  they're the assaulters on the constitution and the in the uh
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:57.480]  the american republic and we're the defenders and so they have to make the
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:00.200]  people think that think the exact opposite that
[2:47:00.200 --> 2:47:03.400]  we're the threat to them when we're we're their projectors
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:07.080]  and so that's why it's absolutely imperative that that
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:10.920]  officers stand up police officers that military stand up and they do it in
[2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:14.840]  large enough numbers that you can't just dismiss them as as long crazies or
[2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:17.800]  whatever you have that you have to acknowledge this is the mainstream
[2:47:17.800 --> 2:47:21.320]  and by the way it takes a lot of courage don't you have some generals and
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:24.680]  people coming uh yeah i mean to have regular you know in the
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:28.600]  military officers coming and and swearing their oath
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:32.440]  that's how close to midnight is that the lieutenant commander put it
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:34.920]  this is one lieutenant commander of the navy he said look
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:38.520]  i have nothing to fear because all i'm doing is reaffirming
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:42.840]  my obligation to follow the law yeah i'm not going there to i'm not
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:47.160]  you know wage war on the american people but that shows but that shows how
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:49.960]  close to midnight it is is that it is radical
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:53.320]  to have people stand up and say i won't put americans in camps
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:57.720]  yeah you talk like you quote jefferson and and john adams and sam adams and
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:01.880]  and they consider you a threat and we are a threat to their plans
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:05.320]  that's absolutely correct because we're not gonna let them do it
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:08.680]  so like this in some ways you know that their report is accurate
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:11.960]  but not not the way they spin it stirred as though we're gonna go blow up you
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:16.200]  know kill kill babies and blow up people you know and then we're racist
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:19.960]  yeah oh yeah that's the worst part well they're upset the people that were buying
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:24.360]  guns are upset because he's black no we're upset because as a state
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:28.440]  uh senator he called for complete gun bans his attorney general in the briefing
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:31.480]  last year before the supreme court said citizens should not be able to own
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:35.800]  a a a a single shot i mean he wants total gun ban
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:39.720]  and they've introduced the bills and you've now got the governor of pennsylvania
[2:48:39.720 --> 2:48:44.120]  calling for gun bans and so again we're in reality but
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:47.880]  for those that don't understand this we are at a historic crossroads
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:51.960]  and right i could see it in their eyes and their actions i realize they're
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:56.520]  actually intimidated they realize that they've put their criminal action into
[2:48:56.520 --> 2:49:00.920]  motion it's a machine they can't turn off and i think they're starting to brace
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:03.320]  for the fact i mean it's like when you get in a fight
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:06.680]  some bully punches you and then you gear up and start punching back and you can
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:10.360]  tell you're gonna whoop their ass i mean that's the feeling right here we are
[2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:14.440]  gonna kick the new world order's butt yeah and then they realize that they
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:17.480]  thought you were gonna be a easy victim and the next thing you know you know
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:19.800]  you you slam them on the ground and you're you're mad on top of them and
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:22.680]  you're punching them in the face
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:26.760]  well let me tell you alex um one thing i wanted wanted to say is that we're
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:29.240]  gonna have a retired navy seal captain larry bailey
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:32.680]  administer the oath unless judge napolitano wants to come and
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:36.120]  administer the oath sometimes hard to reach people but we give an open
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:39.640]  invitation to him if he shows up all you gotta do is show up and he can
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:42.280]  administer the oath because i can't think of a more consistent
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:47.320]  judge he's like okay well listen i well listen i promised
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:54.520]  i promised uh to cover this new angle on these federal reports demonizing
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:59.640]  christians gun owners the troops ammo owners so if you'll do this uh
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:02.920]  steward i'll put you on hold when napolitano comes on at the start of
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:06.040]  the next hour i'll introduce him for about five minutes and then you can come
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:10.760]  on inviting because i know uh he's in new york i don't know if he can come
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:15.320]  uh but uh but you can invite him on air and put him on the spot if you'd like
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:18.120]  or do you want me to ask him and then offer to give him your number
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:21.240]  your number um either way we just we just want to
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:25.160]  i mean everyone's welcome and but it's gonna be wonderful to have a judge like
[2:50:25.160 --> 2:50:28.760]  that it makes the experience all the more special because here's the thing
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:31.880]  this has been done before this is not the first time
[2:50:31.880 --> 2:50:35.960]  there's historic precedent in 1798 a militia company stood on the green
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:39.800]  renew their oath sent a letter to john adams who was president at the time
[2:50:39.800 --> 2:50:44.360]  and he wrote back and responses them and said by taking by renewing
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:48.280]  your oath on that on that on that sacred spot
[2:50:48.280 --> 2:50:52.680]  you have reaffirmed your devotion to your country it was just brilliant so

[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:24.440]  so that is coming up quick update from him on the whole federal reports demonizing
[2:54:24.440 --> 2:54:28.680]  patriots and more steward roads founded oath keepers that's coming up this
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:31.320]  weekend we were talking during the break he was saying yeah it really is starting
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:35.080]  to come to a head i want to make sure this doesn't turn into riots in a
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:37.960]  shooting war and watching cnn try to start physical
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:41.400]  fights with people watching anderson cooper calling
[2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:45.560]  the people horrible sexual expletives i can't believe i'm seeing this i'm seeing
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:49.240]  an msnbc they're trying to energize it to make it a
[2:54:49.240 --> 2:54:53.400]  left-right fight because again 98% 99%
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:56.200]  all the polls are against the bank or takeover they want to make it about
[2:54:56.200 --> 2:54:59.800]  republicans and george bush it's like 20 30%
[2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:04.040]  to automatically divide and conquer and it's so obvious we got to get that
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:07.080]  message out to people but i have heard quote liberals calling into
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:09.960]  america and stuff going no there's a lot of us out here
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:12.840]  so the left at first was trying to make this a fight
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:16.200]  uh... but now they're failing and that's the good news is
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:20.440]  with every successive month that follows more and more people wake up to the
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:23.960]  two-puppet system
[2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:27.160]  so steward again you say this is coming to a head
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:30.680]  absolutely i think i think that that their attack on veterans
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:34.920]  is an indication of of their fear but here's the thing is we're not what is
[2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:37.480]  not germany but our oath was not to the furor
[2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:40.840]  so they can't they can't demonize people who are going to just you know who are

[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:41.080]  it instantly shatters the paradigm and shows you that the same people that ran
[2:57:41.080 --> 2:57:46.040]  bush run obama that obama has lied about everything he said he would do
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:48.760]  about hiring lobbyist and ending the wars and
[2:57:48.760 --> 2:57:52.920]  uh not spying on the american people and shutting down the fema camps

[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:08.120]  as a puppet and then obama is going to double what bush did in one year

[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.400]  i mean just complete lies the arrogance of the lies the

[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:11.560]  running the white supremacist compound they didn't just infiltrate it they ran the whole thing and
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:16.120]  it turned out mcvay was a government operative they set up let's come out and declassify government
[3:10:16.120 --> 3:10:21.400]  documents so a very nasty organization to say the least you know they always catch firefighters
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:27.080]  setting fires you know it's that same thing uh... or or department of homeland security groups
[3:10:27.080 --> 3:10:30.520]  that are quote anti-child molestation it keeps turning out their child molesters
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:34.760]  southern primary law center running the white supremacist operations
[3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:39.640]  kind of like uh... we had the uh...
[3:10:39.640 --> 3:10:44.520]  bomb steer award in texas monthly went to the fb i and back in the late nineties for creating
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:49.000]  fake clan groups and trying to get them to carry out terror attacks i mean they don't just go out
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:54.440]  and find a clan group and try to sting them no no they you know they try to get them to carry it out
[3:10:55.720 --> 3:10:58.120]  the plots all foiled by law enforcement
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:03.480]  reportedly included violent plans by anti-government militia groups
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:07.000]  racist skinhead organizations in coup clark's clan members
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:09.960]  and they even cite admitted staged events by the way
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:13.480]  uh... to use various types of chemical bombs and other weapons
[3:11:14.280 --> 3:11:17.400]  the plots demonstrate the department of homeland security still needs
[3:11:17.400 --> 3:11:19.560]  the closing moment right wing groups says
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:23.320]  heidi barrick uh... that was the lady that
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:27.000]  talked to the pittsburgh post cassette within hours all
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.080]  the cop shooter the alleged cop shooter
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:32.680]  uh... he he visited info wars dot com
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:36.520]  and then it's in the newspaper that the guy loved me and then later the newspaper
[3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:40.200]  nobody have to write other articles saying actually he was attacking alex because alex
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:44.920]  doesn't get in the race hundreds and hundreds of sites he visited
[3:11:44.920 --> 3:11:47.000]  including sienna and fox they've now released that
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:51.320]  but they're me why because i exposed their game
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:53.560]  that's why the southern primary law center hates my guts
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:57.080]  hey i'm sorry you found it a white supremacist organization
[3:11:57.080 --> 3:12:00.520]  and uh... that the police reported was planning to bomb okc and then
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:04.520]  we got the federal documents and had the lawyers on about that i mean i'm
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:08.680]  look i understand you're not too proud of what you're involved in and
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:11.320]  it's kind of your business to claim refining extremists so
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:13.560]  you know these
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:16.280]  needs to be a threat out there for you to exist we understand
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:21.160]  it's just we understand you're very sick and we understand that we know
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:25.160]  that you know that we know that you're aware that we can bring you down
[3:12:25.160 --> 3:12:27.240]  because the kryptonite
[3:12:29.240 --> 3:12:32.280]  to bring down you mr bizarro southern primary law center
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:38.040]  bizarro's kryptonite is the fact that the adl and the southern
[3:12:38.040 --> 3:12:41.240]  primary law center and others have been caught over and over again running white supremacist
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:45.000]  groups and other groups as a pretext of i like the bill of rights constitution
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:48.040]  to point at the nazis and others and then try to restrict the internet
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:51.720]  and freedom of speech and other things it's come out in mainstream news london guardian and others
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:57.400]  that all the major german white supremacist groups that are firebombing uh... um
[3:12:57.400 --> 3:13:01.880]  turks and others killing them turned out we're german intelligence we understand how you operate
[3:13:02.680 --> 3:13:07.240]  understand how you operate don't worry we're on to you just like german intelligence andrea
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:11.000]  strassmeyer was your agent heading up elliheem city with mcveigh
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:19.720]  german intelligence and that's now come out oh we're on to you mr d's and so uh
[3:13:19.720 --> 3:13:24.120]  uh... that's why you're slander trying to connect me these people isn't going to work
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:29.560]  the plots demonstrate the department of homeland security still needs to close the
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:31.480]  water right wing ribs says
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:37.240]  heidi barracks with the intelligence project of which i have a copy of even have a lude
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:42.920]  dobbs in here saying he's basically a white supremacist because he talks about the new
[3:13:42.920 --> 3:13:47.080]  world order when it's when the announcer setting up a world government he'll talk about it so you
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:51.640]  you stick him in here next to nazis how many of these nazi groups do you run
[3:13:51.640 --> 3:13:54.440]  southern probably law center how how many of these guys
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:14:00.360]  because i've been out to protest the nazis in austin and i guarantee that these aren't nazis
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:03.960]  and then they just caught on what last year and in uh...
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:12.680]  in miami and other areas it was in the uh major newspapers it was in the uh orlandos newspaper
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:19.240]  that the head of the white supremacist rally was fb i i mean my god we're so tired of your nazis
[3:14:20.200 --> 3:14:25.240]  we're just really sick of you anyways but that's perfect way for you to hide though she is the
[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:33.720]  anti-nazi group oh you people are sick um he goes on the dhs report listed radical leftist groups
[3:14:33.720 --> 3:14:37.880]  such as the animal liberation front and earth liberation front which have both involved
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:42.920]  numerous arson cases but nonviolent right wing militia and skinhead groups and it's about how
[3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:47.880]  it's such a big deal that the dhs report has come out okay let's stop right there and that brings me
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:55.080]  to my next point and i want curtain demo and paul watson listening right now i need a big
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:15:00.200]  reports from both of you on this from different angles whatever your perspective is but remember
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:08.280]  we put out the flyer in the late nineties that the fbi was putting out with the fbi's phone number
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:12.440]  saying those that make frequent references in fact punch it up on screen just type in
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:18.360]  constitutional terrorist it'll come up and when we put that report out then we got all these other
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:24.440]  internal state police reports federal marshal reports that they sent us where people that have
[3:15:24.440 --> 3:15:31.720]  organic gardens people that protest animal testing people that uh protest nuclear reactors people
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:37.480]  that pro anything uh it's turned out they're spying on bike riding groups that want more rights for
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:42.920]  people to have you know bike lanes and anti-death penalty groups are being listed as terrorist
[3:15:42.920 --> 3:15:47.560]  with no violence in their past and michael moore and farenheit 911 shows you know a little peace
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:52.600]  group baking cookies and they've got you know the police spying on them and and and it came out army
[3:15:52.600 --> 3:15:56.680]  intelligence was spying on us back in november at the end the fed protest saying watch out the
[3:15:56.680 --> 3:16:01.480]  terrorists may attack you don't let them know your military and then the military leaked this to us
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:06.680]  because they're upset about it but the media didn't want to hype that part they hype only certain
[3:16:06.680 --> 3:16:10.040]  parts of the reports because they want to make this a left right thing they want to announce oh all
[3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:16.680]  the tea party protesters are terrorists and their right wingers and then all the leftists go oh my
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:21.560]  god well i'm not with those right wing nazi terrorist uh i must be for the bailout the foreign
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:26.600]  banks taking over see how they play those games now they've divided the public in half
[3:16:29.080 --> 3:16:35.080]  and then remember that back under bush it was in alabama it was in tennessee uh
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:42.280]  libertarians and liberal groups and you can google those stories libertarians listed in
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:47.640]  you know state police report and you can pull those up where libertarians and liberals were
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:51.960]  being listed under bush but really what was happening i'm starting this is getting leaked on
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:57.480]  purpose in some cases that i would actually get the full report it would have right wing left
[3:16:57.480 --> 3:17:04.440]  wing everybody in there but when it was bush they would talk about oh it's bush doesn't like the
[3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:08.360]  left wing and says they're terrorist and then now the obama's in they're putting out reports
[3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:13.160]  saying a very basically everybody's a terrorist but the reports that get the attention because
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:17.320]  there's a bunch of these reports just in missouri alone there were dozens of them the feds wrote
[3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:23.080]  and put out but now we have the national reports they're talking about the right wing and the
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:29.000]  returning troops and gun owners so then everybody can protest and demonstrate and the republicans
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:35.480]  can act like they're anti-establishment and get all the anti-establishment support and soak it up
[3:17:35.480 --> 3:17:40.520]  under their control because their controlled opposition see they want you inside the republican
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:45.720]  or democratic parties because they control both of those and then when a republican gets in power
[3:17:45.720 --> 3:17:49.800]  the reports will be put out about how the democrats are terrorist and the democrats will all feel
[3:17:49.800 --> 3:17:53.480]  radical and cutting edge and who the democrats i guess are anti-establishment look we're being
[3:17:53.480 --> 3:17:58.760]  listed then when meanwhile i walked in this morning and had the added to talk about this
[3:17:58.760 --> 3:18:01.640]  because i've been thinking about it the last few days and i said there's one of the original
[3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:07.080]  reports in 99 out of feeding sarazona show them the back where it says those that make references
[3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:11.880]  the constitution or terrorist and then it was right wing and left wing it it shows them all there
[3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:19.080]  there yeah zoom in on that common law it says defenders of u.s constitution against federal
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:24.040]  government un super patriots groups of individuals engaged in paramilitary training they call that
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:30.120]  target shooting uh it talks it talks about black separatist mixes that in with kkk so they
[3:18:30.120 --> 3:18:35.960]  go after everybody here common law movement participants and it says
[3:18:35.960 --> 3:18:43.240]  uh refuse to identify themselves make numerous references the u.s constitution
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:48.680]  and it's just like people these illegal checkpoints go well you're stopping all the cars you
[3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:52.920]  don't have fourth amendment probable cause they'll just beat you up now these videos come out every
[3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:57.560]  week now see because the cops have been taught oh my god i got a cop killing terrorist right here
[3:18:57.560 --> 3:19:02.200]  he's saying that you know a checkpoint in american yeah it's nazi germany it's not freedom uh pull it
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:07.640]  back up someone show people then over there they've got single issue and they say uh urban riot
[3:19:07.640 --> 3:19:11.960]  agitators those are usually cops they just got caught in denver last year denver post cops attacking
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:17.400]  other cops and staged event for the media to demonize the protesters uh they've got uh that these
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:21.720]  groups are going to use nuclear chemical or biological weapons uh that lone individuals are
[3:19:21.720 --> 3:19:29.240]  terrorist uh they've got uh animal rights they're terrorist uh and uh it just goes on and on
[3:19:29.240 --> 3:19:37.560]  and so they go after everybody here that's what's really happening so when we get back
[3:19:37.560 --> 3:19:43.720]  we should have quit google this morning in minutes they had this for me all these other reports
[3:19:45.320 --> 3:19:51.320]  and guess what we got the pdf files code this big reporter making a big deal out of that obama
[3:19:51.320 --> 3:19:58.760]  just put out it was originally written in 97 it just had the cops killings in pennsylvania added
[3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:04.760]  last week hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve
[3:20:04.760 --> 3:20:09.800]  note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as
[3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:14.520]  no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[3:20:14.520 --> 3:20:19.080]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:24.040]  held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government
[3:20:24.040 --> 3:20:29.080]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:34.280]  is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however
[3:20:34.280 --> 3:20:38.920]  an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:43.960]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[3:20:43.960 --> 3:20:49.160]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven
[3:20:49.160 --> 3:20:57.320]  by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years for more information call 1800 686 2237

[3:24:33.240 --> 3:24:40.600]  about all these federal reports demonizing american people don't you see the genius of it by making
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:49.000]  in about right-wing extremist it now intimidates anybody to think being against the corrupt banker
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:54.200]  bailout is right-wing and tied in with shooting people in dead cobs and white supremacist that's
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:59.320]  what the media is doing just totally ridiculous and so against the whole focus off the bankers
[3:24:59.320 --> 3:25:04.360]  to take over the collapsing economy into let's look at the american people that criticize this
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:08.760]  they're radical and dangerous and bad you don't want to get on a list sit down and shut up
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:15.880]  but it also seduces the left who was against the secret police reports and being spied on under
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:20.840]  bush and they were doing it to left-wing and right-wing and everybody in between to like yeah
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:26.760]  we need to watch these people they're dangerous just like the phony right-wing was all for secret
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:31.480]  police secret torture a million plus dead iraqis all the things that happened in eight years under
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:42.200]  bush the democrats went along with so we googled well well first off um if you go to the pdf file
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:49.480]  of this latest federal report that came out that's gotten all of the attention the one that
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:54.440]  we called sunday and confirmed was real was on a few website people going is it real i don't know
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:25:58.040]  well i mean i read it and said oh this is real and i called the feds and they admitted it was real
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:07.320]  and we put the report out sunday night and then it got big but 1a-0257-09 classified for official
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:13.400]  use unclassified or officially use only this report i knew i'd read pieces of in other reports
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:17.400]  that's how i knew it was real and then we called and confirmed it now the homeland security admits
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:23.720]  it and backs it up and says they support it on record because i've read all of this back under
[3:26:23.720 --> 3:26:28.840]  bush and i didn't think to go google and pull up those old reports we've now done that today
[3:26:29.880 --> 3:26:36.600]  but if you look at the file itself uh in the adobe acrobat reader but maybe you guys can punch
[3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:44.520]  this up on screen this document was originally created in 2007 about the returning troops
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:48.200]  and i've seen that in other documents and the police are on record you know these headlines
[3:26:51.880 --> 3:26:58.280]  military training police to deal with ied's or exploding bombs on the sides of roads
[3:26:58.840 --> 3:27:01.880]  so you can see that was created january 23rd 2007
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:11.480]  and it was published at 1 32 p.m and then it was modified april 7 2009 they only
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:18.680]  added a few paragraphs in there okay so this report came out under george bush people
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:26.200]  could say well we don't have the old report well yeah we do yes we do
[3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:33.640]  this is the federal bureau of investigation intelligence assessment this is the federal
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:39.800]  bureau of intelligence assessment but they now have that as a subunit under homeland security
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:45.240]  here on the final page with the national infrastructure coordinating center you call one
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:50.200]  number it's them you call the other number it's the fbis i did last sunday night and you see uh
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:59.240]  this right here you see this right here the office of the intelligence and analysis center
[3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:08.440]  assessment a division of the fbi well what do we have here from july 7 2008 there's a whole bunch
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:13.800]  of these these are all over the web these have been out we've always been covering these why
[3:28:13.800 --> 3:28:20.520]  did they decide to give it attention now to polarize things left right and this basically
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:25.480]  says the same thing anybody who's pro god is basically a white supremacist and they're gonna
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:29.560]  the military is coming back they're gonna kill everybody and i knew i had read much of what
[3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:35.080]  was in the new report which was we now learn old so again this is what george bush was putting out
[3:28:37.240 --> 3:28:41.080]  and they're saying now when we're talking to paletano the breaking news and he knows
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:47.560]  who's gonna come out right now is that george bush is about to release more homeland security
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:51.960]  documents probably saying oh yes i'm worried about right wing or two to give obama cover
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:56.280]  kind like bush senior came out in bad mouthing in r a that time and said he was getting rid of his
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:01.880]  membership you know that they they pile on against the american people from time to time
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:08.040]  now here is the council on foreign relations that really runs the policy of the government
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:11.720]  four thousand almost five thousand members militant extremists in the united states
[3:29:12.680 --> 3:29:22.280]  and this is a report uh april 21st 2008 and it's types of domestic terrorism says the southern
[3:29:22.280 --> 3:29:28.440]  probably law centers who compiled it for them and it's got left wing and right wing uh terrorism
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:34.760]  right wing domestic terrorism see so what's happened is everybody's focusing in on one little report
[3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:39.320]  the entire american people are basically listed as terrorists in this and if they announced it like
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:44.040]  that we'd all come together and say this is police state this is nazi germany we're against it but if
[3:29:44.040 --> 3:29:48.680]  they only make it about one group like hitler did with the jews see oh it's just the conservatives
[3:29:49.480 --> 3:29:58.440]  we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:26.040]  i just want to add a final point
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:36.920]  that previously people were called leaders or statesmen
[3:33:38.280 --> 3:33:43.080]  and they were judged by where they keep in the man the tyrants on people's backs were they
[3:33:43.080 --> 3:33:51.160]  allowing property rights and freedom it wasn't a left right debate it was tyranny versus liberty
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:55.000]  that was always the discussion so they gave us the false political paradigm so they could
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:01.560]  break down our society and control us politicians at the mid-level and higher level are there to
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:07.320]  lie and deceive and to continually trick the people into never getting control of their
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:13.400]  society again they're there to keep the elites in power they're there for the upper class to wage
[3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:17.640]  war against the middle class and the working class and they write textbooks on it they brag
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:22.600]  about it all day and that's why rick perry's coming out with a tea party leader and you know
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:29.160]  that they want to make it republican so that they can manage dissent and then play it off against
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:35.400]  the left that's the two parties teamed up against the people two wings on the same bird of prey
[3:34:35.400 --> 3:34:39.640]  said looking at the wings all day let's talk about the head the beak the guts of this thing
[3:34:39.640 --> 3:34:47.400]  its mind its eyes what it believes what this bird does this is tyranny this is a group of polycentric
[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:53.960]  plutocrats financiers this is what globalism is they've now announced a bank of the world a
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:58.440]  world government that will set your interest rates and the currency rates and that will set taxes
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:06.120]  worldwide and have an army in a global regulatory system through the imf the world bank now the oecd
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:11.720]  the xm bank the world trade organization the hag and the netherlands it's here and they're now
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:16.680]  announcing we want a new world order it's the banks that engineered the collapse ruling you with you
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:21.480]  paying a carbon tax to them and that's why they've engineered the financial collapse by design
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:26.440]  and they're bragging about it and for decades while they were building this they said it didn't
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:30.440]  exist and then exactly what we said they were going to unveil is what they've now unveiled
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:35.640]  because we were reading trilateral commission and cfr documents i mean the cfr came out last
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:40.520]  year and admitted they're doing chemtrail spraying altering the atmosphere well i don't need to cfr
[3:35:40.520 --> 3:35:45.240]  to tell me they're doing that suddenly you look at the jet trails they don't fade out in 30 seconds
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:49.640]  anymore they hang there for hours and create whole cloud banks and i interviewed the father
[3:35:49.640 --> 3:35:53.880]  weather weapons and you know we talk about all that and then now they admit they're manipulating
[3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:59.960]  our atmosphere but they say it's secret folks what we know is off the chart crazy imagine what we
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:05.000]  don't know people say well just 10 of what alex says is true we're in deep trouble folks it's
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:11.080]  a hundred percent and then some i mean every in every case it turns out being worse than i first
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:16.200]  thought because truth is strange ladies and gentlemen and i go back to what i said earlier
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:21.880]  and i keep bringing this up this is one of the well-known cases they took 4 000 plus us foster
[3:36:21.880 --> 3:36:27.720]  children from the 40s to the early 60s put them in radiation chambers to test radiation on them and
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:35.160]  killed them now if 40 years ago they they had government people ready to assembly line kill kids
[3:36:35.160 --> 3:36:41.640]  what are you doing trust in their vaccines what are you doing trust in anything these criminals
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:47.640]  say they're eugenicists they believe in destroying economies they want to hurt us they believe we're
[3:36:47.640 --> 3:36:55.000]  living too well they're malthusian they say they are so i made my point uh we need to get it out
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:58.760]  that the tea parties aren't left-wing or right-wing they're populist against the corrupt bankers
[3:36:58.760 --> 3:37:02.680]  they're against crime they're anti-corruption that's what the bankers are who are taking
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:07.640]  the crisis they've created and leveraging it into total control and that these memos and
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:13.880]  documents are spying on mainline churches mainline liberal groups mainline conservative groups
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:21.560]  libertarians and that it's being done across the board and that all the powers the patriot act and
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:27.480]  the military commissions act of the john warner defense authorization pdd 51 it's all being used
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:33.560]  against the american people we told you that was what it was being set up for the whole attack
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:38.680]  pattern the whole architecture of the federalization of police all of this was meant for the general
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:43.800]  public they said it was and i kept screaming bloody murder and now they're unveiling it and
[3:37:43.800 --> 3:37:48.200]  conditioning you to get ready to have literal secret police under street corners telling you
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:54.360]  what to do and they got armies of them cia fbi recruiting ads everywhere they're tripling the
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:59.160]  size of the ground force of the cia turning them loose on the cities of america we've got our own
[3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:05.400]  stasi now and all these other agencies and groups i mean but it doesn't intimidate me it makes me
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:10.120]  want to fight back it makes me go you know what you criminals we're not going to let foreign
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:17.800]  bankers set up secret police and then intimidate us to shut up we're going to take this country
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:21.320]  back and bring you to justice and i and you know what so this doesn't happen again in this country
[3:38:21.320 --> 3:38:26.040]  we need to go ahead and arrest these people that have violated the law even their servants

[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:59.160]  angelina jolly i just not into like you know video game remake movies and stuff well no it's a true
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:04.520]  story no no no no i know i just wanted to be specific uh i have to know that brad pitt and
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:09.000]  angelina jolly i talked to people in hollywood are all into this stuff but i was told that five
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:15.800]  years ago and then separately i see her part of the cfr pushing all this so it's really weird but
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:24.200]  uh what is changeline about um it's about the um the chicken coop murders in um uh in california
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:33.960]  back in the 1930s i believe and uh the the really corrupt la pd and um it's it's right up your alley
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:41.480]  it's interesting let me i'll check it out yeah and um i my question about obama is um you said a
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:46.040]  few months back something i i don't know the exact quote i was wondering if you could tell me the
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:51.480]  exact quote that he said something about older people shouldn't get they're not supposed to get
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:57.400]  better or they're something about health care they're not supposed to uh let me think of the
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:07.960]  example there was a bunch of articles let me think of the best one um google guys dr obama
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:14.760]  bloomberg and they have quotes in there by uh the guy he was going to have
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:20.200]  head up health and human services who's bought and paid for by the big insurance companies um
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:27.320]  um but he's the liberal with left cover so it's okay uh the senator uh from the dakotas tom dashill
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:31.880]  who then had to step down for not paying taxes and having free limos and things you know given to him
[3:41:31.880 --> 3:41:37.560]  as part of money laundering and in his book and he was the architect of the current bill
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:42.040]  he said look if you're going blind you're supposed to go blind if you're old you're supposed to die
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:50.600]  and we want the british model of of uh rationing and uh so i pulled up uh bloomberg that had the
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:57.400]  quotes says that not uh it's here's dashill says health care reform will not be pain free services
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:42:04.600]  should be more accepting printed for me i can't read across the room with that small print um
[3:42:06.280 --> 3:42:10.520]  yeah yeah print me that bloomberg article but but also show him a headline for prison planet
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:15.240]  dot tv viewers so we can that's what i love about this thing tv too i don't just read the headline
[3:42:15.240 --> 3:42:20.920]  they can just boom slap it up there and you can read it so in the stimulus package they got the
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:26.280]  socialized health care passed to federalize it and so you're going to get like a aspirin for a heart
[3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:31.080]  attack uh and you're going to get prozac if your back's broken i mean this is what i do to the troops
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:37.240]  at the va that ruin your health with the obama stimulus plan uh betsey mccawley there's another
[3:42:37.240 --> 3:42:43.160]  one about dr obama maybe that was the wall street journal but it says in there with their bioethesis
[3:42:43.160 --> 3:42:47.560]  boards that yeah i mean uh i've seen tony blare on the house of commons i mean it's not just in
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:53.640]  their documents when he was uh when he was prime minister in england admit you have to wait 18 months
[3:42:53.640 --> 3:42:59.320]  for brain surgery for a tumor that's operable but kills you in six months and they look at it and do
[3:42:59.320 --> 3:43:05.800]  an average and if you're above 45 they just say sorry you're dead and so the british with with
[3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:11.640]  money fly over here and so uh that's how it works you uh you know it's like they'll have in the worst
[3:43:11.640 --> 3:43:18.920]  hmo it's like buying that insurance that that doesn't work anywhere and then it also has the federal
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:24.120]  computers telling the doctors what tests they can give so it's the insurance companies running
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:29.320]  everything and then their socialism will be taking all our tax money giving it to private
[3:43:29.320 --> 3:43:33.720]  insurance companies to rape us so uh there you have it does that answer your question
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:39.960]  uh rachel yeah all right i'm gonna let you go go to the next caller thank you uh let's go ahead
[3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:48.120]  and talk to sheryl in winnipeg go ahead you're on the air good afternoon mr jones it's been about
[3:43:48.120 --> 3:43:54.920]  three weeks and since i started listening to you and i finally got the nerve to call you i thought
[3:43:54.920 --> 3:44:00.360]  maybe you'd like a canadian perspective on the world order perhaps you guys should know what's
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:07.240]  going on over here um i know what's going on that the queen publicly announced she rules parliament
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:11.560]  when parlor didn't follow her order she activated the governor general and completely rules everything
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:17.160]  whatever her her head's on her money i mean that there you go but then the canadiens are in denial
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:21.320]  they go oh no she doesn't i go here's roiders with her ruling you oh i know that we need to be
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:27.160]  ruled i mean it's uh you know the queen's good i like her anyways go ahead denial is way farther
[3:44:27.160 --> 3:44:33.080]  than that sir i'll give you uh an idea of where i live winnipeg is a really really small place
[3:44:33.080 --> 3:44:38.200]  for the center of the country in the center of the continent and here we have a level five
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:45.560]  virology lab and norad in our city limits no i know they already merged your mill people say
[3:44:45.560 --> 3:44:49.880]  canada won't be taken over canada's already merged into north com the north american union's already
[3:44:49.880 --> 3:44:57.240]  set up uh november 24th 2005 all publicly announced the documents are all public and
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:45:01.720]  federal public just sucks their thumb and giggles and gobbles more prozac well it's because everything
[3:45:01.720 --> 3:45:06.040]  is just operating fine here we don't have a big economic thing happening here it's a little bit
[3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:11.960]  but your president came here and told us we're doing okay we're doing better than you guys they
[3:45:11.960 --> 3:45:21.080]  say so but we have a um a division of the fdi on our streets we have a division of the dea on our
[3:45:21.080 --> 3:45:27.240]  streets oh you're already completely merged they uh it's total integration and they got
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:32.200]  integrated with mexico so they got to collapse at first they know the drug war is what's causing
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:36.360]  all the violence and death they have a total gunband down there but their answer is keep the drug war
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:42.440]  going we have double the cocaine triple the heroin uh then we had 15 years ago more people in prison
[3:45:42.440 --> 3:45:47.800]  than ever total carnage and their answer is keep prohibition going it sure helped the mafia triple
[3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:52.920]  in size in the us they're in prohibition keep it going forever forever it's wonderful because
[3:45:52.920 --> 3:45:58.360]  they know the breakdown of society gives them more control well let me tell you see something that
[3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:03.720]  you've been saying recent as of recent has been bothering me and we don't have a total gunband
[3:46:03.720 --> 3:46:10.120]  we have an aboriginal population that is huge and they have inherent rights to hold guns now i wasn't
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:15.240]  saying you have a total gunband i said they registered your guns and then began what banning
[3:46:15.240 --> 3:46:21.000]  about half of the next year germany first got them registered and then restricted and now is is is
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:26.760]  moving to ban and australia england has a total gunband so so you're you're midway through the
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:31.560]  steps well they're frightened of our aboriginal population and which brings me to what you've
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:37.400]  been saying you've been predicting that there'll be more terrorist acts in your country i believe
[3:46:37.400 --> 3:46:42.280]  you've got the right operation but the wrong country sir they've got to get canadians on board
[3:46:42.280 --> 3:46:51.960]  with this thing so pick your city you know and that's what i think and the g20 few weeks ago
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:57.400]  or last week when you're talking about it what what they're speaking about i believe is the
[3:46:57.400 --> 3:47:02.200]  weaponization of space because that's part of it about it anymore no no that's part of it and
[3:47:02.200 --> 3:47:06.360]  i appreciate your call they're also having another g20 and they're already issuing the new global
[3:47:06.360 --> 3:47:12.280]  currency it's just bank to bank it's digital transfers the quantitative easing they admit
[3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:18.120]  well there's already global currency and china and others uh new york times reported are beginning
[3:47:18.120 --> 3:47:24.040]  to dump the dollar and all we've got left the dollar folks when it's gone then the hyperinflation
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:31.960]  starts right now we're in a depression but there's been 12.8 trillion that that's the entire gdp
[3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:37.800]  imagine if they gave 12.8 trillion eight trillion would have paid off all the mortgages in the
[3:47:37.800 --> 3:47:43.240]  country not just bad mortgages all the mortgages in the country paid off 12.8 trillion went to
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:48.840]  offshore bankers but notice you're not seeing inflation you're seeing deflation but then in a year
[3:47:48.840 --> 3:47:55.640]  two all the economist agree then it's going to just explode but right now they got to keep inflation
[3:47:55.640 --> 3:48:00.840]  down so that money has value for the private banking families to buy up real assets and then
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:06.040]  when they're done they're going to drop the hammer and it is going to be devastating most people
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:10.600]  listening right now or middle class will be destitute and poor for the rest of your lives
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:17.080]  just like iceland just like argentina in the imf and world bank documents the greatest form of
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:22.200]  bondage is just to make you totally poor and then they'll put little liberal and conservative
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:25.800]  puppets up in front of you all day and get you all obsessed with that while they just keep
[3:48:26.920 --> 3:48:31.080]  just punching you punching you bragging about it let's go ahead and take another call
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:39.240]  lisa you're on the air from ohio welcome lisa hi alex uh i'm a first-time caller

[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:55.080]  and earlier in the week we were having a problem with our broadcast stations being butted in on
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:03.640]  and it wasn't the normal emergency broadcast system test this happened to me saturday night
[3:49:03.640 --> 3:49:11.400]  night when i was watching uh the ten commandments and a blue screen come up with a white circle in
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:20.120]  it with a blue circle in the middle of that and some numbers on it monday night they interrupted
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:30.360]  the simpson adi reds game and it went to a totally different tv show and then the next day the uh
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:37.000]  broadcasters for the reds were talking about it on the radio and saying it it won't happen on the radio
[3:49:37.720 --> 3:49:43.960]  and marty brendam in the morning said that and he got interrupted really right when he was saying it

[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:34.840]  where it would take a day to even get a transmission out without it so fema is in between all the radio
